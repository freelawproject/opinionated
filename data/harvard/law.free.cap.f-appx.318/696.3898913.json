R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Appellant Nathan Dickey, a federal inmate, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a variance sought in conjunction with his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to modify his sentence based on the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">I. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In 2003, Mr. Dickey pled guilty to various offenses, including three counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (crack), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(C). In preparing the presentence report, the probation officer applied the 2002 United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) and determined Mr. Dickey\u2019s possession with intent to distribute 49.7 grams of crack cocaine warranted a base offense level of 30. The probation officer then enhanced his base offense level two levels for his managerial and leadership roles in those offenses and also reduced his base offense level three levels for acceptance of responsibility, for a total offense level of 29. Mr. Dickey\u2019s total offense level of 29, combined with his criminal history category of IV, resulted in a Guidelines range of 121 to 151 months imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Dickey at the low end of the Guidelines range to 121 months on all counts, to run concurrently, which he did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">On February 25, 2008, Mr. Dickey filed the instant motion to modify his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) which modified the Drug Quantity Table downward two levels for crack cocaine and became effective November 1, 2007, and retroactive as of March 3, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his motion, Mr. Dickey also argued for a downward variance based on the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), asking for a reduced sentence of sixty months imprisonment and asserting the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), supported such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">On September 23, 2008, after appointing counsel to represent Mr. Dickey and receiving responsive briefing from the government, the district court issued an order determining Mr. Dickey\u2019s total offense level should be retroactively reduced from 29 to 27, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706, which, together with his criminal history category of IV, resulted in an amended Guidelines range of 100 to 125 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6) (Drug Quantity Tbl. for 49.7 grams) (2007); U.S.S.G. Pt. 5 (Sent\u2019g Tbl.) (2007). It then imposed a sentence at the low end of the amended Guidelines range of 100 months imprisonment. In imposing the amended sentence, the district court stated it had reviewed the record in the matter, the government\u2019s response to the motion, and the applicable law and found a sentence of 100 months was appropriate. It did not otherwise address that portion of Mr. Dickey\u2019s \u00a7 3582 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>motion requesting a downward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, which we construe as a denial of his request for such a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Mr. Dickey now appeals the district court\u2019s failure to grant that portion of his \u00a7 3582 motion requesting a downward variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In so doing, he claims \u201cthe district court erred in reducing Mr. Dickey\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), by treating the amended guidelines sentencing range as mandatory, contrary to <em>United States v. Booker,\u201d </em>without taking into consideration the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). In support, he asserts that when the district court granted his \u00a7 3582(a) motion he was placed in the same position as if his sentence had been vacated following an appeal or the district court had granted a \u00a7 2255 motion, so that his original sentence was vacated and a new one should have been imposed applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. While Mr. Dickey acknowledges we rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833 (10th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2052, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2009), he advises he brings this appeal in order to preserve his right to contest any adverse holding on the argument presented. He also argues that the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s recent 2008 revision to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) violates <em>Booker </em>by effectively rendering the crack guidelines mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">As Mr. Dickey acknowledges, his appeal must fad pursuant to our prior precedent. In <em>Rhodes, </em>we explained <em>Booker </em>made the Guidelines advisory so district courts, when conducting original sentencing proceedings, are no longer bound by the sentencing ranges prescribed in the Guidelines. 549 F.3d at 839. However, in considering whether the holding in <em>Booker </em>applied to a resentencing, like here, we held \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not permit resentencing based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors and objectives, but is much more limited, authorizing \u201ca district court to \u2018reduce the term of imprisonment\u2019 only \u2018if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 840 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Similarly, in <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>this court rejected the same argument Mr. Dickey presented to the district court that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes a sentence reduction based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough. See </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1239 (10th Cir.2008). Even before <em>Rhodes </em>and <em>Sharkey, </em>this court held \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions may not be employed to present <em>Booker-type </em>claims, as \u201c\u00a7 3582(c)(2) only expressly allows a reduction where the Sentencing Commission, not the Supreme Court, has lowered the [sentencing] range.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005, 1007 &amp; n. 2 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Not only does <em>Booker </em>not authorize a variance during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resentenc-ing, but the United States Sentencing Commission has revised U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 so it expressly denies a district court\u2019s authority to grant a downward variance, stating \u201c \u2018the court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pedraza, </em>550 F.3d 1218, 1220-22 (10th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (2008), effective March 3, 2008). Arguably, because Mr. Dickey was resentenced in September 2008, the revised guideline, effective March 3, 2008, applies to him. However, even if it does not, we have held that the prior version of \u00a7 1B1.10 also restricted a resentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>judge\u2019s authority to grant variances under \u00a7 3582(c). <em>Id. </em>at 1221-22 (relying on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) &amp; cmt. nn. 2 &amp; 3 (2006)). Thus, under either version of that guideline, it is clear the district court could consider only whether Mr. Dickey was entitled to a two-level offense reduction under Amendment 706 and not the merits of whether any other reduction of his sentence was warranted under the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying that portion of Mr. Dickey\u2019s motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a downward variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b720-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.
