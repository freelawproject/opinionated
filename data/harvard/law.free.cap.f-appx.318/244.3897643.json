On appeal, Soriano-Enriquez\u2019s attorney has filed an <em>Anders </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> brief, concluding that there are no meritorious issues on appeal, but questioning whether Soriano-Enriquez\u2019s indictment was defective, plea was knowing and intelligent, and sentence was proper. Although informed of his right to do so, Soriano-Enriquez has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c) requires an indictment to be \u201ca plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\u201d The subject indictment tracked the statutory language, cited the charging statute, and gave Soriano-Enriquez adequate notice of the crimes with which he was charged. Accordingly, the indictment was not defective. <em>See Hamling v. United </em>States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>United States v. Fogel, </em>901 F.2d 23, 25 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">Because Soriano-Enriquez did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any challenge to the propriety of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the plea hearing transcript reveals that the district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy, ensuring that Soriano-Enriquez\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary and that there was an independent factual basis for the plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116-20 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Soriano-Enriquez\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">The district court sentenced Soriano-Enriquez to the statutory minimum on each count-120 months on the conspiracy charge and a 60-month consecutive sentence on the firearms charge. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2006) (ten-year minimum sentence for offenses involving 500 grams or more of a methamphetamine mixture); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (2006) (five year minimum sentence on firearm charge). In the absence of a Government motion for a departure, the district court lacked authority to sentence Soriano-Enriquez below the statutory minimum. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>862 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we conclude that the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no' meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Soriano-Enriquez\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Soriano-Enri-quez, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Soriano-Enriquez requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Soriano-Enriquez. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-13\"> <em>Anders v.
