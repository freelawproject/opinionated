He appeals the decision of an immigration judge, subsequently affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d), denying relief and ordering his removal to Russia. The immigration judge based the denial of relief on the untimeliness of petitioner\u2019s asylum application and, more critically, upon a lack of credibility with respect to the testimony offered by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">In cases like this one involving asylum and withholding of removal claims, \u201c[w]e review factual findings under the substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj v. Mukasey, 522 </em>F.3d 667, 672 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This standard of review requires us to take findings of fact as conclusive \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672-73 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying this standard of review to the immigration judge\u2019s factual findings with respect to credibility, we ar\u00e9 simply not \u201ccompelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d This is not to say that petitioner did not suffer hardship in Russia or that his testimony was false. It is simply to say that those portions of his testimony that the immigration judge deemed credible were legally insufficient to support his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Having had an opportunity to review the administrative record, which includes the testimony provided to the immigration judge, as well as the briefs of the parties, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision dated January 28, 2008, dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal. Because that decision clearly sets out the proper legal standards and properly defers to the factual findings of the immigration judge, a detailed written opinion by this court would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The petition for review is denied and the removal order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
