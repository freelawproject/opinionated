ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b723-25\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this proceeding. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-26\">Petitioner and appellant, Esequiel Puli-do-Pedrosa, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to enable him to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition to vacate, modify, or set aside his sentence. For substantially the same reasons that the district court set forth in its well-reasoned order, we deny Pulido-Pedrosa\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">As we stated in our decision affirming Pulido-Pedrosa\u2019s conviction on direct appeal, Pulido-Pedrosa, along with a co-defendant, was found guilty by a jury of \u201cpossessing with intent to distribute, and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, methamphetamine.\u201d <em>United States v. Pulido-Jacobo, </em>877 F.3d 1124, 1128 (10th Cir.2004). Additionally, Pulido-Pedrosa pled guilty to illegally re-entering the United States after previously being-deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a)(l)and (b)(2). He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the methamphetamine charges and twenty years on the illegal re-entry charge, all to run concurrently. We affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>Pulido-Jacobo, </em>377 F.3d 1124. The United States Supreme Court denied Pulido-Pedrosa\u2019s petition for a writ of cer-tiorari. <em>Pulido-Pedrosa v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1030, 125 S.Ct. 679, 160 L.Ed.2d 512 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Pulido-Pedrosa then filed the instant \u00a7 2255 petition, alleging: (1) that his convictions on the methamphetamine counts should be set aside for insufficient evidence; (2) that his sentence was unlawful in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and (3) that his attorney was constitutionally ineffective. The court determined that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary. Order at 20, R. Vol. One, tab 11 (\u201cThe files and the records in this case conclusively illustrate that the Petitioner is not entitled to any relief. Accordingly, no evidentiary hearing is required.\u201d). The district court then denied Pulido-Pedrosa\u2019s petition. The court did not issue a COA, and we therefore presume it was denied. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 22.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Pulido-Pedrosa has filed a request for a COA as well as a <em>pro se </em>appellate brief. We, therefore, must first address whether to grant Pulido-Pedrosa a COA to enable him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">In order to obtain a COA, an appellant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), such that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In addressing this question, we review Pulido-Pedrosa\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings with special solicitude. <em>See Van Deelen v. Johnson, </em>497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007). Even according Pulido-Pedrosa\u2019s materials such a solicitous construction, we conclude, based upon our own review of the record in this case, and for substantially the reasons given by the district court, that no reasonable jurist could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s ruling. Pulido-Pedrosa\u2019s request for a COA is therefore denied and this matter is dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY a COA and DISMISS this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-14\">. Pulido-Pedrosa's motion to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>is also denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
