We affirm the conviction and remand the sentence for the limited purpose of conforming certain conditions of supervised release to the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Although Berry may well have been uncomfortable in the patrol car, his will was not overborne. He was <em>Mirandized </em>before both interviews, which lasted about ten minutes each, and he spoke freely and voluntarily on each occasion. <em>See Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 206, 80 S.Ct. 274, 4 L.Ed.2d 242 (1960); <em>Clark v. Murphy, </em>331 F.3d 1062, 1072 (9th Cir.2003). Agent Warren\u2019s statement that he planned to take Berry\u2019s computers was not a threat, as Berry contends, but a statement about standard procedure in the circumstances. Finally, questioning immediately stopped once Berry asked for a lawyer during the Warren interview. It is clear from the district court\u2019s decision that it necessarily found that Berry made no earlier request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in treating the testimony of Agent Beamer as akin to a fact witness rather than an expert. Beamer simply testified to what he found on the hard drive of Berry\u2019s computer, without expressing an opinion that required specialized knowledge or offering insight beyond common understanding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">As the parties agree, conditions 8 and 9 of the terms of supervised release are not consistent with the terms of the oral sentence. Accordingly, we remand for the district court to correct the judgment, so that those conditions are replaced by one that will instead provide: \u201cThe defendant shall not use or own a personal computer. If the defendant obtains employment requiring him to have and use a computer, the court will allow it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE REMANDED FOR LIMITED PURPOSE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
