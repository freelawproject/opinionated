Porter appeals <em>pro se </em>from the orders of the District Court dismissing his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and denying his motion for reconsideration. For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Porter is a Pennsylvania state prisoner, and Harry J. Cancelmi is the public defender who represented him during his criminal proceeding. Before filing the complaint at issue here, Porter had filed another complaint against Cancelmi, alleging that he had retained Cancelmi to file two lawsuits against prison officials but that Cancelmi failed to do so in purported violation of his constitutional rights. The District Court granted Porter leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis, </em>then dismissed his complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) on the grounds that Cancelmi had not acted \u201cunder color of state law\u201d as necessary for liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We dismissed Porter\u2019s resultant appeal as legally frivolous for the same reason. <em>See Porter v. Cancelmi, </em>C.A. No. 04-1700, 112 Fed.Appx. 867 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Seventeen days later, Porter filed the complaint at issue here. Porter again names Cancelmi as the sole defendant and again accuses him of having failed to file the two lawsuits described in his first complaint. This time, however, Porter alleges that Cancelmi \u201caecept[ed] a sum of money\u201d from the prison officials he wanted to sue, and that Cancelmi had thus \u201cconverted\u201d his lawsuits for personal profit. The case was assigned to a Magistrate Judge, who recommended dismissing the complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) as malicious or \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim on the grounds that it is barred by res judicata. By order entered December 4, 2006, 2006 WL 3490589, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Porter filed a timely motion under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the District Court denied by order entered April 22, 2008, 2008 WL 1817267. Porter appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-18\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal determinations. <em>See Lubrizol Corp. v. Exxon Corp., </em>929 F.2d 960, 962 (3d Cir.1991). Summary action is warranted when no substantial question is presented on appeal. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Essentially for the reasons explained by the Magistrate Judge, we do not believe that there is any question but that Porter\u2019s second complaint is barred by res judicata. As the Magistrate Judge properly explained, res judicata bars a second suit where \u201cthere has been (1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the same cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of action.\u201d <em>Lubrizol Corp., </em>929 F.2d at 963. Only the third element warrants discussion here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Porter argues that this element is not present because his allegations of conspiracy in the second complaint have changed the capacity in which he sues Cancelmi. Presumably, Porter means that Cancelmi may now be deemed to have acted under color of state law, thus giving Porter a \u00a7 1983 cause of action against Cancelmi that he did not have before. \u201cCause of action\u201d for purposes of res judicata, however, does not turn on the legal viability of a claim. Instead, \u201ccause of action\u201d is a broad, transactional concept that focuses on the \u201cessential similarity\u201d of the two claims. <em>Churchill v. Star Enters., </em>183 F.3d 184, 194 (3d Cir.1999). It does not allow a plaintiff in a second suit to assert \u201cdifferent legal theories to seek redress ... from a single course of wrongful conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. That is all Porter has done here. His claim remains that he has been injured by Cancelmi\u2019s failure to file two lawsuits on his behalf, and Cancelmi remains the only defendant. The conspiracy allegations in Porter\u2019s second complaint merely purport to explain Cancelmi\u2019s motive, and do not give him a separate \u201ccause of action\u201d for res judicata purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. Porter\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-13\">. The District Court did not specify whether it dismissed this complaint as malicious under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), or both. Because dismissal was warranted for the second reason, we need not discuss the first.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. Regarding the first element, the Magistrate Judge reasoned that a dismissal of an <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>complaint for failure to slate a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) constitutes a final judgment on the merits. That reasoning is clearly correct where, as here, the second suit also is brought <em>in forma pauperis. See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 34, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992); <em>Ciesz-kowska v. Gray Line New York, </em>295 F.3d 204, 205-06 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam). We need not decide whether the dismissal of Porter's first complaint would bar any <em>paid </em>complaint he might file in the future. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-20\">. In addition, Porter is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of whether Cancel-mi acted under color of state law because Porter actually litigated and lost that same issue in his first suit, which was finally decided against him on that basis. <em>See Peloro v. United States, </em>488 F.3d 163, 174 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
