In his \u00a7 2255 petition, Mr. Ndiaye alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. For substantially the same reasons that the district court set forth in its well-reasoned order, we deny Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b646-18\">Mr. Ndiaye was one of two defendants named in a single count drug trafficking indictment that charged possession with the intention to distribute approximately 1,025 pounds of marijuana. Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s co-defendant, Ebrima Tunkara, was acquitted of the same charge in a separate trial conducted a week before Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s trial. A jury found Mr. Ndiaye guilty on August 18, 2005. Mr. Ndiaye filed a timely motion for a new trial challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and arguing the court erroneously admitted evidence that his cellular telephone called and received calls from two phone numbers of subscribers having Hispanic surnames in Phoenix, Arizona. The district court denied Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s motion and sentenced Mr. Ndiaye to a term of 63 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-19\">Mr. Ndiaye appealed his conviction and sentence. He was represented by his trial counsel, who filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved to withdraw from the case. Mr. Ndiaye filed no response to the <em>Anders </em>brief. Agreeing with the defense counsel that the appeal did not present any non-frivolous issues, this court dismissed Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s appeal and granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>197 Fed.Appx. 780 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Mr. Ndiaye then filed a pro se motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 asserting ineffective assistance of counsel and asking for an evidentiary hearing. The district court determined that the motion was timely, based on the prison mailbox rule, <em>see Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), but concluded that Mr. Ndiaye was not entitled to relief. It grouped Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims into the following areas: \u201c(1) failure to secure an interpreter; (2) denial of the defendant\u2019s [] right to testify; (3) failure to investigate the case and interview the co-defendant; (4) erroneous advice that the charged offense was a misdemeanor; and (5) failure to challenge the officers\u2019 false testimony about the defendant\u2019s post arrest statements.\u201d Rec. doc. 111 at 9; <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>Nos. 05-40017-02-SAC, 08-4009-SAC, 2008 WL 2275569, at *4 (D.Kan. Jun.3, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In order to obtain a COA, Mr. Ndiaye must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Mr. Ndiaye may make this showing by demonstrating that \u201cjurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). \u201c[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that [the] petitioner will not prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Here, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order, we conclude that Mr. Ndiaye is not entitled to a COA. As the district court noted, to establish a claim for ineffective assistance, Mr. Ndiaye must show both that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if.it is objectively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 687-88,104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel\u2019s deficient performance is prejudicial if \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. None of Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s ineffective assistance claims satisfy both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">First, as the district court found, Mr. Ndiaye cannot establish prejudice based on his counsel\u2019s alleged failure to obtain an interpreter. Mr. Ndiaye and his counsel differ on when Mr. Ndiaye directed his counsel to request an interpreter. Nonetheless, when counsel followed Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s direction to request an interpreter at the sentencing phase, the district court denied the request. The district court found that Mr. Ndiaye spoke English and did not need an interpreter. Assuming counsel was deficient for not requesting an interpreter earlier, Mr. Ndiaye cannot establish prejudice. Mr. Ndiaye has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>would oi' should have been different if counsel requested an interpreter earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Mr. Ndiaye also cannot establish prejudice based on his failure to testify. As the district court pointed out, neither of the points to which Mr. Ndiaye sought to testify were in dispute. Further, the critical evidence against Mr. Ndiaye involved the conflicting accounts Mr. Ndiaye gave to police following his arrest. Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s proposed testimony fails to blunt the effect of this critical evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Mr. Ndiaye claims his counsel was deficient for failing to interview his co-defendant, Mr. Tunkara, and for failing to review Mr. Tunkara\u2019s trial transcript. This claim lacks the specificity needed to determine whether his counsel was deficient and whether the deficiency, if any, prejudiced Mr. Ndiaye. As the district court noted, Mr. Ndiaye has not presented an affidavit from Mr. Tunkara. Mr. Ndiaye has not addressed to what Mr. Tunkara would testify or how Mr. Tunkara\u2019s transcript would have assisted him at trial. The simple fact of a codefendant\u2019s acquittal does not draw into question the sufficiency of the evidence against a defendant. <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>374 F.3d 959, 970-71 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A] jury acquittal may simply be the result of the jury\u2019s \u2018mistake, compromise, or lenity,\u2019 rather than a conclusion that the codefendants are not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 64, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984)), <em>judgment vacated on other grounds by Nichols v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1113, 125 S.Ct. 1082, 160 L.Ed.2d 1054 (2005)). Mr. Ndiaye has failed to establish both deficient performance and prejudice on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Mr. Ndiaye also asks this court to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing to \u201ccall his acquitted Co-Defendant Ebrima Tunkara and procure his trial transcripts.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br., at 4. To be entitled to an evidentiary hearing, Mr. Ndiaye must allege facts that if proven would entitle him to relief. <em>United States v. Whalen, </em>976 F.2d 1346, 1348 (10th Cir.1992). We review the denial of an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Ndiaye has asserted no facts that convince us that he is entitled to relief or that the district court abused its discretion. Mr. Ndiaye references Mr. Tunkara\u2019s trial in which Mr. Tunkara took the stand on his behalf and was acquitted. Aplt\u2019s App. for COA and Supporting Memorandum at 6. Mr. Ndiaye states that \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion was that [Mr. Tunkara] successfully rebutted the government\u2019s evidence. The same evidence used against this Petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While evidence or strategy pursued at Mr. Tunkara\u2019s trial may have been beneficial to Mr. Ndiaye, these allegations are insufficient to allow us to conclude that Mr. Ndiaye is entitled to an evidentiary hearing or that the district court abused its discretion when it denied one.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The district court adequately addressed the remaining claims in Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s petition, including the claims that Mr. Ndiaye was misinformed about the nature of his charge and that his counsel never challenged false statements by police. The district court correctly held that these claims lacked sufficient facts on which to base a cognizable claim, <em>see Hall v. Bell-mon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991), or that these claims were otherwise directly refuted by the record. Therefore, these claims are insufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The district court carefully summarized each of Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s allegations, and, after considering them individually and in the aggregate, concluded Mr. Ndiaye was not entitled to relief. We have reviewed the district court\u2019s order, the brief, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>entire record on appeal, and we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Ndiaye\u2019s application for a COA, and we DISMISS this matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
