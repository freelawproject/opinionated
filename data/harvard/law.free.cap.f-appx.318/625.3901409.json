R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b649-24\">ORDER DENYING CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b649-25\">NEIL M. GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b649-26\">Roland Rudd, a Kansas state prisoner, was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 272 months. Following the denial of his direct appeals and collateral proceedings in state court, he filed a challenge to his confinement in federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, in which he raised some eighteen separate claims. In a thorough opinion, the district court discussed each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>claim and denied the petition. Because the district court did not rule on his subsequent request for a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d), it was deemed denied. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 22.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Mr. Rudd now seeks a COA from this court to permit an appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition. In order to obtain a COA, a petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), such that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Mindful of the solicitous construction to be afforded Mr. Rudd\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings, <em>Van Deelen v. Johnson, </em>497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007), we nonetheless conclude that no reasonable jurist could doubt the correctness of the district court\u2019s disposition. As such, and for substantially the same reasons given by the district court, we deny Mr. Rudd\u2019s application for a COA and we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-27\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
