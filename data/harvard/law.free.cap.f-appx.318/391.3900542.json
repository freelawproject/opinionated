BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">Parkham Industrial Distributors, Inc. appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to The Cincinnati Insurance Co., Inc. (\u201cCIC\u201d) on Parkham\u2019s claims that CIC breached the terms of its insurance contract and showed bad faith in refusing to defend and indemnify Parkham against a lawsuit brought by Solidification Products International, Inc. (\u201cSPI\u201d). The district court held that the fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims in SPI\u2019s First Amended Complaint did not allege an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d covered by Parkham\u2019s policy with CIC, and that, even if they did, those claims arose out of a patent infringement claim and were excluded from coverage. Having granted summary judgment to CIC on the breach-of-contract claim, the district court subsequently dismissed with prejudice Park-ham\u2019s claims of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-19\">After carefully reviewing the record, the applicable law, the parties\u2019 briefs and counsels\u2019 arguments, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to CIC. As the district court\u2019s opinion carefully and correctly sets out the law governing the issues raised, and clearly articulates the reasons underlying its decision, issuance of a full written opinion by this court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s orders granting summary judgment to CIC and dismissing Parkham\u2019s Complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
