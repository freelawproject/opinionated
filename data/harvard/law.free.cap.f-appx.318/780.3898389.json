He appeals his conviction and sentence. After review and oral argument, we affirm, his conviction but vacate his sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">A. Smith\u2019s Arrest; State and Federal Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">On August 5, 2006, Smith was arrested by Atlanta police. Smith\u2019s arrest stemmed from a fight between Smith and Atlanta police officer Matthew Henderson. Officer Henderson was called to the scene after Nadia Boothe called police and reported that a man (Smith) had grabbed and threatened her in the parking lot of a gas station. When Officer Henderson arrived, Smith was boarding a bus. Officer Henderson stopped the bus and escorted Smith off the bus. Wfiien Officer Henderson attempted to arrest Smith, Smith tried to run and a fight ensued in which both men were hurt. Smith allegedly clubbed Officer Henderson with a gun. Officer Henderson eventually subdued Smith. Wfiien other officers arrived they found a .38 caliber handgun at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">Smith, who previously had been convicted of a felony, was charged in state court with aggravated assault on a peace officer, possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, attempted kidnaping, boarding a bus with a concealed weapon, reckless conduct, and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to the state charges, Smith was indicted in federal district court on September 6, 2006 for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">B. Pretrial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">Smith pled not guilty and moved to suppress evidence and statements obtained by police in the case. Smith argued that his stop, detention, seizure, and arrest by Officer Henderson was warrantless and without probable cause. Smith also moved to suppress all statements that he allegedly made to police, arguing that they were not made voluntarily and were obtained in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>lation of <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Smith later filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss for violation of the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The magistrate judge held an evidentia-ry hearing and issued a report recommending that Smith\u2019s motions to suppress and to dismiss be denied. The magistrate judge recommended denying the motion to dismiss because it was filed <em>pro se </em>and Smith was represented by counsel. The magistrate judge recommended denying the motions to suppress because (1) Officer Henderson\u2019s investigatory stop and detention of Smith was supported by reasonable suspicion, (2) the events after the investigatory stop warranted Smith\u2019s arrest, and (3) Smith\u2019s statements to police were voluntary and not obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>or the Fourth Amendment. The district court accepted the report and recommendation as to the motions to suppress and denied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">At the pretrial conference on September 5, 2007, the district court denied Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss for a Speedy Trial Act violation (along with two other <em>pro se </em>speedy-trial-based motions to dismiss, which Smith filed after the magistrate judge\u2019s report). On September 11, 2007, Smith\u2019s counsel filed a motion to adopt the <em>pro se </em>motions to dismiss. The district court permitted the adoption, but denied the counseled motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">C. Trial Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The district court held a jury trial from September 12 to 14, 2007. Because Smith challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, we detail the testimony of the witnesses at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">1. <em>Government\u2019s Case-in^-Chief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Nadia Boothe, the government\u2019s first witness, testified that on August 5, 2006, her husband \u25a0 was driving her to work shortly before 4:00 p.m. She was sitting in the front passenger seat. They stopped at a gas station. When they were pulling out, they saw Smith walk in front of their car and stare at them in a \u201cmenacing\u201d way. Boothe asked him \u201cwas everything all right, did he need anything.\u201d Smith said, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d and walked up to the car. Smith then leaned through the open passenger-side window and grabbed Boothe in the groin area. Smith tried to snatch an unlit cigarette out of her hand, and he also was \u201ctrying to grab [Boothe] out of the car.\u201d Boothe told Smith to get away from her, and her husband drove them away from Smith. Smith followed their car on foot; Boothe testified that Smith was \u201cchasing us with, like, his hand on his hip like he has a gun and saying that he spared us and saying all kinds of smart things to us.\u201d Boothe did not see Smith have any gun at that time, though.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Boothe\u2019s husband drove to another gas station further down the street, and Boothe called 911. While Boothe was outside the second gas station making the call and waiting for police, Smith walked past her into the gas station\u2019s store \u201cand he was still saying smart little stuff, basically kept saying that he had spared us and things of that nature.\u201d Boothe waited for a police officer for 30 minutes before giving up and going to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">Boothe worked at a Church\u2019s Chicken restaurant a few minutes down the road. After working for an hour or two, Boothe noticed that Smith was in the restaurant. Boothe had not seen him come in. Smith approached the counter and asked her for hot sauce. Smith was wearing totally different clothing, but Boothe recognized him. Boothe called 911 again. Smith went out to a bus stop, and five minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>later a policeman (Officer Henderson) arrived. Boothe pointed out Smith to Officer Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">At that time, Smith was getting onto the bus. Boothe saw Officer Henderson stop the bus, enter it, and escort Smith off the bus. Then she saw Officer Henderson \u201cattempt to arrest\u201d Smith, and Smith resist. Officer Henderson grabbed Smith by the back of the shirt and Smith \u201cstarted attacking\u201d Officer Henderson. Officer Henderson drew his baton and they fought; during the fight they fell to the ground. Boothe saw Officer Henderson on the ground, and Smith was on top of him \u201cbeating him with a gun.\u201d The gun was silver, \u201cshaped like a gun basically\u201d and \u201clooked like a gun.\u201d Smith hit Officer Henderson with the gun repeatedly, and Officer Henderson had blood all over his face and dripping down his shirt. Officer Henderson got to his knees and radioed for backup. Boothe ran to Officer Henderson\u2019s car and also tried to call for help. When she went to the car, Boothe was not watching the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The fight lasted a few minutes, and at the end Officer Henderson had handcuffed Smith. A few minutes after the fight stopped, another police officer arrived. Until that time, no one approached Officer Henderson and Smith. Shortly after the second officer arrived, a number of other police officers came as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The government also called Officer Henderson to testify. Officer Henderson testified that on the afternoon of August 5, 2006, he received word from a dispatcher sending him to a \u201cdispute call\u201d at Church\u2019s Chicken and directing him to see Boothe. When he arrived, Boothe told him that the man at the bus stop tried to grab her. She pointed out Smith. Smith got onto the bus, and Officer Henderson ran to the bus and stopped it to speak to Smith. Officer Henderson told Smith to leave the bus, and they exited. After Officer Henderson got off the bus, he testified that the \u201c[n]ext thing that I can remember is I feel this burst of pain in my head, it\u2019s extreme pain, and ... then I\u2019m covered in my blood.\u201d Officer Henderson felt like he was hit with a blunt object right at his hairline on the front of his head, but he had \u201cno idea what the object was that caused the pain.\u201d His memory is unclear after that, but he was struggling physically with someone and at some point he was lying on the ground and radioed to his dispatcher that he had someone in custody, was bleeding, and needed an ambulance. The next thing Officer Henderson remembered was someone applying pressure to his head and then waking up at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The next witness was the bus driver, Joe Terry Cole. Cole testified that when Smith and Officer Henderson got off the bus, there was a \u201ccommotion.\u201d Cole thought one of the men was falling and the other was trying to catch him, then one (Smith) was trying to run and the other (Officer Henderson) was trying to hold him. Then he saw- the men on the ground fighting. Cole \u201cdefinitely\u201d saw a shiny object in Officer Henderson\u2019s hand, with which Officer Henderson was trying to strike Smith, but no other objects or weapons. Cole stated he did not know whether he saw Smith\u2019s hand or not, beca\u00fc'se he was not looking for anything in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Atlanta police officer David Somers testified that he responded to Officer Henderson\u2019s request for help. He found Officer Henderson and Smith on the ground in some grass near a house, with Smith\u2019s hands behind his back and Officer Henderson\u2019s arms and legs wrapped around Smith to hold him down. Somers \u201ctook [Smith] off\u201d of Officer Henderson to cuff him and found Smith already cuffed. Somers turned to Officer Henderson and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Smith got up on one knee, saying \u201cI can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ve got to get out of here. I can\u2019t go back.\u201d Somers put him down and ordered him to stay, but Smith got up again, reiterating that he had to go and could not go back. Somers put his knee on Smith to keep him from getting up. After five minutes, other police units arrived and took charge of Smith. During this time, Officer Henderson did not speak at all, even though Somers repeatedly asked him what was going on. Officer Henderson\u2019s entire face was covered with blood. Smith was covered in blood too, but Somers did not see any injuries on Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Somers testified that Officer Burt Brooks was one of the officers who arrived at the scene. Brooks \u201cstopped right in front of the bus stop, and as soon as he stepped out of [his] vehicle, [said], \u2018Who does this gun belong to?\u2019 \u201d Somers testified that \u201cright where Officer Henderson is and the gun, it\u2019s like a long\u2014it\u2019s just a straight line [from where Brooks found the gun] to where I found Officer Henderson.\u201d There were no civilians in the grassy area, and no one was trying to help Officer Henderson when Somers arrived. There were a group of people at the Church\u2019s Chicken across the street watching.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Officer Johnny Leblanc testified next. Officer Leblanc was the responding officer who wrote up the police report for the incident. He arrived as other officers were getting there and he made a perimeter with crime scene tape. No civilians came inside the taped-off area. He looked around in the grassy area for evidence. At first neither he nor the other officers located any evidence there. Leblanc testified that, between five and ten minutes after he arrived, \u201cit was brought to my attention and the attention [of] other officers that there was a revolver [lying] on the grass which wasn\u2019t initially noticed by any of us.\u201d At that time, there were ten to twelve officers present. Someone said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d and pointed out the weapon on the ground. Leblanc turned and saw the weapon, which was a dark gray revolver. No one moved the gun until the I.D. tech arrived and photographed it. Officer Leblanc took Boothe\u2019s statement and asked if any of the civilians present had seen the fight, but no one came forward. Leblanc testified that he saw \u201cdebris\u201d in the grassy area, but no other \u201cweapons or rocks or bricks or anything.\u201d On cross-examination, Leblanc stated that about seven or eight officers were looking around the area for evidence by the time the gun was found, and they had been looking for \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d before finding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Atlanta police investigator Eric Anderson testified that he collected evidence at the scene. He tagged and bagged the gun and the items off Smith\u2019s person. Anderson did not see any bricks, rocks, or blunt objects other than the gun in the general area; he also did not find any electronics. On cross-examination, Anderson testified that he did not request any fingerprint analysis of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The government called Thomas Hopen, a forensic investigator with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\u201cB.A.T.F.\u201d). Hopen tested the gun found at the scene. His tests did not reveal any traces of blood on the gun. He was not able to express an opinion about whether or not the gun was used to hit someone in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">B.A.T.F. special agent Steve Koseh testified as an expert as to the interstate movement of the gun. Kosch testified that the gun matched the legal definition of a firearm and that he examined it to see where it was manufactured. He examined the markings on the gun, consulted research materials, and determined the gun was manufactured in Massachusetts by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Smith &amp; Wesson. Smith &amp; Wesson does not have any manufacturing plants in Georgia. Kosch opined that the weapon had to travel in or affect interstate commerce to be present in Georgia. He also reviewed a trace report for the gun and testified that the gun was sold to its original purchaser (Loren Keith Burt) in St. Louis, Missouri in July 2001. The trace report listed the last firearms dealer to sell the gun, but did not contain information about potential sales from one private citizen to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">2. <em>Defendant Smith\u2019s Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Smith called Alfonso Kennedy, a fourteen-year-old boy who lived in a house near the Church\u2019s Chicken and witnessed the fight between Smith and Officer Henderson from his front porch, where he was sitting with his cousin Marino. Kennedy testified that after Officer Henderson pulled Smith off the bus, Smith \u201ctried to get loose, then they ended up in the grass and they was on the ground fighting.\u201d According to Kennedy, the two men \u201cwas hitting each other. Then the police officer whipped out his little stick and starting beating [Smith] in the head.... They was still going at it and then [Officer Henderson] finally got [Smith] in handcuffs and then he started calling for backup and then some more police officers came down.\u201d Kennedy said he saw the whole thing and Smith never had anything in his hands. He stated that when the other police officers arrived one of them kicked Smith and another picked him up and dropped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">On cross-examination, Kennedy testified that the fight started because Smith was trying to . get away from Officer Henderson. He testified that Smith swung at Officer Henderson one time, but did not hit him. At some point Officer Henderson fell in the grass.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Kennedy\u2019s grandmother Diane Kennedy also testified for Smith. She did not see the fight because she was inside when her grandson Marino told her to come look. The fight was over by the time Ms. Kennedy reached her porch. Ms. Kennedy testified that when the police officers arrived after the fight, they picked Smith up, dumped him down, and started kicking and hitting him with \u201csomething like a stick or iron or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">D. Exclusion of Marino Simon</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">After Ms. Kennedy testified, the defense called Marino Simon, Kennedy\u2019s cousin and Ms. Kennedy\u2019s other grandson, to testify. The government objected to Simon\u2019s testimony on the ground that Simon violated the rule of sequestration, which the government invoked at the beginning of the trial. The government asserted Simon had spoken to Kennedy about the testimony Kennedy had given.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The district court and counsel questioned Simon about the alleged violation outside the presence of the jury. Simon indicated that Kennedy had spoken to him outside the courtroom after Kennedy had finished testifying. Simon stated that Kennedy did not mention his testimony, but that they had just talked about lunch and \u201cthings at school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">The district court and counsel then had Kennedy come back to the courtroom to testify further, but outside the presence of the jury. Kennedy stated that Simon asked him what went on in the courtroom during his testimony, but that Kennedy did not tell him. Next, Simon said he was hungry, and Kennedy said he was too. After denying it, Kennedy then admitted that he told Simon that Kennedy had testified that he saw the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">The district court and counsel then examined a government rebuttal witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>Amy Michalik, who testified that she overheard Kennedy tell Simon that he had testified that the two of them were sitting on the porch, and that the two of them spoke more quietly for a moment when she approached. She could not make out what they said after that. After hearing this testimony, the district court concluded that Kennedy and Simon violated the rule of sequestration, and excluded Simon from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Smith\u2019s counsel then made a proffer of what he expected Simon\u2019s testimony to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aoa-dedup-0\">I expect that he will testify that he was in fact sitting on the porch with his cousin, that they were listening to music and that he witnessed the whole fight. He saw the bus pull up in front of the neighboring yard ..., that he saw, in essence, shortly after the two gentlemen get down to the street that a fight erupted between the two of them where they were swinging at each other, that there was\u2014that [Smith] did not display or show or have anything in his hands, that ultimately the\u2014he and the officer found themselves down on the ground wrestling, punching each other, and ultimately he ended up in handcuffs and that both of the individuals appeared to sustain injuries as both people were bloody in the aftermath and that both people were taken away, taken away by ambulances, obviously, apparently because they needed medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Later, the district court made the following statement about its exclusion of Simon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5u\">Mr. Simon was never sworn. It was stated to me that Mr. Simon and Alfonso Kennedy were seen talking together after Mr. Kennedy had testified. And I know that they were not supervised ..., so they were out there without supervision, I guess, while their grandmother was testifying. And I have the sworn testimony of Agent Michalik, stat[ing] that she had overheard Mr. Kennedy telling Mr. Simon what his testimony had been. And when I asked Mr. Kennedy if he had discussed his testimony with Mr. Simon, ultimately his answer was, quote, not really. He\u2019s 14 years old and he was probably scared to death, but he did not make eye contact with me during my discussion with him and he would click his tongue up against the top of his mouth. And I\u2019m not commenting on his credibility as a witness in this case. I\u2019m just talking specifically about my conversation with him about whether he had discussed his testimony with Mr. Simon. There were three people involved. Mr. Simon said he did not discuss Mr. Kennedy\u2019s testimony. Mr. Simon, again, was never sworn. I\u2019ve got the sworn testimony of M[s]. Michalik saying that she did hear the young men discussing Mr. Kennedy\u2019s testimony. And then I\u2019ve got the testimony of Mr. Kennedy saying, not really, when I asked him if they had discussed his testimony. And so it\u2019s on the record that I made the ruling that I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">E. Exclusion of Treatment Note Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">At trial, Smith\u2019s counsel informed the district court that Smith intended to call a hospital nurse that treated Officer Henderson. The government objected based on hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Smith\u2019s counsel argued that because the hospital records are business records, the nurse could testify \u201cthat to the extent that there are doctor\u2019s notes or progress notes [in the hospital\u2019s medical records] pertaining to the night, that very night she was treating Mr. Henderson, that she is also capable of testifying, for instance, to a progress note saying that Mr. Henderson thought that he was hit with a C.D. player.\u201d The district court ruled that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>nurse could testify about entries she made arising from what Officer Henderson himself told her for diagnosis or treatment purposes. However, the court ruled the nurse could not testify as to entries arising from statements Officer Henderson may have made to the ambulance\u2019s emergency medical technicians or other medical personnel that the nurse received secondhand.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Smith ultimately did not call the nurse. However, he did make a proffer of the testimony he expected to elicit had the government\u2019s hearsay objection not been sustained. Smith\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">[WJhat she was going to testify to is that she saw Officer Henderson. She helped treat him. In essence, she created the emergency trauma nursing notes that particular night. They\u2019re a three-page document, and ... those [notes] indicate that Officer Henderson was hit with a rock, that she will testify that essentially those documents are documents that are maintained in the ordinary course of business there at Grady Hospital. They are documents that are filled out every time a patient comes into the emergency [room]. Moreover, she would testify regarding other doctors\u2019 notes and an intake note, and in those doctors\u2019 notes and intake notes there are indications, again, that ... Officer Henderson was hit with a brick and a rock, and then a different place that he was hit with either a C.D. player\u2014or thought he was hit with a C.D. player or a gun that was found at the scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The district court reiterated its ruling \u201cthat I did not exclude her altogether. I just ... said she could testify to hearsay to the extent of what Officer Henderson told her.... It\u2019s just that what Officer Henderson told somebody else who told her that I excluded.\u201d Smith\u2019s counsel responded that the nurse \u201cwould have testified if she took the stand that her emergency trauma notes most likely reflected conversations that she would have had with E.M.T.\u2019s who transported Officer Henderson to the hospital.\u201d He also indicated that the nurse would have testified as to doctor\u2019s progress notes that \u201cwould likely reflect the conversation that Officer Henderson was having with the doctor himself at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The district court asked whether Smith intended to call the doctor. Smith\u2019s counsel said yes. The government also indicated it had planned to call the doctor, but that the doctor \u201cdoesn\u2019t know where that information came from in the doctor\u2019s notes either\u201d and therefore the government did not call the doctor to testify. Smith\u2019s counsel gave no response to this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">F. Verdict and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">After the government rested, and again at the close of all evidence, Smith moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Smith possessed the gun or that an interstate nexus existed with respect to the gun. The district court denied the motion both times. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Smith guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">The federal probation office calculated Smith\u2019s base offense level at 20 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. Smith qualified for a four-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because he used a weapon in connection with another felony offense (Smith\u2019s state charge of aggravated assault). Smith also qualified for a two-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 3A1.2 because the offense involved an official victim, Officer Henderson. Therefore, Smith\u2019s total offense level was 26 which, with a criminal history category of VI, yielded an advisory guidelines range of 120 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. The probation office adjusted Smith\u2019s advisory guidelines range to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>120 months\u2019 imprisonment because the statutory maximum period of imprisonment for Smith\u2019s offense was ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The district court conducted a sentencing hearing on March 20, 2008. As mentioned above, Smith was convicted in state court for his conduct on August 5, 2006. Smith was sentenced to 20 years in prison on his state aggravated assault conviction. The district court determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) required Smith to be sentenced concurrently with his state aggravated assault sentence. Smith\u2019s attack on Officer Henderson was relevant conduct to Smith\u2019s federal \u00a7 922(g) offense and was used to increase Smith\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a 120-month sentence of imprisonment, to run concurrent with Smith\u2019s 20-year state sentence. After the district court announced the sentence, Smith\u2019s counsel requested that the court credit Smith with the time he already had served on his state sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l). The government objected. The district court concluded that \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) required a sentence adjustment for time served in state prison only if the federal Bureau of Prisons will not credit the time served. The district court further concluded that it could not determine, and would not attempt to anticipate, what time the Bureau of Prisons would credit to Smith\u2019s federal sentence. Thus, the district court denied Smith\u2019s request to credit him with time served on the state aggravated assault sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Smith appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">A. Speedy Trial Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">Smith first argues that the district court erred in denying his motions to dismiss for speedy trial violations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Speedy Trial Act requires that the trial of an indicted defendant shall start within seventy days of the later of the defendant\u2019s indictment or arraignment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1); <em>United States v. Young, </em>528 F.3d 1294, 1295 (11th Cir.2008). However, certain days are excluded from the seventy-day calculation. Those include \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including ... delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion\u201d and \u201cdelay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(D), (h)(1)(H).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">Additionally, in <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>935 F.2d 1223 (11th Cir.1991), this Court explained that the excludable time regarding pretrial motions continues through a post-hearing briefing period un~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>til 30 days after the court takes the matter under advisement, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\">[T]he court may provide a period of time following the hearing during which parties may submit supplemental materials regarding the motion. This period of time is automatically excluded without regard to its reasonableness. Once the court concludes the hearing and the time for filing supplemental materials expires, the court has taken the motion under advisement and [\u00a7 3161(h)(1)(H) ] permits no more than thirty additional days to be excluded from the speedy trial clock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\"><em>Davenport, </em>935 F.2d at 1228-29 (citations omitted). In addition, when a magistrate judge considers a pretrial motion and issues a report, and then the district court considers whether to accept the report, both judges have thirty days of excluded time in which to consider the motion. <em>United States v. Mers, </em>701 F.2d 1321, 1335-37 (11th Cir.1983). Also excluded is \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge\u201d upon a finding that the ends of justice served by the continuance outweigh the interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">As to excludable time, Smith does not provide his own calculation or state with specificity which days the district court should not have excluded. Instead, he argues merely that \u201cthe [district court\u2019s] calculation excluded over seven months of time solely related to the disposition of Mr. Smith\u2019s motions to suppress evidence and statements.\u201d Because Smith\u2019s\u2019 argument focuses on the time excluded as to his motion to suppress, we review what happened with the motion to suppress and explain why the district court properly excluded the time between October 12, 2006 and July 16, 2007.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">First, Smith\u2019s motion to suppress was filed on October 12, 2006 and required a hearing. Thus, the time between the October 12, 2006 motion and the January 8, 2007 hearing was excludable on that basis alone. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>936 F.2d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.1991). Second, at the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate judge ordered post-hearing briefing to be filed after the transcript of the hearing was available. The transcript was filed on March 8, 2007, Smith filed his post-hearing brief on March 27, 2007, and the government filed its brief on April 16, 2007. Thus, the excludable time extended to April 16, 2007. <em>See Davenport, </em>935 F.2d at 1228-29. Third, the magistrate judge\u2019s thirty days of excluded <em>time to </em>consider the motion extended to May 17, 2007, when the magistrate judge issued her report. <em>See id. . </em>Smith requested more time to file his objections to the report, and the district court granted the request on May 23, 2007. Smith filed his objections on June 15, 2007, which extended the excludable time to June 15, 2007. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Finally, the district court\u2019s thirty-day period to consider the report and objections extended the excludable time to July 16, 2007. <em>See Mers, </em>701 F.2d at 1335-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Accordingly, with the October 12, 2006 to July 16, 2007 time properly excluded, the district court accurately calculated that only 63 non-excludable days had run from Smith\u2019s arraignment on September 13, 2006 to the commencement of his trial on September 12, 2007.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Alternatively, Smith argues that the delay in bringing him to trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. In determining whether a defendant has been deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, courts must consider: \u201c(1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1296 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The first factor measures the delay between indictment and the start of trial. It must be satisfied with some \u201cpresumptively prejudicial period of delay\u201d before a court need consider the other factors. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cA delay is considered presumptively prejudicial as it approaches one year.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Smith satisfies the first and third factors. Smith was indicted on September 6, 2006, and his trial began on September 12, 2007. This one-year delay is presumptively prejudicial. Smith also adequately asserted his speedy trial right, thereby satisfying the third factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">However, the \u201creasons for the delay\u201d factor does not weigh in Smith\u2019s favor. Indeed, much of the delay was occasioned by litigation of Smith\u2019s motion to suppress. And, it was not unreasonable for the district court <em>sua sponte </em>to continue the trial for two weeks due to a change in the court\u2019s own schedule. Thus, Smith has not satisfied the second factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">Because not all of the first three factors weigh against the government, Smith must show actual prejudice. <em>See Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1296 (stating that \u201ca defendant generally must show actual prejudice unless the first three factors all weigh heavily against the government\u201d (quotation marks, citation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted)). Smith has failed to show actual prejudice. His brief states only the conclusion that he suffered prejudice, without enumerating how or why. He has not shown that he endured oppressive pretrial incarceration, that he suffered particular delay-related anxiety and concern, or that his defense was impaired by the wait of slightly more than a year in bringing his case to trial. <em>See id. </em>Thus, Smith has not shown that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">B. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">Smith contends the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress all evidence (in particular, the gun) and statements obtained by police following his arrest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He maintains that Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Henderson arrested or attempted to arrest him (as they were getting off the bus) without probable cause, and that therefore all evidence obtained as the fruit of that wrongful arrest must be suppressed. In support, he argues: (1) upon arrival, Officer Henderson knew only that some type of dispute or disturbance had occurred; (2) Officer Henderson spoke to Boothe only briefly, and made no other investigation, before approaching Smith on the bus; (3) Officer Henderson had no basis for determining the trustworthiness of Boothe\u2019s assertion that Smith had grabbed her; (4) once on the bus, Officer Henderson immediately ordered Smith to leave the bus and took hold of Smith\u2019s arm to escort him off; and (5) after Smith and Officer Henderson left the bus, Henderson tried to place Smith in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits police officers from seizing a person unreasonably. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2924, 168 L.Ed.2d 253 (2007). An arrest qualifies as a seizure of the person. <em>See United States v. Virden, </em>488 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2007). In general, the reasonableness of an arrest or other seizure turns on the presence, or absence, of probable cause. <em>Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1288. \u201cProbable cause to arrest exists when the totality of the facts and circumstances support a reasonable belief that the suspect had committed or was committing a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 438, 169 L.Ed.2d 306 (2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">An exception to the probable cause requirement exists for investigatory detentions whereby \u201cminimally intrusive searches and seizures of the person are permissible when a law enforcement officer has an objectively <em>reasonable suspicion </em>that criminal activity may be afoot.\u201d <em>United States v. Heard, </em>367 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). Reasonable suspicion \u201ccan arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)). Nevertheless, it must derive from \u201csomething more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>345 F.3d at 1289 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">It is questionable whether Officer Henderson\u2019s actions in stopping the bus, ordering Smith to leave, and taking Smith by the arm rise to the level of arrest. However, we need not address that question because Boothe\u2019s identification of Smith as the man who had attacked her that day gave Officer Henderson not only reasonable suspicion, but also probable cause, to believe Smith had committed a crime. <em>See United States v. Burbridge, </em>252 F.3d 775, 778 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn ordinary citizen\u2019s eyewitness account of criminal activity and identification of a perpetrator is normally sufficient to supply probable cause to stop the suspect.\u201d); <em>Woods v. City of Chicago, </em>234 F.3d 979, 996 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e have consistently held that an identification or a report from a single, credible victim or eyewitness can provide the basis for probable cause.\u201d); <em>cf. Heard, </em>367 F.3d at 1278 (concluding that an anonymous face-to-face tip that a man with whom the tipster had been arguing had a gun provided reasonable suspicion for a stop and frisk).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">Furthermore, the officers certainly had probable cause to arrest Smith after he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>tried to flee from Officer Henderson and then attacked him. Once Smith and Officer Henderson left the bus, Boothe testified that she \u201csaw [Officer Henderson] attempt to arrest [Smith] and which [Smith] resisted and he tried to run. And [Officer Henderson] grabbed the back of his shirt first, and that\u2019s when [Smith] turned around and started attacking\u201d Officer Henderson. Officer Henderson testified that he got off the bus with Smith and the \u201c[n]ext thing that I can remember is I feel this burst of pain in my head ... and then I\u2019m covered in my blood.\u201d He was asked, \u201cThat\u2019s immediately after you get off the bus?\u201d and responded, \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I can recall after the bus, getting off the bus.\u201d Cole, the bus driver, testified that once the two men left the bus, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s when it was commotion\u201d and then he saw Smith and Officer Henderson on the ground fighting. Certainly, at this point Officer Henderson and the other officers had probable cause for an arrest. <em>Cf. United States v. Gonzalez, </em>71 F.3d 819, 826-27 (11th Cir.1996) (stating that police had probable cause to arrest a defendant who fled when they attempted to stop his vehicle); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>691 F.2d 1009, 1018 (11th Cir.1982) (concluding that, even if a drug enforcement agent\u2019s initial arrest of the defendant was illegal, the defendant\u2019s subsequent flight and assault of the agent constituted probable cause to re-arrest the defendant). Because Smith was detained and arrested with probable cause, the district court properly denied his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Smith argues that the district court erred in denying his motions for a judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To convict Smith under \u00a7 922(g), the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) Smith was a convicted felon; (2) Smith knowingly possessed a firearm; and (3) the firearm was in, or affected, interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004). At trial Smith stipulated he was a convicted felon, and he does not challenge the knowledge element. As to the possession element, however, Smith argues that the evidence did not permit a reasonable jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he possessed the gun found at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">We disagree. The evidence of possession, while not overwhelming, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Smith possessed the gun. First, Boothe testified that she saw Smith beat Officer Henderson with a gun. Specifically, Boothe testified Smith was on top of Officer Henderson \u201cbeating him with a gun.\u201d The gun was silver, \u201cshaped like a gun basically\u201d and \u201clooked like a gun.\u201d Smith hit Officer Henderson with the gun repeatedly, and Officer Henderson had blood all over his face and dripping down his shirt. Boothe also testified that Smith chased her earlier in the day with his hand on his hip like he had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Second, the officers found a gun at the scene of the fight. Officer Brooks parked by the bus stop, where Officer Henderson and Smith were, and he saw the gun. Further, Officers Somers and Leblanc testified that they were present when Brooks discovered the gun. According to Somers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the gun was found in \u201ca straight line to where I found Officer Henderson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Third, Officer Henderson had serious injuries and testified he was hit with a blunt object. Officer Leblanc testified, and investigator Eric Anderson agreed, that no weapons other than the gun and no \u201crocks or bricks or anything\u201d were found in the grassy area where Smith and Officer Henderson fought. Also, no civilians entered the area between the time of the fight and the time the gun was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Given this evidence cumulatively, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Smith possessed the gun found at the scene of the fight.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">As to the interstate commerce nexus requirement, \u00a7 922(g)(1) provides that it is unlawful for a convicted felon to \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Smith acknowledges that the evidence\u2014the gun was manufactured in Massachusetts, sold in Missouri, and discovered in Georgia\u2014was sufficient to establish that the firearm \u201ctraveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>355 F.3d 1281, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir.2000)); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">We reject Smith\u2019s argument that we should reconsider our precedent as inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), because we have already reaffirmed our \u201cminimal nexus\u201d requirement after the <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison </em>cases. <em>See Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1259-60; <em>see also United States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218, 1242 (11th Cir. 2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (discussing post <em>-Morrison </em>cases applying minimal interstate commerce nexus requirement for \u00a7 922(g) convictions). Accordingly, Smith\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the interstate commerce nexus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">D. Exclusion of Marino Simon</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Smith contends the district court erred in excluding the testimony of Smith\u2019s proposed witness Marino Simon based on Simon\u2019s violation of the rule of sequestration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court has broad power to sequester witnesses during trial. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1104 (11th Cir.2001). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">[wjhen a violation of the sequestration rule occurs, the court may respond in one of three ways: (1) it may cite the guilty party for contempt; (2) it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>allow opposing counsel to cross-examine the witnesses as to the nature of the violation; or (3) where counsel or the witness violate the rule intentionally, the court may strike testimony already given or disallow further testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Upon commencement of the trial, the government invoked the rule of sequestration. Kennedy and Simon were directed not to speak with each other about their testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When informed of a sequestration-rule violation, the district court separately questioned Simon, Kennedy, and Agent Michalik, who overheard them speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Simon admitted he talked with Kennedy but said he did not ask about Kennedy\u2019s testimony. Kennedy testified that Simon \u201cwas asking me\u201d about what had been discussed in the courtroom, but that \u201cI didn\u2019t really tell him.\u201d However, Kennedy also admitted: \u201cI was just, like, I said we seen the fight,\u201d but \u201c[w]e didn\u2019t really say anything about it.\u201d Agent Michalik testified that she saw Kennedy talking to Simon in the hallway outside the courtroom; she stated, \u201cI heard [Kennedy] say, \u2018I just told them that me and my cousin was sitting on the porch.\u2019 \u201d According to Agent Michalik, Kennedy and Simon continued to talk more quietly, and she could not make out the rest of their conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">After hearing this testimony, the district court found Agent Michalik\u2019s testimony to be more credible than Kennedy\u2019s and Simon\u2019s, found that Simon had violated the sequestration rule, and on that basis excluded Simon\u2019s testimony. While the district court did not use the word \u201cintentional,\u201d the context of the court\u2019s ruling and the exclusion of the testimony suggest the district court considered the violation intentional. Given the district court\u2019s findings, we conclude Smith has not shown the district court abused its discretion in excluding Simon\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Alternatively, Smith has not shown prejudice to justify reversal. When the district court barred Simon from testifying, Kennedy already had testified. Simon watched the fight between Smith and Officer Henderson from the same vantage point as Kennedy. The proffer of Simon\u2019s testimony reveals nothing that was different from Kennedy\u2019s. Although Simon would have testified that he saw nothing in Smith\u2019s hands, Kennedy already had testified similarly. Thus, because Simon\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative, Smith cannot show prejudice. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>441 F.3d 254, 263 (4th Cir.2006) (concluding that exclusion of a witness\u2019s testimony for violating sequestration rule was harmless error because the witness\u2019s testimony \u201cwould have been cumulative\u201d); <em>United States v. Atkins, </em>487 F.2d 257, 259 (8th Cir.1973) (noting that even if a sequestration-order violation did not justify exclusion, no prejudicial error existed because the rejected testimony was \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d of other testimony already introduced).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">E. Medical Records Hearsay Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Smith\u2019s fifth issue on appeal involves testimony by a nurse who treated Officer Henderson for the wounds received in the fight with Smith.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The district court ruled that the nurse could not testify as to notes in the hospital\u2019s treatment records that allegedly indicated that (1) Offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>cer Henderson was hit with a rock, (2) Officer Henderson was hit with a brick, and (3) Officer Henderson told a doctor that he thought he was hit with a silver CD player or a silver gun found at the scene. The district court determined that these alleged statements by Henderson were made to doctors or emergency medical technicians, and not to the nurse herself, and thus were inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">This proffered testimony presents a question of triple hearsay: statements by Officer Henderson to doctors/emergency medical technicians, to the nurse, who recorded them in hospital records. According to Federal Rule of Evidence 805, \u201c[h]earsay included within hearsay\u201d is inadmissible unless \u201ceach part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 805. Smith contends that the hearsay testimony was admissible through the combined operation of the medical treatment and business records hearsay exceptions found, respectively, in Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (6).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">If Officer Henderson made statements to his doctors or the EMTs for treatment purposes, such statements would fall within the medical treatment hearsay exception in Rule 803(4). And, if the doctors or EMTs told the nurse what Officer Henderson said and the nurse entered that hearsay-excepted statement in the hospital treatment records, the records would come within the business records exception in Rule 803(6).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">However, the record reveals that the nurse was not sure who told her the information she recorded in the treatment records.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the nurse does not know for sure who told her the information, Smith could not show that the information contained in the hospital treatment records was \u201ctransmitted by ... a person with knowledge.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>lack of knowledge, or at least uncertainty, about who transmitted the information contained in the treatment records also deprives the information of trustworthiness. <em>See id. </em>(stating the business records exception does not apply if \u201cthe source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness\u201d); <em>Ricciardi v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>811 F.2d 18, 23 (1st Cir.1987) (concluding notation in patient\u2019s medical records made by doctor who lacked personal knowledge of the alleged event he noted and who did not recall where he obtained the information he recorded in the notation did not qualify under the business records exception because \u201c[a]n unknown source is hardly trustworthy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The \u201ctouchstone of admissibility under Rule 803(6) is reliability, and a trial judge has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of such evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1183 (11th Cir.2006). We cannot say that the district court abused its broad discretion when it determined that the notations in the medical records that Smith sought to admit did not qualify under an exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">F. Sentence Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Smith\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred in failing to adjust his federal sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l), for the time he already had spent incarcerated in connection with his underlying offense conduct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This includes both time spent in state custody on the charges arising from his August 5, 2006 arrest, and the time he spent in federal custody on writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to answer, and be sentenced for, the \u00a7 922(g) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Section 5G1.3(b)(l) provides that a court shall adjust a federal sentence for prison time already served if: (1) \u201ca term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)\u201d; (2) the other offense \u201cwas the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) or Chapter Three (Adjustments)\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">The parties agree that (1) Smith\u2019s state aggravated assault conviction represents relevant conduct, (2) it was the basis for an increase in his offense level for his federal conviction, and (3) the Bureau of Prisons is not authorized to credit the time Smith served on his state aggravated assault conviction to Smith\u2019s federal sentence because this time was credited toward his state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (stating that a defendant shall not be credited time spent detained before sentence commences if that time has \u201cbeen credited against another sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">Accordingly, the government concedes that the district court erred in failing to credit Smith, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l), for his presentence period of incarceration. <em>See Descally, </em>254 F.3d at 1333 (vacating sentence for failing to credit defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) for time served before federal sentencing in state custody for related crime). We therefore vacate Smith\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of re-sentencing Smith to give him credit for the time he spent in custody between the time of his arrest and his federal sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Smith\u2019s conviction but vacate his sentence and remand this case to the district court for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-14\">.

The government argues that the district court\u2019s July 16, 2007 date for re-starting Smith's Speedy Trial Act clock was actually too generous to Smith, because it failed to account for the time in which the government could have, but did not, file a response to Smith\u2019s objections to the report.
