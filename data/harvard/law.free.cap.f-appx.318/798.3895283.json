Specifically, he argued that the following enumerated overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were not a violation of \u00a7 1029(b)(2): (1) his co-defendant, Oromie Ogionwo, presented a false driver\u2019s license in the name of Robert L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Voelkell, Jr. to a postal employee; (2) Ogi-onwo obtained mail containing a Discover credit card in Voelkell\u2019s name; and, (3) Ogionwo delivered the mail containing that Discover credit card to Obasohan.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On appeal, Obasohan argues that his <em>coram nobis </em>petition was warranted because his conduct was not a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, and he is no longer in custody. Therefore, no other remedy is available to correct his improper conviction. Furthermore, he contends that he suffers from various continuing civil disabilities due to his improper conviction. Obasohan argues that he did not produce, use, and traffic in any counterfeit access device, and thus he could not have violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029. Obasohan claims that because a major element of \u00a7 1029(a)(1) is that the access device or credit card be counterfeited, faked, or forged, he could not have committed the offense because the Discover credit card was unauthorized instead of counterfeited. Obasohan states that based on the Discover credit card being unauthorized, his overt acts could only have been charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2), but because he did not obtain at least $1,000 in value from the credit card, the elements of this offense were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Obasohan, relying primarily on <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam), argues that because the indictment did not allege a crime, the district court lacked jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea to a non-offense. Obasohan concedes that he pled guilty to conspiracy under \u00a7 1029(b)(2). However, he argues that he did not violate \u00a7 1029(a)(1). Therefore, he contends that he could not be guilty of \u00a7 1029(b)(2) because neither the rule of law nor evidence supported his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Obasohan also contends that he did not attack his improper conviction earlier because his counsel misadvised him that an unauthorized access device was also a counterfeit access device. Specifically, Obasohan states that his counsel failed to discover that he was charged with one specific conduct, which was not within the reach of \u00a7 1029(a)(1). Obasohan argues that, at every stage of his criminal proceedings, his counsel provided him with ineffective representation in violation of due process by failing to notice that there was a jurisdictional defect in his indictment. Further, Obasohan contends that he did not discover the difference in the two elements of \u00a7 1029(a)(1) until after reviewing his immigration appeal in <em>Oba-sohan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>479 F.3d 785 (11th Cir.2007) (hereinafter \u201cimmigration case\u201d), in which we stated that his conviction was premised upon one conduct depicted in the indictment, which was contrary to the overly broad \u201ctrue name fraud\u201d used by the district court in denying his <em>coram nobis </em>petition. Obasohan contends that based on his immigration case, he has discovered that \u201call credit cards are not counterfeited.\u201d Obasohan, relying on Ninth Circuit case law, argues that <em>coram nobis </em>does not require that he challenge his conviction at the earliest possible opportunity, but only that he provide reasons for not doing so earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">\u201cFederal courts have authority to issue a writ of error coram nobis under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Mills, </em>221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th Cir.2000). We review a district court\u2019s denial of the writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">As defined in \u00a7 1029 at the time of Obasohan\u2019s conviction, a counterfeit access device is \u201cany access device that is counterfeit, fictitious, altered, or forged, or an identifiable component of an access device or a counterfeit access device.\u201d 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>\u00a7 1029(e)(2). Further, an unauthorized access device is \u201cany access device that is lost, stolen, expired, revoked, canceled, or obtained with intent to defraud.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">\u201cThe writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy of last resort available only in compelling circumstances where necessary to achieve justice.\u201d <em>Mills, </em>221 F.3d at 1203. The bar for <em>coram nobis </em>is high and relief may issue only where: (1) \u201cthere is and was no other available avenue of relief,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe error involves a matter of fact of the most fundamental character which has not been put in issue or passed upon and which renders the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u201d <em>Alikhani, </em>200 F.3d at 734 (intei*-nal quotation marks and citation omitted). A district court \u201cmay consider coram nobis petitions only where no other remedy is available and the petitioner presents sound reasons for failing to seek relief earlier.\u201d <em>Mills, </em>221 F.3d at 1204. \u201c[T]he concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmreck, </em>441 U.S. 780, 784, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 2087, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979). In addition, \u201c[a] claim of newly discovered evidence relevant only to the guilt or innocence of the petitioner is not cognizable in a coram nobis proceeding.\u201d <em>Moody v. United States, </em>874 F.2d 1575, 1577 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is a remedy available to vacate a conviction when the petitioner has served his or her sentence and is no longer in custody because \u201cthe results of the conviction may persist.\u201d <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 712 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Peter, </em>we found <em>coram nobis </em>relief to be appropriate. Peter claimed that the facts supporting his guilty plea did not constitute an offense in light of a Supreme Court case decided after his sentence had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 711. We found that \u201cPeter\u2019s innocence of the charged offense appears from the very allegations made in the superseding information, not from the omission of an allegation requisite to liability\u201d and ruled as a consequence that the district court lacked jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea to a \u201cnon-offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">We held in <em>Peter </em>that \u201ca writ of error coram nobis must issue to correct the judgment that the court never had power to enter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716. In so holding, we distinguished claims that a defendant had been charged in an indictment with alleged conduct that was non-criminal\u2014a jurisdictional defect\u2014from claims involving indictments with omissions, such as a missing element, which are not jurisdictional defects. <em>Id. </em>at 714. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), the Supreme Court held that an indictment\u2019s failure to allege an essential element of an offense did not constitute a jurisdictional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Here, Obasoharis failure to investigate and recognize the legal significance of his claims is not a sound reason for failing to seek relief earlier. Therefore, he did not satisfy the requirements for <em>coram nobis </em>relief. Additionally, Obasohan\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction claim is distinguishable from <em>Peter </em>because Obasohan was not charged with a non-offense. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Obasohan\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
