Nov. 30, 2008), <em>aff\u2019g </em>No. A98 920 147 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 30, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">I. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">\u201cWhere the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and merely supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, ... we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Passi v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">We conclude that the agency properly found that Mazariego failed to establish that she suffered past persecution, and has a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of a protected ground. While her brief asserts that she is eligible for relief because she was a victim of gang violence, the agency properly found that she failed to demonstrate that such a group targeted her because of her membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">As the BIA found, membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d requires a \u201ccertain level of social visibility\u201d and the \u201cdefinition of the social group must have particular and well-defined boundaries.\u201d <em>Ucelo-Gomez v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 70, 73 (2d Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). Mazariego alleged that she received a tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>phone call threatening her with death if she did not leave her town, yet she acknowledges that she did not know who made the call or what group the caller represented. Mazariego has not established that any of the harms that allegedly occurred, including the kidnapping and murders of her relatives and the threats against her, were committed by any particular group of persons that are distinguishable as a \u201cgang.\u201d Given her avowed lack of knowledge about the identity of her alleged \u201cpersecutors,\u201d the agency did not err in finding that the victims of such persons do not belong to a group that was socially visible or recognizable as a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA. <em>See id. </em>Because Mazariego failed to establish that the harms she alleged were on account of a protected ground, she cannot prevail on her claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(A), 1208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">II. CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In her brief to this Court, Mazariego has failed to raise any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of her CAT claim. Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, we deem her CAT claim to be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
