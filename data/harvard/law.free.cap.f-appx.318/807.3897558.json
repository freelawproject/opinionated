Reeves appeals his convictions on one count of conspiracy to make false statements in an application for the purchase of firearms, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, seven counts of making false statements in an application for the purchase of firearms, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(1)(A), 2, and four counts of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924(a)(2). The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court committed reversible error when it denied Reeves\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of 14 New Jersey police officers as to them recovery of firearms from crime scenes near his residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion arises when the district court\u2019s decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law, or an improper application of law to fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d is broadly defined. <em>United States v. Glasser, </em>773 F.2d <em>1553, </em>1559 n. 4 (11th Cir.1985). To be relevant, \u201c(1) [t]he evidence must be probative of the proposition it is offered to prove, and (2) the proposition to be proved must be one that is of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>Id. In </em>general, \u201cevidence introduced in a criminal trial should relate only to the specific offense charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Auds-ley, </em>486 F.2d 289, 290 (5th Cir.1973) (per curiam). \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">District courts have broad discretion to admit probative evidence, but their discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 is limited. <em>United States v. Terzado-Madru-ga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1117 (11th Cir.1990). \u201c[T]he application of Rule 403 must be cautious and sparing. Its major function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>is limited to excluding matter of scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Mills, </em>704 F.2d 1553, 1560 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Evidence that some of the firearms in question were recovered at crime scenes in New Jersey shortly after their purchase in Georgia was probative of Reeves\u2019s possession of the firearms and his participation in the conspiracy to acquire and transport them. The evidence also was not so prejudicial, misleading, or du-plicative as to warrant its exclusion under Rule 403. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Reeves\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
