Rochelle, a federal prisoner convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). On appeal, Rochelle argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">A district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). However, there is an exception under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-16\">[When] a defendant ... has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArR\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-17\">Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced by two levels the base offense level for certain crack cocaine cases calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. The amendment became effective on November 1, 2007. <em>Id. </em>The Sentencing Commission listed Amendment 706 in \u00a7 1B1.10(c) on March 3, 2008, thereby making the amendment retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713. However, a movant is not entitled to a resentencing pursuant to Amendment 706 when the provisions of that amendment do not result in a lower base offense level and Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>range. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 986 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>James, </em>the defendant\u2019s base offense level did not change because the conspiracy that included him involved 10 to 15 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 985. Under the amended Guidelines, a defendant accountable for 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine receives a base offense level of 38. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.1(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In addition, sentencing adjustments under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Rather, all \u201coriginal sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous sentencing issues,\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000), and a district court should leave intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing, including drug quantity calculations, when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that the district court correctly declined in a \u00a7 3582 proceeding to re-examine the number of marijuana plants involved in the drug offense). Finally, we recently held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We find no merit to Rochelle\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion. As the record shows, the Presentencing Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) held Rochelle accountable through the conspiracy for 24 kilograms of crack cocaine, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s findings over Rochelle\u2019s drug quantity objections, and Rochelle was given a base offense level of 36 at sentencing for that amount of crack cocaine. Yet pursuant to Amendment 706, Rochelle would now receive a base offense level of 38 because he was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). As a result, Rochelle was not entitled to a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 did not lower his base offense level or Guideline range. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion by sentencing Rochelle based on 24 kilograms of crack cocaine without making individualized findings regarding the drug quantity attributable to him as opposed to the conspiracy as a whole. The PSI and sentencing transcript show that he was sentenced based on a finding that the overall offense involved 24 kilograms of crack cocaine, and that Rochelle was accountable, through the conspiracy, for that entire amount. Although the district court did not specifically make a finding as to Rochelle\u2019s accountability alone, the finding that he was accountable through the conspiracy for 24 kilograms of crack cocaine must remain unchanged in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563. In addition, to the extent that Rochelle nonetheless sought to be resen-tenced under <em>Booker </em>and an advisory Guideline system, we have held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1191, 1192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">In short, Amendment 706 did not lower Rochelle\u2019s base offense level or Guideline range and he was not entitled to a resen-tencing pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rochelle\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
