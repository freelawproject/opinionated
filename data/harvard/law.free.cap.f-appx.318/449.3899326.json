Bryant appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-23\">We conclude that the sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per cu-riam) (review of revocation sentences). First, the 20-month sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum authorized where the offenses underlying Bryant\u2019s supervised release were a Class B felony and a Class C felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (maximum prison term upon revocation of supervised release is 3 years for Class B felony and 2 years for Class C felony). Second, the sentence resulted from the district court\u2019s consideration of relevant policy statements and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (specifying \u00a7 3553(a) factors court should consider in revocation decision); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. (recommended prison term); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>453 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2006) (appellate court reviews revocation sentence to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>whether it is unreasonable in relation to, inter alia, advisory Guidelines range and \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-24\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
