Police later found additional child pornography on Calderon\u2019s home computer. Calderon pleaded guilty to child pornography possession. During his plea colloquy, Calderon verified the truth of a government statement of facts, to the effect that his computer contained \u201cover ten images of young children engaged in sexually explicit conduct,\u201d including \u201cchildren under 12 years of age.\u201d At sentencing, however, Calderon argued that the government only proved he \u201cpossessed\u201d the single image sent to the investigator, because police had located the others only in the computer\u2019s difficult-to-access \u201ccache\u201d memory, where the computer had saved them as part of its automatic background processes. Calderon therefore objected to enhancements, of two levels each, for possessing 10\u2014149 images of child pornography, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(A), and possessing an image of child pornography depicting a child under age twelve, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2). The district court applied both enhancements. Calderon received a 46 month sentence, which he now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and applies clear error review to findings of fact made in connection with sentencing. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). Calderon does not dispute that the district court\u2019s decisions to apply upward adjustments under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 are subject to clear error review. A factual finding is not clearly erroneous unless the court has a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). A finding cannot be clearly erroneous if it is \u201cplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety\u201d or constitutes one of multiple \u201cpermissible views of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504. A district court makes factual findings at sentencing based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Calderon argues that the government did not show by a preponderance of the evidence that he possessed ten or more images of child pornography, or that he possessed an image of a child under twelve. He argues that the images found on his computer appeared in cache memory, which he claims he did not know how to directly access. He analogizes his case to <em>United States v. Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d 853 (9th Cir.2006), where the Ninth Circuit held that evidence of child pornography images in a type of cache memory was inadequate to prove the defendant individually possessed those images. We need not decide whether we agree with the statutory interpretation in <em>Kuchinski, </em>or whether the cache memory and other technical facts discussed in that case are analogous to this one, because there is ample evidence in this record to support the district court\u2019s determination that Calderon possessed the requisite images. This includes the statement of facts Calderon verified during the plea colloquy, evidence that Calderon has a long-term history with child pornography, Calderon\u2019s activity procuring child pornography in the \u201cpreteen\u201d chat room, and Calderon\u2019s lack of alternate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>explanations for the presence of the images found on his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">During the plea colloquy, Calderon personally verified under oath that the government\u2019s statement of facts was true and correct, except as to one ambiguous phrase to which his counsel objected. The statement of facts, with the objected-to language omitted by ellipses, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfI\">On July 12th, 2005, in the Southern District of Texas, the Defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed a material, namely a computer hard drive which contained an image of child pornography that had been mailed, shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce by any means, including by computer. During an undercover sting operation based out of Dallas, Texas, the Defendant entered into a chat room and corresponded with an undercover officer. The conversation turned sexual in nature involving children. Various Internet correspondence took place between the undercover officer and the Defendant with the Defendant sending a picture of an unknown naked child to the undercover officer. By obtaining information from [America Online], via Grand Jury subpoena, the undercover officer was able to determine the Defendant\u2019s address, which resided [sic] in Mission, Texas. A search warrant was obtained and executed for the Defendant\u2019s residence in Mission, Texas. Forensics examination of the computer ... seized revealed over ten images of young children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The images included children under 12 years of age. There are known victims in the images. Post-Miranda, the Defendant admitted that he possessed ten to 20 images of naked, young girls on his computer. The use of the Internet through phone lines affected foreign and interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In summary, the verified statement of facts establishes that (1) Calderon is guilty of possessing child pornography, (2) forensic examination of Calderon\u2019s computer \u201crevealed over ten images of young children engaged in sexually explicit conduct ... inelud[ing] children under 12 years of age\u201d and (3) \u201cPost-Miranda, the Defendant admitted that he possessed ten to 20 images of naked, young girls on his computer.\u201d These admissions are adequate to show that Calderon knowingly possessed ten or more images of child pornography. Calderon quibbles that his admission to possessing images of naked young girls \u201cdoes not constitute an acknowledgment that the images were of child pornography,\u201d because according to a dictionary, \u201cgirl\u201d can mean, e.g., \u201ca single or married woman of any age.\u201d This argument ignores both the modifier \u201cyoung\u201d and the context of the statement in a plea admitting guilt to the possession of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The verified statement of facts also provides evidence to support the conclusion that Calderon knowingly possessed an image of a child under twelve. The most straight forward interpretation of the statement of facts is that the \u201cten to 20\u201d images Calderon admits he possessed are the same as the \u201cover ten images of young children ... including] children under 12 years of age\u201d discussed two sentences earlier. In any case, this is a plausible interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Further evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusions. Calderon told police he had a long history with child pornography, and more specifically that he exchanged images by e-mail on his computer. As to the image of a young child, Calderon was caught exchanging child pornography in a \u201cpreteen\u201d chat room. He has not claimed that any image found on his computer got there by a means other than Calderon himself putting it there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The forensic evidence of cache memory contents merely complements all this evidence. Altogether it is \u201cplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety\u201d that Calderon knowingly possessed more than ten child pornography images, including at least one of a child under twelve.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not err at sentencing. The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-19\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">. The complete sentence read: \"Forensics examination of the computer and computer disks seized revealed over ten images of young children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\" Calderon\u2019s objected to the phrase \"and computer disks\u201d because it could suggest removable or external disks as opposed to the internal hard drive of the computer. The images at issue were found on the hard drive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. Calderon does argue that the government failed to rule out other possible explanations for the existence of child pornography in his computer's cache memory, but he cannot prevail on a sentencing appeal by putting the government to its proof. He pled guilty and admitted the key facts informing his sentence. The sentence stands unless Calderon shows that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">. All of this evidence supports the district court's ultimate finding that Calderon possessed more than ten images, including an image of a child under twelve. In addition, the district court acknowledged and relied on many of these specific facts, as well as others, in reaching its rulings. It placed particular emphasis on Calderon's admissions under oath in the statement of facts, the \u201cprurient interest\u201d evident in Calderon's on-line conversation with the undercover officer, and the existence, apart from the local police sting that led to this conviction, of FBI investigations identifying Calderon as a recipient of other, similar images. The district court's findings on subsidiary facts are of course entitled to the same deferential review we apply to the ultimate rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
