At sentencing, Moon requested a downward variance from his advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) range of 63 to 78 months. Moon argued a downward variance was warranted under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors based on Moon\u2019s prolonged emotional problems, low intelligence level, inadequate upbringing, limited education, young age at the time the crime was committed (18), and heavy influence of his brother in the commission of the robbery. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> declined to depart from Moon\u2019s advisory Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>range and sentenced Moon to the bottom of the range, 63 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Moon now asserts the district court committed procedural error during sentencing. Moon contends the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors which favored a downward variance because the district court did not address each of Moon\u2019s arguments for a variance and misconstrued Moon\u2019s argument regarding mental capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">At sentencing, Moon did not object to any procedural error by the district court. Moon thus forfeited any alleged procedural error, and we will review his claim only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>552 F.3d 686, 690 (8th Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>519 F.3d 802, 804 (8th Cir.2008), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 998, 173 L.Ed.2d 297 (2009)). \u201c \u2018Under plain error review, the defendant must show: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Vaughn, </em>519 F.3d at 804). If a defendant makes a plain error showing, we \u201cmay exercise our discretion to correct a forfeited error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Vaughn, </em>519 F.3d at 804) (internal marks omitted). <em>See also Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); <em>United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 549-50 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u201cA district court commits procedural error if it fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but the court need not recite all of the factors on the record, and it is not required to make a specific rejoinder to each argument advanced by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Barron, </em>557 F.3d 866, 868 (8th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n determining whether the district court considered the relevant [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors in a particular case, \u2018the context for the appellate court\u2019s review is the entire sentencing record, not merely the district court\u2019s statements at the hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gray, </em>533 F.3d 942, 944 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>526 F.3d 1107, 1111 (8th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">We are convinced the district court did not commit procedural error. The district court thoroughly reviewed the undisputed PSR and correctly calculated Moon\u2019s Guidelines range. The district court also listened to arguments by Moon\u2019s counsel and by the government, and was aware of Moon\u2019s position seeking a variance. The district court responded to Moon\u2019s arguments by noting Moon was on probation at the time of the robbery and had an escalating criminal history at a young age, which discredited Moon\u2019s mental capacity argument. The district court then explained a long prison sentence would not resolve Moon\u2019s problems, and imposed a sentence at the bottom of Moon\u2019s Guidelines range \u201cpursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 as well as the considerations of 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d Although the district court did not specifically address each of Moon\u2019s arguments, the district court was not required to do so. <em>See Barron, </em>557 F.3d at 868. Based on the record before us, we are persuaded the district court was aware of its authority to vary downward, and understood Moon\u2019s arguments for a variance. <em>Cf. United States v. Orozco-Rodriguez, </em>220 F.3d 940, 942 (8th Cir.2000) (affirming a denial of a request for downward departure because \u201cwe have consistently held that the district court\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to depart downward is unreviewable so long as the court was aware of its authority to depart\u201d). The district court properly considered Moon\u2019s contentions within the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and decided a sentence within Moon\u2019s Guidelines range was warranted. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>does not constitute error, and clearly does not rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-17\">.
