HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">In October 2006, Nationwide Agribusiness Insurance Company, the insurer of plaintiff Consolidated Grain &amp; Barge Company (CGB), filed this subrogation action under CGB\u2019s name in Oklahoma state court, alleging that one of CGB\u2019s facilities in Arkansas was damaged by a November 2003 fire that was caused by negligent work substantially completed there in June 2000 by defendant Structural Systems, Inc. (SSI). After SSI removed the case to federal court, the district court granted summary judgment to SSI, ruling that the suit was barred by Arkansas\u2019s five-year statute of repose, Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-56-112(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-16\">CGB appealed, arguing that Oklahoma\u2019s common-law choice of law rules were abrogated by Oklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, \u00a7 105, and that, under the borrowing statute, the applicable statute of repose was Oklahoma\u2019s ten-year statute of repose, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 109, making this suit timely. We certified to the Oklahoma Supreme Court \u25a0 the question of whether Oklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 105, should be interpreted to include Oklahoma\u2019s substantive statute of repose, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 109. Based on that court\u2019s answer that it should not, we lift the abatement of the appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-18\">CGB, a Missouri corporation, operated a grain terminal in Van Bur\u00e9n, Arkansas. Following a fire at that facility, CGB entered into a written contract in Arkansas with SSI, an Arkansas corporation, to reconstruct and repair parts of the grain conveyor system. SSI substantially completed the work in June 2000 and completed the final call back in September 2000. Another fire occurred at CGB\u2019s facility in November 2003. CGB asserted that grain dust ignited from the heat generated from a failed bearing improperly installed by SSI, and that the fire caused approximately $800,000 in damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Nationwide Agribusiness, through CGB, filed its first subrogation action against SSI in an Arkansas state court in October 2005. CGB voluntarily dismissed that suit, however, after SSI filed a motion to dismiss based on Arkansas\u2019s five-year statute of repose, which bars an action in contract for damages caused by the deficient construction or repair of any improvement to real property brought \u201cmore than five (5) years after substantial completion of the work.\u201d Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-56-112(a). In October 2006, Nationwide Agribusiness, through CGB, filed this subrogation action in state court in Oklahoma, which has a ten-year statute of repose for tort claims arising from \u201cconstruction of an improvement to real property,\u201d Okla. Stat. tit. 12, \u00a7 109, and a borrowing statute stating that \u201c[t]he period of limitation applicable to a claim accruing outside of this state shall be that prescribed either by the law of the place where the claim accrued or by the law of this state, whichever <em>last </em>bars the claim[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 105 (emphasis added). SSI removed the case based on diversity jurisdiction to federal court, and the district court denied SSI\u2019s subsequent motion to dismiss or transfer venue. SSI then moved for summary judgment, arguing that Oklahoma\u2019s choice-of-law rules called for the application of Arkansas\u2019s substantive law, including its five-year statute of repose. CGB argued that Oklahoma\u2019s ten-year statute of repose applied under Oklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute. The district court ruled that Oklahoma\u2019s choice-of-law rules required it to apply Arkansas\u2019s substantive law; that Oklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute applies to procedural law, not substantive law; and that because statutes of repose are substantive, Arkansas\u2019s statute of repose applied to bar CGB\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">We certified to the Oklahoma Supreme Court the following question: Should \u201cperiod of limitation\u201d in Okla. Stat. tit. 12, \u00a7 105 be interpreted to include statutes of repose, including Oklahoma\u2019s statute of repose for construction tort claims, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 109? The Oklahoma Supreme Court recently answered that question in the negative in <em>Consolidated Grain &amp; Barge Co. v. Structural Systems, Inc., </em>No. 105918, \u2014 P.2d-, 2009 WL 582390 (Okla; Mar.3, 2009). The court\u2019s analysis of Oklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute is lengthy and detailed, and the court\u2019s holding is clear. The court reasoned that \u201cOklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute, <em>12 O.S.2001, \u00a7 105, </em>is a procedural law that applies to time periods that operate upon the remedy\u201d that may be available under state law, <em>Consolidated Grain &amp; Barge, </em>\u2014 P.2d at-, 2009 WL 532390, at *7, and the borrowing statute \u201cdoes not relate to substantive statutes of repose[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>\u2014\u2014 P.2d at-, 2009 WL 532390 at *6, that is, to a party\u2019s \u201csubstantive rights to actions for damages!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">[w]hen CGB\u2019s insurer filed this subrogation action in the Oklahoma district court on October 28, 2006, CGB\u2019s right to a damages action under Arkansas [substantive] law had been extinguished for more than a year and CGB no longer had a claim under Arkansas law. Oklahoma\u2019s procedural borrowing statute, <em>12 O.S.2001, \u00a7 105, </em>may not be construed to resurrect a foreign claim that has been extinguished by substantive law. The phrase \u201cperiod of limitation\u201d in Oklahoma\u2019s procedural borrowing statute, <em>12 O.S.2001, \u00a7 105, </em>may not be construed to include Oklahoma\u2019s substantive ten-year limitation on construction torts, <em>12 O.S.2001, \u00a7 109.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-15\"><em>Consolidated Grain &amp; Barge, </em>\u2014 P.2d at -, 2009 WL 532390, at *7 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>The parties did not discuss, and we need not decide, whether the reconstruction and repair work done by SSI on CGB\u2019s facility was \u201cconstruction of an improvement to real property\u201d within the meaning of Oklahoma\u2019s statute of repose, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, \u00a7 109. CGB raised only one issue on appeal: whether Oklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute applies to statutes of repose. Based on the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s answer to the certified question, Oklahoma\u2019s borrowing statute, <em>id,., </em>\u00a7 105, cannot, in any event, be interpreted to include Oklahoma\u2019s substantive statute of repose, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 109. As noted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, CGB\u2019s cause of action against SSI had already been extinguished by Arkansas\u2019s five-year statute of repose when CGB filed this suit in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The abatement is lifted. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
