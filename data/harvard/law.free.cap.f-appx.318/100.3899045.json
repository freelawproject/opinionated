We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, we recount only those facts essential to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">In 2003 Boatwright pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count I), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count II). The presentence report calculated Boatwright\u2019s total offense level for Count I to be 19 after deducting three points for acceptance of responsibility. When combined with a criminal history category of IV, Boat-wright\u2019s imprisonment range under the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines was 46 to 57 months. On the firearm offense, Boatwright faced a statutory mandatory minimum of five years imprisonment, which had to be imposed consecutively to the drug count. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(I). The District Court sentenced Boatwright to 84 months, which was comprised of 24 months for the drug offense (a 48% reduction from the bottom of the Guidelines range), plus 60 months for the gun offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">In March 2008, Boatwright filed a motion seeking a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, based on Amendment 706, which amended the Guidelines for crack cocaine offenses by retroactively ordering a two-level reduction in the offense level.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As \u00a7 1B1.10 of the Guidelines states: a court \u201cmay reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment\u201d when \u201cthe guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines manual listed in subsection (c) below.\u201d Amendment 706 is listed in subsection (c); nevertheless, \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) plainly states that \u201cif the original term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline sentence determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a further reduction generally would not be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">Boatwright argues that his original sentence was a Guidelines sentence because Judge Caldwell stated that he was using the Guidelines \u201cas a measure,\u201d but noted that he was \u201cgoing to vary that somewhat.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u25a0 Contrary to Boatwright\u2019s argument, the language he cites shows that the District Court was not relying on the Guidelines in imposing the sentence. Although <em>Booker </em>had not been decided when Boatwright was sentenced, Judge Caldwell presciently anticipated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>and declined to impose a Guidelines sentence, correctly predicting that \u201cthe <em>Blakely </em>decision will be extended to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d Dist. Ct. Op. at 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, Judge Caldwell noted that if he had been required to apply a Guidelines sentence, he would have imposed a sentence of 46 months for the drug offense, and 60 months for the firearm offense, for a total of 106 months imprisonment. Taken together, these statements demonstrate that the District Court did not adhere to the Guidelines in imposing its sentence. Thus, under \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B), a sentencing reduction would not be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Boatwright next argues that the District Court improperly interpreted. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) to deprive it of the power to further reduce Boatwright\u2019s non-Guidelines sentence. Boatwright argues that \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) is merely an advisory policy statement, and to hold otherwise would violate <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Our review of the record leads us to the opposite conclusion. Judge Caldwell did not believe that \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) removed his discretion to reduce Boatwright\u2019s sentence, because he stated: \u201cWe decline to grant a further reduction.\u201d Dist. Ct. Op. at 6. The District Court noted that \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) \u201cadvises that if the original sentence was a non-guideline one ... further reduction \u2018generally\u2019 is not appropriate.\u201d Again, the record shows that the District Court understood that \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) was advisory, and that it chose not to reduce further Boatwright\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-14\">. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant can seek the benefit of an amendment by a motion to modify his sentence. The United States Sentencing Commission has authority to amend the guidelines, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), and to provide that any amendment has retroactive effect. \u00a7 994(u).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">.

Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), which involved a state criminal statute, the Supreme Court held that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
