Johnston<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Companion Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cCompanion\u201d). Following a trial, the jury returned a verdict against Companion and in favor of Johnston, awarding $117,551.30 for breach of contract, plus a bad faith penalty and attorney\u2019s fees. The district court vacated the award of a bad faith penalty and attorney\u2019s fees, but left undisturbed the jury\u2019s verdict and award for breach of contract. Companion appeals the breach of contract verdict, arguing that the district court gave an improper jury instruction, the insurance policy did not cover the roof collapse, and damages were not adequately proven. Johnston cross-appeals, arguing that the district court erred in vacating the bad faith penalty and attorney\u2019s fees. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">The insured property at issue in this appeal is a flat-roofed commercial building located in College Park, Georgia, that houses offices, a laundromat, and a warehouse. The warehouse portion of the building is seventy-nine feet long and contains a small staircase leading to a twenty-four-foot long mezzanine. The mezzanine is located in the front portion of the warehouse and is used for storing boxes of documents. Following a period of heavy rain, on June 15, 2004, Johnston\u2019s son discovered that a portion of the warehouse\u2019s roof had collapsed. At the time of the collapse, the building was insured with Companion. The insurance policy states, in relevant portion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-15\">We will pay for direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property, caused by collapse of a building or any part of a building ... if the collapse is caused by one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-16\">b. Decay that is hidden from view, unless the presence of such decay is known to an insured prior to the collapse ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-17\">Johnston filed an insurance claim with Companion and retained a contractor, Sherman Neal Brown, to evaluate the damage and suggest repairs. Brown recommended that temporary repairs be conducted to prevent further damage to the warehouse\u2019s structure and contents. At Johnston\u2019s request, Brown made $20,619 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>temporary repairs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Johnston submitted a copy of the invoice for these repairs to Companion.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Companion retained an engineer, David Hildebrand, who examined the warehouse, took pictures of the damage, spoke with Brown, and reported his findings to Companion. Based on Hildebrand\u2019s investigation, Companion sent a letter to Johnston on September 1, 2004, denying the entire claim on the grounds that the collapse was not covered under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Johnston sent a demand letter on November 30, 2004, indicating that if Companion did not pay for all necessary repairs within sixty days, he would bring suit seeking damages under the contract, as well as a bad faith penalty and attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Companion did not respond and the instant suit was filed in Georgia state court on April 12, 2006. Companion thereafter removed the action to federal court based on diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The case was tried before a jury in September 2007. Four witnesses testified: (1) Richard Johnston, plaintiff; (2) Neal Brown, plaintiffs contractor; (3) Robert Clein, plaintiffs expert; and (4) David Hildebrand, defendant\u2019s expert. The witnesses agreed that the damage to the warehouse was caused by a collapse and that the collapse was at least partially the result of decay to the warehouse\u2019s roof trusses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 primary dispute was whether the decay to the roof trusses was \u201chidden from view.\u201d If the decay that caused the collapse was not \u201chidden from view,\u201d Johnston was precluded from recovering under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">At the close of Johnston\u2019s case, Companion moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that Johnston failed to prove: (1) that the decay was \u201chidden from view\u201d; (2) his damages; and (3) that Companion acted in bad faith. This motion was denied. At the close of the defense, Companion brought a motion for judgment as a matter of law on all three grounds, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">The jury returned a verdict in Johnston\u2019s favor on September 12, 2007, awarding $117,551.30 for breach of contract, $11,755 as a bad faith penalty, and $40,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. Companion thereafter renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the same three grounds as before, as well on the ground that the district court erred by charging the jury on ambiguity and contract construction. Companion argued that, in the alternative, it was entitled to a new trial on those grounds. On January 30, 2008, the district court entered an order granting Companion\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith claim, vacating the jury verdicts as to both the bad faith penalty and. attorney\u2019s fees. The district court denied the motions for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law on the breach of contract claim. Both parties now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">\n<em>A. Jury charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">Companion argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the district court com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>mitted reversible error by instructing the jury on ambiguity and principles of contract construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">\n<em>1. Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Bianchi v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1278, 1282 (11th Cir.2006). We review jury instructions to determine \u201cwhether the jury charges, considered as a whole, sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled. If jury instructions accurately reflect the law, the trial judge is given wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in the instruction.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers, Inc., </em>437 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir.2006) (citations and quotations omitted). We will only grant a new trial based on inadequate jury instructions in eases in which \u201cthe instructions did not accurately reflect the law in such a way that we are left with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1196 (11th Cir.2004) (citation and quotations omitted). This court reviews the jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the detriment of the objecting party. <em>Tran v. Toyota Motor Corp., 420 </em>F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.2005). Jury instructions must, however, be considered as a whole and are subject to harmless error analysis. <em>Cistola v. Daniel, </em>266 Ga.App. 891, 598 S.E.2d 535, 540 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">\n<em>2. Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Companion argues that the district court improperly charged the jury by giving the following jury instructions; (1) the ambiguity charge\u2014\u201c[t]he plaintiff contends that the language, hidden from view, ... is ambiguous ... \u201d; and (2) the contract construction charge\u2014\u201c[ijnsurance policies are to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurance company where the policy language is ambiguous and the insurer has been the drafter of the contract.\u201d Companion argues that under Georgia law, a court should not charge a jury on principles of ambiguity and contract construction unless the court has already found that a contractual term is ambiguous. Companion argues that because the district court made no such finding, it erred by instructing the jury on how to interpret ambiguous contractual terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">\u201cThe construction of a contract is a question of law for the court. Where any matter of fact is involved, the jury should find the fact.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-2-1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Where a contract is unambiguous, it is \u201cimproper for the court to give the jury any instruction with regard to the manner in which the contract should be construed.\u201d <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Thrift-Mart, Inc., 159 </em>Ga.App. 874, 285 S.E.2d 566, 571 (1981) (quotations and citation omitted). Georgia law requires that before submitting a contract construction charge to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>jury, the trial court should conduct the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">First, if no ambiguity appears, the trial court enforces the contract according to its terms irrespective of all technical or arbitrary rules of construction. Thus, where the terms of the contract are clear and unambiguous, the court looks only to the contract to find the parties\u2019 intent. Second, if the potential for ambiguity appears, the existence or nonexistence of an ambiguity is itself a question of law for the court, unless an ambiguity remains even after the court has applied the pertinent rules of contract construction. Finally, issues of contract construction will be submitted to the jury only when there appears to be an ambiguity in the contract which cannot be resolved by the court\u2019s application of the statutory rules of construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\"><em>Ga. Ass\u2019n of Educators, Inc. v. Paragon Prod., Inc., </em>238 Ga.App. 681, 520 S.E.2d 37, 39 (1999). Failure to properly apply this test can constitute reversible error. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Blakey, </em>255 Ga. 699, 342 S.E.2d 308 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The district court did not find an ambiguity- in the contract, as required under step one of the test enunciated in <em>Georgia Association of Educators. </em>In fact, during the charge conference the district court expressly stated that \u201chidden from view,\u201d as used in the contract, \u201cisn\u2019t ambiguous to me.\u201d It was therefore improper for the district court to instruct the jury on how to interpret an ambiguous contractual term.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">This error, however, is harmless when construed in light of the charge as a whole. Shortly after the ambiguity and contract construction charges, the district court told the jury that decay is not \u201chidden from view\u201d if it is \u201cexposed and open to plain sight.\u201d The court further explained that simple \u201cfailure of an insured to observe decay\u201d does not render otherwise exposed decay \u201chidden from view.\u201d Because the court defined \u201chidden from view,\u201d the jury would have understood that despite the previous contract construction charge, it was not authorized to apply its own meaning to this term. Given this charge, the jury could not have believed that it was authorized to alter the interpretation of this term. The errors in the jury charge are therefore harmless in light of subsequent portions of the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Because the errors in the charge were harmless, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for a new trial based on the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">\n<em>B. Breach of contract claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Companion argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative a new trial, on the breach of contract claim because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict and damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">\n<em>1. Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1275 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWe will reverse only if the facts and inferences point overwhelmingly in favor of one party, such that reasonable people could not arrive at a contrary verdict. We consider all the evidence, and the inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>\n<em>2. \u201cHidden from view\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Companion concedes that Johnston was subjectively unaware of the decay, but argues that all of the witnesses, including Johnston and his expert, acknowledged that the decay was apparent and visible from inside the warehouse. Companion argues that if Johnston \u201ctook the time to look,\u201d he would have seen the decay. As such, it contends that Johnston failed to prove that the decay on the building was \u201chidden from view,\u201d as required for coverage under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Under Georgia law, \u201c[wjords in an insurance contract must be given their usual, ordinary, and common meaning.\u201d <em>Bold Corp., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>216 Ga.App. 382, 454 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1995). In its ordinary usage, something is considered \u201chidden\u201d if it is \u201cout of sight.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1065 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the decay was \u201chidden from view.\u201d The evidence presented at trial established that the warehouse was dimly lit, containing only a few fluorescent fixtures. The decayed roof trusses were located approximately sixteen,feet above the warehouse\u2019s floor. Johnston, Brown, and Clein all testified that when standing underneath the mezzanine, view of the decayed trusses was obscured by a beam and boxes stacked on top of the mezzanine. Companion\u2019s expert, Hildebrand, agreed that \u201c[ijf one were standing underneath the mezzanine, you could not see the decay on the roof structure.\u201d The witnesses only viewed the decayed trusses after the collapse. The witnesses therefore could not speak definitively as to how apparent the decay was prior to the collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Companion has not met the weighty burden of showing that \u201creasonable people could not arrive at a contrary verdict.\u201d <em>Goldsmith, </em>513 F.3d at 1275. A reasonable jury could have found that the poor lighting, the beam, and the boxes stacked on the mezzanine rendered the decay \u201cout of sight,\u201d and thus \u201chidden from view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in denying the motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial on the grounds that the decay was not \u201chidden from view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">\n<em>3. Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">The jury awarded Johnston a total of $117,551.30 on the breach of contract claim, which encompassed both the actual cost of temporary repairs and the estimated cost of future repairs. Companion does not challenge the award of $20,619 for the temporary repairs conducted by Brown, but argues that the jury was not provided with sufficient evidence from which it could assess the cost of future repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"AO1\">At trial, Johnston presented Brown\u2019s February 2006 estimate for permanent repairs, which totaled $96,982.30. Brown testified that the estimate was accurate when given, but admitted that those figures had become outdated and that the present cost of repair was likely higher. Companion argues that because this figure was outdated and no other witnesses testified as to the present cost of repairs, the jury should not have been permitted to include the cost of permanent repairs in its jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that damages cannot be left to speculation, conjecture, or guesswork and must be proven with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Kroger Co. v. U.S. Foodservice of Atlanta, Inc., </em>270 Ga.App. 525, 607 S.E.2d 177, 181 (2004). When considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>the costs of repair, the plaintiff is only-entitled to those expenses \u201cwhich would have been incurred had the repairs been undertaken upon the discovery of the damage .:. not the cost of repairs as incurred [at a later date.]\u201d <em>Getz Services, Inc. v. Perloe, </em>173 Ga.App. 532, 327 S.E.2d 761, 765 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Companion\u2019s argument is flawed because the award should be based on the cost of repairs at the time of discovery of the damage. It is of no consequence that the actual cost of repair may have changed by the time of trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury\u2019s verdict did not exceed Brown\u2019s estimate. We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in finding the jury\u2019s award of damages was supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">\n<em>C. Bad faith penalty and attorney\u2019s fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Johnston cross-appeals, arguing that the district court erred in granting Companion\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith verdict. In the alternative, Johnston argues that even if judgment as a matter of law was appropriate, the district court erred in vacating the attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">\n<em>1. Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. Rossbach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1356 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">\n<em>2. Bad faith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Johnston argues that the district court erred in vacating the award of a bad faith penalty. He asserts that Companion\u2019s initial denial of his claim was in bad faith because the damage to the warehouse was clearly within the parameters of the policy, Companion failed to investigate the claim in a timely manner, Companion implied to Johnston and Brown that the damage would be covered under the policy, and that in reliance on Companion\u2019s implication that the damages would be covered, Brown engaged in temporary repairs that resulted in spoliation of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">Most of the facts that Johnston points to are irrelevant to proving a claim for bad faith failure to pay. Under Georgia law, a court may impose a bad faith penalty against an insurer and require it to pay the insured\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in the following situation:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-15\">In the event of a loss which is covered by a policy of insurance and the refusal of the insurer to pay the same within 60 days after a demand has been made by the holder of the policy and a finding has been made that such refusal was in bad faith, the insurer shall be liable to pay such holder, in addition to the loss, not more than 50 percent of the liability of the insurer for the loss ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6. \u201cTo prevail on a claim for an insurer\u2019s bad faith under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6, the insured must prove: (1) that the claim is covered under the policy, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>that a demand for payment was made against the insurer within 60 days prior to filing suit, and (3) that the insurer\u2019s failure to pay was motivated by bad faith.\u201d <em>Lavoi Corp., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. of Hartford, </em>293 Ga.App. 142, 666 S.E.2d 387, 391 (2008). These requirements are strictly construed. <em>BayRock Mortgage Corp. v. Chi. Title Ins. Co., </em>286 Ga.App. 18, 648 S.E.2d 433, 435 (2007). \u201cThe insured bears the burden of proving bad faith, which is defined as any frivolous and unfounded refusal in law or in fact to comply with the demand of the policyholder to pay according to the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Ga. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Williams, </em>266 Ga.App. 540, 597 S.E.2d 430, 432 (2004). A penalty for bad faith is not permissible \u201cwhere the insurance company has any reasonable ground to contest the claim and where there is a disputed question of fact.\u201d <em>S. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Nw. Ga. Bank, </em>209 Ga.App. 867, 434 S.E.2d 729, 730 (1993) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In the present case, the first two elements of a \u00a7 33-4-6 bad faith claim were satisfied because the jury found that the insurance claim was covered under the policy and it is undisputed that Johnston sent a demand, to which Companion did not respond within 60 days. We agree with the district court, however, that Johnston failed to prove the third element of a bad faith claim. Companion had a legitimate, although ultimately unsuccessful, challenge to Johnston\u2019s claim. Johnston argues that he was deceived by Companion as to the purpose of its investigation, but he does not allege that Companion\u2019s subsequent denial of payment was done in bad faith, as required for a bad faith claim under Georgia law. <em>See Ga. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>597 S.E.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">We conclude that the evidence does not support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Companion engaged in a bad faith failure to pay. Although the jury ultimately found that the decay was not \u201chidden from view,\u201d Companion\u2019s theory at trial was not so unreasonable as to be considered \u201cfrivolous and unfounded.\u201d Because Companion\u2019s reason for denying coverage was not so unbelievable as to sink below the minimal threshold of <em>\u201cany </em>reasonable ground to contest the claim,\u201d <em>S. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>434 S.E.2d at 730 (emphasis added), the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\n<em>3. Attorney\u2019s fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Having concluded that the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith penalty, Johnston may not collect attorney\u2019s fees under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6 because that statute only applies to cases in which the insurer acted in bad faith. Johnston argues, however, that he was also entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11 allows the jury to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwhere the plaintiff has specially pleaded and has made prayer therefor and where the defendant has acted in bad faith, has been stubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense.\u201d Georgia courts have explicitly stated that in cases where a plaintiff alleges that an insurer engaged in bad faith by refusing to pay a claim, an action \u201cfor attorney fees and expenses of litigation under OCGA \u00a7 13-6-11 is not authorized.\u201d <em>Howell v. Southern Heritage Ins. Co., </em>214 Ga.App. 536, 448 S.E.2d 275, 276 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Johnston is precluded under Georgia law from availing himself of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11 because \u201c[t]he penalties contained in OCGA \u00a7 33^4-6 are the exclusive remedies for an insurer\u2019s bad faith refusal to pay insurance proceeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>court therefore did not err in vacating the jury\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">For the reasons set forth, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-10\">.

In any event, the standard of review is immaterial because even if we were to review the contract construction charge <em>de novo, </em>we would still conclude that the district court did not commit error that warrants reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b888-13\">. In the instant case, subject matter jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, so state substantive law applies. <em>See McMahan v.

We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Bianchi, </em>441 F.3d at 1282. We need not separately review this issue under the more lenient standard because we conclude that there is sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>evidence to support the jury's verdict under the more stringent <em>de novo </em>standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">. The collapse occurred in 2004, but Brown did not prepare an estimate for permanent repairs until 2006. Companion, however, has not argued that the 2006 estimate inaccurately reflects the 2004 cost of repairs. We therefore will not consider this issue. <em>See Doe v. Dekalb County Sch. Dist., </em>145 F.3d 1441, 1445 n. 4 (11th Cir.1998) (issues not raised in a party\u2019s brief are considered abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b891-17\">. Johnston argues that Companion engaged in what he refers to as both \"normal\u201d and \"abnormal\u201d bad faith. \"Abnormal\u201d bad faith is a creature of Alabama caselaw, <em>see In re Simmons v. Cong. Life Ins. Co. &amp; Insurers Admin. Corp., </em>791 So.2d 371, 379 (Ala.2000), and has not been recognized by any Georgia courts. We therefore will only examine the facts in light of what Johnston refers to as \u201cnormal\u201d bad faith, which is recognized under Georgia law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
