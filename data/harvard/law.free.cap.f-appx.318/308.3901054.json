The district court sentenced Dartez to 120 months of imprisonment, which was the statutory maximum term and above the range advised by the United States Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, he contends that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court gave too much weight to Sentencing Guideline factors favoring punishment and not enough weight to the factors counseling mitigation of the sentence. He also contends that the district court improperly weighed his disputing the number of pornographic images that he was charged with possessing. He asserts that the district court mistakenly believed that he was attempting to minimize the seriousness of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>When the issue is properly preserved for appeal, we examine whether the sentence resulted from an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). This review for reasonableness is a two-part process. <em>United States v. Rowan, </em>530 F.3d 379, 381 (5th Cir.2008). The appellate court first ensures that the district court did not commit a significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is procedurally sound, the appellate court then considers its \u201csubstantive reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The Government contends these review standards do not apply because Dartez did not make a contemporaneous objection to the sentence imposed. If that is so, our review would be for plain error. It is not necessary to determine the sufficiency of Dartez\u2019s 'objection at his sentencing hearing because he has failed to show that his sentence is infirm even under an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Dartez\u2019s first argument is that the district court\u2019s determination about the number of images was the type of clearly erroneous fact-finding that amounts to procedural error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, Dartez offered no evidence in rebuttal to the Government\u2019s witness. There is thus nothing to show that the district court\u2019s factual finding was erroneous. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Nevertheless, Dartez also argues that his persistence in his objection to the number of images itself became a factor that the district court improperly considered when imposing sentence. A non-Guidelines sentence may be found unreasonable if, among other reasons, it assigns too much weight to an improper factor. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). Dartez claims that he got a harsher sentence in part because his counsel\u2019s dispute about the number of images was found to be an irritating quibble. However, nothing in the record supports that the court chose Dartez\u2019s sentence because of a dispute being made about the number of images.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The actual reasons articulated by the sentencing judge for the sentence included that Dartez\u2019s materials were graphic and featured young children. In the district court\u2019s view, Dartez\u2019s act of collecting the pornography meant that he encouraged the kind of abuse that was depicted. The court labeled Dartez\u2019s actions as sexual exploitation and abuse of children. Also considered was Dartez\u2019s history of being sexually abused as a child. One stated purpose for the sentence was to make professional treatment available to assist his overcoming what the court labeled as sexual dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The district court summarized its analysis by stating that an upward departure from the Guidelines range was warranted in light of Dartez\u2019s characteristics, the circumstances involving his crime, and his refusal to recognize the full import of his actions. Dartez fails to demonstrate that the district court committed procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Dartez also fails to demonstrate that his sentence was not substantively reasonable. A \u201csentencing court may ... conclude in a particular case that a sentence within the Guidelines range is not lengthy enough to serve the objectives of sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). That is what the district court did in Dartez\u2019s case. Even if an 87-month sentence would have been reasonable, as Dartez suggests, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>is an insufficient reason for not deferring to the district court\u2019s decision to impose the sentence that it selected. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Dartez\u2019s motion to have his counsel relieved and new counsel appointed is DISMISSED as moot. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
