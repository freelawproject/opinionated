We deny Erb\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-29\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-30\">Erb is a native and citizen of Germany. He immigrated to the United States in 1957 at age four. In 1993, Erb pleaded guilty to three counts of gross sexual imposition under Ohio law, for which he served three years and eleven months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In 2004, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which is now part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), issued Erb a Notice to Appear (NTA) before an immigration judge (IJ). The NTA charged Erb with being subject to removal for having \u201cbeen convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(A) of the\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) for \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d J.A. 63. Erb sought a waiver of removal pursuant to former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994). The IJ found Erb ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, and ordered him removed to Germany. The BIA affirmed in a written order. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Erb argues that the BIA erred in finding him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>\u201cde novo, </em>while granting substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the [INA] and the INA\u2019s accompanying regulations.\u201d <em>Koussan v. Holder, </em>556 F.3d 403, 406 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Former INA \u00a7 212(c) \u201cprovided for a discretionary waiver of certain grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a).\u201d <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 724 (BIA 2005). Section 212(a) listed various classes of individuals \u201cwho are ineligible to receive visas and who shall be excluded from admission into the United States[,]\u201d including persons convicted of \u201ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A) (1994). Former \u00a7 212(c) provided, however, that \u201c[a]liens lawfully admitted for permanent resident [sic] who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelin-quished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney Generalf.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">By its terms, former \u00a7 212(c) applied only to aliens seeking <em>readmission </em>to the United States, but \u201c[o]ver the last 30 years ... the BIA and the courts have extended \u00a7 212(c) relief to aliens seeking to avoid <em>removal!]\u201d Thap v. Mukasey, </em>544 F.3d 674, 677 (6th Cir.2008) (emphasis added); <em>but see Abebe v. Mukasey, </em>554 F.3d 1203 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc) (holding that \u00a7 212(c) relief is not available in removal proceedings). But the rule in this circuit, as in most others, is that such aliens are eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief only if their ground of removability has a \u201ccomparable ground of exclusion\u201d\u2014or \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d\u2014in \u00a7 212(a). <em>See Thap, </em>544 F.3d at 679 (collecting cases). In 2004, the BIA codified this statutory-counterpart rule in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In 1996, Congress repealed \u00a7 212(c). <em>See </em>Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-594. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court held in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), that \u201c \u00a7 212(c) relief remains available for aliens [who] ... would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Erb presents several arguments as to why, at the time of his plea, he would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief under the law then in effect. First, Erb argues that the statutory-counterpart rule does not apply to him because he made his plea before we formally recognized that rule in <em>Gjonaj v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 824, 826 (6th Cir.1995). <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r Br. at 11. He argues that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) does not apply to him for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">But we did not announce a new rule in <em>Gjonaj. </em>Rather, we \u201cdecline[d] to change\u201d the <em>\u201cwell-established </em>rule\u201d that \u201cthere must be a comparable ground of exclusion for an alien in deportation to be eligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>section 212(c) relief.\u201d <em>Gjonaj, </em>47 F.3d at 827 (emphasis added). That is a characterization that we must accept for purposes of this appeal. We applied that rule in <em>Gjonaj </em>to a petitioner who had pleaded guilty to his offense in <em>1990, </em>three years before Erb\u2019s guilty plea here. Therefore, we are bound by precedent to apply the statutory-counterpart rule to Erb here. That the BIA did not codify the rule until 2004 in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) is irrelevant. \u201cSection 1212.3(f)(5) is simply the agency\u2019s codification of [a] preexisting, judicially created rule.\u201d <em>Valere v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 757, 761 (7th Cir.2007). And that rule, as shown above, existed when Erb made his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Erb next contends that his ground of removability finds a counterpart in \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude.\u201d He asserts that the conduct that led to his gross-sexual-imposition conviction was \u201cinherently base, vile, or depraved[,]\u201d and thus that it \u201cis very clear that [his] actions involved moral turpitude.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Erb\u2019s argument is again foreclosed by precedent. The \u201cstatutory ground of removal\u201d\u2014and not the \u201cfactual basis of the underlying criminal activity\u201d\u2014must \u201chave a \u2018substantially identical\u2019 counterpart in the statutory grounds for exclusion in order to qualify for section 212(c)[.]\u201d <em>Thap, </em>544 F.3d at 679 (quoting <em>Caroleo v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 158, 168 (3d Cir.2007)). It simply does \u201cnot matter [that Erb\u2019s] actions ... could be considered a crime of moral turpitude <em>as well as </em>an aggravated felony\u201d for sexual abuse of a minor; and \u201cit is beside the point that a different ground of deportation <em>(e.g., </em>the \u2018crimes of moral turpitude\u2019 ground) might have been waived <em>if </em>it also had been invoked against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678-79 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Here, the DHS seeks to deport Erb under INA \u00a7 237 on the ground that he was convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A). That is his statutory ground for removal. There is no \u201csubstantially identical\u201d statutory counterpart to that ground in \u00a7 212(a), since that subsection does not include conviction of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as a ground of inadmissibility. <em>Id.; see also Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 727 (\u201calthough there may be considerable overlap between offenses characterized as sexual abuse of a minor and those considered crimes of moral turpitude, these two categories of offenses are not statutory counterparts\u201d); <em>Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869, 872 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[t]here is no textual link between sexual abuse of a child and crimes involving moral turpitude to indicate that Congress had the same class of offenses in mind when in enacted the two provisions.... Absent this textual link, we cannot extend \u00a7 212(c) relief to cover any crime that common-sense might classify as involving moral turpitude\u201d); <em>So-riano v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 909, 909 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (\u201cthe ground for which [the petitioner] was found removable\u2014the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor\u2014does not have a statutory counterpart in the grounds of admissibility listed in INA \u00a7 212(a)\u201d). Erb is therefore ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Finally, Erb argues that, because we owe no deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 212, we should abandon the statutory-counterpart rule altogether. He argues that the rule creates an asymmetry between aliens seeking readmission, who can seek \u00a7 212(c) waivers on the ground that their offenses involved \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d and aliens facing removal for the same offenses, who cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">But precedent forecloses those arguments as well. We have long recognized the statutory-counterpart rule in precisely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>this form, <em>see Gjonaj, </em>47 F.3d at 827, and recently reaffirmed it on two occasions, <em>see Thap, </em>544 F.3d at 678-79; <em>Koussan, </em>556 F.3d at 408-09. In so doing, we have aligned this circuit with nearly every other circuit that has considered the issue. Our decision here, then, is based not on undue deference to the BIA, but on adherence to our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We therefore deny Erb\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b419-6\">WHITE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Afm\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">I agree that precedent precludes us from granting relief. I observe, however, that there is an unsettling incongruity in refusing to apply \u00a7 212(c) to grounds for removal that would be subject to discretionary waiver under \u00a7 212(c) were the alien seeking readmittance rather than waiver of deportation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
