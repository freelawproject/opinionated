Cui also has filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision on June 6, 2008, denying her \u201cMotion to Reconsider, Motion to Amend, Motion to Consolidate, Motion to Remand, Motion for Sua Sponte En Banc Review, and Motion for Stay of Removal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-26\">Cui argues that the BIA erred by refusing to apply equitable tolling to excuse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>untimeliness of her July 13, 2007 motion to reopen. She contends that equitable tolling should have been applied on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Cui also argues that her Fifth Amendment right to due process was violated because ineffective assistance of counsel has rendered her removal proceedings fundamentally unfair. With respect to her petition for review of the BIA\u2019s June 6, 2008 decision, the arguments in Cui\u2019s brief pertain only to the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration of its December 5, 2007 decision, and Cui has waived any argument challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of her other motions by failing to brief any such arguments. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Cui\u2019s argument that the time limitations period set forth in \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) should have been equitably tolled on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cis in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the proceeding sua sponte based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Ramos-Bonilla, </em>543 F.3d at 220 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decisions denying Cui\u2019s untimely motion to reopen and her motion for reconsideration. <em>See id.; Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 250 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">To the extent that Cui argues that equitable tolling should be applied to protect her due process rights with regard to the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen, her argument is unavailing. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2006) (recognizing that there is no liberty interest at stake in a motion to reopen). To the extent that Cui\u2019s argument concerning due process challenges decisions other than the BIA\u2019s December 5, 2007 decision denying her motion to reopen or the BIA\u2019s June 6, 2008 decision denying her motion for reconsideration, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider to her argument because any such decision is outside the scope of the petitions for review before this court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">PETITIONS DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
