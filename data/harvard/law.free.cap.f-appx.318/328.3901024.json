Pete Arcibar Rocha appeals both his conviction and sentence arising out of the same conspiracy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Orozco-Torres and Rocha each played a role in a cocaine-distribution conspiracy that started in the border town of Brownsville, Texas, and ended in Nashville, Tennessee. The conspiracy began in March 2005, when the Nashville police and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) used a confidential informant to arrange a purchase of cocaine from two men in Nashville. Those two men then contacted three other persons in Texas\u2014Mark Anthony Garcia, Rita Martinez, and Maria Villareal\u2014to arrange a delivery of three kilograms of cocaine from Brownsville to Nashville.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Rocha\u2019s role was to transport the cocaine. He worked as a bus driver for Adame Bus Lines, a passenger-bus company with regular routes from Mexico to various cities in the United States. Garcia met Rocha at the Brownsville bus station, and gave him a backpack containing three kilograms of cocaine. Rocha placed the bag in the driver\u2019s luggage area on the front seat of the bus. Rocha then drove the bus to Houston, with Garcia onboard as a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">In Houston, Rocha and Garcia met Martinez and Villareal, and the four of them boarded an Adame bus for Nashville. Rocha did not drive on this trip, but again stored the backpack in the driver\u2019s luggage area. Upon reaching Nashville, they checked into a motel. There, Rocha learned that the final sale of the cocaine would not be completed until several days later, so he left Nashville. Rocha was supposed to be paid $2,000 for his role in transporting the cocaine, but Garcia paid him only $500 at that time because the deal had not yet been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">Orozco-Torres entered the picture a few days later. He had arrived in Nashville from Mexico one day before the cocaine sale was to be completed. He learned of the deal from one of the Nashville purchasers\u2014his brother-in-law\u2014at whose apartment he was staying. Orozco-Torres also met the other Nashville purchaser that same day, and told him that he would like to participate in the sale because his brother-in-law \u201chad never done this kind of dealt ] and he didn\u2019t know about ... these things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">The next day, the confidential informant went to the apartment to complete the sale. The informant was wearing a transmitting device, which was monitored by ICE agents. In a conversation overheard by the agents, Orozco-Torres negotiated with the informant about how the transfer of cocaine for cash would occur. Orozco-Torres then ordered two other men to retrieve the cocaine from the motel at which Garcia, Martinez, and Villareal were staying. Surveillance agents observed the men go to the motel and pick up Garcia, who was carrying a black backpack. The men returned to the apartment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>showed the informant three kilograms of cocaine in the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Police then entered the apartment and arrested all of the conspirators present, including Orozeo-Torres. Martinez and Villareal were arrested at the motel, and their room was searched. In their purses, agents found a business card with Rocha\u2019s name on it, and two pictures of Rocha, one of him in front of an Adame bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">ICE agents learned that Rocha would be driving a bus to Nashville a few weeks later. Two agents met him at the bus station and told him that his name had come up in an investigation of a cocaine-trafficking investigation. Rocha agreed to go with the agents to their office for an interview. There, he made inculpatory statements\u2014telling the agents that he helped transport the cocaine, and that he was paid for his role in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Rocha was not arrested immediately following his interview, but was driven back to the bus station by the agents. Rocha was arrested several days later and charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Prior to his trial, Rocha moved to suppress the inculpatory statements that he made to the ICE agents. At a hearing on his suppression motion, Rocha testified that the agents had told him at the bus station that \u201cif I was willing to cooperate with them ... I won\u2019t be arrested.\u201d He testified that he later signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver of rights form, but that it was his understanding that he was signing that form as a \u201ctrade\u201d for not getting arrested. He further testified that he asked the agents at the station if he needed an attorney, and they told him that if he was willing to cooperate, \u201c[n]o, you don\u2019t need one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">The agents disputed both assertions. Each testified that they had not made any promises to Rocha that he would not be arrested or prosecuted. They also testified that Rocha had never asked for an attorney, and, indeed, had read and signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver of rights form, indicating that he understood his rights and was willing to talk to the agents without an attorney present. It is also undisputed that Rocha was never handcuffed, that the agents told Rocha he was not under arrest at that time, and that Rocha rode in the front seat of the agents\u2019 car to and from the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">The district court denied Rocha\u2019s motion to suppress the inculpatory statements, finding his testimony not credible. Specifically, with respect to Rocha\u2019s testimony regarding the agents\u2019 alleged promise not to arrest him if he cooperated and signed the waiver of rights form, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">I am finding that to not be credible and not supported by the facts for the following reasons. First of all, the form doesn\u2019t say that. The agents didn\u2019t testify accordingly, so there is a conflict in the testimony there, and I am finding that Mr. Rocha\u2019s testimony in that regard is not credible. It is just not an objective basis for a promise of not being arrested for signing a form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">The court also found that another aspect of Rocha\u2019s testimony\u2014that he had asked for a lawyer but was told he did not need one\u2014was \u201cparticularly not credible in light of his signing and initialing the waiver of rights form.\u201d It was undisputed, the court observed, that Rocha had signed a waiver of rights form and understood that he could have had a lawyer if he had wanted one. The court found that Rocha\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>mony contradicted the testimony of both of the agents, and was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Rocha\u2019s case proceeded to a jury trial, following which he was convicted of both charges. Rocha\u2019s presentence report calculated his Sentencing Guidelines range to be 78 to 97 months\u2019 incarceration. Rocha objected to the report\u2019s failure to include a four-level offense reduction for being a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the drug conspiracy under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The government objected to the report\u2019s failure to include a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The district court overruled Rocha\u2019s objection to the report\u2019s failure to include a four-level minimal-participant reduction, but granted him a two-level reduction as a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the conspiracy. The court granted the government\u2019s request for a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. Noting that it had \u201cpreviously found that Mr. Rocha was hot credible[,]\u201d the court found that his testimony \u201cwas intentionally false, and that rises to the level of obstruction of justice.\u201d The district court then sentenced Rocha to 78 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">For his part in negotiating the drug transaction, Orozco-Torres pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. His pre-sentence report calculated his Guidelines range as 100 to 125 months\u2019 incarceration. Orozco-Torres objected to the report on several grounds, including its failure to include a minimal-role reduction, its failure to reduce his criminal history category on the grounds that it allegedly overstated his propensity to commit crimes, and its failure to grant a downward departure on the grounds that his incarceration would have an \u201cextraordinary effect on innocent family members.\u201d The district court overruled all of these objections, and sentenced Or-ozco-Torres to 100 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">Rocha appeals both his conviction and his sentence. Rocha first argues that his conviction should be vacated because the district court refused to suppress his incul-patory statements. He contends the statements were not voluntary because his \u201cwill was ... overborne by illusory promises\u201d by the agents, to the effect that he would not be arrested if he cooperated with them. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its determination of voluntariness <em>de novo. United States v. Marks, </em>209 F.3d 577, 581 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">\u201cIn determining whether a confession has been elicited by means that are unconstitutional, this court looks to the totality of the circumstances concerning whether a defendant\u2019s will has been overborne.\u201d <em>United States v. Mahan, </em>190 F.3d 416, 422 (6th Cir.1999). \u201cPolice promises of leniency ... can be objectively coercive,\u201d rendering a confession involuntary. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>351 F.3d 254, 261 (6th Cir.2003). But \u201c[a]ny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Rocha\u2019s inculpatory statements were freely and voluntarily given. As an initial matter, Rocha does not argue that he was in custody when he gave the statements. To the contrary, he admits that he agreed to go with the ICE agents to the bureau station, that they told him he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>not under arrest, that he was never handcuffed, and that he rode in the front seat of the agent\u2019s car to and from the station. The \u201ccompulsion inherent in custodial surroundings\u201d was absent, therefore, and the pre-interrogation warnings mandated by <em>Miranda </em>were not required. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 458, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Moreover, Rocha concedes that the agents read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that he signed a waiver-of-rights form, indicating that he was willing to answer questions without a lawyer present.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Rocha\u2019s argument, instead, is that his \u201cwill was overborne\u201d by the agents\u2019 alleged promise that he would not be arrested if he agreed to cooperate. But the district court specifically found the predicate for this argument\u2014that the agents made such a promise\u2014to be incredible. We have no basis to hold that finding to be clear error. Under the totality of the circumstances, therefore, Rocha\u2019s statements were \u201cgiven freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences,\u201d and properly admissible against him at trial. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Rocha also appeals his sentence. He argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement, and in failing to grant a four-level \u201cminimal participant\u201d reduction. In reviewing an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, we review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error, its \u201cdetermination that certain conduct constitutes obstruction of justice\u201d <em>de novo, </em>and its application of the enhancement <em>de novo. United States v. Baggett, </em>342 F.3d 536, 540-41 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Section \u00a7 3C1.1 provides for a two-level enhancement where a defendant \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The notes to \u00a7 3C1.1 recite \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\u201d as examples of obstructing justice. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4(b). A defendant commits perjury when, testifying under oath, he \u201cgives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">In <em>Dunnigan, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged the \u201cconcern that courts will enhance sentences as a matter of course whenever the accused takes the stand and is found guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 113 S.Ct. 1111. To protect against this risk, the Court held that \u201cif a defendant objects to a sentence enhancement resulting from her trial testimony, a district court must review the evidence and make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to or obstruction of justice, or an attempt to do the same, under the perjury definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111. The Court recognized that \u201c[w]hen doing so, it is preferable ... to address each element of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding,\u201d but \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s determination that enhancement is required is sufficient ... if ... the court makes a finding of an obstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">We have added additional requirements. For a district court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3C1.1, the court must: \u201c1) identify those particular portions of defendant\u2019s testimony that it considers to be perjurious; and 2) either make a specific finding for each element of perjury or, at least, make a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>308 F.3d 623, 632 (6th Cir.2002). With respect to the first requirement, however, we \u201chave never insisted on a rigid adherence to its terms,\u201d and \u201ca district court\u2019s findings will be adequate if: 1) the record is sufficiently clear to indicate which statements the district court considered perjurious; and 2) the district court found that the statements satisfied each element of perjury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Here, Rocha testified under oath at a suppression hearing that ICE agents told him that \u201cif I was willing to cooperate with them ... I won\u2019t be arrested.\u201d He further testified that he asked the agents if he needed a lawyer, and they told him, \u201c[n]o, you don\u2019t need onei\u201d The district court found at the hearing that \u201cthose pieces of testimony by Mr. Rocha aren\u2019t credible, particularly not credible in light of his signing and initialing the waiver of rights form.\u201d At sentencing, the district court referenced these findings, saying that \u201c[o]n the obstruction of justice enhancement, the Court previously found that Mr. Rocha was not credible. In the opinion of the Court his testimony was intentionally false, and that rises to the level of obstruction of justice, so I\u2019m granting that objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Rocha argues that these findings were not specific enough under <em>Dunnigan </em>and <em>Lawrence. </em>He cites our decision in <em>United States v. Spears, </em>49 F.3d 1136 (6th Cir.1995), where we held that a sentencing judge\u2019s general finding that a defendant\u2019s entire testimony was not credible was not specific enough to warrant an obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In Rocha\u2019s case, however, the \u201crecord is sufficiently clear to indicate which statements the district court found perjurious.\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>308 F.3d at 632. The district court specifically found \u201cnot credible\u201d two material aspects of Rocha\u2019s testimony\u2014 that he asked for a lawyer and that the agents promised him he would not be arrested\u2014and then referenced that finding at sentencing. Thus, unlike <em>Spears, </em>there is no ambiguity in the record here regarding the statements that the district court found perjurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Those statements also \u201csatisfied each element of perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court expressly found that the cited testimony was \u201cintentionally false\u201d\u2014thus satisfying the \u201cwillful\u201d element of perjury. Although the court did not address the \u201cmateriality\u201d of the testimony, that element generally is a question of law in this setting. <em>See United States v. Seymour, </em>38 F.3d 261, 264 (6th Cir.1994) (where a district court\u2019s findings \u201cencompass all elements of perjury except materiality, <em>Dunnigan </em>does not require a remand because materiality is a question of law\u201d). Any error, at any rate, was harmless because the element is plainly met here; Rocha\u2019s perjury formed the <em>basis </em>for his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The district court\u2019s findings therefore \u201cencompass[ed] all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury,\u201d and thus satisfy the rules set forth in <em>Dunnigan </em>and <em>Lawrence. </em>The district court did not err in imposing a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Rocha further argues that the district court erred in denying him a four-level reduction to his offense level as a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the conspiracy under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). The district court did, however, grant Rocha a two-level reduction as a \u201cminor participant\u201d under \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Section 3B1.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">(a) If the defendant was a minimal participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">(b) If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">In cases falling between (a) and (b), decrease by 3 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The reduction for a minimal participant \u201cis intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4. A reduction for a minor participant \u201capplies to a defendant ... who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines cautions that \u201c[i]t is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used infrequently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4. \u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">\u201cThis court will not disturb the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the criminal activity unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>940 F.2d 176, 180 (6th Cir.1991). The defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a minimal participant in the offense. <em>United States v. Salas, </em>455 F.3d 637, 643 (6th Cir.2006). The issue, therefore, is whether the district court clearly erred in determining that Rocha failed to prove that he was a minimal\u2014rather than a minor\u2014participant in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">The district court made no such error. Rocha\u2019s role in the cocaine-trafficking conspiracy was to transport the cocaine from Brownsville to Nashville. That was an essential role. He used his position as a commercial bus driver to store the cocaine during its transport in the driver\u2019s luggage area, where it was less likely to be searched by customs agents. He traveled with three other members of the conspiracy\u2014knowing their roles\u2014and successfully delivered the cocaine to Nashville. He was paid $500 for his services. Rocha thus played a significant role in the conspiracy and knew the role of others in it. That takes him beyond the scope of a minimal participant. The district court\u2019s determination that Rocha had not met his burden of proving that he was a minimal participant, therefore, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Orozco-Torres appeals only his sentence. Like Rocha, he first argues that the district court erred in failing to grant him a mitigating-role reduction. His argument fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">In his plea agreement, Orozco-Torres stipulated to the fact that he \u201cnegotiated with the informant over how the transfer of cocaine for cash would occur,\u201d and the fact that he \u201cordered\u201d two other co-conspirators \u201cto get the cocaine and bring it to the apartment.\u201d The district court rightly relied on these facts in finding that Orozco-Torres was not a minimal or minor participant. Orozco-Torres was not \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved\u201d in the conspiracy, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4, thus precluding a reduction as a minimal participant. And he was not \u201cless culpable than most other participants,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5\u2014given that he gave orders to at least two of them\u2014thus precluding a reduction as a minor one. The district court did not err in denying the requested reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Orozco-Torres next argues that the district court erred in failing to grant a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l). That section provides that a downward departure may be granted \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l). In making this determination, the district court can consider the types of prior convictions, the age of the convictions, and signs of rehabilitation. <em>United States v. Fletcher, </em>15 F.3d 553, 557 (6th Cir.1994). We review the district court\u2019s determination only for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">This argument is meritless. Orozco-Torres has seven prior convictions, including ones for drug possession, possession of a handgun while under the influence, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He committed all these offenses between 1999 and 2002\u2014and indeed in the 26 months during that period when he was not in prison. It understates matters to say that the district court\u2019s determination on this issue was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Orozco-Torres also argues that his family circumstances \u201cwarranted a downward departure.\u201d He asserts that his incarceration will have a negative effect on his wife and child, who rely on him for support. We have held that \u201c[ejxtraordinary and special family circumstances may justify a downward departure in exceptional cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Tocco, </em>200 F.3d 401, 435 (6th Cir.2000). But this case is not exceptional; the conduct of criminals often has severe, harmful effects upon their families. The district court did not err on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Finally, Orozco-Torres challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. We review his sentence for both procedural and substantive reasonableness, \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">eommit[s][a] significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALb\"><em>Id. </em>at 597, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence fell within the Guidelines, we apply a \u201crebuttable presumption of substantive reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilms, </em>495 F.3d 277, 280-81 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Orozco-Torres\u2019 sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court acknowledged the advisory nature of the Guidelines, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and properly calculated a Guidelines range of 100 to 125 months\u2019 incarceration. The court then sentenced Orozco-Torres at the bottom of the Guidelines range, 100 months, which it determined in its discretion to be reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgments in both cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
