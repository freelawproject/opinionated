The district court properly denied relief because Omar has not shown that his conviction has been overturned or called into question. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Harvey v. Horan, </em>278 F.3d 370, 375 (4th Cir.2002) (applying <em>Heck </em>to claims for injunctive relief).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, we modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect that dismissal is without prejudice to Omar\u2019s ability to refile his claims if his federal conviction is overturned or called into question by the appropriate court, and affirm the order as modified. <em>See Omar v. Chasanow, et al., </em>No. 8:08-cv-02626-PJM (D.Md. Oct. 16, 2008). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b213-12\"> The rationale in <em>Heck </em>applies in actions under <em>Bivens v.
