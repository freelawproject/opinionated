Jackson was committed in 1996 after qualifying for the SVPA by virtue of three previous convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and forcible rape. Jackson argues California unlawfully held him in custody for SVPA proceedings after he had successfully completed a 6-month sentence for a parole violation. As a result, he maintains his continuing custody under the SVPA violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Because California\u2019s application of state law was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of United States Supreme Court due process law, we DENY his ha-beas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The parties are familiar with the facts and procedural background so we need not recount all of the details here.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">In sum, California\u2019s SVPA allows the state to conf\u00edne particularly dangerous individuals who have been convicted of multiple sexual offenses. Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code \u00a7 6600 <em>et seq. </em>The SVPA defines a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d (SVP) as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for which he or she received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6600(a) (as in effect in 1996). In order to confine a person under the SVPA, the state must petition a court to commit him, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6601(i), and the court or a jury must determine that he is a SVP, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6604. A SVPA petition may be filed only if the person named in the petition is <em>\u201cin custody under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections </em>\u201d at the time the petition is filed. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6601(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">The SVPA took effect on January 1, 1996, when Jackson was in prison for a parole violation. He was scheduled for parole release at 12:00 a.m. on February 25, 1996. Because Jackson had multiple rape convictions, state officials began considering him for confinement under the SVPA. The state Board of Prison Terms (BPT) completed several preliminary steps in late 1995. On January 29, 1996 and February 20, 1996, Jackson was evaluated by two psychologists, as required by the SVPA, and both determined that Jackson met the criteria for civil confinement under the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">On January 26, 1996, \u201cperhaps concerned that it would not be able to satisfy the prerequisites for filing an SVPA petition before Jackson\u2019s scheduled release,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Jackson v. California Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>399 F.3d 1069, 1070 (9th Cir.2005), <em>as amended on denial of reh\u2019g, </em>417 F.3d 1029 (9th Cir.2005), the BPT placed an anticipatory three-day hold on Jackson\u2019s release. To justify the hold, the BPT appears to have relied on Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 3056. The hold was scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on February 25 and Jackson\u2019s new release date was now February 28, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On February 27, the day before Jackson\u2019s new release date and two days after his original one, the BPT determined that there was probable cause that Jackson was a sexually violent predator. As a result, the BPT placed a 45-day hold on Jackson\u2019s release pursuant to Cal.Code Regs. tit. 15, \u00a7 2600.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On March 13, 1996, while the 45-day hold was in force, the Sacramento County District Attorney filed a petition in superi- or court to have'Jackson committed under the SVPA. After several hearings were held, including ones on April 8 and 15, Jackson was appointed an attorney. Jackson waived time requirements under the SVPA, and the mandatory judicial probable cause hearing was continued until May 6, 1996. After further continuance requests by Jackson, the superior court finally found probable cause existed to believe Jackson met the criteria for civil confinement as a SVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On June 2, 1997, a jury determined that Jackson was a sexually violent predator, and he was ordered committed for two years at Atascadero State Hospital. Jackson directly appealed, raising issues unrelated to this case. He did not challenge the jurisdiction of the state court pursuant to the SVPA. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the jury verdict and the California Supreme Court denied Jackson\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">While his direct appeal of the jury verdict was pending, Jackson filed a state habeas petition. In his petition, he argued the three-day hold on his release was illegal and the state was required to release him on February 25 under California\u2019s \u201cmandatory kick-out\u201d rule. In particular, Jackson claimed he was not in \u201clawful\u201d custody when the SVPA petition was filed and therefore the state court did not have jurisdiction to order him confined. Both the California Court of Appeal and the California Supreme Court summarily denied his habeas petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Jackson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, and after a remand on procedural grounds, <em>Jackson, </em>417 F.3d 1029, the district court denied the petition since it would have been required to reach state law issues already determined by the California state courts. Subsequently, the district court granted Jackson a certificate of appealability and stated the issue on appeal as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">Whether the judgment under which Mr. Jackson is in custody was rendered by a court without jurisdiction in violation of his federal constitutional right to due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">This appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo. Eslaminia v. White, </em>136 F.3d 1234, 1236 (9th Cir.1998). The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) provides that we cannot grant federal habeas corpus for any claim decided on the merits in state court unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claim was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">On appeal, Jackson contends his due process rights were violated by California. His claims center on whether California unlawfully held him in custody under the SVPA thereby violating his federal due process rights. We conclude that Jackson was properly held pursuant to California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>A. Custody</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">First, Jackson argues he was not in \u201clawful custody\u201d at the time the BPT conducted its SVPA probable cause determination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">1. Scope of Review of State Law Error</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\u201c[Fjederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for <em>errors of state law.\u201d Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Lewis v. Jeffers, </em>497 U.S. 764, 780, 110 S.Ct. 3092, 111 L.Ed.2d 606 (1990)). And it \u201cis not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. In conducting habeas review, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475; <em>Hubbart v. Knapp, </em>379 F.3d 773, 780 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe may not second-guess the California appellate court\u2019s construction of its own state law....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Hence, a federal habeas corpus petition must allege a deprivation of one or more federal rights to present a cognizable claim pursuant to \u00a7 2254. <em>Hubbart, </em>379 F.3d at 779. In determining whether a state court decision is contrary to federal law, \u201cwe look to'the state\u2019s last reasoned decision ... as the basis for its judgment.\u201d <em>Avila v. Galaza, </em>297 F.3d 911, 918 (9th Cir.2002). In the face of a summary disposition by the state courts, as we have here, we \u201cmust undertake our own analysis of the embedded state law question.\u201d <em>Himes v. Thompson, </em>336 F.3d 848, 853 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">2. Custody was Lawful or in Good Faith</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Jackson claims, as a \u201cparolee on parole,\u201d the SVPA was inapplicable to him. Specifically, he claims the SVPA\u2014as in effect in 1996\u2014only permitted civil confinement of \u201cinmates who were in custody serving a determinate sentence or in custody following a revocation of parole.\u201d This is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">California courts interpret state law and deem parolees to be in legal custody while on parole status. <em>People v. Hernandez, </em>229 Cal.App.2d 143, 149, 40 Cal.Rptr. 100 (1964) (\u201c[A] parolee is not a prison inmate in the physical sense, he is constructively a prisoner under legal custody of the State Department of Corrections and may be returned to the prison walls without notice and hearing.\u201d). And, California law allows parole agents to prevent a parolee, \u201cin the event he is already in jail, ... from being released on bail, on his own recognizance or after the expiration of any sentence he may have been required to serve.\u201d <em>In re Law, </em>10 Cal.3d 21, 24 n. 2, 109 Cal.Rptr. 573, 513 P.2d 621 (1973). Based on these authorities, Jackson was properly detained for application of the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">Even if the BPT exceeded its detention authority, \u201ccustody\u201d as intended by the SVPA was not lost. The California legislature amended section 6601 to provide as follows: \u201cA petition shall not be dismissed on the basis of a later judicial or administrative determination that the individual\u2019s custody was unlawful, if the unlawful custody was the result of <em>a good faith mistake of fact or law.\u201d People v. Superior Court (Small), </em>159 Cal.App.4th 301, 307, 71 Cal.Rptr.3d 462 (2008) (quoting the amended version of Cal. Welf. <em>&amp; </em>Inst.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u00a7 6601(a)(2) (2008)). The amended version of section 6601(a)(2) expressly states it applies retroactively to \u201cany petition filed on or after January 1, 1996.\u201d Here, the petition for confinement pursuant to the SVPA was filed in March 1996, so this retroactive provision is applicable. Jackson points to nothing that suggests California officials were acting in bad faith in applying the SVPA in these circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Nevertheless, even assuming Jackson\u2019s custody was \u201cunlawful\u201d as a matter of state law, his contentions regarding the BPT\u2019s and California courts\u2019 lack of jurisdiction are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">California courts have stated that <em>lawful </em>custody is <em>not </em>a jurisdictional prerequisite for a SVPA application. <em>E.g., People v. Hedge, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1478, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 52 (1999) (stating \u201cthe unambiguous language of the Act contains no requirement a defendant\u2019s custody be \u2018lawful\u2019 at the time such petition is filed, only that the person alleged to be an SVP be in \u2018custody under the jurisdiction of the [DOC].\u2019\u201d (alteration in original)). Thus, California officials still had jurisdiction over Jackson pursuant to the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In sum, Jackson\u2019s custody did not violate state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\n<em>B. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Even if Jackson\u2019s custody was not lawful under the SVPA, any confinement did not implicate his federal due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">California courts have clearly stated that \u2022 <em>lawful </em>custody by the California Department of Corrections is not a jurisdictional prerequisite for application of the SVPA, only actual <em>physical </em>custody. <em>See Hedge, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at 1478, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 52; <em>People v. Superior Court (Whitley), </em>68 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1390, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 189 (1999); <em>Garcetti v. Superior Court, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1117-18, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 724 (1998). Recognizing this, Jackson also argues the California courts\u2019 interpretation and application of the SVPA deprived him of his federal due process rights. In particular, he claims California\u2019s mandatory discharge provision gives rise to a state-created liberty interest. We disagree, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">First, although Jackson paints his civil confinement as a substantive due process violation, in reality, he claims that the state failed to follow its own procedures for a SVP determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">As discussed above, California courts have found section 6601 does not necessarily require lawful custody. <em>See People v. Wakefield, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 893, 898, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 221 (2000) (\u201c[L]awful custody has never been a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing an SVP petition.\u201d); <em>Garcetti, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at 1117-18, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 724 (same); <em>see also In re Smith, </em>42 Cal.4th 1251, 73 Cal.Rptr.3d 469, 178 P.3d 446, 458 (2008) (implicitly approving of this conclusion). Similarly, individuals subject to a parole release are still in \u201cconstructive custody.\u201d <em>In re Smith, </em>73 Cal.Rptr.3d 469, 178 P.3d at 458 (citing Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 3056, which states: \u201cPrisoners on parole shall remain under the legal custody of the department ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-18\">More significantly, we rejected the same argument in <em>Hubbart v. Knapp, </em>379 F.3d 773, 779-80 (9th Cir.2004). We concluded in <em>Hubbart:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Under AEDPA, we again defer to the state court, which held that \u201cthere is no due process violation where the person was not in lawful custody at the time the petition was filed ... [provided that] custody ... resulted] from a good faith error rather than negligent or intentional wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">:\u00a1{ ;j: ;}:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">The California appellate court concluded that \u201can SVPA commitment resulting from unlawful custody [does not] violate due process where, as here, the unlawful custody was the result of good faith error and where, as here, the SVP is provided with numerous procedural safeguards. SVPA safeguards include requirements that accused sexually violent predators receive diagnoses from two psychiatrists or psychologists, assistance of counsel, and trial by jury on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. As the state court concluded, \u201c[a] person in unlawful custody who is alleged to be an SVP still has all of the procedural safeguards that the SVPA provides in order to decrease the risk of an erroneous liberty deprivation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">379 F.3d at 780-81 (citations omitted) (emphasis added) (alterations in original).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Jackson alleges the unlawful custody was not a product of a good faith mistake. But he fails to present any evidence other than his legal arguments, which provide no support.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In any event, the Supreme Court has allowed states to impose involuntary civil commitment on individuals who are not currently in actual custody, after expiration of a prison term, or even where the individual had been found not guilty of the crime by reason of insanity. <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 369, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997). Jackson was provided with all of the due process protections required by <em>Hendricks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">In conclusion, although Jackson\u2019s state habeas petition was summarily denied, our review of the embedded state legal issues satisfies us that California properly fulfilled the SVPA prerequisites for civil commitment. Consequently, there is no due process claim here\u2014the state\u2019s action was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d nor an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of Supreme Court law on procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">For the reasons set forth above, we DENY Jackson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\">. Jackson argues the BPT's actions were \u201cat the very least, grossly negligent\u201d conduct. Other than stating the BPT\u2019s actions were not permitted under the California statutes or regulations, Jackson offers no proof the BPT did not act in good faith reliance on its authority under the relevant law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">. The federal habeas petitioner in <em>Hubbart </em>similarly contended his \"custody\u201d by the California Department of Corrections was unlawful and thereby precluded the application of the SVPA. 379 F.3d at 779. Rejecting this argument, we found the \"California Court of Appeal rejected Hubbart's interpretation of the SVPA's 'in custody\u2019 provision as a matter of state law. The state court held that the SVPA contains \u2018no explicit requirement that a defendant\u2019s custody be lawful; it require[s] only that the person alleged to be a SVP was in custody under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections.\u2019 \" <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (quoting <em>People v. Hubbart, </em>88 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1229, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 490 (2001)) (finding that \"Hubbart\u2019s commitment proceedings complied with the SVPA's \u2018in custody' requirement, despite the fact that he was held due to a \u2018mistake of law' when his SVPA proceedings began\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
