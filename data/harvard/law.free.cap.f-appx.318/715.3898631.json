HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Defendant Darnell Young pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to a charge of felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In calculating his offense level under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), the court determined that he had two prior convictions for \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d\u2014namely, a third-degree assault and an escape. On appeal Mr. Young contends that neither prior conviction should have been counted. He argues that (1) his assault offense did not qualify because he had not been sentenced for that offense when he committed the instant offense and (2) under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), the escape for which he was convicted was not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Mr. Young also contends that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a downward departure. We hold that (1) the district court properly considered Mr. Young\u2019s assault offense because it is immaterial under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) that he was sentenced for the assault after he committed the instant offense; (2) as the parties agreed at oral argument, further district-court proceedings are necessary to determine whether Mr. Young\u2019s escape offense was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under <em>Chambers-, </em>and (3) because the district court presumed that it had authority to depart downwards, we cannot review the denial of Mr. Young\u2019s downward-departure motion. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">Understanding Mr. Young\u2019s claims on appeal requires a timeline of events. In 1997 Mr. Young was convicted of accessory to first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to three years in a community correctional facility. About two weeks after he began serving that term, he \u201cleft the facility and was placed on escape status.\u201d R. Vol. III at 9. The record does not establish how Mr. Young \u201cleft the facility\u201d-\u2014we do not know, for example, whether he broke free, walked out, or failed to report after a furlough. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Young was convicted in Colorado state court of the crime of escape and was sentenced to two and one-half years\u2019 im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>prisonment for that offense. On October 19, 2006, he committed the crime of assault; he pleaded guilty on February 13, 2007. Then on July 1, 2007, before he had been sentenced on the assault offense, he committed the offense of felon in possession of a firearm. Mr. Young was sentenced for the assault conviction on August 15, 2007. He pleaded guilty to the firearm charge on February 20, 2008, and received the challenged sentence for that offense on April 25, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">At sentencing for the firearm offense, the district court adopted the Guidelines calculation recommended in the probation office\u2019s presentence report (PSR). The PSR applied USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), which sets the base offense level at 24 for possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) if the defendant has previously sustained two or more \u201cfelony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2); <em>see id. </em>cmt. (this section covers, inter alia, violations of \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)-(p)). The PSR concluded that \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) applied because Mr. Young had been convicted of an escape and an assault, both felony crimes of violence, before committing the firearm offense. The PSR reduced Mr. Young\u2019s base offense level by three levels (to 21) in consideration of his acceptance of responsibility, and assigned him a criminal-history category of VI. This resulted in a Guideline range of 77-96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">At the sentencing hearing the district court rejected Mr. Young\u2019s challenges to the PSR\u2019s calculation of his base offense level, ruling that (1) Mr. Young\u2019s assault offense counted under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) even though he had not been sentenced for that offense before he committed the firearm offense, and (2) Mr. Young\u2019s escape offense was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under this circuit\u2019s precedents. Finding no reason to depart from the Guidelines, the district court also denied Mr. Young\u2019s motion for a downward departure, sentencing him to a 77-month term of imprisonment (the low end of the Guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">On appeal Mr. Young contends that neither his assault nor his escape conviction should have been considered in the calculation of his base offense level. He also argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a downward departure. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">A. Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Mr. Young\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that a conviction is not counted under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) if sentence had not been imposed before the instant offense was committed. Although Mr. Young had pleaded guilty to assault before committing the firearm offense, he was not sentenced for the assault offense until one and one-half months <em>after </em>he committed the firearm offense. In Mr. Young\u2019s view, his assault offense was therefore not a prior conviction and \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) was erroneously applied to calculate his base offense level. Our review of this legal issue is de novo. <em>See United States v. Whitehead, </em>425 F.3d 870, 871 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Mr. Young\u2019s argument, however, is inconsistent with our holding in <em>United States v. Dell, </em>359 F.3d 1347, 1349-50 (10th Cir.2004). In that case the defendant had pleaded guilty to a Utah drug charge, but he was never sentenced for the offense. <em>See id. </em>at 1348. The state court had entered an order, termed a \u201cplea in abeyance,\u201d Utah Code Ann. 77-2a-l(l), under which the charge was dismissed when he successfully completed treatment. <em>See id. </em>The defendant was later convicted of federal firearm offenses and he argued at sentencing for those offenses that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>missed drug charge was not a prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1347-48. Because the defendant had <em>never </em>been sentenced under his plea in abeyance, the federal offenses obviously did not occur <em>after </em>sentencing on the drug charge. Nevertheless, we held that the plea in abeyance counted as a conviction under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) because it received a criminal history point under \u00a7 4Al.l(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1349. Mr. Young does not, and could not, reasonably dispute that he properly received a criminal-history point for his assault conviction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(4) (\u201c \u2018Convicted of an offense\u2019 ... means that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of <em>nolo contendere.\u201d). </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s treatment of Mr. Young\u2019s assault conviction as a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">B. Escape</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Mr. Young contends that his escape conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d After this claim was rejected below, the Supreme Court decided <em>Chambers, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484, ruling that a failure to report to a penal institution is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). Although Mr. Young was not sentenced under the ACCA, the applicable Guidelines definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a), is almost identical to the ACCA\u2019s definition of a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Accordingly, we have said that in this context the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis under the ACCA \u201capplies equally to the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Tiger, </em>538 F.3d 1297, 1298 (10th Cir.2008). In this case, however, the record does not provide the information that we would need to apply <em>Chambers. </em>Although it establishes that Mr. Young escaped from a community correctional facility, it does not establish the nature of that escape or the escape statute under which Mr. Young was convicted. Thus, as the parties agreed at oral argument, further district-court proceedings are required to determine whether, in light of <em>Chambers, </em>Mr. Young\u2019s prior escape conviction was a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">C. Downward Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Mr. Young\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure. We \u201clack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Fonseca, </em>473 F.3d 1109, 1112 (10th Cir.2007). And because we presume that district courts \u201crecognize [their] discretion,\u201d we review the denial of a downward departure only if the court \u201cunambiguously states it lacks discretion to grant the departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court made no such unambiguous statement. To the contrary, at the sentencing hearing the district court rejected Mr. Young\u2019s argument to depart downwards by noting that it \u201c[was] not persuaded that the defense ha[d] met its burden.\u201d R. Vol. II at 14. Later, the court found \u201cno reason to depart from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of Mr. Young\u2019s downward-departure motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">We REVERSE Mr. Young\u2019s sentence and REMAND for further sentencing proceedings consistent with <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>\u2014- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009) and this opinion. We GRANT the Stipulated Motion to Supplement Record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent-with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
