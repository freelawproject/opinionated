On September 1, 2005, he was released on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">In January 2006, the city police in Rotterdam, New York found a firearm in Coons\u2019s possession and arrested him. Coons was then placed in state custody for violating his parole. He later pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), which forbid those previously convicted of felonies from possessing firearms. Coons\u2019s federal sentencing hearing was not held until May 2007, at which time Coons had been in state custody for approximately 16 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">At Coons\u2019s sentencing hearing in federal court before Judge Lawrence E. Kahn, Coons argued that his sentence should be reduced by 16 months to reflect the period that he had been in state custody. Coons contended that the district judge had the authority to make this adjustment under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) and (c) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Judge Kahn concluded that a Guidelines sentence would be 27 to 33 months in prison and sentenced Coons to 27 months in prison. The judge did not grant the 16-month adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">On appeal to us, Coons makes two arguments. First, he claims that Judge Kahn made some comments at the sentencing hearing that suggest the judge thought that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) and (c) did not authorize him to grant the 16-month adjustment Coons requested. Coons argues that this is an erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 5G1.3 and that we should correct the district court\u2019s misinterpretation and remand for resentencing. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Genao, </em>343 F.3d 578, 586-87 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cWhere a District Court mistakenly believes that it lacks the authority to exercise discretion, we remand for resentencing.\u201d). But after reviewing the record, including defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history, we do not agree that the district judge thought he lacked the authority to order such relief. Instead, we conclude that the judge decided he would not grant it in this case even if he had the discretion to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we need not remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Second, Coons argues that his sentence must be vacated because the district court failed to abide by the command of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that a sentencing court consider a number of factors, such as \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cthe kinds of sentences available.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">This argument fails because this Court will \u201cpresume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006); see also <em>United States v. Wills, </em>476 F.3d 103, 107 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cNo robotic incantation of the factors is required .... \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). There was no indication here that the district court failed to consider the statutory factors. Indeed, the court explicitly stated that it had \u201cconsidered ... the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 3553\u201d and discussed, among other things, defendant\u2019s criminal history. Therefore, this challenge to defendant\u2019s sentence also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u25a0 We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining arguments, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\">. Thus we need not (and do not) decide whether \u00a7 5G1.3 authorized the district court to grant the 16-month adjustment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
