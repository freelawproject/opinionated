Under the Speedy Trial Act, the district court dismissed his first indictment without prejudice because it found that the delay in trying Grady was caused by personnel in the court clerk\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>office. Grady then was re-indicted, and a jury found him guilty of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">On appeal, Grady argues that, under the Speedy Trial Act, the district court should have dismissed the original indictment \u25a0with prejudice because, even though his offense was serious, it is the responsibility of the executive branch of government to ensure that trials are timely, and the government has not offered an affirmative justification for why the dismissal should have been without prejudice. This argument is raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">When an argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we review it for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). If these factors are met, the decision to correct the forfeited error is \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the court of appeals,\u201d and the court may correct the error if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Review for plain error requires an error to be clear or obvious. <em>United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1008 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">When deciding whether to dismiss an indictment for a Speedy Trial Act violation with or without prejudice, \u201cthere is no preference for one type of dismissal over the other.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>183 F.3d 1306, 1310 (11th Cir.1999). In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the district court must consider each of the following factors: \u201cthe seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(1) (2006); <em>see also Brown, </em>183 F.3d at 1310. Serious offenses favor dismissal without prejudice unless there has been a correspondingly severe delay of \u201cseveral months.\u201d <em>See United States v. Russo, </em>741 F.2d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.1984). The second factor favors dismissal without prejudice if the delay resulted from \u201cnegligence and oversight,\u201d rather than an \u201cintentional delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>835 F.2d 830, 834 (11th Cir.1988). The interests of administration of justice and speedy prosecution tend to cancel each other out. <em>Russo, </em>741 F.2d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Because of the seriousness of Grady\u2019s offense and the fact that the delay was the fault of the district court clerk\u2019s office and without any fault by the parties, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error by dismissing without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Grady also argues that his re-indictment and subsequent conviction violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial because the re-indictment occurred eight months after he was arrested, which constituted an undue delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">\u201cDetermination of whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated is a mixed question of law and fact. Questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>83 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Yapp v. Reno, </em>26 F.3d 1562, 1565 (11th Cir.1994)). However, as discussed <em>supra, </em>when an issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>raised for the first time on appeal, it is reviewed for plain error. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">'The Sixth Amendment states that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. \u201cIn order to determine whether a defendant has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, this court must consider (1) whether the delay before trial was uncommonly long; (2) whether the government or the defendant is more to blame for that delay; (3) whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial; and (4) whether the defendant suffered prejudice as a result of the delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>376 F.3d 1282, 1290 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Harris, </em>we found that the trial delay of over 18 months was uncommonly long. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, because the delay was not the government\u2019s fault, but rather the result of a scheduling error committed by the district court, we found that the second consideration favored the government, and, therefore, Harris had to show that he actually was prejudiced by the delay. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Here, Grady could not show, and did not argue on appeal, that he was prejudiced by the delay. Thus, the district court did not commit plain error when it declined to dismiss the second indictment because the government did not cause the delay in Grady\u2019s proceedings, and Grady could not show that he was actually prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Lastly, Grady argues that the evidence was not sufficient to convict him because: (1) there was no direct evidence that he possessed cocaine; and (2) the circumstantial evidence merely presented a suspicion that he possessed cocaine, which did not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">Grady did not move the district court for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, thus we will reverse his conviction only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 556-57 (11th Cir.1990). This standard requires \u201ca finding that \u2018the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Tapia, </em>761 F.2d 1488, 1492 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Landers, </em>484 F.2d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1973)). In making this determination, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and accept all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations that support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Grady\u2019s conviction is not a manifest, miscarriage of justice because evidence showed that he buried a bag of cocaine in the mud while he was fleeing the police. For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Grady\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
