NELSON, TASHIMA, and FISHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b505-34\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-35\">AT Publishing (\u201cAT\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of OFC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Capital (\u201cOFC\u201d), and the district court\u2019s order awarding OFC attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Because AT\u2019s primary argument has been waived and its secondary arguments are unavailing, we affirm the judgment of the district court, as well as its post-judgment fees\u2019 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">AT\u2019s failure to make a post-verdict motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict constitutes, on appeal, a waiver of issues arising from the denial of AT\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Nitco Holding Corp. v. Boujikian, </em>491 F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The district court\u2019s jury instructions fairly and adequately covered the issues presented, correctly stated the law, and were not misleading. <em>See White v. Ford Motor Co., </em>312 F.3d 998, 1012 (9th Cir.2002). The district court did not misstate the law governing acceptance and rejection in those instructions, which referenced (1) the lease the parties signed; and (2) the requirement that AT be provided a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods received before its acceptance would be legally binding. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 11-2A-515G).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The district court properly dismissed AT\u2019s claim regarding its right to revocation of acceptance. Although \u201c[r]evocation is an available remedy even where the seller has attempted to limit its warranties,\u201d <em>see Prudential Metal Supply Corp. v. Atl. Freight Sales Co., </em>204 Ga.App. 439, 419 S.E.2d 520, 521 (1992), AT was not entitled to revoke its acceptance against OFC. AT realized the equipment was nonconforming when it was tested immediately after installation. Indeed, AT could not have accepted the press prior to learning about the nonconformity. <em>See </em>Ga. Code. \u00a7\u00a7 11-2A-509; 11-2A-509(1). Because a buyer may only revoke its acceptance against a finance lessor when it is unaware of the nonconformity, AT was not entitled to revoke its acceptance. <em>See </em>Ga.Code. \u00a7\u00a7 11-2A-516, 11-2A-517.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Similarly, the district court properly dismissed AT\u2019s claim for damages against OFC. Because OFC had not breached its finance lease, and had no contractual obligation to provide conforming goods, AT did not state a claim against OFC for which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); <em>see also Milledgeville Water Co. v. Fowler, </em>129 Ga. 111, 58 S.E. 643, 644 (1907) (\u201cwhere contract relations exist, the parties assume toward each other no duties whatever besides those the contract imposes\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Finally, the district court appropriately awarded fees to OFC under the terms of the lease, which provided that \u201cLessee shall reimburse Lessor for all charges, costs, expenses and attorney\u2019s fees.... \u201d <em>See Georgia Subsequent Injury Trust Fund v. Muscogee Iron Works, </em>265 Ga. 790, 462 S.E.2d 367, 368 (1995) (recognizing that under Georgia law, attorneys\u2019 fees are allowed where authorized by statute or contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>by 9 th Cir.
