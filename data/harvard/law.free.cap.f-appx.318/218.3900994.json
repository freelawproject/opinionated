The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2006). The magistrate judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed without prejudice for Penland\u2019s failure to perfect service of process and advised Pen-land that failure to file specific objections to this recommendation would waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Penland did not specifically object to the dispositive portion of the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>United States v. Midgette, </em>478 F.3d 616, 621-22 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Penland has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. Further, we deny Penland\u2019s motion to void her plea agreement with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
