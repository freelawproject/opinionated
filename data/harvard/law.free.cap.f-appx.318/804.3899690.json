As relevant to this appeal, following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion, Brewer filed the instant motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied, relying on the law of the case doctrine, because we previously had denied Brewer relief on his \u00a7 2255 claims. The district court then granted Brewer a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) because it found \u201cjudicial disagreement\u201d over the validity of the law of the case doctrine. On appeal, Brewer argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Rule 60(b) motion, as it was a true Rule 60(b) motion that challenged the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion based on a procedural bar, and not a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Because of the limited scope of the COA, however, we will address only the court\u2019s denial of Brewer\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the law of the case doctrine.\u201d <em>Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Med., Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cUnder the law of the case doctrine, both district courts and appellate courts are generally bound by a prior appellate decision in the same case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1285-86. The doctrine operates to preclude courts from revisiting issues that were decided explicitly or by necessary implication in a prior appeal. <em>Luckey v. Miller, </em>929 F.2d 618, 621 (11th Cir.1991). It will bar us and the district courts from reconsidering an issue that we previously have decided, unless: (1) \u201cthe evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different;\u201d (2) \u201ccontrolling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues;\u201d or (3) \u201cthe decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1561 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>White v. Murtha, </em>377 F.2d 428, 431-32 (5th Cir.1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">We conclude that the law of the case doctrine precluded the district court from revisiting those issues that Brewer raised in his Rule 60(b) motion. Thus, the district court properly denied Brewer\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
