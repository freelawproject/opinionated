At his sentencing hearing, the district court, over the Government\u2019s objection, granted Gaskill a downward variance from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of fifteen to twenty-one months, and imposed a sentence of three years\u2019 probation with six months\u2019 home confinement. The Government has appealed Gaskill\u2019s sentence, asserting that the court erred in granting the downward variance. As explained below, we agree with the Government, and thus vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">On June 15, 2006, at the conclusion of a four-day trial, a jury in Raleigh convicted Gaskill of <em>a </em>single \u00a7 1001 offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That charge, contained in Count Four of a four-count indictment, specified that Gaskill had violated \u00a7 1001 by making (and aiding and abetting others in making) false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements to the Army Corps of Engineers (the \u201cCorps\u201d), by submitting and causing to be submitted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">written statements which claimed that the creation of [a] 730 foot channel in the Currituck Sound, near Corolla, North Carolina, resulted by accident, when, in fact, he knew that the channel [had been] intentionally dredged, and dredged spoil intentionally discharged, through prop washing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">J.A. 20.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Gaskill committed this criminal offense, he was serving as the Director of the Ferry Division of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (the \u201cNCDOT\u201d). The trial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was essentially as spelled out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">In 2003, the NCDOT was directed by the North Carolina legislature to establish a ferry service from Currituck, an unincorporated community in Currituck County on the mainland of North Carolina, east-wardly across the Currituck Sound to Corolla, a small community in the same county on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. As Director of the NCDOT\u2019s Ferry Division, Gaskill was charged with establishing the ferry service by May 2004. Together with officials of Currituck County\u2014which owned the land essential to establishing the ferry service\u2014Gaskill selected an area near the Whalehead Club in Corolla <em>for </em>the proposed ferry terminal. The part of the Currituck Sound lying adjacent to the Whalehead Club is known as the Whale-head Club Basin (the \u201cBasin\u201d). In order to establish a ferry service to the Corolla terminal, the Basin had to be dredged. Under applicable federal and state law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>however, such dredging activity could be legally undertaken only after issuance of permits by the Corps and the North Carolina Division of Coastal Management (commonly referred to as \u201cCAMA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL0\">Gaskill was familiar with the permitting processes of the Corps and CAMA, and wrote memoranda as early as 2002 to state and county officials specifying that the proper permits were essential to establishing the Corolla ferry terminal. As the land owner, Currituck County was responsible for obtaining such permits for the dredging of the Basin, but the county officials doubted whether the permits would be issued by the state and federal authorities because similar permits had been denied in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In February 2004, Bill Moore, who worked directly for Gaskill as Superintendent of Dredge and Field Maintenance for the Ferry Division, responded to Gaskill\u2019s question \u201cHow are we going to do this job?\u201d by advising Gaskill that his people would \u201cpush a barge in there, build a dock, and push it back out.\u201d J.A. 137. In other words, Moore intended to move an NCDOT vessel into the shallow waters of the Basin in a forward manner in order to excavate the bottom of the waterway to create a channel. According to Moore, Gaskill \u201cseemed okay\u201d with this suggestion. <em>Id. </em>at 138. Gaskill thereafter told another Ferry Division employee, however, that \u201cI didn\u2019t order those guys to do that dredging, but when Bill Moore made that statement, I knew [Moore] probably or could do something like that, and I didn\u2019t stop him, so that makes me partly responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">As of May 2004, no permit applications for dredging in the Basin had been submitted by the County to either the Corps or CAMA. Accordingly, no permits had been issued by either agency. On May 6 and 7, 2004, Moore nevertheless directed Ferry Division employees to utilize the propellers of two NCDOT vessels to excavate a channel in the Basin for use by the ferry service. The Division employees then used the NCDOT vessels to \u201cprop wash\u201d a channel in the Basin that was about four to five feet in depth, approximately 730 feet long by 30 feet wide, and included a turning basin approximately 110 feet long by 50 feet wide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Moore drove to Gaskill\u2019s office in More-head City on May 7, 2004, after the dredging had been completed, and informed Gaskill that he had directed Ferry Division employees to \u201ckick that channel out.\u201d J.A. 156. Neither Gaskill nor any other NCDOT personnel, however, informed the Corps or CAMA of those events. Nevertheless, the prop washing activity was almost immediately reported to the federal and state authorities by an anonymous third party. As a result, the Corps and CAMA initiated a joint federal-state investigation of the apparently illegal dredging activity. In responding to this investigation, Gaskill made the false statements that were used to secure his conviction for the \u00a7 1001 offense. These statements are explained further below.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">First of all, the Corps and CAMA made inquiries to the Ferry Division concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the dredging activities in the Basin. In formulating the Division\u2019s response to those inquiries, Gaskill, as the Division\u2019s Director, was instructed to conduct an internal review of the dredging activity. Gaskill asked Moore and other Division personnel to prepare written statements detailing the events that took place in the Basin on May 6 and 7, 2004. According to Moore, he was directed by Gaskill to \u201cget your story straight.\u201d J.A. 222. On June 23, 2004, Moore provided a letter to Gas-kill, in which Moore falsely said that a state vessel had accidently run aground in the Basin, unintentionally disturbing the sediment on its bottom.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">On June 25, 2004, after receiving Moore\u2019s letter, Gaskill submitted his proposed response to the NCDOT\u2019s Deputy Secretary (the \u201cResponse\u201d). On July 2, 2004, that Response was forwarded, together with Moore\u2019s letter and other materials, to the Corps. The Response falsely characterized the disturbance in the Basin as unintentional and as having a limited environmental impact. <em>See </em>J.A. 628 (representing to the Corps that \u201cneither Mr. Moore or the Ferry Division had any intention of deepening the channel, and any disturbance was unintentional\u201d). The Corps, upon receiving NCDOT\u2019s submission, which included the Response, continued to investigate the prop washing incident, seeking to identify and possibly prosecute those responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On June 28, 2004, CAMA investigators issued a Notice of Violation to the NCDOT, alleging that \u201c[i]t appears NCDOT is responsible for the unauthorized excavation of a channel\u201d within the Basin. J.A. 402. That same day, in a telephone interview with a CAMA investigator, Gaskill again falsely asserted that the NCDOT had not intentionally caused an environmental disturbance within the Basin. On July 6, 2004, Gaskill responded in writing to CAMA\u2019s Notice of Violation, sending it a letter\u2014substantially identical to the Response submitted to the Corps\u2014 again falsely maintaining that the prop washing activity in the Basin was unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Eventually, by notice to the Corps of August 23, 2004, the NCDOT reversed its position concerning the prop washing incident, and accepted full responsibility for the illegal dredging activities in the Basin on May 6 and 7, 2004. J.A. 366 (specifying that \u201c[the NCDOT] has investigated the activities of the Ferry Division and has determined that they were responsible for the unauthorized disturbance\u201d). Because the Corps does not perform restorative environmental work\u2014relying instead on the responsible party\u2014the four-month delay in identifying the responsible party resulted in a substantial amount of additional environmental harm in the Curri-tuck Sound that otherwise could have been mitigated or avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Gaskill testified in his own defense at trial, asserting that when the NCDOT submitted his Response to the Corps on July 2, 2004, he was unaware of the actual facts relating to the Ferry Division\u2019s prop washing activities in the Basin. He also said that he was unaware of those facts when the separate exculpatory submission was made to CAMA on July 6, 2004. In fact, Gaskill told the jury that he did not learn of the intentional nature of those activities until mid-July 2004, after his denials had been submitted to the Corps and CAMA. Gaskill denied providing any false information concerning the incident to the Corps or CAMA, and asserted that he had contacted them immediately upon learning of the prop washing activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u2022 On cross-examination, however, the prosecution confronted Gaskill with evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>dence contradicting his direct testimony, including his admission to a federal investigator on August 26, 2004, that Moore \u201ccame clean\u201d with him on June 25, 2004, concerning the intentional prop washing in the Basin. In view of these multiple contradictions, and on the basis of the other evidence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the jury rejected Gaskill\u2019s exculpatory version of the prop washing incident. Gaskill was thus convicted of the \u00a7 1001 offense in Count Four of the indictment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">After Gaskill\u2019s trial and conviction, a presentence report (the \u201cPSR\u201d) was prepared, and it recommended a Sentencing Guidelines base offense level of 14. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2J1.2 (2006). The PSR also recommended a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, predicated on Gas-kill\u2019s perjured trial testimony. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. As stated in the PSR, the final offense level of 16, combined with a criminal history category of I, yielded an advisory sentencing range of twenty-one to twenty-seven months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In response to the PSR, Gaskill objected to an obstruction of justice enhancement. He also filed a \u201cMotion for Variance Sentence,\u201d asserting that a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range was appropriate. In the motion, Gaskill alleged that he had neither sanctioned, participated in, nor authorized the dredging; that he had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by his subordinate, Moore; and that his criminal conduct\u2014lying about the dredging\u2014was out of character and a singular lapse of judgment, i.e., aberrant behavior. In its written sentencing memorandum, the Government objected to Gas-kill\u2019s variance request, asserted that an adjustment for obstruction of justice was appropriate, and requested the imposition of a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">On March 20, 2007, the district court conducted the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court first sustained Gaskill\u2019s objection to the PSR\u2019s recommendation of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, concluding that the prosecution had \u201cnot satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that there was an obstruction of justice.\u201d J.A. 753.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court then determined that Gaskill\u2019s proper advisory sentencing range, predicated on a base offense level of 14 and a criminal history category of I, was fifteen to twenty-one months.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">The district court then turned to Gas-kill\u2019s request for a variance sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>granting a downward variance and sentencing him to three years\u2019 probation with six months\u2019 home confinement. The court also ordered Gaskill to perform 150 hours of community service and pay a $5000 fine. The Statement of Reasons filed by the court with respect to the sentence did not explain the basis for the variance sentence, nor did it select or emphasize any of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors as justifying such a variance. Instead, the Statement of Reasons provided that \u201c[t] he defendant\u2019s motion for variance is granted by the court.\u201d J.A. 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The Government has timely noted this appeal, challenging the sentence and seeking to have it vacated. We possess jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Generally, in order to determine whether a sentencing court has abused its discretion, we apply a two-step analysis. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. First, we examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural errors,\u201d and, second, we evaluate the substance of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>In assessing procedural reasonableness, we examine whether the sentencing court properly calculated the Guidelines range, whether it treated the Guidelines as mandatory, whether it considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and whether it selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">If there are no procedural errors, we proceed to consider the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). In evaluating a sentence that falls within a properly calculated Guidelines range, we may\u2014but are not obliged to\u2014apply a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Where, as here, the sentence falls outside the advisory Guidelines range, we \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">The sentence imposed on Gaskill is flawed in that the sentencing court procedurally erred by failing to fully consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately explain the sentence imposed, as required by \u00a7 3553(c). We explain further below.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gall v. United States </em>identified two potential pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>cedural problems with respect to a sentencing court\u2019s assessment of the relevant sentencing factors. <em>See </em>128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97 (2007). First, \u201cafter giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate,\u201d a sentencing court should \u201cconsider all of the \u00a7 3558 factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596. Significantly, \u00a7 3553(a) mandates that a sentencing court consider the statute\u2019s enumerated factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a) (\u201cThe court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider [the \u00a7 3553(a) factors].\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 323 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cA district court must ... consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in every case, regardless of whether the sentence imposed is within the Guidelines range.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, a sentencing court need not accord equal weight to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it is \u201cquite reasonable for the sentencing court to have attached great weight to a single factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 476 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Second, after determining the appropriate sentence, a sentencing court \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (directing sentencing court to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence\u201d). As we have explained, however, a sentencing court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection,\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006), and we have ourselves matched a sentencing court\u2019s reasons\u2014 when not couched in the precise language of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2014to an appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) factor, <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 658 (4th Cir.2007). Significantly, a sentencing court\u2019s \u201cexplanation of a variance sentence must be tied to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 122-23 (4th Cir.2007). Moreover, notwithstanding our deferential standard for review, it is well established that a sentence well outside the advisory Guidelines range \u201cshould be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">At Gaskill\u2019s sentencing, the district court did not explicitly state that it had considered any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Significantly, the court did not address the Government\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) contentions on the nature of the offense, the characteristics of the defendant, or the importance of affording adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. Additionally, the court failed to assess Gaskill\u2019s contentions\u2014presented in his variance motion\u2014that he had neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>sanctioned, participated in, nor authorized the dredging; that he had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Moore; and that his criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The sentencing court observed that, although both Gaskill and the Government had made arguments concerning the appropriate sentence, other factors would also be considered. <em>See </em>J.A. 764 (\u201cI\u2019m going to give both defendants a sentence in a minute, but as the referee, I think it would be unjust for the sentence to be grounded only in what the two sides say, because I think that grossly distorts what\u2019s going on in this case.\u201d). In order to determine whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we assess the other factors discussed by the court, placing them into two broad categories: the \u201cdredging comments\u201d and the \u201cpublic service comment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In its dredging comments, the court stated that it was \u201ccommitted to restoring and preserving- ... the environment\u201d in coastal North Carolina, but that \u201cthe whole mosaic of the environment\u201d should be considered. J.A. 764. The court noted that, in assessing the impact to this \u201cdelicate and precious resource,\u201d consideration should be given to the roles of \u201cthe national government, the United States, and the state of North Carolina.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763. The court highlighted the fact that Gaskill did not simply \u201con a Saturday afternoon, decide[ ] to go out, [and] on a lark do something that impacted the environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201c[t]his was the state of North Carolina, through all its agencies and resources, doing this as official policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the court observed that the ferry services provided by North Carolina are \u201ccritical, essential, life-saving and life-preserving and life-generating lines between coastal areas, islands, and the people who live there.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">Thus, although the sentencing court recognized that environmental damage to the Basin was \u201cunfortunate and reprehensible,\u201d it tempered that observation by stating that such damage \u201cneeds to be seen in the context of everything that\u2019s going on in coastal North Carolina.\u201d J.A. 765. The court then stated that \u201c[t]he state necessarily and properly remediated the damage. Was there a long-term permanent effect? Yes, I think so, based on what I\u2019ve read. Is that unfortunate? Yes. Is there anything more that can be done? Probably nature needs to take its course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The dredging comments thus only address the nature and circumstances of the <em>prop washing </em>incident in the Basin. They do not reach or address the nature and circumstances of Gaskill\u2019s \u00a7 1001 <em>false statements offense, </em>and cannot be characterized as addressing any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor. As a result, the dredging comments are not linked to the history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>and characteristics of Gaskill personally, to the nature and circumstances of his \u00a7 1001 offense, or to any other factor specified in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Turning to the public service comment, the sentencing court recognized that Gas-kill had served in a supervisory capacity for the state and had a long history of public service. The court observed that Gaskill had \u201cprovided extensive public service in his job as director of the ferry service\u201d and that he had served in a management capacity as a state employee with significant responsibilities. J.A. 766. This comment appears to bear on the factor identified in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d -See <em>Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d at 122 (explaining that sentencing court \u201c \u2018may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law' \u201d (quoting USSG \u00a7 1B1.4)). Accordingly, the public service comment indicates that the court partially considered one aspect\u2014 the history and characteristics of the defendant\u2014of one factor under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In the absence of some indication that the sentencing court considered all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we are unable to conclude that it complied with its \u00a7 3553 mandate. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201cdistrict court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication ... that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). First, the court did not explicitly state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or address the parties\u2019 arguments addressing such factors. Second, in these circumstances, we accept the proposition that the sentencing court primarily considered the factors it placed on the record at the sentencing hearing\u2014i.e., the dredging comments and the public service comment\u2014in granting a downward variance. The court\u2019s implicit consideration of only a part of a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor, however, is insufficient to support the implication that it considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, the Statement of Reasons filed in connection with the sentencing did not explain the court\u2019s reasoning. In fact, the court did not identify <em>any </em>\u00a7 3553(a) factor in its Statement of Reasons as being supportive of a variance sentence. Because a sentencing court should provide a more substantial justification for a probationary sentence when the Advisory Guidelines call for an active sentence of imprisonment, such as in this case, we are unable to conclude that the award of a downward variance was proeedurally sound.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">.

At trial, the Government presented extensive evidence showing that Gaskill was aware, prior to responding to the Corps and CAMA, of the illegal nature of the dredging activities in the Basin. Moore testified that he told Gaskill of the illegal nature of the dredging on May 7, 2004. Gaskill\u2019s former secretary testified that, at a May 11, 2004 meeting, Gaskill stated that the Ferry Division had \u201cmade water\u201d in Corolla. Additionally, Charles Utz, another Division employee, testified that sometime before the end of June 2004, Gaskill showed him the CAMA Notice of Violation and an aerial photograph of the prop washed area. This evidence convinced Utz that the dredging could not have been an accident, but Gaskill nevertheless had him prepare the July 6, 2004 letter to CAMA, asserting Gaskill\u2019s exculpatory version of the facts. In all, eighteen witnesses testified for the Government. Gaskill himself, plus six character witnesses, testified for the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b279-14\">.

Upon motion of the Government, the execution of Gaskill's sentence has been stayed pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. Gaskill contends that his sentence can only be vacated if it constitutes plain error, because the Government waived any objection by failing to object following the imposition of the variance sentence. This contention is without merit. As we have previously recognized, the Government preserves its objection to a variance sentence by \"arguing for a sentence within the Guidelines range throughout the sentencing hearing.\" <em>United States v. Curry, </em>461 F.3d 452, 459 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Clark, </em>434 F.3d 684, 686 n. 1 (4th Cir.2006). The Government, in its sentencing memorandum and\u2019 at the sentencing hearing, advocated for a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">.

Did they call it an inlet? No. Why didn\u2019t they call it an inlet? They didn't call it an inlet because you can't close an inlet, but you can close a breach. So the government, state and federal, went hog wild, hard as they could, long as they could, dredging and pumping. Was that an environmentally positive or sound event? I don't know----Was there a political and policy commitment to keep a land road to Hatteras? You bet there was. Did that mean that that inlet was going to be closed? If in any way it was physically possible, that inlet was going to be closed, and there was no limit to what was going to happen until that happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">J.A. at 764-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">. Gaskill contends that the sentencing court incorporated the arguments that were made in his motion for a variance when the court stated that it was \"going to allow the defendant\u2019s motion for a variant sentence on Mr. Gaskill.\" <em>See </em>J.A. 766. The record reveals that, although the court granted Gaskill\u2019s motion, it did so without referring to Gaskill\u2019s asserted reasons in any way. We are, in these circumstances, unable to impute the contentions of the motion to the court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\">. On appeal, the Government has characterized the sentencing court\u2019s reliance on factors not cognizable under \u00a7 3553(a) as constituting procedural error. Br. of Appellant 27-30. So long as a sentencing court satisfies the procedural requirements delineated by the Supreme Court, however, a challenge to its reliance on improper factors is more appropriately considered under a substantive reasonableness analysis. <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.2006) (instructing that \"[a] sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court relies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>an improper factor\u201d); <em>see also United States v.

Having concluded that the court erred procedurally, we need not reach or assess the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
