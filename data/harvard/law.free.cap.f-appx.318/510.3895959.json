The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect this status.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-19\">We review the BIA\u2019s ruling on a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-20\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Petitioners\u2019 final orders of removal were entered on November 29, 2007. Because petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was filed on July 7, 2008, beyond the 90-day deadline, and petitioners have not contended that any exceptions to this time limit apply, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying their motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-21\">Accordingly, we summarily deny this petition for review in because the questions raised are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-22\">To the extent petitioners\u2019 challenge the BIA\u2019s decision declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen removal proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to review this portion of the order. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-23\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b534-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
