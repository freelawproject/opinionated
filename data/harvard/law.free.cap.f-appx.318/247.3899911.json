The Government has moved to dismiss Drake\u2019s appeal based upon a waiver of appellate rights in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We conclude that Drake\u2019s appeal of his sentence is barred by his waiver of appellate rights, except for his claim that his sentence was impermissibly based upon race. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we grant the motion to dismiss in part and dismiss the appeal of the claims not based on race. We also deny the motion to dismiss in part on the ground that Drake\u2019s claim of racial bias falls outside the scope of the waiver provision and affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Turning to the non-waived issue, Drake, an African American, contends that his career offender sentence was unreasonable, both because his Caucasian co-defendants received lighter sentences and because a study by the United States Sentencing Commission found that the career offender provision has a disparate impact on black males. We find Drake\u2019s arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">A district court must engage in a multistep process at sentencing. First, it must calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range. It then must consider the resulting range in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Courts of appeal review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008). In conducting this review, this court must first determine that the district court did not commit any</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\"><em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, and may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>Go, </em>517 F.3d at 218; <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">It is undisputed that Drake qualified as a career offender and that the district court properly calculated the advisory Guidelines range. The district court adequately contemplated the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the role Drake played in the offense in comparison to that of his co-defendants, and considered whether to impose a variance sentence before ultimately deciding to sentence Drake at the bottom of the Guidelines range. We find no evidence to support Drake\u2019s claim that his sentence impermissibly was based on race. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>481 F.3d 1113, 1115 (8th Cir.2007) (rejecting challenge to career offender sentence based on racially disparate impact of career offender provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">For these reasons, we dismiss in part and affirm in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
