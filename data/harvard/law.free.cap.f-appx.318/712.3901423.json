R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">Defendant Mostafa Mohd Khondaker was originally sentenced in 2006 for various drug and firearm offenses, including the possession of crack cocaine. Following the Sentencing Commission\u2019s 2007 amendment of the crack cocaine-related Sentencing Guidelines, Khondaker sought and was granted a modification of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). His request for a downward variance was denied. Khondaker now appeals his modified sentence, arguing that his modified sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred when explaining the law applicable to his request for a variance. Khondaker specifically relies upon <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), in challenging the district court\u2019s ruling. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b737-18\">On November 23, 2005, a jury found Khondaker guilty of four counts of possession with intent to distribute various controlled substances, including crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined Khondaker\u2019s offense level was 30. His Criminal History Category was I. The guideline range for the drug charges was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment, plus a consecutive mandatory statutory minimum sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>for the firearm charge. On August 9, 2006, the district court sentenced him to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment for the drug charges and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm charge, for a total of 157 months\u2019 imprisonment. Khondaker appealed his conviction and sentence, and we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Khondaker, </em>263 Fed.Appx. 693 (10th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">After Khondaker was sentenced, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the drug quantity. table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The effect of the amendment was to reduce the base offense levels for crack cocaine-related offenses by two levels. The amendment was made retroactive on March 3, 2008. <em>See United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 835 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Khondaker petitioned the court for a sentence reduction to take advantage of the amendment\u2019s retroactive effect, as permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and he also requested a downward variance. Under the amended guidelines, Khondaker\u2019s sentencing range was 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment for the drug-related charges. The consecutive statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm offense was unchanged, so the new guideline range for all offenses was 138 to 157 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court modified Khondaker\u2019s original sentence to 138 months\u2019 imprisonment, but denied Khondaker\u2019s request for a downward variance. In denying the request for a variance, the court cited Khon-daker\u2019s reliance on <em>Kimbrough </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWd\">[T]he only fact presented by defendant in support of a variance is the incongruous treatment of crack cocaine offenses in the sentencing guidelines and underlying statutory scheme. This broad, categorical argument is not convincing because sentencing decisions must be grounded in case-specific considerations, not a general disagreement with broad-based policies pronounced by Congress and the Sentencing Commission. A sentencing court cannot completely ignore the ratio differences between cocaine powder and crack cocaine because the advisory guideline range, which remains relevant under \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, and the statutory minimum and mandatory sentences reflect Congress\u2019 preferred ratio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZuN\">Order at 2-3. Khondaker contends that the district court procedurally erred in denying his motion for a downward variance because the court misstated the law by failing to follow <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ax5H\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">\u201cThe scope of a district court\u2019s authority in a resentencing proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d at 837. A district court has no authority to grant a variance from the amended crack cocaine guidelines at a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence modification proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 841 (holding that a sentencing court \u201clacked the authority to impose a modified sentence that fell below the amended guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Khondaker relies on <em>Kimbrough, </em>where the Supreme Court held that a sentencing judge at an original sentencing \u201cmay determine ... that, in the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to serve the objectives of sentencing\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a), based on the district court\u2019s disfavor of \u201cthe disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. He argues that the district court\u2019s misstatement of the law after <em>Kimbrough </em>renders his modified sentence procedurally unreasonable. However, we need not proceed with an in-depth critique of the district court\u2019s analysis of <em>Kimbrough. </em>By addressing <em>Kimbrough </em>at all, the district court afforded Khondaker more than he was entitled. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3) (providing that \u201cproceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant\u201d). Since the court had no authority to grant Khondaker\u2019s request for a variance below the amended guideline range, any error the district court may have made when explaining its decision to deny the request for a variance is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Khondaker also argues that the district court retains discretion to vary below the amended guideline range at sentence modification proceedings because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which made the sentencing guidelines advisory. He relies on the rationale set forth in <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167, 1170-71 (9th Cir.2007). However, we specifically rejected this reasoning in <em>Rhodes. See </em>549 F.3d at 840 <em>(\u201cBooker </em>simply has no bearing, on sentencing modification proceedings conducted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d). A district court\u2019s discretion when modifying a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is limited to the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. Khondaker acknowledges that his argument is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">foreclosed by <em>[Rhodes], </em>which ruled that a district court could not apply a sentence lower than the minimum of the revised Guideline range. The judge panel assigned to this case is bound to follow <em>Rhodes </em>and cannot revisit the law established therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Aplt.
