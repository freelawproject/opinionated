The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect this status.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>This is a petition for review from the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) June 18, 2008 decision denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen and reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We have reviewed the record, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition, and the opposition thereto. We conclude that summary disposition is appropriate because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The regulations provide that a party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision, and such motion \u201cmust be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). The regulations also provide that \u201ca party may file only one motion to reopen,\u201d and that the motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion, filed more than three years after the BIA entered the final order of removal, as untimely. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, because petitioners had filed two previous motions to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as number-barred. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b526-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
