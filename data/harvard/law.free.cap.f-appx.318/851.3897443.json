According to appellants, H.B. 89 overrides the City of Atlanta\u2019s longstanding policy prohibiting visitors to the Airport from carrying firearms. Appellees, in their answer, asserted that H.B. 89 does not apply to the Airport and that, if it did apply, H.B. 89 would be preempted by the pervasive scheme of federal law and regulations governing airport security.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Appellees moved the district court for judgment on the pleadings. In a comprehensive order entered on September 26, 2008, 602 F.Supp.2d 1281, the district court held that H.B. 89 does not apply to the Airport. It therefore granted appel-lees\u2019 motion and dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint. Appellants now appeal, arguing that contrary to the district court\u2019s holding, H.B. 89 does apply to the Airport. We reject their argument, concluding for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s September 26 order that appellants\u2019 argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
