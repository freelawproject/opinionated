We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">Zapata\u2019s petition is untimely even after applying the statutory tolling provision in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), which tolls the running of the one-year statute of limitations until \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d The factual predicate for Zapata\u2019s claims\u2014his co-defendant\u2019s parole\u2014could have been discovered as early as May 1, 2003, the date of parole, through the exercise of due diligence. Zapata undertook no investigation at all between May 2003 and September 2004, despite long suspecting his claim of prosecutorial misconduct would come to pass in the form of his co-defendant\u2019s early release from prison and despite having procured the help of private investigators and others in the past to confirm his co-defendant\u2019s status. His failure to investigate does not meet the due diligence standard and thus his October 25, 2005 federal habeas petition was filed long after the statute of limitations had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">Although evidentiary hearings are generally favored in habeas proceedings, one need not be held when the state court record alone suffices to show no entitlement to relief. <em>See Totten v. Merkle, </em>137 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.1998); <em>see also Sckriro v. Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). The parties do not dispute any of the facts recounted in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and do not assert that additional evidence would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>brought to light by an evidentiary hearing. The state court record suffices to show Zapata failed to exercise due diligence when, from May 2008 to September 2004, he undertook no investigation at all into his co-defendant\u2019s incarceration status. An evidentiary hearing would be but a \u201cfutile exercise.\u201d <em>Totten, </em>137 F.3d at 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b568-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
