Petitioner argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to strike a specific juror. The district court did not err; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">In August 2002, Petitioner was charged with one count of first-degree murder. During voir dire, a potential juror, Ms. Drajem (\u201cDrajem\u201d), was asked whether she would be able to follow the court\u2019s instructions during trial. She responded \u201cI think so.\u201d To another question about following the law as instructed by the trial judge, Drajem responded, \u201cAll I can do\u2014 I\u2019d say I could try. I can\u2019t say for sure, but I would try.\u201d Drajem was selected as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">After the jury was selected, the judge asked Petitioner if he was satisfied. Petitioner expressed some discomfort over the racial make-up of the jury. Nevertheless, after conferring with his lawyer, Petitioner said that he was satisfied with the jury-selection process. The jury ultimately found Petitioner guilty of second-degree murder, and the court sentenced Petitioner to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">After Petitioner\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, he filed a motion for state postconviction relief. The state court denied all six claims in Petitioner\u2019s petition. In denying Petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court found\u2014after reviewing the record\u2014that, although juror Drajem \u201cmay have expressed uncertainty in regards to following a law that she did not agree with[,] she was properly rehabilitated by the State.\u201d Because Petitioner voiced no objection to juror Drajem during voir dire, and because any alleged lack of fitness was rehabilitated, the state court deemed effective Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">In federal court, Petitioner timely filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habe-as corpus; the district court denied it, and later denied Petitioner\u2019s Certificate of Ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). A few months later, however, this Court granted a COA on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred in finding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to strike a juror.\u201d-</p>\n<p id=\"A8x\">When examining a district court\u2019s denial of a section 2254 habeas petition, we review a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\u2014a mixed question of law and <em>fact\u2014de novo. See Payne v. Allen, </em>539 F.3d 1297, 1312 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the state court reviewed Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the merits, to obtain federal habeas corpus .relief Petitioner must show that the state-court adjudication (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established law, or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Petitioner argues that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance when his trial counsel did not object to Drajem, thereby impairing Petitioner\u2019s fair trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, Petitioner argues, this Court should not defer to the state court because the state court\u2019s finding that Drajem was rehabilitated was an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Drajem expressed on trial-transcript pages fifty-nine and sixty ambivalence about her ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions. Yet the state court pointed to transcript page twenty-eight to demonstrate Drajem\u2019s rehabilitation. Petitioner maintains that a juror could not have been rehabilitated before she was revealed as potentially unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Petitioner is correct to the extent that the state court cited page twenty-eight as part of Drajem\u2019s rehabilitation. Petitioner fails to note, however, that Drajem\u2019s rehabilitation is evident even after the ambivalence expressed on page sixty\u2014something the district court expressly noted in its order denying Petitioner habeas relief. On page sixty-one, for example, the prosecutor asked prospective jurors if they could follow the law on the charged offense, \u201ceven if it\u2019s not what you thought it was or even if you may not agree with it[.]\u201d The prospective jurors, including Drajem, affirmatively responded. Later in the transcript, at pages 118\u201419, the judge and defense counsel asked prospective jurors if they could follow the judge\u2019s instructions on the law. Three jurors expressed concern before affirming that they could follow the judge\u2019s instructions. Juror Drajem was not one of the jurors who expressed this concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">Here, the record supports the state court\u2019s finding that Drajem was rehabilitated: she affirmed that she could follow the judge\u2019s instructions; she exhibited no bias against Petitioner; and she expressed that she was capable of applying the law as instructed by the court. That the state court cited incorrect transcript pages when the substance of the whole transcript sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>ports the state court\u2019s conclusion does not render the state court\u2019s determination unreasonable. Thus, the state court\u2019s determination that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was effective was reasonable, and this Court should defer to it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Because the state-court finding and conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s counsel was effective was, in fact, reasonable, the district court did not err by reaching the same conclusion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s section 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-13\">. This claim is the same claim now before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that a reasonable probability existed that but for counsel's unprofessional conduct, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-68, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">. Petitioner cites distinguishable cases for the proposition that a prospective juror response of \"yeah, I think so\u201d raises doubts about that juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial. <em>See Brown v. State, </em>728 So.2d 758, 759 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999) (court abused discretion by denying defense challenge to juror for cause); <em>Peters v. State, </em>874 So.2d 677, 680 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (reversing domestic-violence conviction where juror said she could be impartial but admitted that she was traumatized by domestic abuse she had previously suffered).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
