See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meuse, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 772 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>At trial, Eric Schneider, a significant prosecution witness who had pleaded guilty, testified pursuant to a plea agreement. The Appeals Court considered the prosecutor\u2019s comments on Schneider\u2019s credibility in light of what we stated concerning testimony pursuant to plea agreements in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 264-265 (1989). The Appeals Court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s argument improperly suggested that the State police could determine whether Schneider was lying and that, with that leverage over him, Schneider necessarily told the truth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meuse, supra </em>at 773-774. The Appeals Court further concluded that the judge\u2019s jury instructions did not cure the prosecutor\u2019s error. We agree with the Appeals Court. Because there must be a new trial, we also consider two issues likely to arise at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">1. In its argument to this court concerning further appellate review, the Commonwealth does not defend the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s obviously improper vouching for the truthfulness of Schneider\u2019s testimony. It argues, however, that the judge cured the prosecutor\u2019s improprieties by his instructions to the jury. We agree with the Appeals Court that, because of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the judge\u2019s instructions could have been curative only if he specifically instructed the jury that the government did not and could not know whether Schneider was telling the truth. <em>Id. </em>at 775. The judge\u2019s instruction that the prosecutor\u2019s remark (about the use of the police to determine Schneider\u2019s truthfulness) was none of the jury\u2019s business and should be disregarded <em>(id.), </em>failed to neutralize the prosecutor\u2019s error. The jury should have been told additionally, in some form of words, that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">When a prosecution witness testifies pursuant to a plea agreement containing a promise to tell the truth, and the jury are aware of the promise, the judge should warn the jury that the government does not know whether the witness is telling the truth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, supra </em>at 264. Although a failure to instruct, standing alone, would not be reversible error (cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>415 Mass. 680, 687 [1993]), if the prosecutor has vouched for that witness\u2019s credibility, such a failure to instruct is reversible error. The prosecutor\u2019s comment was not a permissible response to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor had no specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>means of determining whether Schneider was telling the truth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, 399 </em>Mass. 514, 519-520 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">2. The Appeals Court did not discuss appellate issues that are likely to arise at a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The defendants argue that Schneider should not have been permitted to testify because his plea agreement required him, as a condition of its enforcement, \u201cto take whatever action is deemed necessary and appropriate by the Commonwealth to produce a prosecutable case against\u201d the defendants. The claim is that Schneider was obligated to give testimony that would result in convictions. We have indicated that a plea agreement made contingent on obtaining a conviction, as a result of the witness\u2019s testimony, would be too great an inducement to the witness and would not meet the test of fundamental fairness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 261-262 n.5 (1989). A \u201cprosecutable case,\u201d however, does not mean a conviction. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>778 F.2d 1380, 1385 (9th Cir. 1985), modified on other grounds, 791 F.2d 707 (9th Cir. 1986). Although those words are better left out of a plea agreement (see <em>id.), </em>they do not alone require that testimony pursuant to a plea agreement be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">If the prosecutor wants to have the white plastic hockey mask identified as similar to one worn during the robbery, the jury should be made aware that the mask is used only for illustrative purposes and has no direct connection with the case. Other issues argued are insubstantial or not likely to arise at the new trial, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AP2\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
