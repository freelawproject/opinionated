Still, was employed as a senior nurse\u2019s aide at a nursing home. On January 12, 1993, she was discharged by her employer for swearing at a patient, in violation of the employer\u2019s patient care policies and rules for employee conduct. Still filed a claim for unemployment benefits with the Department of Employment and Training (department), and a department claims service representative determined that she was disqualified from receiving such benefits. She requested a hearing before a department review examiner, who concluded that Still had knowingly violated a reasonable and uniformly enforced company rule or policy, and was therefore disqualified from receiving benefits under the provisions of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) (1994 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Still applied for further consideration by the department\u2019s board of review (board), which also denied her application. She then sought judicial review of the decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A District Court judge upheld the board\u2019s decision. Still appealed, and the Appeals Court vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment and held that Still\u2019s conduct did not, as matter of law, disqualify her from receiving benefits. 39 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (1995). We granted the application of the commissioner of the department (commissioner) for further appellate review. We conclude that Still is not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits and reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The facts concerning Still\u2019s employment and discharge, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>contained in the examiner\u2019s findings, and in testimony which he found to be credible, are not in dispute. Still is an African-American woman who had been employed for four years at the nursing home, and was a senior nurse\u2019s aide at the time of her discharge. Her employer had a written policy, contained in an employee handbook, that patients were to be free from mental and physical abuse, and that employees could be discharged for inconsiderate treatment of patients and for rude, discourteous, or uncivil behavior. Still was aware of these policies; she had received a copy of the handbook, and had attended training sessions on dealing with combative and demanding patients. She was aware that other employees had been discharged for patient abuse. Before the incident, Still herself had never been accused of, or disciplined for, any abusive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">On Saturday, January 9, 1993, Still worked a double shift, beginning at 7 a.m. During the morning, she went to provide care to a male patient who was known by staff and administrators for being angry and argumentative, and for often uttering racial slurs. The patient called Still names and ordered her to leave the room; she did so, and reported the situation to her supervisor. For the rest of the day, the patient made abusive remarks to Still and to other employees who entered or passed by his room. In order to avoid contact with the patient, Still changed assignments so that another aide would provide the patient\u2019s scheduled afternoon care. About 4 p.m., Still entered the patient\u2019s room to care for his roommate; the curtain between the patients was partially closed. The patient called Still a \u201cfat, lazy, black bitch.\u201d Still responded by calling the patient a \u201cmother fucker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Two days later, Still\u2019s outburst was reported to the employer by another employee. When Still arrived for work the next day (January 12, 1993), she was discharged for \u201cswearing at a [patient].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">At issue is whether the conduct for which Still was discharged disqualifies her from receiving unemployment benefits, in accordance with c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). That statute provides that an employee is disqualified if substantial and credible evidence shows that the discharge was attributable either to \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest,\u201d or to \u201ca knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>employer, provided that such violation is not shown to be as a result of the employee\u2019s incompetence.\u201d The examiner concluded that Still\u2019s action, although constituting misconduct, had not been \u201cdeliberate,\u201d because \u201cit was not done with forethought,\u201d and that the conduct had been \u201cprovoked\u201d by the patient. Nonetheless, the examiner concluded that Still had \u201cknowingly violated a reasonable and uniformly enforced company rule or policy,\u201d and was disqualified from receiving benefits. In support of this conclusion, the examiner stated that Still \u201cknew of the rule or policy by having been issued a copy of [such rules] and having been instructed regarding them and avoidance of violations thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Still contends that this decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of the statutory term \u201cknowing violation.\u201d She argues that the statute requires a finding of intent on the part of the employee to violate the employer\u2019s rule, and argues further that the examiner\u2019s decision that she had \u201cknowingly violated\u201d company policy is contradicted by his conclusion that her action had not been \u201cdeliberate\u201d or \u201cdone with forethought.\u201d The commissioner contends that Still\u2019s admission (that she had prior knowledge of the employer\u2019s policy and understood the consequences of violating it) is sufficient to establish that she \u201cknowingly violated the policy,\u201d and that the commissioner may disqualify an employee on this basis without a showing that the employee intended to violate the rule or policy (as contrasted with the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d test, which does require a finding of intent). The statutory meaning of \u201cknowing violation\u201d is, thus, the sole legal issue which we must address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">We have not, until now, considered the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>term \u201cknowing violation\u201d in \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cknowing violation\u201d test was added to the statute by St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19; prior to that amendment, the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d test had been the only basis on which a discharged employee could be disqualified from receiving benefits. The meaning of \u201cknowing violation\u201d must be examined in the context of established principles underlying the unemployment insurance system, as well as our prior decisions interpreting the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The unemployment compensation statute itself directs that G. L. c. 151A \u201cshall be construed liberally in aid of its purpose, which purpose is to lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his family.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74 (1994 ed.). Benefits are to be paid to \u201cpersons who are out of work and unable to secure work through no fault of their own.\u201d <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>333 Mass. 244, 248 (1955). If an employer contests the eligibility of a discharged employee to receive unemployment benefits, the issue is not whether the employee had been discharged for good cause, but whether the Legislature intended to deny benefits in the circumstances presented by the case. See <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>375 Mass. 434, 436 (1978). Even if an employee leaves a position on his own initiative, he is still not disqualified if he can show \u201cgood cause for leaving attributable to the employing unit or its agent,\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(1), or can establish that \u201chis reasons for leaving were for such an urgent, compelling and necessitous nature as to make his separation involuntary.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e), </em>second par. In accordance with the directives of \u00a7 74, the grounds for disqualification in \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) are considered to be exceptions or defenses to an eligible employee\u2019s right to benefits, and the burdens of production and persuasion rest with the employer. See <em>Cantres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>396 Mass. 226, 229-232 (1985). See also <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 351, 352 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>(1984) (Any \u201cstatutory opaqueness\u201d should be construed favorably to the unemployed worker).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Prior to the 1992 amendment to \u00a7 25 <em>(e) (2), </em>\u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard\u201d of an employer\u2019s interest was the only basis for disqualifying a discharged employee from receiving benefits. The phrase denotes \u201cintentional conduct or inaction which the employee knew was contrary to the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Goodridge, supra </em>at 436. In decisions interpreting this provision, we have concluded that the Legislature\u2019s purpose was \u201cto deny benefits to a claimant who has brought about his own unemployment through intentional disregard of standards of behavior which his employer has a right to expect. When a worker is ill-equipped for his job or has a good faith lapse in judgment or attention, any resulting conduct contrary to the employer\u2019s interest is unintentional; a related discharge is not the worker\u2019s intentional fault, and there is no basis under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) for denying benefits..\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 97 (1979). The denial of benefits therefore requires evidence as to \u201cthe claimant\u2019s state of mind in performing the acts that cause his discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The provision requires a two-part analysis: both \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d and \u201cwilful disregard\u201d of the employer\u2019s interest must be shown in order to disqualify the employee, and the employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of the misconduct is an issue for both parts. <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 206, 208-209 (1984). An employee may engage in deliberate misconduct, and yet do so without engaging in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, and consequently not be disqualified from benefits. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>392 Mass. 148, 149-151 (1984) (\u201cwilful disregard\u201d not shown where employee who refused to follow a supervisor\u2019s order believed that other work he was performing was of \u201cparamount importance\u201d to his employer); <em>Jean, supra </em>at 209 (state of mind for \u201cwilful disregard\u201d not shown, where employee who lacked proficiency in English may have misunderstood instructions or consequences of failing to follow them). To determine whether the employee\u2019s state of mind demonstrated \u201cwilful disregard\u201d of the employer\u2019s interest, the factfinder must \u201ctake into account the worker\u2019s knowledge of the employer\u2019s expectation, the reasonableness of that expectation and the presence of any mitigating fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>tors.\u201d <em>Garfield, supra </em>at 97. See <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>399 Mass. 737 (1987); <em>Wedgewood </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 30 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The 1992 amendment to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), created a new basis for disqualification: a \u201cknowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer, provided that such violation is not shown to be as a result of the employee\u2019s incompetence.\u201d A key issue for interpretation is how the Legislature intended the \u201cknowing violation\u201d test to be differentiated from the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d test, particularly with regard to their respective state-of-mind requirements. The commissioner contends that requiring the showing of an intent to violate the employer\u2019s rule or policy would make the \u201cknowing violation\u201d test indistinguishable in its effect from the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d test, a result that would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s purpose in adding the new provision. Still argues that, if the Legislature had wished the \u201cknowing violation\u201d provision to apply to unintentional conduct, it would have done so more explicitly. (Moreover, it is observed that the Legislature did not use such wording as \u201ca violation of a known rule.\u201d) Still further contends that \u201cknowing\u201d means \u201cintentional,\u201d and a state of mind requirement therefore exists for the first element of both disqualifying tests. The crucial difference between the two tests, Still argues, is that a subjective state of mind inquiry must be made to satisfy the \u201cwilful disregard\u201d element of the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d test, but the employer need only prove the objective existence of \u201ca reasonable and uniformly enforced rule [or policy]\u201d to establish the second element of the \u201cknowing violation\u201d test. In her particular case, Still points out that no finding was made that she intentionally violated the employer\u2019s policy; indeed, the examiner found that her actions were <em>not </em>deliberate, and were \u201cprovoked\u201d by the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Legislative history of the 1992 amendment to \u00a7 25 (e) (2) suggests that the Legislature intended to broaden the grounds for benefit disqualification, but did not intend to eliminate altogether the state of mind requirement in the existing stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>ute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The legislative record does not indicate the intended meaning of the term \u201cknowing violation\u201d in \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For guidance, we may consider the ordinary usage of the word \u201cknowing,\u201d as well as the interpretation of the phrase \u201cknowing violation\u201d as it is used in other statutory contexts. \u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">An act is done \u201cknowingly\u201d if it \u201cis [the] product of conscious design, intent or plan that it be done, and is done with awareness of probable consequences.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 872 (6th ed. 1990).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consistent with this definition, the term \u201cknowing violation,\u201d when used in other civil statutes, has required a showing of intent on the actor\u2019s part. For example, decisions construing the multiple damages provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>sions of G. L. c. 93A (1994 ed.) have imposed such damages for \u201cwilful\u201d or \u201cknowing\u201d violations, equating the former with reckless conduct and the latter with intentional acts. See <em>International Fidelity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 854-855 (1983); <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388 (1979); <em>Computer Sys. Eng\u2019g, Inc. </em>v. <em>Qantel Corp., </em>571 F. Supp. 1365, 1373-1377 (D. Mass. 1983). Decisions interpreting discrimination statutes have similarly indicated that a \u201cknowing violation\u201d requires an intent to violate the law, and not merely an intent to commit the act that is a violation. See <em>Andover Newton Theological Sch., Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>409 Mass. 350, 351-352 (1991). See also <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 321-322 (1993). In view of the meaning given to the term \u201cknowing,\u201d it would be an anomalous result to subject a party to the severe sanction of multiple damages for intentional conduct, but to disqualify a person from unemployment benefits for a violation of an employer\u2019s rule or policy that is unintentional. We conclude that, in the context of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), \u201cknowing\u201d implies some degree of intent, and that a discharged employee is not disqualified unless it can be shown that the employee, at the time of the act, was consciously aware that the consequence of the act being committed was a violation of an employer\u2019s reasonable rule or policy. This principle was aptly stated by the Appeals Court in its ultimate holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">\u201c[W]hat must be proved at an irreducible minimum is intentionality in the form of (a) consciousness on the part of the employee of what it is she is doing and (b) awareness that she is in the process of violating a rule or policy of the employer. The dictionary definitions and decisional precedent agree in according \u2018knowing\u2019 that basic intentional, cognitive content. It cannot apply, as contended by the employer and determined by the review examiner, to conduct that is unintentional by virtue of being involuntary, accidental, or inadvertent.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 39 Mass. App. Ct. at 510.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>In concluding that Still had not engaged in \u201cdeliberate misconduct,\u201d the review examiner stated that Still\u2019s verbal abuse of the patient \u201cwas not done with forethought and therefore can not be considered to have been deliberate.\u201d While the degree of intent involved in a \u201cknowing violation\u201d does not necessarily involve \u201cforethought,\u201d the review examiner\u2019s conclusion that Still had not acted deliberately is relevant to assessing whether she committed a \u201cknowing\u201d violation. Still\u2019s testimony (found by review examiner as \u201ccredible\u201d) supports a conclusion that she lacked the state of mind required to find a \u201cknowing\u201d violation: \u201c[W]e\u2019d been having problems all day and he\u2019d been calling me names and been cursing me out .... So, when I went into the room later on that evening to do his room mate, I Was in the room and he called me another derogatory name, and by this time, I had had it because I\u2019d had a rough day, and I just said what I said, not thinking, and'it wasn\u2019t intentionally. I .didn\u2019t go down there with the intent of swearing at [the patient], because normally I do not swear, but it just came out. ... I said what I said before I even realized what I\u2019d said. ... I was not thinking about being discharged. ... I know there\u2019s a policy, but I wasn\u2019t thinking about it at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Even if we were to accept, for the sake of argument, that Still was consciously aware that she was engaging in the act of verbal abuse, the evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion that Still acted with awareness of the probable consequences of her act, namely, the violation of her employer\u2019s rule or policy. In concluding that a knowing violation had occurred, the examiner relied solely on Still\u2019s prior knowledge of the rule or policy, and not on evidence of her intent to commit a violation. Still\u2019s conduct was, as the Appeals Court described it, \u201cin the nature of a spontaneous, emotional reaction rather than culpable conscious action performed with an awareness of its character, circumstances and consequences.\u201d 39 Mass. App. Ct. at 512. It was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>substance on her part a serious, but nonetheless, a \u201cgood faith lapse in judgment or attention.\u201d <em>Garfield, supra </em>at <em>91.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The commissioner has properly expressed a concern that the language of the Appeals Court\u2019s decision would entitle a discharged employee to receive benefits in spite of a knowing violation, whenever the existence of fatigue, stress, or other \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d could be shown. See <em>id. </em>at 507, 511-512.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He argues that employees would, in effect, be able to use such mitigating circumstances to excuse a knowing violation. To address this concern, we conclude that mitigating circumstances alone will not negate a showing of intent or thereby excuse a \u201cknowing violation.\u201d These circumstances may, however, serve as some indication of an employee\u2019s state of mind, and may aid the factfinder in determining whether a \u201cknowing violation\u201d has occurred: they may, in some cases, offer support for a conclusion that the employee\u2019s act was essentially spontaneous and unplanned. For example, an employee who violates an employer\u2019s policy by using abusive language, with conscious awareness of the act, and its probable consequences, has committed a \u201cknowing\u201d violation, regardless of circumstances or prior work history. However, if the act occurred in response to provocation, or while the employee was under extreme stress, and the employee had never committed such an act previously, a factfinder might reasonably conclude that the employee had in fact acted unintentionally. Conversely, if the employee had used abusive language previously, and been warned of the consequences, this might indicate to the factfinder that the latest violation was intentional.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>In Still\u2019s case, the decision that was reached by the review examiner does not contain sufficient subsidiary findings to demonstrate that correct legal principles were applied. <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623, 626-627 (1984). His findings do not establish, by the \u201csubstantial and credible evidence\u201d required by \u00a7 25 (&lt;?) (2), that Still was discharged for a \u201cknowing violation\u201d of her employer\u2019s rule or policy, and she therefore may not be disqualified from receiving benefits on that basis. In the absence of these necessary findings, we would ordinarily reverse the District Court\u2019s decision and order that the District Court judge remand the case to the department for further findings. However, where a review examiner\u2019s decision not only fails to cite sufficient findings in support of his conclusion but also affirmatively sets forth subsidiary findings which compel the opposite conclusion, no good purpose is served by remanding the case for further findings. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., 392 </em>Mass. 148, 151 (1984). Here, the review examiner found that Still\u2019s remarks had been an \u201coutburst,\u201d occurring after Still had been \u201cprovoked\u201d by the patient\u2019s abusive language toward her. The review examiner also concluded that Still\u2019s testimony, in which she described her state of mind at the time of the incident, was \u201ccredible.\u201d These findings compel a conclusion that Still\u2019s discharge was not attributable to a knowing violation of her employer\u2019s reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and judgment shall be entered in the District Court remanding this case to the department for entry of an order awarding the plaintiff appropriate unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) (1994 ed.), provides that benefits shall not be paid to an individual who has left work \u201cby discharge shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner [of the department] by substantial and credible evidence to be attributable to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest, or to a knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer, provided that such violation is not shown to be as a result of the employee\u2019s incompetence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The review examiner is the authorized representative of the commissioner, and the review examiner\u2019s decision is therefore the commissioner\u2019s decision.

L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2), so as to clarify that \u201c[an employer\u2019s] rules must be reasonable in themselves and must not produce unreasonable results when measured against the objective circumstances surrounding their violation.\u201d The Appeals Court declined to address this argument, as it had not been raised below. We likewise shall not address this issue, for the same reason. See 39 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 503-504 n.3 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In two related cases involving the application of the \u201cknowing violation\u201d test, it was unnecessary to determine whether a rule had been violated \u201cknowingly,\u201d because there was a lack of evidence that the rule had been violated at all.

No. 2935 at 10. After the House passed the bill, the Senate adopted an amendment that would have replaced the existing \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d provision with less specific language: \u201cmisconduct connected with the individual\u2019s work.\u201d 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1464 at 14. A joint conference committee then proposed a version of the bill which restored the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d language and also contained the new \u201cknowing violation\u201d provision. This version was adopted by both houses. The Governor returned the bill unsigned with suggested changes, including a return to the broader language of the proposed Senate amendment, but both houses rejected the Governor\u2019s proposals and ultimately passed the bill over the Governor\u2019s veto. See 1992 House Doc. No. 5445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Still asserts that the Massachusetts provision was based on an identically worded Indiana statute, Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7 22-4-15-1 <em>(d) </em>(2) (Burns Supp. 1996). Even if the assertion is correct, the differences in structure and coverage between the Indiana and Massachusetts statutes mean that Indiana judicial interpretations of that State\u2019s statute are not helpful to us. See 39 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 504 n.4 (1995). We note that Kentucky also uses the same wording. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 341.370 (Michie 1995). Other States have, by judicial interpretation, subsumed \u201cknowing violation\u201d within the category of \u201cmisconduct,\u201d \u201cdeliberate\u201d misconduct, or \u201cjust cause.\u201d See <em>Kehl </em>v. <em>Board of Review of the Indus.

However, the quoted language is, we think, ambiguous: it could mean only that the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ployee must be aware of engaging in the conduct itself, and not necessarily that awareness is required, at the time of the conduct, that the conduct violates the rule.
