At issue is whether the nonresident insured of an insolvent insurer is entitled to indemnity from the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund (Fund) for the costs of defending and settling tort claims asserted against the insured by Massachusetts residents. The Fund denied indemnification on the ground that a nonresident insured\u2019s costs are not \u201ccovered claim[s]\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(a) </em>(1994 ed.). The insured, Clark Equipment Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(Clark), brought this action for declaratory and other relief. The case was submitted on cross motions for summary judgment. \u00c1 Superior Court judge entered judgment for the Fund. Clark appealed, and filed an application for direct appellate review. We granted Clark\u2019s application. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><em>Facts. </em>Clark is a Delaware corporation whose principal place of business is in Indiana. Prior to February 4, 1985, Clark\u2019s principal place of business was in Michigan. Clark is in the business of manufacturing and selling forklift trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">From September 30, 1981, through September 30, 1985, Clark was insured by The Insurance Company of North America (INA) under policies which provided up to $5 million per year in general liability coverage, and by Integrity Insurance Company (Integrity) under policies which provided an additional $6 million per year after the INA coverage was exhausted. The 1983-1984 INA coverage was exhausted on May 30, 1986, by the costs of defending and settling numerous product liability lawsuits in several States. Clark tendered the claims filed against it for the 1983-1984 policy year to Integrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">On March 24, 1987, a New Jersey \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction,\u201d G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (4) (1994 ed.), declared Integrity insolvent. Clark tendered all claims and lawsuits covered by the Integrity policies to the Michigan Property and Casualty Guaranty Association (Michigan Association), and to the Indiana Insurance Guaranty Association (Indiana Association). The Indiana Association refused to accept defense or indemnity obligations for claims against Clark arising from occurrences prior to February 4, 1985, when Clark moved its principal place of business to Indiana. The Michigan Association refused to accept defense or indemnity obligations on the ground that Clark\u2019s net worth exceeded the limit established by the Michigan Property and Casualty Guaranty Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Clark seeks reimbursement and a declaration that the Fund is hable for Clark\u2019s settlement costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and other defense expenses arising from eight product liability suits brought against Clark by Massachusetts residents. By Clark\u2019s estimation, these combined costs as of January 9, 1995, totaled $858,569.81.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\"><em>Analysis. </em>The Fund is a nonprofit unincorporated legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>entity created by G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 3 (1994 ed.). <em>Ulwick </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>418 Mass. 486, 486 (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It \u201cis obligated to pay covered claims against an insolvent insurer (up to $300,000 per claim) in place of the insolvent insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fund\u2019s obligations and expenses are assessed to a broad range of insurers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including all liability and property insurers who write insurance in the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (5), 5 (1) (c) (1994 ed.). Insurers recoup the amounts which they pay into the fund by increasing their rates and premiums. G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 13. See <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>373 Mass. 798, 799 (1977). The cost of paying claims against insolvent insurers \u201cis thus ultimately passed on to the insurance-buying public.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Reinsurance Facility </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>379 Mass. 527, 530 (1980).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The Fund is obligated only on \u201ccovered claim[s],\u201d defined as \u201cunpaid claim[s] . . . which arise[ ] out of and [are] within the coverage of an insurance policy . . . issued by an insurer, if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer and . . . the claimant or insured is a resident of the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(a). </em>Clark concedes that it is not itself a resident, but argues that it may rely on the residency of the underlying tort claimants to meet the statute\u2019s residency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Clark\u2019s reasoning begins with the premise that \u201cclaimant\u201d in \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(a) </em>refers to the underlying tort claimant (rather than the person asserting the claim against the Fund or insolvent insurer). That implies, of course, that \u201cclaimant\u201d and insured\u201d are mutually exclusive categories. Clark then notes that the residency requirement of \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(a) </em>is satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>if either \u201cthe claimant or insured is a resident of the commonwealth.\u201d Thus, according to Clark, the interpretive question is whether an \u201cinsured\u201d and a \u201cclaimant\u201d may each rely on the other\u2019s residency, or only on its own. Because \u00a7 9 clearly contemplates cases where the claimant can recover from more than one State, Clark asserts that a \u201cclaimant\u201d and an \u201cinsured\u201d may each rely on the residency of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">This argument fails because Clark\u2019s assumption that \u201cclaimant\u201d in \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(a) </em>refers to the underlying tort claimant violates the traditional rule of statutory construction that, \u201c[w]here the Legislature uses the same words in several sections which concern the same subject matter, the words \u2018must be presumed to have been used with the same meaning in each section.\u2019 \u201d <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 188-189 (1969), quoting <em>Liddell </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co., </em>283 Mass. 340, 346 (1933). Accord <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Adamson, </em>409 Mass. 325, 333-334 (1991) (citing cases); <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Hillside Park \u2018N Shop, Inc., </em>370 Mass. 209, 213-214 (1976) (presumption of same meaning not rebutted). The term \u201cclaimant\u201d appears six times in c. 175D.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In \u00a7 5 (1) (c), which provides that the Fund may pay claims in the order that they are \u201creceived from the claimants,\u201d the term refers to persons who have incurred a loss and are now asserting claims against the Fund or insolvent insurer. That is also the necessary meaning of the term in \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, where \u201cclaimant\u201d refers to an insured claimant, and in \u00a7 16, which provides that the Commissioner of Insurance may terminate the Fund\u2019s operation if the Federal government enacts a plan \u201cto avoid excessive delay or financial loss to claimants or policyholders.\u201d Clark fails to rebut the presumption that the term \u201cclaimant\u201d in \u00a7 1 (2) (a) refers, as it does elsewhere in the chapter, to the individual or entity currently asserting a claim against the Fund or insolvent insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Because, in c. 175D, \u201cclaimant\u201d refers to the person how asserting the claim, either the underlying tort claimant or the insured may be a c. 175D claimant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(a), </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>residency requirement is satisfied if either the c. 175D claimant or the insured is a resident. If the c. 175D claimant is a tort claimant who resides in another State, and the insured resides in Massachusetts, recovery from the Fund is available. But if the insured is the c. 175D claimant, then the State of residence of the c. 175D claimant and the State of residence of the insured are one and the same. Thus, an insured may recover from the Fund only if it is a Massachusetts resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The requirement of c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(a), </em>that \u201cthe claimant or insured [be] a resident of the Commonwealth\u201d therefore means: (1) the c. 175D claimant who is also the insured must be a resident; and (2) the c. 175D claimant who is an underlying tort claimant may be a nonresident if the insured is a resident. The underlying tort claimants in this case are not currently asserting claims. Therefore, they are not \u201cclaimants\u201d within the meaning of c. 175D. Clark, the insured, is asserting a claim (and is therefore a c. 175D claimant) but is not a resident. Thus, the residency requirement is not satisfied, and Clark\u2019s claims are not \u201ccovered claim[s]\u201d under G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\"><em>Other jurisdictions. </em>We are aware of only one other appellate case in which a nonresident insured tried to collect indemnity from a guaranty association on the basis of the residency of underlying tort claimants whom the insured had already compensated. That case, <em>T &amp; N </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>44 F.3d 174 (3d Cir. 1994), involved an English corporation whose principal place of business was in Manchester, England. The corporation, T &amp; N, sought to recover from the Pennsylvania Insurance Guaranty Association (PIGA) over $5 million which T &amp; N had expended in litigation and settlement costs and which were owed to T &amp; N by an insolvent insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 176.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The case turned on the interpretation of the terms \u201cresident\u201d and \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the former Pennsylvania Insurance Guaranty Association Act, 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1701.101 et seq. (1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>(Pennsylvania Act),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provided: \u201c \u2018Covered claim\u2019 means an unpaid claim . . . which arises under a property and casualty insurance policy of an insolvent insurer and is . . . [t]he claim of a person who at the time of the insured event resulting in loss or liability was a resident of the Commonwealth <em>. T &amp; N, supra </em>at 178-179, quoting 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1701.103 (since repealed [see note 9, <em>supra]).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Federal District Court found for T &amp; N, but the Court of Appeals reversed, stating: \u201cThe purpose of the [Pennsylvania] Act is clearly to protect <em>Pennsylvania </em>residents. If the underlying Pennsylvania claimants can proceed against PIGA to recover their losses, their rights are protected; . . . giving the insured the ability to rely on the underlying claimants\u2019 residence does not provide the underlying Pennsylvania claimants with money they would not have received if the insured was not permitted to recover under the Act. . . . Rather, it merely allows a non-resident to make a claim against the Act. Such a result violates the intent of the Act .... While it is unfortunate that T &amp; N apparently does not have a guaranty association which it can approach for relief, this does not affect Pennsylvania and PIGA should not be forced to pay T &amp; N\u2019s claim on this reason alone. . . . [Because] T &amp; N is the one with the claim, <em>its </em>residence is the one which should be examined. As a result, T &amp; N must be the one who was a resident of Pennsylvania at the time of the insured event .... At the time of the insured event, T &amp; N was a resident of England. Thus, we conclude that T &amp; N cannot claim recovery from the Association by adverting to the Pennsylvania residency of its underlying claimants.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Id. </em>at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Although the definitions of \u201ccovered claim\u201d in the Pennsylvania Act and in G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (2), are different, both are patterned on the \u201cPost-Assessment Insurance Guaranty Association Model Bill\u201d (Model Act).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We think that under c. 175D, as under the Pennsylvania Act, a nonres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ident insured may not use the residency of the underlying tort claimants which it has compensated to make out a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Wyoming Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>888 P.2d 192, 197 (Wyo. 1994), cited by Clark, is not persuasive. In that decision the court stated: \u201cEither the \u2018claimant\u2019 or the \u2018insured\u2019 must be a \u2018resident\u2019 to make a \u2018covered claim.\u2019. . . The [Guaranty] Act, therefore, permits a foreign \u2018claimant\u2019 to seek recovery when the \u2018insured\u2019 is a \u2018resident.\u2019. . . Conversely, a foreign \u2018insured\u2019 may also seek recovery when the \u2018claimant\u2019 is a \u2018resident.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>The last sentence, on which Clark relies, is dictum which adopts reasoning of the Federal District Court opinion reversed by <em>T &amp; N, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The judge below did not \u201cmake [a] binding declaration[ ] of right, duty, status [or] other legal relation.\u201d G.

This matter is therefore remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a judgment declaring that the Fund has no obligation to defend or indemnify Clark under the Integrity policies.
