R. Civ. P. 53, as amended, 386 Mass. 1237 (1982), who issued a report containing extensive findings of fact and rulings of law. A Superior Court judge adopted the master\u2019s report in its entirety and awarded Sutton $255,504.61 plus $346,903.72 in interest. The MDC appealed from the judgment; Sutton cross appealed. The Appeals Court reversed the decision of the Superior Court. <em>Sutton Corp. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 764 (1995). We granted Sutton\u2019s application for further appellate review and now affirm the decision of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>A. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the significant facts as found by the master.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sutton bid for and was awarded a contract with the MDC to conduct site preparation as part of the replacement of the bridge. As part of its contract, Sutton was responsible for the installation of sand drains on the site of the bridge. Sutton contracted with Vibrofiotation Foundation Company for the use of Vibroflotation\u2019s patented system of sand drain installation utilizing the \u201cDutch Bailor\u201d method, which was one of the methods sanctioned in the contract specifications.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Sutton agreed to charge $3 per linear foot for a total of 141,362 linear feet of sand drains. Sutton estimated that it would take approximately twenty minutes to install each of 1,570 sand drains over a period of thirty-five working days for a total cost of $424,086.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Sutton began installing trial sand drains on April 13, 1981, and immediately encountered a multitude of problems. Use of the \u201cDutch Bailor\u201d method, as designed, resulted in sand drains that did not meet contract specifications. In attempts to explain these problems, on-site observers hypothesized that either the clay material in one of the layers of the soil was overcompacted or the clay in another layer contained more gravel than anticipated. Everyone agreed that the conditions at the site were unusual and that the resulting sand drains were unacceptable. On April 24, 1981, after two weeks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>failed attempts to improve the situation, Sutton stopped installing sand drains.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">By a letter dated April 27, 1981, Sutton advised the MDC that it had encountered a \u201cchanged condition\u201d within the scope of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39N (1994 ed.), and requested permission to use a substitute system for compacting the soil. Sutton conducted some successful tests of the substitute \u201cwick drain\u201d system (which were paid for by the MDC), but ultimately the MDC declined to authorize its use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Eventually, Sutton resumed work using a highly-modified Dutch Bailor system. With the new system, Sutton was able to install sand drains acceptable to the MDC, but only at much greater cost and time than anticipated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As a result of the sand drain installation, a significant amount of \u201cspoils material\u201d accumulated on the site.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the spoils material did not meet contract specifications for ground cover, the MDC required Sutton either to mix it with other material to bring it within contract specifications or to move the material offsite and replace it with soil that complied with the contract. Sutton asked instead to move the material to the preload area, another portion of the construction site. The MDC declined. Sutton then chose to remove the spoils material and replace it with \u201cgravel borrow,\u201d for a total cost of $153,094.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>B. <em>Changed condition. </em>Sutton first argues that it is entitled to an equitable adjustment under the changed conditions provision of the contract. The Superior Court judge adopted the master\u2019s rulings that: (1) there was a \u201cchanged condition\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39N; and (2) Sutton satisfied the procedural requirements for an equitable adjustment claim under the \u201cchanged conditions\u201d provision of the contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The MDC argues, first, that there was no changed condition. In the alternative it argues that, even if there was a changed condition, Sutton\u2019s claims are barred because they fall under the purview of the \u201cextra work\u201d provision of the contract (Article XVIII) and Sutton failed to follow the detailed procedural prerequisites for such a claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was on this latter ground that the Appeals Court reversed the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>sion of the Superior Court and ruled in the MDC\u2019s favor. 38 Mass. App. Ct. at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We begin with the general rule that \u201ccontractor\u2019s invocation of remedies available under either the contract or applicable statutes such as G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39N, must be addressed by the public agency in good faith. <em>Glynn </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. [454, 460-461 (1980) <em>(Glynn </em>I)].\u201d <em>Glynn </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 397 (1986) <em>(Glynn II). </em>Here, Sutton followed the procedures set out in \u00a7 39N (and incorporated in the contract as part of Article XIX); once Sutton discovered what it believed to be a changed condition, it ceased operations and notified the MDC by letter seeking an equitable adjustment. The MDC does not dispute that Sutton fulfilled the procedural prerequisites of \u00a7 39N.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The master found that, in the course of the sand drain installation, Sutton had experienced a \u201cType II\u201d changed condition, because \u201cthe site conditions [were] substantially in conformance with the contract documents, but the installation system specified did not perform as anticipated.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>peals Court ruled that the master\u2019s conclusion was \u201cincorrect as matter of law\u201d because it relied on the failure of the installation system rather than the soil conditions, <em>Sutton Corp. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 767 n.2, but went on to conclude that \u201cSutton experienced a changed condition under \u00a7 39N, since the [master\u2019s] subsidiary findings support the conclusion that the actual soil conditions differed radically from those described in the contract plans.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We agree that Sutton experienced a changed condition within the meaning of the statute, but for slightly different reasons than either the master or the Appeals Court. The Appeals Court correctly criticizes the master\u2019s report for improperly focusing on the performance of the equipment, not the actual physical conditions, as required by the statute. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39N. But the Appeals Court improperly focuses on the description of the conditions set out in the contract plans. <em>Id. </em>Where the actual subsurface conditions differ substantially from those conditions \u201cordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in the plans and contract documents,\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39N, there is a changed condition under the meaning of the statute, whether or not the conditions differ from the contract specifications. Thus, contrary to the MDC\u2019s assertions, the Federal \u201cType II\u201d changed condition is explicitly part of Massachusetts law, as demonstrated by both the text of the statute and regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The master\u2019s subsidiary findings support the conclusion that subsurface conditions at the construction site differed substantially from those \u201cordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent\u201d in the installation of sand drains by the methods specified in the contract. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39N. The difference in the conditions caused \u201ca change in the construction methods required for the performance of the work which result[ed] in an increase ... in the cost of the work,\u201d see <em>id., </em>a conclusion also supported by the master\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Appeals Court concluded that Sutton forfeited its claim for an equitable adjustment by failing to follow the procedures for an extra work claim under Article XVIII of the contract. We disagree. Section 39N, mandates that its provisions be included in public works construction contracts. It provides a specific procedure and remedy for the contractor encountering differing subsurface or latent physical conditions. Article XVIII, on the other hand, applies to \u201cextra work,\u201d rather than work required by the contract. The unexpected soil condition encountered by Sutton required it to modify its construction methods and incur significant additional expense in order to complete the contractually required work. Such modifications and additional expense do not constitute \u201cextra work\u201d within the meaning of Article XVIII. Cf. <em>Lawrence-Lynch Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Management, </em>392 Mass. 681, 682-683 (1984).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The cases cited by the MDC are not to the contrary. It is true that contractors seeking to recover payment in excess of the contract price must follow the procedures set out in the contract. See <em>Lawrence-Lynch Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Management, supra </em>at 684-685, 686; <em>State Line Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 306, 317-319 (1969); <em>Marinucci Bros. &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 141, 144-145 (1968); <em>Chiappisi </em>v. <em>Granger Contracting Co., </em>352 Mass. 174, 177-178 (1967); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>332 Mass. 4, 5-7 (1954); <em>Glynn II, supra </em>at 394-395; <em>Skopek Bros. </em>v. <em>Web</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>ster Hous. Auth., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 947 (1981); <em>D. Federico Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 248, 252-253 (1981). In those cases, recovery was denied when the contractor failed to give timely notice of its claim to the public agency. Without such notice, the contracting authority was unable to monitor the additional expenses incurred by the contractor. Here, on the contrary, Sutton met the procedural requirements for a claim under \u00a7 39N: it provided timely written notice of its claim to the MDC. As the master found, the MDC was aware throughout the project of Sutton\u2019s additional expense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, there was no evidence or finding that the MDC was prejudiced in any way by the lack of an itemized statement of damages. Therefore, we conclude that the MDC\u2019s refusal to pay Sutton\u2019s additional sand drain installation expenses was improper.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">C. <em>Substitution. </em>Sutton argues that the MDC should have approved the use of a substitute method of soil compaction under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M <em>(b) </em>(1994 ed.).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The master ruled that \u201c[t]he MDC should have permitted Sutton to substitute the Alidrain or wick system as an \u2018or equal\u2019 system pursuant to Mass. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M and the failure or refusal by the MDC to allow the substitution was a breach of its contract with Sutton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The master\u2019s ruling was incorrect. The wick drain system is not equivalent to the Dutch Bailor method for purposes of substitution under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M <em>(b). </em>Even if we assume that both systems are \u201cmaterials\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M <em>(e), </em>a proposition not free from doubt, they fail at least two of the three requirements for a substitute. First, the wick drain system is not \u201cat least equal\u201d to the Dutch Bailor method in either appearance or design. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M <em>(b) </em>(1). Sand drains are water-jetted holes filled with sand; wick drains are porous plastic tubes. The two types of drains are installed by substantially different methods. In particular, the master found that the installation of sand drains displaces significantly more material than wick drain installation. Second, despite the master\u2019s contrary conclusion, the wick drain system does not meet the statutory requirement that it \u201cconform! ] substantially, even with deviations, to the detailed requirements for the item in the . . . specifications.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M (b) (3). The master found that the two systems were equal in \u201cquality, durability, strength and design\u201d and that the wick drain system \u201cachieved the intent of the specifications\u201d because it performed the same function as the jetted method. Any difference in appearance was \u201cirrelevant,\u201d the master found, \u201cbecause the system was installed below ground level and not visible.\u201d The master\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the substitution issue is clearly erroneous as a matter of law in light of the information in the record and mutually inconsistent with his subsidiary findings about the nature of the two drain systems. See <em>Melrose Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 27, 34 (1988). The record does not support the master\u2019s finding that the two systems were equal in design. There are numerous subsidiary findings detailing the differences in design. In fact, the master\u2019s implied finding that the two systems differ in appearance itself suggests two different designs. Appearance is a factor set out in the statute and is not irrelevant, even where the system will not be visible once installed. See <em>John F. Miller Co. </em>v. <em>George Fichera Constr. Corp., 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 494, 496-497 (1979) (proposed substitute waste piping system in housing construction project was not equal, even though it complied with State plumbing code).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Finally, to the extent that the finding involves the interpretation of a statute, it is a conclusion of law and subject to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>dependent judicial review. <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>391 Mass. 543, 555 (1984), and cases cited. The contract specifications detail two permissible methods of soil compaction: jetted sand drains and augered sand drains. Wick drains are not included. The differences between wick drains and the methods in the contract are significantly more than deviations; instead, the wick drain system is a \u201cdifferent animal\u201d entirely. <em>John F. Miller Co. </em>v. <em>George Fichera Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The Appeals Court cases addressing this issue support our conclusion. In <em>John F. Miller Co. </em>v. <em>George Fichera Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 496-498, for example, a subcontractor attempted to substitute one waste piping system for another. The proposed system would have changed the size, number, and location of fittings, pipes, and vents and the materials out of which they were made. <em>Id. </em>at 496. The court agreed that the proposed system did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 39M <em>(b), </em>and was, in fact, \u201ca fairly fundamental change of the design and system prescribed by the specifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also <em>Acmat Corp. </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 44, 48-49 (1983). Cf. <em>E.A. Berman Co. </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1009, 1010 (1981). Therefore, we conclude that, while the MDC owes Sutton an equitable adjustment under the \u201cchanged conditions\u201d clause, the MDC did not breach its contract with Sutton by failing to approve the use of the substitute wick drain system.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">D. <em>Spoils material. </em>We now address the issues raised by Sutton in its cross appeal. The first issue involves Sutton\u2019s extra work claim for the costs of removing and replacing spoils material. The master ruled that, under the contract, the MDC had a right to refuse Sutton\u2019s request to move the spoils material to the preload area of the construction site. In addition, the master ruled, the MDC had the right to require Sut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ton to remove the spoils material and replace it with conforming material without extra cost to the MDC.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Sutton argues that it is entitled to the additional costs incurred in removing the spoils material because those costs were a direct result of the MDC\u2019s failure to allow Sutton to use the substitute wick drain system, citing <em>White Spot Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc., </em>344 Mass. 632, 635 (1962). Because we have concluded, <em>supra, </em>that the MDC did not breach the contract by failing to approve the wick drain proposal, Sutton is not entitled to damages arising from such a failure. Furthermore, the contract clearly provides that Sutton was not entitled to recover for the cost of removing and replacing the spoils material. See note 19, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">E. <em>Damages calculation. </em>The master found that the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>limited Sutton\u2019s damages to those directly related to the installation of the sand drains under the modified Dutch Bailor method. Consequently, he rejected claims for extended job overhead, delay, and consequential damages. In so doing, the master relied on provisions of the contract relating to payment for extra work, including Article XVIII.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although we have concluded that Article XVIII does not apply to a claim for an equitable adjustment under \u00a7 39N, we do not thereby automatically reject the master\u2019s approach. Where, as here, there is no contractual or statutory provision for an appropriate measure of damages after the wrongful denial of an equitable adjustment, it is reasonable to refer to the contractual damages formula concerning payment for extra work. Indeed, the MDC\u2019s regulations for settling equitable adjustment claims contain a damages formula nearly identical to the one contained in the contract and used by the master. 350 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 13.01 (7) (b) (1993). We therefore uphold the master\u2019s calculation of damages as reasonable and in accordance with the appropriate statutory and contractual provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Sutton argues that it is entitled to a greater measure of damages than the contract provides because, by denying the claim for an equitable adjustment, the MDC allegedly com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>mitted a \u201ctrue breach\u201d of the contract.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree. A claim for an equitable adjustment under the changed conditions provision is a claim for relief under the contract, and is not a \u201ctrue\u201d breach of contract claim. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 404-405 n.6 (1966). Cf. <em>Glynn II, supra </em>at 397-398 (suggesting that, where agency acts in bad faith, unjustified rejection of proper equitable adjustment claim might constitute true breach of contract [dictum]). Sutton\u2019s damages, therefore, are limited to those provided by the terms of the contract and the statutes governing public construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">F. <em>Interest. </em>In its original appeal, the MDC protested the Superior Court\u2019s application of prejudgment interest at the rate of twelve per cent per annum to Sutton\u2019s award. We now examine whether the interest award was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In 1993, the way that interest is calculated in judgments against the Commonwealth in contract actions was changed. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, as amended through St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 224, and \u00a7 61, inserted by St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 225. Passed as outside sections of an appropriations bill such interest is now calculated by reference to the coupon issue yield equivalent of the price for United States treasury bills, capped at ten per cent. The sections were approved July 19, 1993, but, by St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 390, were made effective July 1, 1993. The statute did not contain an emergency preamble and did not explicitly state whether it had retroactive effect. The Superior Court clerk entered final judgment in the case on August 16, 1993. Interest was calculated at twelve per cent per annum from the date the complaint was filed (April 20, 1982) until the date of the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The MDC argues that the clerk should have applied the new, lower interest rate to the judgment. Sutton responds that, because it was subject to referendum, the amended inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>est statute did not take effect until ninety days after its enactment, citing art. 48, The Referendum, I, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Because final judgment entered before the effective date, Sutton argues, the amendment does not apply to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We agree with Sutton that the 1993 amendment does not apply because it became effective after final judgment was entered. Laws which are subject to referendum do not take effect until ninety days after passage, unless they are designated as emergency laws. Art. 48, The Referendum, I. See <em>Mirageas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>391 Mass. 815, 819-820 (1984). The MDC argues that this law is not subject to referendum because it \u201cappropriates money for the current or ordinary expenses of the commonwealth, \u201d which is an excluded subject under the Constitution. Art. 48, The Referendum, III, \u00a7 2. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>413 Mass. 330, 337 (1992); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Cole-Hersee Co., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 532, 535 (1988). In <em>Mirageas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 820, we assumed that, barring an effective emergency preamble, a statute changing the interest rate applied to judgments would be subject to referendum. The only difference between that case and the one before us is that the 1993 amendment was attached to an appropriations bill as an outside section. We have declined to determine the constitutionality of attaching provisions that do not appropriate funds (outside sections) to appropriation bills. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., supra, </em>quoting <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>407 Mass. 377, 382, 384 (1990). The practice, even if it is constitutional, would not be effective to insulate a legislative enactment from the operation of art. 48, when that enactment did not pertain to matters excluded from the referendum process by art. 48. Here, the provisions of the bill relating to interest in actions against the Commonwealth are not sufficiently related to appropriations to bring them within the excluded matters provision of art. 48.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The clerk\u2019s calculation of interest was correct.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>G. <em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, we reject both the MDC\u2019s appeals and Sutton\u2019s cross appeals.

The \u2018Dutch Bailor\u2019 or \u2018jetted\u2019 method of sand drain installation involves the use of a dropping head or bailor which pulsates in a vertical manner as it is lowered into the ground. A high pressure jet of water is sprayed into the hole liquefying the earth; the earthen materials float to the surface in suspension as the water level in the hole rises, ultimately flowing out onto the work area surface. . . . Once the water drains from the hole, the hole is filled with sand. . . . The purpose of the sand drains is to provide a route for the moisture that is trapped in the soil below to percolate to the surface, thus permitting quicker compaction of the soil.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The master found that \u201c[t]he resident engineer noted in his Project Diary entry for that day as follows: \u2018there is a definite problem with the existing conditions.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The master found: \u201cThe wick or Alidrain system involves inserting an oblong shaped piece of plastic tubing into the ground by means of a long mandrel. A jet spray of water is used to assist in clearing a path through the earth for the mandrel. The plastic tube remains in the hole after the mandrel is withdrawn. There are numerous pores or openings in the plastic tube or \u2018wick\u2019 through which the moisture in the soil seeps and rises to the surface, thus performing the same function as the sand drains in facilitating the consolidation of the soil.

According to Sutton, the document fit within the public records exception to the hearsay rule, see <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 393 (1980), and would have provided evidence that a bridge plan existed at the time when Sutton was attempting to dispose of the spoils material. Had the MDC furnished Sutton with such a plan, the master found, the spoils material could have been relocated to the preload area of the construction site. Such a relocation presumably would have permitted Sutton to incur less expense. We conclude that the master did not abuse his discretion in excluding the inspector general\u2019s report, which alludes to, but does not contain a plan of the bridge replacement design. See <em>Enrich </em>v. <em>Windmere Corp., </em>416 Mass. 83, 84 n.2 (1993).
