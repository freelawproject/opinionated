After a second trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the jury convicted the defendant of the offense alleged in the first indictment and acquitted him on the two remaining indictments. The Appeals Court reversed, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 384 (1995),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concluding that the admission of certain expert testimony was prejudicial error. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review and now affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. When the victim was about eleven years old, she was raped by the defendant in August and September, 1990. The rapes occurred at the victim\u2019s aunt\u2019s house, where she was staying while her mother was in the hospital and, later, while her mother was recuperating at home. The first rape occurred on the first floor on the living room sofa; the second occurred in the aunt\u2019s bedroom; and the third occurred in her cousin\u2019s bedroom. The victim\u2019s younger brother testified that, when he came down to the kitchen for a drink of water late one night, he saw the defendant \u201chumping\u201d his sister and heard her saying, \u201cStop.\u201d The defendant then got up and hit him, and the victim\u2019s brother ran to his mother\u2019s house. The victim\u2019s mother confirmed that, during the summer of 1990, her son had come into the house very late one night, which was out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The defendant called Sgt. Marie Donahue of the Boston police department\u2019s sexual assault unit, who testified on direct examination that the victim had told her of the three incidents in a different sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">On cross-examination, the Commonwealth sought to elicit testimony from Sgt. Donahue that \u201cit\u2019s not unusual for children to not be consistent in terms of times, places.\u201d Over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>defendant\u2019s objection, the judge allowed the witness to testify that \u201cit\u2019s highly unusual that [child victims] remember dates and times and sequences.\u201d The objected-to testimony is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">2. <em>Expert testimony. </em>The defendant raises several issues regarding the admission of the testimony of Sgt. Donahue. First, he argues that her opinion testimony on cross-examination was inadmissible because she was not properly qualified as an expert. Second, he argues that her opinions, even if admissible as expert testimony, impermissibly vouched for the credibility of the victim witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u201cThe admission of expert testimony lies \u2018largely in the discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>417 Mass. 536, 540 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maltais, </em>387 Mass. 79, 93 (1982). \u201cThe judge\u2019s \u2018ruling will be reversed on appeal only if it constituted an abuse of discretion or was otherwise tainted with error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Amherst, </em>422 Mass. 359, 362 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>365 Mass. 149, 152 (1974). As a preliminary matter, the judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that the subject matter was appropriate for expert testimony. \u201c[C]ourts have uniformly allowed expert testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>on the typical symptoms of sexually abused children because the information is beyond the common knowledge of jurors and of assistance in assessing a victim witness\u2019s testimony and credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The judge also did not abuse his discretion in qualifying Sgt. Donahue as an expert. \u201c \u2018The crucial issue,\u2019 in determining whether a witness is qualified to give an expert opinion, \u2018is whether the witness has sufficient \u201ceducation, training, experience and familiarity\u201d with the subject matter of the testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Amherst, supra </em>at 361-362, quoting <em>Letch </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>401 Mass. 65, 68 (1987). See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 571-573 (1991). Here, Sgt. Donahue testified to her extensive training, education, and experience in investigating allegations of sexual assault on children, and, in particular, in interviewing children who may have been victims of such assault. The judge had an adequate basis which we set out in detail in the margin for qualifying Sgt. Donahue as an expert.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The defendant argues that the qualification of Sgt. Donahue was improper because it was done outside the hearing of the jury and because there was no instruction to the jury on how to evaluate expert testimony. We disagree. First, the judge need not qualify a witness as an expert before the jury. \u201cAlthough it is for the court to determine whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert, there is no requirement that the court specifically make that finding in open court upon proffer of the offering party. Such an offer and finding by the Court might influence the jury in its evaluation of the expert and the better procedure is to avoid an acknowledgement of the witnesses\u2019 expertise by the Court.\u201d <em>United States </em>v <em>Bartley, </em>855 F.2d 547, 552 (8th Cir. 1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 183 (1975) (judge need not make preliminary finding of expert\u2019s qualifications within hearing of jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The defendant did not request an instruction on expert testimony. Therefore, our review is confined to whether any error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). The purpose of standard instructions on expert testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>primarily to remind the juiy that they are the sole judges of credibility, and to counteract the possibility that designation of a witness as an expert might create the impression among the jury that they may not disbelieve the witness\u2019s testimony. See generally C.R. Richey, Proposals to Eliminate the Prejudicial Effect of the Use of the Word \u201cExpert\u201d under the Federal Rules of Evidence in Civil and Criminal Jury Trials, 154 F.R.D. 537 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Here, the witness testified on direct examination as a fresh complaint witness and an investigating police officer. Moreover, Sgt. Donahue, while a qualified expert for purposes of her testimony, did not belong to one of the professions easily identified by jurors as those from whom expert opinions are typically drawn. For those reasons, there was little danger that the jury would ascribe additional significance to her testimony in the absence of an official designation by the judge as an \u201cexpert witness.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 453 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 65, 70 (1994). Finally, the judge adequately instructed the jury on their role as judges of the credibility of all witnesses, with a special reference to fresh complaint witnesses and the credibility of minor children. We conclude that the judge properly qualified the witness as an expert and did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in failing to instruct the jury on their role in evaluating expert testimony. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 458, 468 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 207-208 (1990). See generally P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 7.10.1, at 413 (6th ed. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">3. <em>Vouching. </em>The defendant contends that, even if Sgt. Donahue was properly qualified as an expert witness, her testimony should not have been admitted because it impermissibly vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility. \u201cEvaluations of credibility are, of course, within the exclusive province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 504 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 202 (1987). \u201c[Witnesses may not offer their opinions regarding the credibility of another witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, supra. </em>\u201cAlthough expert testimony on the general behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children is permissible, an expert may not refer or compare the child to those general characteristics.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>419 Mass. 750, 759 (1995). \u201cSuch testimony impermissibly intrudes on the jury\u2019s province to assess the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The line between permissible and impermissible opinion testimony in child sexual abuse cases is not easily drawn. Where the witness explicitly links the opinion to the experience of the witness child, the opinion is clearly impermissible vouching. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass. 54, 60 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, supra. </em>Where there is no link between the expert testimony and the victim, the opinion is usually allowed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 541-543; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 421 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 629 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, supra. </em>In some cases, however, opinion testimony that does not explicitly link the opinion to the child witness nevertheless constitutes impermissible vouching. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, supra </em>at 504-505; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, supra </em>at 201-203; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 148-149 (1994). The danger of such implicit vouching is greater where the witness is testifying as both a direct witness and an expert, particularly where the witness offers fresh complaint testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, supra </em>at 148. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lorette, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 736, 741 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>422 Mass. 1014 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The testimony in this case comes close to the third category. Sgt. Donahue testified on direct examination as a fresh complaint witness for the defense. She said that she had interviewed the victim and had been told about the three incidents in a different sequence than that described by the victim in her own testimony. The expert testimony elicited on cross-examination regarding the capacity of child sexual abuse victims to determine the sequence of events thus implicitly related to the victim\u2019s credibility <em>as perceived by the expert witness herself. </em>While the testimony fell short of rendering an opinion on the credibility of the victim, it was very close to the line of admissibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, supra </em>at 201-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Even if this testimony should not have been admitted, we conclude that any error was not prejudicial, however, given the unique circumstances of the jury verdicts. It would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>appear that the vouching testimony had a prejudicial effect on the jury verdicts, where the jury refused to convict on two of the three indictments. The incidents alleged in the two indictments were supported only by the victim\u2019s testimony; the incident in one of the indictments was supported by the corroborating testimony of the victim\u2019s brother and to a lesser extent her mother. It is clear that the jury reached a guilty verdict on the only indictment which was corroborated by another eyewitness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude the error was harmless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>421 Mass. 547, 555 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">4. <em>Prior bad acts. </em>On cross-examination of the victim, the defendant brought out that she had had opportunities to report the rape but did not. In an attempt to rehabilitate the witness, the prosecutor, on redirect examination, asked questions regarding two incidents when the victim had told someone else about the rape. One of the incidents involved a group discussion with several friends, one of whom allegedly told the group that she had been raped by the defendant. This revelation led the victim to tell the group that the defendant had raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The testimony regarding another rape was not admissible for its truth; it violated the. hearsay rule and was not permitted for the purpose of showing the defendant\u2019s criminal disposition. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 881 (1984). The testimony was admissible, however, \u201cbecause the fact that the statement was made, regardless of its truth or falsity, tended to rehabilitate the Commonwealth\u2019s witness by explaining why, after a long period of silence, she complained of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The defendant argues that the prejudicial effect of the testimony outweighs its probative value. We disagree. The Commonwealth had a serious need to rehabilitate its primary witness, a need which was created by the cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>In addition, there was a prompt jury instruction limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the evidence to its proper use, which was then repeated at the end of all the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the evidence was properly admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, supra </em>at 505-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">5. <em>Closing statement. </em>The defendant contends that certain comments by the prosecutor in the closing argument improperly appealed to the jury\u2019s sympathies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The argument was not objected to at trial. A reading of the entire closing argument discloses nothing that creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, particularly in light of the judge\u2019s clear and comprehensive instructions and the evidence produced at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 285-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>287 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherick, </em>401 Mass. 302, 304 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>In summary: (1) the expert witness was properly qualified; (2) the admission of expert testimony vouching for the victim\u2019s credibility was harmless error; (3) the evidence of prior bad acts was properly admitted for a limited purpose; and (4) the closing argument was proper. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The first trial was declared a mistrial after the jury were unable to reach a verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\">One member of the panel dissented on the ground that any error was not prejudicial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>38 Mass.

Donahue as an expert was flawed because the judge referred to another proceeding in which the same witness had testified. Before qualifying the witness as an expert at sidebar, the judge commented: \u201cIf you want counsel to develop her experience in dealing with sexual abuse, I bet you he\u2019ll be able to do it, because I heard it in the last case she testified in here before. This woman is unbelievably experienced in this area, unbelievably.\u201d While the judge\u2019s reference to another proceeding in a separate case was unhelpful and could not properly form the basis for his preliminary finding, the record contains adequate testimony to support such a finding, as the excerpts below demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5j4\">The prosecutor: \u201cAlso with respect to your training, can you tell us something about your training as a sexual assault officer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">The witness: \u201cYes, sir.
