See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A (1994 ed.). We allowed the commissioner\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">The board concluded that Houghton was eligible for the credit because it was a \u201cmanufacturing corporation\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38C (1994 ed.). Such classification allows a corporation to take advantage of an investment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tax credit, see G. <em>L. </em>c. 63, \u00a7 31A <em>(a),</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and certain exemptions from local taxes on machinery. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (3) (1994 ed.). Decisions of the board are final as to findings of fact. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13 (1994 ed.). Thus, the sole question before us is whether the board erred as a matter of law. See <em>First Data Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 444, 446 (1976). \u201c[Otherwise stated, the question is whether a contrary conclusion is not merely a possible but a necessary inference from the findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude that the board did not err. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The essential facts are not in dispute. We recite these facts as found by the board in its decision. Houghton is a Massachusetts corporation and a well-known publisher of elementary, secondary, and college textbooks, as well as trade, reference, fiction, and nonfiction books. Its book-production process was described by the board as follows: \u201cInitially, editors, ordinarily employed by [Houghton], engage in extensive research and development activities regarding a proposed book. These activities include researching the probable marketability and developing the content and format of a proposed book. [Houghton\u2019s] employees then design, write, and produce a manuscript to serve as the content of a proposed book. Various writers and editors working on different portions and aspects of a proposed book combine their work on a network.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u201cNext, [Houghton\u2019s] employees produce and then circulate among the company\u2019s marketing, production, and editing personnel thumbnail sketches for further processing and refinement. After that step, electronic-production specialists transform the manuscript and thumbnail sketches into templates which are analogous to blueprints or page outlines without any text. [Houghton\u2019s] art department then creates drawings, develops charts and graphs, and creates line art for inclusion in the ultimate product. The art department also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>selects, retrieves, and transforms photographs for incorporation into the ultimate product.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u201cFollowing these steps, all of the aforementioned items are assembled into layouts. First proofs are subsequently produced and marked for changes and corrections, resulting in the production of second proofs which further refine the product. The second proofs are then converted into color proofs. Throughout this process, [Houghton] uses, among other things, human skill and knowledge as well as various implements, materials, and machines or machinery such as computers, digital modems, printers, photocopiers, writing utensils, lighting machines, drawing equipment and materials, graphic art tools, electronic graphic equipment, electronic color collection equipment, photo-retrieval equipment, sophisticated software, and scanners.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u201cFrom the color proof stage of the process, [Houghton] either produces CD ROM tapes which are then sent to independent contractors for final packaging in compact disks, or it sends the proofs (usually on computer diskettes) to independent contractors for printing and binding into conventional books.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">A \u201cmanufacturing corporation\u201d is defined by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38C, as a corporation \u201cengaged in manufacturing.\u201d This \u201cless than illuminating\u201d definition, <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>413 Mass. 576, 579 (1992), combined with the desirability of the classification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has spawned a great body of caselaw,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which we have concluded that \u201c[t]he words \u2018engaged in manufacturing\u2019 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>used in [G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38C,] . . . are words of flexible meaning.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 32, 36 (1949) <em>(Assessors of Boston II). </em>Accord <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 578-579; <em>Tilcon-Warren Quarries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>392 Mass. 670, 672 (1984); <em>Southeastern Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>384 Mass. 794, 795 (1981); <em>Joseph T. Rossi Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>369 Mass. 178, 181 (1975). \u201cThe undefinable nature of the operative terms . . . necessitates case-by-case, analogical development of their meaning. Absent legislative instruction, we know of no better direction in which to proceed.\u201d <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Our lodestar in these cases has been the rule that, where a dominant statutory term is undefined, \u201cthe Legislature should be supposed to have adopted the common meaning of the word, as assisted by a consideration of the historical origins of the enactment.\u201d <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>382 Mass. 354, 357, appeal dismissed, 452 U.S. 933 (1981), quoting <em>First Data Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 444, 447 (1976).

Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>361 Mass. 614, 617-618 (1972). As to the term\u2019s common meaning, \u201cour decisions have embraced the basic concept of manufacturing articulated in <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R. </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>262 Mass. 439, 444-445 (1928): \u2018[C]hange wrought through the application of forces directed by the human mind, which results in the transformation of some preexisting substance or element into something different, with a new name, nature or use.\u2019 \u201d <em>William F.

It was subsequently incorporated in St. 1936, c. 362, \u00a7 1, and it is to the 1936 act that we have looked for guidance regarding legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Fernandes Super Mkts., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 318, 321 (1976); <em>Franki Found. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra; Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>321 Mass. 90, 95-96 &amp; n.1 (1947) <em>(Assessors of Boston I). </em>It was enacted pursuant to 1936 House Doc. No. 143, entitled \u201cReport of the Special Commission Relative to Taxation of Tangible and Intangible Property and Certain Related Matters.\u201d <em>Franki Found. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>The commission reported, in part, as follows: \u201cLong regarded as a great industrial State, in which prosperous cities and thriving towns found their inhabitants busily employed in mills and factories, few there were who ever conceived the possibility of such a decline in industrial manufacturing as has occurred. . . . Idle factories and abandoned mills are the silent and convincing evidence of the disaster that has come upon our people. We do not attempt to give all the reasons for the loss of this industry, but it is clear that among the many causes high taxes play an important part. ... It is imperative, therefore, that the State shall provide sufficient relief to save the factories and mills now operating from closing their doors and seeking locations in other States. . . . The effect of such [tax relief] undoubtedly will be to retain within the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the factories now operating, the possible reopening of factories now closed, and the attracting of new industries to locations within our borders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618 n.1, quoting 1936 House Doc. No. 143 at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Although \u201c[t]he statutory goal was not to encourage and preserve all industry in the Commonwealth but only that portion of industry represented by manufacturing corporations,\u201d <em>Charles River Breeding Lab., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 336, we have nevertheless stressed that the words \u201cengaged in manufacturing\u201d are not to be given a narrow or restricted meaning\u201d and that \u201cthe statute should be construed, if reasonably possible, to effectuate th[e] legislative intent [of fostering industrial expansion].\u201d <em>Joseph T. Rossi Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 181, quoting <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>323 Mass. 730, 741 (1949). Accord <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>413 Mass. 576, 579 (1992); <em>Assessors of Boston II, supra; Assessors of Boston I, supra </em>at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Our past cases in this area have focused on whether the processes under study \u201ceffect [ed] the kind of change and cause[d] a correlative degree of refinement to the source material\u201d sufficient to qualify as \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 581. Accord <em>York Steak House Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 424, 426 (1984); <em>Hopkinton LNG Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 286, 287-288 (1977). Although the activity at issue must constitute more than merely providing raw materials to another to.be processed, see <em>TilconWarren Quarries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 674, processes which do not in themselves produce a finished product are nonetheless \u201cmanufacturing\u201d if they comprise an \u201cessential and integral part of a total manufacturing process.\u201d <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 580, quoting <em>Joseph T. Rossi Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 181-182.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In <em>William F. Sullivan &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>supra </em>at 581, we held that the taxpayer\u2019s business of converting cast off pipe, boilers, plumbing fixtures, automobile parts, refrigerators, and other metal items into compressed and baled scrap metal of various grades involved sufficient change and refinement to constitute manufacturing. Similarly, we have held the scouting of raw waste wool into wool ready to be spun into thread, cloth, or rugs to be an essential and integral part of the manufacturing of textiles, <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, supra </em>at 748, as was the processing of raw wood into cut lumber, \u201ca product more refined and specialized in use than the raw material.\u201d <em>Joseph T. Rossi Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 182. Further, we have held the production of electricity to involve \u201cmanufacture.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>334 Mass. 549, 565 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In <em>Tilcon-Warren Quarries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>392 Mass. 670, 673 (1984), on the other hand, we held that the taxpayer\u2019s business of extracting pieces of rock from the ground and crushing them into usable sizes was not manufacturing, because the process did not transform the source material \u201c \u2018into an article or a product of substantially different character . . . even though the processing increase[d] the value [and] usefulness of the product.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Solite Corp. </em>v. <em>County of King George, </em>220 Va. 661, 665 (1980). We have also held that a computer time-sharing system, whereby information provided by a customer is manipulated by computer software, is \u201cthe transmission or manipulation of knowledge or intelligence,\u201d and properly classified as a service rather than a manufacturing process. <em>First Data Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 444, 448 (1976). Similarly, the transformation of sound waves over telephone lines, <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>321 Mass. 186, 191 (1947), and light waves to television transmitters, <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>382 Mass. 354, 357 (1981), does not constitute \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Houghton transforms ideas, art, information, and photographs, by application of human knowledge, intelligence, and skill, into computer disks, ready for use by independent printers, containing an immense amount of information in a highly organized form. We have never required that source materials be tangible. See <em>First Data Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>at 446, and cases cited (\u201cIf it be objected that the definition [of manufacturing] contemplates corporeal or tangible input and output, the taxpayer can cite cases that may read to the contrary \u2014 those which consider the production of electricity to involve manufacture\u201d). Cf. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 358 (quoting the Appellate Tax Board: \u201cWestinghouse may not be denied manufacturing status merely because its end product is intangible\u201d). The work Houghton does approaches, to the extent humanly possible, creation ex nihilo; it is quite different from the mere manipulation of information and electric currents that we discussed in <em>First Data Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 447-448 (manipulation of computer data), <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 355-356 (transformation of light into television signals), and <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, supra </em>at 189, 191 (transmission of sound waves). We agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that Houghton\u2019s operations \u201cproduce a significant degree of change and refinement to the materials involved and that these are essential and integral steps in the manufacture of conventional books.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The commissioner argues that Houghton\u2019s activities to some extent resemble those of a furniture designer who produces designs used by others to build furniture, or an author who writes and sells a manuscript to a publisher. In each case there is a creative process constituting a sine qua non of subsequent production, yet no one would argue that the author or designer should be classified as a manufacturer. While we agree, in principle, with this general statement, there is a reasonable basis for distinguishing Houghton\u2019s activities. The documents produced by the author and designer are valued solely for their artistic and intellectual content. Houghton\u2019s completed computer disks and CD ROM tapes, on the other hand, although having intellectual content, are valuable principally because they are physically useful in making the finished product. Houghton\u2019s activity is similar to the dress cutting \u201cmarkers\u201d which we said were (albeit in the context of the sales and use tax) used \u201cdirectly and exclusively\u201d in the manufacture of dresses in <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Fashion Affiliates, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 543, 545-546 (1982), the \u201ccomposition proofs\u201d we held exempt from sales and use tax in <em>Houghton Mifflin Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>373 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>772, </em>773, 776 (1977), and the linotype we held similarly exempt in <em>Courier Citizen Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>358 Mass. 563, 572-573 (1971). Indeed, the commissioner does not argue that the maker of corporeal printing plates of the type discussed in <em>Courier </em>would not be a manufacturer. We believe that the difference between printing plates and the printer-ready computer disks produced by Houghton is one of kind, not of quality. Therefore, we conclude that Houghton\u2019s activities constitute \u201cmanufacturing\u201d within the \u201cmatrix of intention and expectation\u201d of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38C, <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 358, and that Houghton is entitled to the manufacturer\u2019s investment tax credit of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31 A, so long as its manufacturing operations are \u201c \u2018important and material\u2019 . . . when measured against the entire operations of the corporation.\u201d <em>Fernandes Super Mkts., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 318, 322 (1976), quoting <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>323 Mass. 730, 746 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The commissioner draws our attention to a Maryland case, <em>H. M. Rowe Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>149 Md. 251 (1925). \u201cDecisions of other jurisdictions are not likely to have direct bearing because of the peculiarities of the various taxing schemes.\u201d <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Houghton\u2019s compilation of information, photographs, and text, into proofs, edited, refined, and ultimately transferred to disk or CD ROM, transcends the mere manipulation of information and constitutes a substantial and integral step in the process of manufacturing books. The disks and CD ROMs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>possess a new nature and are adapted for a new use, namely the printing and binding of books. The board did not err as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 31A (a) (1994 ed.), allows a manufacturing corporation to take a credit against its corporate excise due equal to \u201cone percent of the cost or other basis for Federal income tax purposes of qualifying tangible property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected during the taxable year . . . including buildings and structural components of buildings acquired by purchase, as defined under [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 179(d)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We acknowledge the assistance to the court of the amicus brief of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">In addition to eligibility for the investment tax credit, classification as a manufacturing corporation under G.

In <em>Assessors of Sudbury </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>1 Mass. App. Tax Bd. Rep. 21 (1981), the board held that a taxpayer who received, edited, and retyped advertisements for its \u201cwant-advertiser\u201d before sending the manuscript to a printer was not a manufacturer. The basis for its conclusion was that the preparation of the advertisements for publishing did not significantly change any material and did not constitute a substantial and integral part of any manufacturing operation. Similarly, in <em>Beckler Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, 4 </em>Mass. App. Tax Bd. Rep. 87 (1984), the taxpayer arranged typed manuscripts into proper format for a printer, but did not edit or significantly change the material. We agree with the board that the nature of Houghton\u2019s complex transformation of ideas, text, and artwork into computer discs and CD ROMs is significantly different from the services provided by the taxpayers in the above cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
