L. c. 10, \u00a7 28 (1994 ed.), permits judicially approved voluntary assignments of \u201cMass Millions\u201d lottery prize payments, and (2) an order approving the assignment contemplated by an agreement between Singer and the nominal defendants, Gregory P. Powell and Josephine J. Powell, who are husband and wife. The defendant State Lottery Commission (commission) contended in the Superior Court, and contends on appeal, that G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 28, prohibits such assignments. On cross motions for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>mary judgment, a judge in the Superior Court denied Singer\u2019s motion and allowed the commission\u2019s cross motion. Judgment was entered for the defendant commission. Singer appealed and we granted Singer\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We recite the significant facts established for summary judgment purposes by materials described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Gregory Powell (Powell) purchased the winning \u201cMass Millions\u201d lottery ticket for the October 14, 1988, drawing. Subject to Federal and State tax withholdings, Powell\u2019s prize consists of twenty annual installments each in the amount of $211,478. After winning the lottery prize, Powell cosigned several notes for friends. Some of the friends defaulted and Powell was required to make the payments. As a result, Powell was unable to meet his own mortgage obligations. To prevent foreclosure and to stabilize his finances, Powell and Josephine entered into an agreement with Singer in June, 1994, to assign to Singer their rights in the prize payments due in October, 1994, and October, 1995, totalling $422,956, in return for which they would receive a lump sum of $310,000, subject to certain conditions including the requirement that judicial approval of the assignment be obtained on or before December 31, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Because judicial approval was not obtained by December 31, 1994, the agreement between Singer and the Powells lapsed. Thus, this case is moot. \u201cThe general rule is that courts ordinarily will not decide moot questions.\u201d <em>Norwood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>409 Mass. 116, 121 (1991). In the instant case, however, the plaintiff is a corporation which offers discounted lump sum payments in exchange for assignments of future prize payments from State lottery winners. The commission makes annual \u201cjackpot\u201d payments to approximately 1,670 winners each year. It is very likely that this same issue will \u201carise again in similar factual circumstances\u201d and would not obtain appellate review before \u201cthe recurring question would again be moot.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Lock-hart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 783 (1984). Therefore, we address the request for declaratory relief because it is an issue which is capable of repetition yet evading review. <em>Norwood Hosp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">General Laws c. 10, \u00a7 28, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201cNo right of any person to a prize shall be assignable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>except that payment of any prize may be made to the estate of a deceased prize winner or to the [child support enforcement] agency as set forth in chapter one hundred and nineteen A, and except that any person pursuant to an appropriate judicial order may be paid the prize to which the winner is entitled, and except that the commission may, by regulations adopted pursuant to section twenty-four, permit assignment of prizes for purposes of paying estate, and inheritance taxes, or to a trust the beneficiaries of which are the prize winner, his mother, father, children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, or spouse. Neither the commission nor the director shall be liable for the payment of a prize pursuant to this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The first clause of G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 28, standing alone, is unambiguous. It prohibits all assignments of rights to lottery prize money. The first clause, however, is followed by four \u201cexceptions,\u201d the second of which is that \u201cany person pursuant to an appropriate judicial order may be paid the prize to which the winner is entitled.\u201d The controversy in this case is about the meaning of that language which, standing alone, is ambiguous. Singer contends that the Legislature intended this language to permit all voluntary assignments which are judicially approved. Singer contends that, by virtue of this language, courts are authorized to enter orders approving lottery winners\u2019 voluntary assignment of annual prize payments to finance companies for discounted lump sum payments. The commission, on the other hand, contends that the language in question merely permits involuntary transfers of payments in situations where a court must determine property rights in a winner\u2019s prize, for example, in a dispute over ownership of the prize as in probate proceedings concerning a winner\u2019s estate or in divorce proceedings concerning division of marital assets.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe text [of a statute] must be afforded its plain meaning when it is clear and unambiguous. <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984), and cases cited. When ambiguities are present, however, \u2018a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975). At the same time, a statute should be read as a whole to produce an internal consistency. See 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05 (4th ed. 1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872-873 (1985). In addition, \u201can exception from the coverage of a statute is ordinarily to be construed narrowly so as to prevent the purposes of the statute from being rendered ineffective.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 745, 747 (1985). See <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Executive Office of Communities &amp; Dev., </em>411 Mass. 599, 605 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In denying Singer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and allowing the commission\u2019s cross motion, the Superior Court judge in this case made clear by her endorsements on the motions that her reasons were those previously articulated by another Superior Court judge in a memorandum of decision in another case involving an issue very similar to the issue here. The memorandum of decision in that other case, Cove First Acquisition Corp. vs. State Lottery Comm\u2019n, Middlesex Superior Court No. 93-7407, August 9, 1994, is set forth in the record appendix. The judge in the Cove First Acquisition Corp. case, Judge Wendie I. Gershengom, concluded that G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 28, \u201cis a general prohibition on assignments with certain exceptions, including an exception in circumstances where the disposition of a lottery prize is an appropriate remedy in a judicial proceeding independent of section 28.\u201d The judge\u2019s reasoning, with which we agree, was substantially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201cIf the \u2018appropriate judicial order\u2019 exception were to freely permit voluntary assignments for any reason with leave of the court, the exception would entirely swallow the general rule that \u2018[n]o right of any person to a prize shall be assignable.\u2019 See G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 28. Such a construction is contrary to the principle that statutory exceptions should be construed narrowly. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201cFurther, the structure of section 28 does not support plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the statute states a general rule allowing voluntary assignments made with the Court\u2019s permission and certain other assignments made without need for an \u2018appropriate judicial order.\u2019 It defies logic to suggest that the \u2018appropriate judicial order\u2019 clause forms part of the general rule (making the general rule a conditionally permissive one rather than a prohibitive one) when that clause is separated from the broad prohibition of the rule by an unrelated exception (payments to a deceased prize winner\u2019s estate).[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] In addition, such an interpretation is contraiy to the principle that the legislative policy is assumed to be contained within the general rule, not the proviso. <em>Woods [supra </em>at 604-605]. The prohibition of prize assignments, rather than the allowance of assignments, must be assumed to constitute the legislative policy here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cFinally, plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is weakened by the fact that the statute provides absolutely no standards by which the Court could determine when it would be \u2018appropriate\u2019 for it to grant a judicial order allowing a voluntary prize assignment. A construction of section 28 which would grant the Court broad authority to allow or disallow assignments without any standards for making such decisions is not a reasonable construction and is therefore to be avoided. See <em>Korkuch </em>v. <em>Planning Board of Eastham, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 307, 309 (1988).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We endorse the above reasoning and the result reached by the motion judge in this case and the judge whose decision in Cove First Acquisition Corp. vs. State Lottery Comm\u2019n, <em>supra, </em>we have liberally quoted. The reasoning is persuasive. Furthermore, our decision comports with nearly every reported appellate and trial decision which has construed State lottery statutes containing similar language. See <em>In re Dalton, </em>146 B.R. 460, 463 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 1992); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>272 Ill. App. 3d 86, 92 (1995); <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Director of N.J. Lottery Comm\u2019n, </em>143 N.J. Super. 443, 448 (1976); <em>Converse </em>v. <em>State Lottery Comm\u2019n, </em>56 Wash. App. 431, 434 (1989). See also <em>Lemieux </em>v. <em>Tri-State Lotto Comm\u2019n, </em>666 A.2d 1170, 1173 (Vt. 1995) (holding voluntary assignments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>pursuant to \u201cappropriate judicial order\u201d not prohibited where, unlike G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 28, general prohibition against assignments not present). The <em>Lemieux </em>court expressly distinguished its statute from the statutes in Massachusetts and elsewhere that do not contain a general prohibition against assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\">If the Legislature intended the general rule to be that no right of any person to a prize shall be assignable without an appropriate judicial order, it is reasonable to believe that the Legislature would have expressed the rule in that, or a similar, manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
