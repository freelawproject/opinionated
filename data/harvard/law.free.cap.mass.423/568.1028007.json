L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1994 ed.). The judge denied the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of a second-floor apartment located at 5 Grant Street, Holyoke.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The defendant asserted in his motion that the affidavit supporting the warrant fails to establish probable cause for the search, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. The Appeals Court determined that the motion to suppress should have been granted and reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 483 (1995). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We agree with the Appeals Court and reverse the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The affidavit in support of the search warrant stated as follows: \u201cOn 11-24-91 Captain Paquette of the Uniform Division received a phone call from a Cooperating Member of the Community [(Cl)] who told him that there was a large quanity [svc] of Cocaine at 5 Grant in a second floor apartment. The Cl further told Captain Paquette that two Colombians operating a white blazer, New York Registration E6J964, had arrived in Holyoke on 11-22-91 and that this motor vehicle was parked in the rear of 5 Grant Street. The Cl also told Captain Paquette that they had brought approximately two to three Kilo-Grams which the Cl had seen in the Grant Street, second floor apartment. The Cl stated that the white blazer would be leaving on 11-24-91 with $300,000 to $400,000 which was made from the sale of Cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">\u201cOn 11-24-91 Officer J. Whalen went to 5 Grant Street where he found a white blazer, New York Reg. E6J964, parked in the rear. A check with the New York Registry of Motor Vehicle indicates that this vehicle is [registered] to Jose A. Rodriquez. ... A further check with NCIC indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>that Jose A. Rodriquez has a Criminal record in the State of New York for Carrying a loaded weapon, impersonating a Police Officer, and assault to cause physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\u201cMyself and Sgt. Dinapoli have personal knowledge of the above listed motor vehicle having received information in the past concerning the operator of that motor vehicle being involved at 289 Walnut Street in a large scale Crack Cocaine and Cocaine operation. We also had information from a member of the Dominican-Hispanic community that this motor vehicle made numerous trips to New York to pick up large quanities <em>[sic] </em>of Cocaine to be [delivered] in [the] Holyoke area for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\u201cA check with Official City of Holyoke records the renter of 5 Grant Street, second floor is Ovidio Blanco Reyes. I have personal knowledge that Ovidio Blanco Reyes is from the Dominican Republic and is a resident alien. I also have received information in the past that Ovidio Blanco Reyes is a large distributor of Cocaine and Crack Cocaine. I have conducted an investigation into the distribution of Cocaine in the 650 South East Area this year and observed drug sales being made and the money passed to Ovidio Blanco Reyes and Daniel Garcia in a late model Caprice Classic which was [registered] to Ovidio Blanco Reyes. At the time of this arrest Mr. Reyes stated that he lived at 289 Walnut Street. Subsequent to this arrest information was developed from a participant that Mr. Reyes was a large scale Cocaine distributor, and that he used several different apartments in the City to move the Cocaine around to a safe house location.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\u201cOn 8-16-91 Sgt. Dinapoli arrested a Dominican male, Diego Mejia of no known address, with 80 vials of Crack Cocaine in his possession. Sgt. Dinapoli developed information that Mr. Mejia was involved in the distribution of the Crack Cocaine with Jose Rodriquez who he knew operated the White Blazer, New York Registration E6J964. Subsequent to this arrest I was in the Holyoke Police Department when Mr. Reyes came in to try and secure the release of the motor vehicle Mr. Mejia was operating at the time of his arrest for the Crack Cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">\u201cBased on information received from the Cooperating Member of the Community, my personal knowledge of Ovidio Blanco Reyes, information received by St. Dinapoli concerning the White Blazer and the arrest of Mr. Mejia, information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>that Mr. Reyes does live at 5 Grant Street, second floor, arrest of Ovidio Blanco Reyes, I believe that there is a large quanity [szc] of Cocaine being kept for distribution at 5 Grant Street, second floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The standards by which probable cause for a search warrant based on information provided by a confidential informant is measured are well established in this Commonwealth. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 373 (1985), we rejected the more lenient \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test announced in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213 (1983), and ruled that art. 14 requires adherence to the principles set out in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). Under the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard, a magistrate must \u201cbe informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019 (the veracity test).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, supra </em>at 375, quoting <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra </em>at 114. Each of the two prongs of the test must be separately considered and satisfied, but independent police corroboration can rectify deficiencies in either or both prongs. <em>Id. </em>at 375-376.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The Appeals Court concluded that, although the basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge was shown by his personal observation of the cocaine in the apartment, the affidavit failed to articulate the circumstances underlying the affiant\u2019s belief in the informant\u2019s veracity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 485, 487 (1995). The only indication that the informant had personal knowledge of criminal activity at 5 Grant Street is found in his statements that the men in the white automobile brought cocaine \u201cwhich the Cl had seen in the 5 Grant Street, second floor apartment,\u201d and that the white automobile would be leaving that day. The informant provided no names or descriptions of the individuals involved, no indication that he had witnessed one or a series of sales transactions, and few details of the reported drug operation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, </em>419 Mass. 163, 164 (1994) (informant present on numerous occasions in past month, named and described defendants, and described details of cocaine sales); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 182-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>183 (1993) (informant familiar with manner of cocaine sales gave extensive details of reported operation). The tip was devoid of details that would normally support a belief that the informant had actually been inside the apartment and obtained personal knowledge of illegal activities. We need not decide, however, whether the informant\u2019s assertion of personal knowledge, coupled with minimal additional detail, meets the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test, because the affidavit fatally failed to show the veracity of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The informant\u2019s reliability was not proven by the prior provision of information leading to convictions or seizures of evidence, or otherwise proven accurate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>411 Mass. 108, 112-113 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, </em>410 Mass. 43, 46 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 486 (1988). The tip itself was not so detailed as to ensure the requisite reliability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319, 323 (1989). Neither was the police investigation sufficient to corroborate the informant\u2019s information. \u201cInformation received in the past\u201d and attributed to various unspecified members of the community, to the effect that the defendant was a large-scale cocaine distributor and that the automobile parked outside the defendant\u2019s address was often used to transport cocaine from New York, was not shown to be recent enough to avoid being stale and did not \u201cprovide the sort of idiosyncratic detail that would effectively corroborate and lend credibility to the informant\u2019s assertions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, supra </em>at 167. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 627 (1983) (separate confidential informants\u2019 tips may corroborate each other if sufficiently detailed and independently reliable).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Further, the police conducted no surveillance of activities at the defendant\u2019s address other than to verify the location of the automobile, and engaged in no controlled buy of narcotics from the defendant or anyone at the location, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, supra </em>at 165, 167; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>418 Mass. 86, 89 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, supra </em>at 185-186; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasco, </em>405 Mass. 316, 322 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, supra </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Although the affidavit intimated that the defendant had been arrested previously, presumably for a drug offense, the magistrate was told no details about the purported arrest, including when it occurred, whether charges were brought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>whether contraband was seized, or the ultimate disposition of the arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, supra </em>at 167 (convictions of \u201cuncertain vintage\u201d given no weight in probable cause determination); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, supra </em>at 185 (recent history of similar crimes may be considered in determining probable cause). There is absolutely no evidence in the record before us to suggest, as does the dissent, that the police were merely waiting for an opportunity to arrest the defendant, which conveniently arose with the unidentified confidential informant\u2019s tip. The judge did not so much as allude to such a state of events. The defendant\u2019s motion was denied without memorandum of decision. Not only do we lack the power of clairvoyance, but it is wholly inappropriate to speculate on a bare record as to what the judge may or may not have concluded about what the police officers may or may not have speculated when seeking a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Finally, only minimal weight in a probable cause determination can be placed on the affiant\u2019s knowledge that the defendant attempted to retrieve Mejia\u2019s automobile from the police after Mejia\u2019s drug-related arrest. Neither Mejia\u2019s arrest (outcome uncertain) nor the defendant\u2019s attempt to retrieve the vehicle suggest the defendant was involved in illegal drug-related activity. In short, the independent investigation revealed no \u201cpredictive details that were not easily obtainable by an uninformed bystander.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desper, supra </em>at 167-168, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 21 (1990). A commonsense view of the affidavit as a whole, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>418 Mass. 86, 90 (1994), fails to establish the veracity of the informant\u2019s knowledge, and probable cause did not exist for the warrant\u2019s issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Finally, it appears clear on this record that the statement made by the defendant to the police must be suppressed as the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d The rationale behind the conclusion is amply stated in the well-reasoned opinion of the Appeals Court and need not be repeated here. The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence should have been granted. The conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-15\">Seized from the apartment were cocaine, cash, drug paraphernalia, and personal papers belonging to the defendant. The motion to suppress evidence additionally sought suppression of a statement made to police at the police station after the defendant\u2019s arrest. Contrary to the assertion in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>dissent, the police inventory of property seized constituted just one page. Of course, it matters not what police actually seize during a search, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Straw, </em>422 Mass. 756, 758 (1996) (evidence of over 200 grams of cocaine, $1,750 in cash, paraphernalia, and personal effects suppressed where briefcase illegally searched), when determining the legality of the search itself. Although the dissent relies on an identified Hispanic male\u2019s (Rodriquez) past New York conviction for carrying a loaded weapon to support an inference that Rodriquez is a \u201clarge scale cocaine dealer,\u201d it must be noted that no weapons were found in the apartment. Further, carrying a firearm is not a crime in this Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(1994 ed.) (carrying a firearm without a license to do so is a crime); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, ante </em>266, 269 (1996) (report of carrying a firearm, absent more, does not establish reasonable suspicion of criminal activity).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b597-8\">Greanby, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-z\">(dissenting, with whom Lynch and Fried, JL, join). There has been a failure to apply certain fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>principles to the examination of the affidavit. These principles are as follows. A warrant issues on a showing of probable cause, a much less rigorous requirement than that posed by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, \u201ca certain leeway or leniency [is always granted] in the after-the-fact review of the sufficiency of applications for warrants,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corradino, </em>368 Mass. 411, 416 (1975), and that review necessarily must take into account the substantial role of reasonable inferences and common knowledge in deciding whether an assertion has been shown to a probability. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alessio, </em>377 Mass. 76, 82 (1979). Courts, therefore, \u201cshould not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense manner .... [T]he resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965). Critically, \u201c[t]he sufficiency of the affidavit is to be decided on the basis of a consideration of all its allegations as a whole, and not by first dissecting it and then subjecting each resulting fragment to a hypertechnical test of its sufficiency standing alone.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>358 Mass. 747, 751 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">This affidavit, considered as a whole, and with fairness, is sufficient. The informant\u2019s basis of knowledge is clearly satisfied by observation of two to three kilograms of cocaine in the defendant\u2019s apartment which would be subject to sale at a price estimated between $300,000 and $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The remaining issue is a simple one \u2014 does the affidavit disclose a reasonable basis to support the reliability of the informant\u2019s report? The police verified that the defendant rented the apartment where the cocaine had been seen, and the police knew from personal observations that the defendant dealt drugs from his late model Caprice classic automobile with another identified Hispanic man. The white Blazer, which was to make the substantial delivery of cocaine to the defendant, was seen exactly where it was said to be, in the back of the apartment building where the defendant lived; the New York registration plate number matched that of the Blazer; and the Blazer was registered to a known Hispanic male (Jose R. Rodriquez), who (based on a police check of his criminal records) likely carried a loaded handgun, a protection usually considered prudent by any large scale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>cocaine dealer. The defendant was also linked to a third cocaine dealer (Diego Mejia) who had engaged in cocaine distribution with Rodriquez. The independent information and corroboration gathered by the police thoroughly supported the informant, and provided sufficient indication of the defendant\u2019s involvement with cocaine distribution so that the magistrate issuing the warrant reasonably could conclude \u201cthat he [was] relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation.\u201d <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 416 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Considered on a commonsense basis, this would appear a situation in which the police had probable cause to believe that the defendant was dealing in large amounts of unlawful drugs, on a regular basis, based on the police officers\u2019 own observations and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the defendant\u2019s association with others involved in the illicit drug trade. A reasonable person could conclude that the police may well have been waiting to arrest the defendant (again), until such time as they had cause to believe that he was in possession of a considerable quantity of cocaine (brought in from New York) commensurate with the scope of the defendant\u2019s activities. The informant\u2019s tip merely established the time at which such an arrest and the accompanying search should occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The experienced Superior Court judge appears to have so concluded, and I would affirm his denial of the motion to suppress. This result is consistent with what the court stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374 (1985): \u201cWe conclude . . . that the principles [of Aguilar-Spinelli], if not applied hypertechnically, provide a more appropriate structure for probable cause inquiries under art. 14.\u201d The search of the apartment uncovered a treasure trove of cocaine, money, and drug distribution equipment which, to list and identify item by item, would add pages to this separate opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant validly confessed to his ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the cocaine and to his role as a cocaine distributor. I would affirm the judgment convicting the defendant of trafficking in large quantities of cocaine.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The illegal substances and other paraphernalia and items taken during the search are genetically described in the one-page-retum filed after the search. The Commonwealth\u2019s brief spends eight and one-half pages particularly describing the magnitude of the items devoted to the drug enterprise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
