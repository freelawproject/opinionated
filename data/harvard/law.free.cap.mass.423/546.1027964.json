App. Ct. 36, 49 (1992), the defendant, Anthony Penta, was convicted of (1) trafficking in cocaine in excess of 200 grams, and (2) trafficking in cocaine in excess of twenty-eight grams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appeals alleging that: (1) the prosecutor interfered with his ability to procure a witness favorable to him; (2) his motion to suppress should have been allowed; (3) his convictions violate principles of double jeopardy; and (4) the judge erred in ruling that the drugs and certificates of analysis were admissible. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">After filing his appeal, the defendant obtained a stay of the appeal and filed a motion pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), to vacate his sentence on double jeopardy grounds. The defendant\u2019s motion was denied. Appeal from that denial has been consolidated with the defendant\u2019s appeal from his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\"><em>Facts. </em>The evidence at the second trial substantially was similar to that presented at the first trial and recited in detail in the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, supra </em>at 37-40. We recite only the basic facts, supplementing when necessary in discussion of a particular issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>In September, 1987, Jeffrey Mueller approached the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and offered to purchase drugs from Penta. The FBI referred Mueller to the State police. On two occasions, October 8 and October 22, 1987, Mueller, while under surveillance by the State police, purchased twenty-eight grams (one ounce) of cocaine from Penta. On the second of these occasions, Mueller wore a transmitter authorized by a previously obtained warrant. A tape recording was made of a conversation between Mueller and Penta on the afternoon of October 22, 1987, during which Mueller and the defendant discussed a sale by Penta of at least eight ounces (approximately 225 grams) of cocaine. The contemplated sale occurred on November 5, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Prior to Mueller\u2019s arrival at the meeting on November 5, 1987, the police obtained another warrant arid again wired Mueller with a transmitter. Over the transmitter, the police heard discussion of the drug buy. They moved in and arrested the defendant while he was counting the money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The police then executed a search of the defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They seized 63.2 grams of cocaine, a cash box, a grinder, inositol powder (cocaine dilutant), pieces of window glass, a scale, and a pager from the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant\u2019s 1987 Mercury Cougar automobile also was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">1. <em>Failure of Mueller to appear and testify at trial. </em>The defendant argues that his convictions must be reversed because he was unable to procure Mueller\u2019s testimony at his retrial. The defendant alleges that Mueller\u2019s failure to appear was due to obstruction by the prosecutor and therefore asserts his convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Because Mueller was not in the custody of the Commonwealth,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Commonwealth had no affirmative duty to produce Mueller for trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 747 (1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>540 F.2d 1152, 1155 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1000 (1976) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(\u201cthere is no absolute rule of production [of informant]\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>496 F.2d 378, 382 (1st Cir. 1974) (government\u2019s duty to keep track of or search for informant depends on many factors including extent of government control over witness, importance of witness\u2019s testimony, difficulty of finding witness; on timely demand, government only required to make affirmative showing satisfactory to court why it could not reasonably be expected to locate informant and that its conduct has been diligent). The Commonwealth\u2019s obligation was to provide the defendant with Mueller\u2019s last known address and to refrain from obstructing the defendant\u2019s access to Mueller. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curcio, supra </em>(\u201cThe Commonwealth, neither by itself nor by connivance with the informer, was to put any obstruction between the defense and the informer, and it must offer the defense whatever information it had about the informer\u2019s location\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manrique, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 597, 599-603 (1991) (prosecution fulfils obligation by offering to provide all information as to latest location of informant). The Commonwealth has complied fully with the motion judge\u2019s direction to attempt to locate Mueller and provided the defendant with an address in Caribou, Maine. This address enabled defense counsel to initiate communication with Mueller.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The defendant, nonetheless, claims that the Commonwealth is responsible for his inability to secure Mueller\u2019s presence because of the Commonwealth\u2019s unexecuted threat to Mueller of a perjury prosecution. The record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim. The only \u201cthreat\u201d made by the prosecutor was a request, made in open court at a hearing on reconsideration of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, that Mueller be given notice under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 4 (1994 ed.), that his inconsistent testimony in two judicial proceedings could result in prosecution for peijuiy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mueller had previously acknowledged that he was aware of his rights and possible exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>to perjury charges and he was represented by counsel both before and during the hearing. There was no prosecutorial misconduct. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 387 (1994) (prosecutor\u2019s threats made at a tavern to defense witnesses that \u201cYou better not show up in court,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tear you apart,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll end up putting you away too,\u201d violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to prepare a defense); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>535 F.2d 223, 225-227 (3d Cir. 1976) (prosecutor\u2019s actions, after judge agreed to give witness warning as to rights, in subpoenaing defense witness to office and, in presence of three law enforcement officers [undercover agents in case], impressing on her dangers of testifying violated defendant\u2019s right to present witnesses).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dismissal of the charges or reversal of the convictions is not warranted in these circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 391; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>405 Mass. 566, 579 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 198-199 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">2. <em>Admissibility of evidence obtained through recording of transmissions received by transmitter attached to body of confidential informant. </em>As part of a police investigation, State Trooper James R. White applied for and received authorization from the court to transmit and record conversations between then-confidential informant, Jeffrey Mueller, and the defendant by means of a transmitter secreted on Mueller. On two dates in October, 1987, White obtained warrants, issued under the authority of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 220, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61 (1987), to seize and tape record oral communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>tians between Mueller and the defendant. On both occasions, White attested that he had received the prior consent of Mueller, and, therefore, believed that the procedures of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 (1994 ed.), did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4 (1994 ed.), defines the term \u201cinterception\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 99. It provides that \u201cit shall not constitute an interception for an investigative or law enforcement officer, as defined in this section, to record or transmit a wire or oral communication if the officer is a party to such communication or has been given prior authorization to record or transmit the communication by such a party and if recorded or transmitted in the course of an investigation of a designated offense as defined herein.\u201d \u201c[Designated offense\u201d is defined in \u00a7 99 B 7 to include, inter alla, any offense involving the possession or sale of a narcotic or harmful drug in connection with organized crime as defined in the preamble. In the preamble, organized crime is defined as consisting of \u201ca continuing conspiracy among highly organized and disciplined groups to engage in supplying illegal goods and services.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>384 Mass. 271, 281 (1981), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 1147 (1982). The record reveals that Trooper White received prior authorization from Mueller, a party to the conversation, to record the conversation and that the recording and transmission was made in the course of an investigation of a designated offense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, supra </em>at 43. We conclude, therefore, that the exception in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4, applies. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>issued pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, was not required in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The defendant maintains that, even assuming a warrant under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 99, was not required, the warrants that did issue were not valid as they purported to issue under the authority of G. L. c. 276, art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and the common law and none of those sources authorizes the seizure of oral communications through use of a hidden transmitter.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While it is true that G. L. c. 276 does not expressly provide for the seizure of oral communications, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1 (defining property), it expressly states that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be construed to abrogate, impair or limit powers of search and seizure granted under other provisions of the General Laws or under the common law.\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1. Chapter 276 permits a search warrant to issue if based on common law authority and consistent with art. 14. See <em>Matter of Lavigne, </em>418 Mass. 831, 835 (1994) (G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, permits a search warrant based on common law justification for its issuance).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">It is under the common law authority of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61 (1987), and its progeny that the Commonwealth justifies the seizure of oral communications pursuant to a warrant issued under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. In <em>Blood, </em>this court held that art. 14 protected conversants\u2019 reasonable subjective expectations of privacy and therefore, prohibited the warrantless surreptitious transmission and rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ording of conversations taking place in a private home. <em>Id. </em>at 68-70. Because no warrant was sought or obtained, the court in <em>Blood </em>did not address the question presented today as to what form of warrant is required to protect a defendant\u2019s rights under art. 14. That question was again presented but not reached in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, </em>408 Mass. 668 (1990). The <em>Price </em>court did not decide whether a warrant issued under authority of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, was sufficient to protect a defendant\u2019s art. 14 rights because the court concluded that the defendant did not have standing to challenge the admissibility of the videotapes he sought to exclude. In dictum, however, the court foreshadowed the conclusion we now reach. The court concluded that \u201ceven if the defendant had standing, at least the audio portion of the tapes, which was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant [under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7], would still be admissible because the search did not violate the prohibition of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>Price, supra </em>at 669. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">A warrant obtained in compliance with G. L. c. 276 serves the purpose of art. 14 by subjecting police information to the scrutiny of \u201ca neutral and detached magistrate instead of [leaving them to be] judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d <em>Blood, supra </em>at 73, quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 14 (1948). Such a warrant fulfils the Legislature\u2019s mandate that the secret \u201cuse of [modem electronic surveillance] devices by law enforcement officials must be conducted under strict judicial supervision.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A (preamble). We, therefore, hold that, when law enforcement officials seek to transmit and record oral communications pursuant to the one-party consent exception of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4, they may do so under authority of a warrant pursuant to G. L. c. 276 and the common law. The form of warrant obtained in this case was adequate to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. We have never incorporated the procedures and requirements of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, into art. 14. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, supra </em>at 671 n.2, 674; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>407 Mass. 1001, 1002 (1990). We do not do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument relating to the validity of the warrants is that the warrants are invalid because the affidavits, applications, and warrants failed to state with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>particularity the place and property to be searched. He argues that such warrants are invalid under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; art. 14<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Search warrants must be reviewed in a commonsense, rather than hypertechnical, manner. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Byfield, </em>413 Mass. 426, 430 n.6 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 299-300, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989). Common sense dictates that warrants for the seizure of oral communications not be limited in such a way as to preclude all flexibility and to endanger the safety of the informant or officer on whose body the transmitter is secreted. Cf. <em>Freiberg, supra </em>at 299 (where warrant applied for immediately after discovery of body police could not be expected to describe with detailed precision items to be seized; to hold otherwise would unreasonably thwart ability of police to investigate crime immediately after its occurrence). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>998 F.2d 1112, 1123 (2d Cir. 1993), cert, denied, 511 U.S. 1069 (1994) (Fourth Amendment should be read with a flexible interpretation to keep pace with a technologically advanced and modem society); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silberman, </em>732 F. Supp. 1057, 1061 (S.D.Cal. 1990), affd sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petti, </em>973 F.2d 1441 (9th Cir. 1992), cert, denied, 507 U.S. 1035 (1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The warrants were limited to the seizure of face-to-face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>oral communications between the defendant and Jeffrey Mueller during two brief periods (seven days for the October 21, 1987, warrant; fourteen days for the October 30, 1987, warrant) and relating to specifically listed illegal transactions. And, in fact, only conversations between the named parties which related to the illegal sale of cocaine were transmitted and recorded. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 Mass. 248, 250 (1989). The warrants described the conversations to be seized with the level of specificity that was practical in the circumstances. We conclude that a warrant so limited in its scope and application satisfies the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Westerman, </em>414 Mass. 688, 694 (1993). Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ferrara, 771 </em>F. Supp. 1266, 1292 (D. Mass 1991) (reasonable to describe place to be searched other than by address of single location if not likely to result in mistaken, unjustified intrusions and necessary to maintain requirement of prior judicial approval and to accommodate legitimate, important needs of law enforcement). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">3. <em>Double jeopardy. </em>The defendant claims that the principles of double jeopardy, embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the common and statutory law of this Commonwealth, are violated by his criminal prosecution, civil forfeiture of an automobile, and subsequent criminal retrial stemming from the same conduct. The defendant, therefore, urges this court to vacate his criminal conviction, as an impermissible second punishment for the same offense. We conclude, in accord with the most recent pronouncement from the Supreme Court of the United States, that civil forfeiture does not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ursery, </em>116 S. Ct. 2135 (1996), is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim under Federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 2142, 2148 (civil forfeiture of automobiles and other property used to facilitate criminal activity does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accord <em>Albano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, post </em>at 1005 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">4. <em>Admission in evidence of drugs and certificates of analysis. </em>The defendant asserts that the judge committed error by allowing admission in evidence of drugs and a certificate of reanalysis of the drugs because the Commonwealth failed to establish the chain of custody of the drugs seized on November 5, 1987.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that failure to establish chain of custody usually goes to the weight rather than the admissibility of evidence, but argues for an exception to that general rule in the circumstances of this case. We conclude that the defendant has not presented a basis for an exception to the general rule. Any alleged inconsistencies or failures in the chain of custody properly went to the weight not the admissibility of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Westerman, supra </em>at 700 (no prejudice where chemist testified and was subject to cross-examination). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berth, </em>385 Mass. 784, 791 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 309 (1992) (arguable weaknesses in chain of custody go to weight of evidence that object introduced is same object connected with crime; chain of custody evidence not nullified by weak link). The evidence as to chain of custody was the subject of testimony and vigorous cross-examination. There was no error in its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\">The Appeals Court had reversed the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, concluding that the trial judge erred in allowing an informant, Jeffrey Mueller, to claim a privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and avoid testifying at Pen-ta\u2019s first trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>32 Mass.

Section 1 further provides that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall be construed to abrogate, impair or limit powers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>search and seizure granted under other provisions of the General Laws or under the common law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">General Laws c. 220, \u00a7 2 (1994 ed.), provides: \u201cThe courts of the commonwealth and the justices thereof shall have and exercise all the powers necessary for the performance of their duties.

The Appeals Court specifically concluded in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, supra </em>at 43, that the first judge\u2019s finding that Mueller orally consented before the issuance of the search warrant on October 21 was amply supported by the evidence and that the recording and transmission occurred in the course of an investigation of a designated offense as defined in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 (1994 ed.). The second judge was under no obligation to revisit these issues. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>412 Mass. 353, 356 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass. 242 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>379 Mass. 557, 558 (1980).
