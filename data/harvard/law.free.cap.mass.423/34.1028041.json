The plaintiff, the school committee of Natick (school committee), filed a <em>complaint in </em>the Superior Court seeking an order to stay arbitration with respect to the grievance brought by the defendant, the Education Association of Natick (union). The union filed a counterclaim, seeking an order that the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ties proceed to arbitration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court ruled that the grievance was not arbitrable, and granted the school committee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (a), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The union appealed from the judgment, see <em>Old Rochester Regional Teacher\u2019s Club </em>v. <em>Old Rochester Regional Sch. Dist. Comm., </em>398 Mass. 695, 696 (1986), which we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The materials submitted by the parties reveal the following material facts. The school committee and the union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) which was in effect from September 1, 1991, through August 31, 1994. Article III, \u00a7 6, of the agreement provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cNo teacher will be disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in compensation, suspended, demoted, dismissed or non-renewed without just cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no grievance involving an alleged failure to appoint a person to a promotional or stipendiary position or to not renew the contract of a non-tenured teacher or non-tenured administrator shall be arbitrable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u201cGrievance\u201d was defined in the agreement, in art. VIII, \u00a7 2(a), to include \u201ca dispute involving the meaning, interpretation or application of [this agreement].\u201d In the terminology of the agreement, a coaching position is a \u201cstipendiary position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The grievant has been a teacher in the Natick public schools since the 1970-1971 school year. According to his affidavit, the grievant was \u201cinitially appointed as Head Coach of the Natick High School Baseball Team in 1991 for the 1991-92 school year, and . . . was renewed to that appointment in 1992 for the 1992-93 school year.\u201d He anticipated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>would remain in the position for the 1993-1994 school year. On or about December 13, 1993, the grievant received a letter from the school superintendent, informing him that the superintendent did not \u201cintend to reappoint [him] to the position of head coach of the Natick High School baseball team\u201d for the 1994 season, because the grievant had \u201cexperienced two consecutive unimpressive seasons as head coach,\u201d and because of the grievant\u2019s \u201cnegative attitude regarding the 1993 season as expressed in the \u2018write up\u2019 [the grievant] prepared for the [Natick High School] 1993 yearbook.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The record indicates that the practice in Natick has been to make annual appointments and reappointments to the various coaching positions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to passage of the Educational Reform Act, St, 1993, c. 71 (Act), a coaching appointment was the prerogative of the local school committee. See G. L. c. 71,\u00a7 47A (1992 ed.). The Act transferred the authority to make coaching appointments to school superintendents. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 50, amending G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47A. The superintendent\u2019s letter to the grievant, declining to reappoint him, was sent pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47A, as amended, on the basis of the superintendent\u2019s newly assumed statutory responsibility for the appointment of athletic coaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The union construes art. III, \u00a7 6, of the agreement to provide that, while the initial decision to appoint a person to a coaching position is nonarbitrable, once such an appointment has been made, an incumbent coach (at least if that coach is also a teacher) is entitled to remain in a coaching position, subject to dismissal or nonrenewal only for just cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the union contends, the nonrenewal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>grievant to the coaching position has a disciplinary aspect which, under art. III, \u00a7 6, is a proper subject of arbitration, because a teacher may not be disciplined without just cause. The judge agreed with the union that art. III, \u00a7 6, did not unambiguously exclude from arbitration the nonrenewal of a teacher to a stipendiary position. The judge nonetheless declined to order arbitration of the grievance on the ground that, under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47A, as amended, the superintendent had nondelegable managerial authority with respect to the appointment and reappointment of an athletic coach and, therefore, even if the agreement did grant to an arbitrator the right to decide whether an athletic coach is entitled to reappointment, such an agreement would not be enforceable. We agree with the latter conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">As amended, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47A, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">\u201cThe superintendent may contract to employ athletic coaches for periods not in excess of three years. The provisions of section forty-one relative to tenure shall not apply to such athletic coaches, unless they are otherwise entitled to tenure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Section 67 of St. 1993, c. 71, made the provisions of the Act applicable to all cities, towns, and regional school districts \u201cwithout regard to any acceptance or appropriation by a city, town, or regional school district.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AB8\">Contrary to the union\u2019s contention, we conclude that, under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47A, as amended, a teacher may not hold a stipendiary coaching position subject to dismissal or nonrenewal only for just cause. Section 47A is relatively clear as to its intent. The statute provides that a superintendent may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>enter into a contract for the services of an athletic coach. Such a contract may have a maximum length of three years, or it may be of more limited duration. The intent of the Legislature that such contractual commitments not be made on a more permanent basis is further emphasized by the explicit declaration that an appointment as coach to an athletic team of a public school shall not give rise to tenure for a person so appointed unless he or she is otherwise entitled to tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">This court and the Appeals Court have observed that any employee who is covered by a \u201cjust cause\u201d provision in a collective bargaining agreement, in effect, has obtained tenure in the position. See <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165 </em>v. <em>Northborough, </em>416 Mass. 252, 255 (1993); <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 338, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 125-126 (1992); <em>Selectmen of Ayer </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 931, 932-933 (1990). An incumbent coach protected by a just cause provision would have to be reappointed indefinitely, unless just cause for his removal was demonstrated at a requested hearing. See <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165 </em>v. <em>Northborough, supra. </em>It was observed in the <em>Northborough </em>decision that this result would conflict with a statutorily mandated, fixed term of appointment, which otherwise could be terminated at will (assuming no improper motive) at the expiration of the appointment by the appointing authority. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The <em>Northborough, Leominster, </em>and <em>Ayer </em>cases concerned the appointment, pursuant to various statutory provisions, of municipal police officers. The union suggests that \u00a7 47A can be distinguished from the statutory provisions at issue in those cases because it \u201cdoes not require the superintendent to contract with or appoint athletic coaches\u201d and, it is contended, \u201cdoes not establish terms of employment.\u201d For these reasons, according to the union, \u00a7 47A does not prohibit the employer from conferring a right to just cause protection through collective bargaining. We disagree. We are satisfied that, by limiting coaching appointments to a maximum of three years, the Legislature intended to establish a fixed term of employment, readily terminable at its conclusion. Section 47A confers discretion on a superintendent to the extent that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>does not require the appointment of a coach,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but the durational limit on such a decision, once made, is not discretionary. A collective bargaining agreement which conferred just cause protection, and de facto tenure, on a public high school coach would conflict with the durational limitation of \u00a7 47A. \u201cGeneral Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>id) </em>[1994 ed.], lists those statutes that are subordinated to collective bargaining agreements. General Laws c. [71, \u00a7 47A] is not among them. \u2018[Statutes not specifically enumerated in \u00a7 7 (d) will prevail over contrary terms in collective bargaining agreements.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 448, 452, cert, denied, 515 U.S. 1161 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm \u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 124, 126 (1989). See <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 157, 163 (1983). Thus, even if the agreement was found to be susceptible to an interpretation that covered the asserted grievance, a point we need not decide, arbitration of the grievance would be foreclosed. See <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165 </em>v. <em>Northborough, supra </em>at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The union contends that the limitations in \u00a7 47A should not be construed as an expression of legislative intent to reserve decisions on coaching appointments to the sole discretion of employers because the subject matter of \u00a7 47A is not a core concern of \u201ceducational policy.\u201d See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>378 Mass. 65, 69-73 (1979). We have discovered, in \u00a7 47A, an expressly stated legislative restriction on the appointment power of employers that is in itself an adequate response to this contention. See <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, </em>420 Mass. 13, 16 (1995) (arbitration may not award relief which requires a result contrary to express statutory provision). See also <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 109 (1977). The restriction expressed in \u00a7 47A is, moreover, in substantial harmony with decisional law on this point. \u201c[I]t is by now well-settled that \u2018specific appointment determinations . . . are within the exclusive managerial prerogative of [employers], and thus beyond the scope of collective bargaining.\u2019 \u201d <em>School Comm. of Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Educ. Ass\u2019n, 395 Mass. 651, 655 (1985), quoting <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>386 Mass. 197, 211 (1982). Among the justifications for limitations on the bargaining authority of a school committee is the recognition that school officials must retain primary authority to make decisions about the \u201cefficient use of scarce funds.\u201d <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, supra </em>at 212. <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, 395 </em>Mass. 232, 237 (1985). The Legislature reasonably could consider that this authority should extend to decisions about whether to provide or retain optional, and perhaps costly, scholastic athletic programs. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47 (1994 ed.). Given that a superintendent would not have the authority to enter into an agreement in contravention of the provisions of \u00a7 47A, just as a school committee would lack the authority to agree to terms in a collective bargaining agreement that were in conflict with the provisions of the legislation, we fail to perceive the \u201cwholesale dismantling\u201d of school committee authority which the union asserts would follow from the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Finally, we reject the union\u2019s contention that the judge erred by foreclosing arbitration of the related claim of disciplinary action taken against a teacher. A statement of reasons for nonrenewal of an annual stipendiary coaching appointment reasonably could not be construed as disciplinary action. Cf. <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 338, supra </em>at 122-123 nn. 4 &amp; 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">It follows from what we have said that \u201cno lawful relief could conceivably be awarded by an arbitrator in this case.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165 </em>v. <em>Northborough, supra </em>at 256. An arbitrator could not order the grievant\u2019s reappointment as a coach. While the union has contended that the grievant would be entitled to renewal to the coaching appointment in the absence of just cause for nonrenewal, it has not been contended that any procedures required to be followed in connection with such appointments were violated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Contrast <em>School Comm. of W. Bridgewater </em>v. <em>West Bridgewater Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 121 (1977). See <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, supra </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">A statutorily created nondelegable right of management cannot be abrogated by agreement. <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165 </em>v. <em>Northborough, supra </em>at 255. <em>Billerica </em>v. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Firefighters, Local 1495, </em>415 Mass. 692, 694 (1993). We conclude that the judge properly granted the school committee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and correctly declared that the superintendent\u2019s decision not to reappoint the grievant as coach was not arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The portion of the judgment allowing the school committee\u2019s motion as to the grievance in issue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The dispute between the parties concerned arbitration of two grievances. One grievance concerned a principal\u2019s mid-year withdrawal of a teacher\u2019s appointment to a stipendiary position as advisor to a student yearbook. The judge ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration on this grievance. There has been no appeal from that portion of the judgment, and we do not refer to it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The union contends that there is no conclusive evidence on this point. This assertion is not bom out by the record. Included in the record is a 1991 arbitrator\u2019s decision resolving a dispute concerning the appointment of the head coach for the Natick High School boys\u2019 spring track team. In that decision, the arbitrator observed that both parties, the union and the school committee (who are also the same parties now before us), acknowledged that \u201ccoaching is an annual appointment.\u201d The grievant\u2019s affidavit states that he was first appointed to the coaching position at issue in 1991, and that he was \u201crenewed to that appointment\u201d in 1992. In other words, the grievant was reappointed to the position for a second year. The arbitrator also found that historically, once an appointment as coach was made, the incumbent reasonably could expect reappointment (or renewal) to the position \u201cuntil something happened to change that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In support of its position that the just cause provision of art. Ill, \u00a7 6, applies to the nonrenewal of a coaching position, the union points to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>use of the word \u201cnon-renewal\u201d in the just cause provision. According to the union, because \u201cnon-renewal\u201d in the just cause provision cannot apply to nontenured teachers, who clearly are not entitled to its protection, the only category of persons to whom it could apply are teachers who have been appointed to stipendiary positions. Thus, the union contends, once a teacher has been appointed to a stipendiary position, the teacher is entitled to renewal to the position unless just cause exists for nonrenewal. The judge also noted that the clause covering stipendiary positions refers only to a failure to appoint, while the subsequent clause, covering nontenured teachers, refers with specificity to the nonrenewal of a contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The only amendment to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47A, by the Act, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 50, was the change from the word \u201ccommittee\u201d (i.e., school committee) to the word \u201csuperintendent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">That a superintendent should have discretion whether to hire an athletic coach is to be expected, since athletic programs in public schools are optional and offered at the discretion of the school committee. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 47 (1994 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Article XIV (e) of the agreement provides that, when a vacancy occurs in a coaching position, \u201cpreference will be given to athletically qualified, full-time teachers at the school where the vacancy occurs.\u201d Thus, the agreement addresses procedures for the appointment of coaches, an alleged violation of which clearly would be an appropriate subject for grievance and arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
