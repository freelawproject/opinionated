Laurence S. Fordham. On March 11, 1992, bar counsel served Fordham with a petition for discipline alleging that Fordham had charged a clearly excessive fee in violation of S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 2-106, as appearing in 382 Mass. 772 (1981), for defending Timothy Clark (Timothy) in the District Court against a charge that he operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUI) and against other related charges.. Fordham moved that the board dismiss the petition and the board chair recommended that that be done. Bar counsel appealed from the chair\u2019s decision to the full board, and the board referred the matter to a hearing committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">After five days of hearings, and with \u201cserious reservations,\u201d the hearing committee concluded that Fordham\u2019s fee was not substantially in excess of a reasonable, fee and that, therefore, the committee recommended against bar discipline. Bar counsel appealed from that determination to the board. By a vote of six to five, with one abstention, the board accepted the recommendation of the hearing committee and dismissed the petition for discipline. Bar counsel then filed in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County (county court) a. claim of appeal from the board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Fordham moved in the. county court for a dismiss\u00e1l of bar counsel\u2019s appeal. A single justice denied Fordham\u2019s motion and reported the case to the full court. We conclude that the single justice correctly denied Fordham\u2019s motion to dismiss bar. counsel\u2019s appeal. We conclude, also, that the board erred in dismissing bar counsel\u2019s petition for discipline. We direct a., judgment ordering public censure be entered in . the county court.. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">We summarize the hearing committee\u2019s findings. On March 4, 1989, the Acton: police department arrested Timothy, then twenty-one years old, and charged him with OUI, operating a motor vehicle after suspension, speeding; and operating an unregistered motor vehicle.. At the time of the arrest, the police discovered a partially full quart of vodka in the vehicle. After failing a field sobriety test,.Timothy was taken to the' Acton police station where he submitted to two breathalyzer tests which registered .10 and .12 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Subsequent to Timothy\u2019s arraignment, he and his father, Laurence Clark (Clark) consulted with three lawyers, who offered to represent Timothy for fees between $3,000 and $10,000. Shortly after the arrest, Clark went to Fordham\u2019s home to service an alarm system which he had installed several years before. While there, Clark discussed Timothy\u2019s arrest with Fordham\u2019s wife who invited Clark to discuss the case with Fordham. Fordham then met with Clark and Timothy.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">At this meeting, Timothy described the incidents leading to his arrest and the charges against him. Fordham, whom the hearing committee described as a \u201cvery experienced senior trial attorney with impressive credentials,\u201d told Clark and Timothy that he had never represented a client in a driving while under the influence case or in any criminal matter, and he had never tried a case in the District Court. The hearing committee found that \u201cFordham explained that although he lacked experience in this area, he was a knowledgeable and hard-working attorney and that he believed he could competently represent Timothy. Fordham described himself as \u2018efficient and economic in the use of [his] time.\u2019. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u201cTowards the end of the meeting, Fordham told the Clarks that he worked on [a] time charge basis , and that he billed monthly. ... In other words, Fordham would calculate the amount of hours he and others in the firm worked on a matter each month and multiply it by the respective hourly rates. He also told the Clarks that he would engage others in his firm to prepare the case. Clark had indicated that he would pay Timothy\u2019s legal fees.\u201d After the meeting, Clark hired Fordham to represent Timothy.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">According to the hearing committee\u2019s findings, Fordham filed four pretrial motions on Timothy\u2019s behalf, two of which were allowed. One motion, entitled \u201cMotion in Limine to Suppress Results of Breathalyzer Tests,\u201d was based on the theory that, although two breathalyzer tests were exactly .02 apart, they were not \u201cwithin\u201d .02 of one another as the regulations require. See 501 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.56 (2) (1994). The hearing committee characterized the motion and its rationale as \u201ca creative, if not novel, approach to suppression of breathalyzer results.\u201d Although the original trial date was June 20, 1989, the trial, which was before a judge without jury, was held on October 10 and October 19, 1989. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>judge found Timothy not guilty of driving while under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Fordham sent the following bills to Clark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201c1. April 19, 1989, $3,250 for services rendered in March, 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201c2. May 15, 1989, $9,850 for services rendered in April, 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">\u201c3. June 19, 1989, $3,950 for services rendered in May, 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\u201c4. July 13, 1989, $13,300 for services rendered in June, 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">\u201c5. October 13, 1989, $35,022.25 revised bill for services rendered from March 19 to June 30, 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">\u201c6. November 7, 1989, $15,000 for services rendered from July 1, 1989 to October 19, 1989.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">The bills totaled $50,022.25, reflecting 227 hours of billed time, 153 hours of which were expended by Fordham and seventy-four of which were his associates\u2019 time. Clark did not pay the first two bills when they became due and expressed to Fordham his concern about their amount. Clark paid Fordham $10,000 on June 20, 1989. At that time, Fordham assured Clark that most of the work had been completed \u201cother than taking [the case] to trial.\u201d Clark did not make any subsequent payments. Fordham requested Clark to sign a promissory note evidencing his debt to Fordham and, on October 7, 1989, Clark did so. In the October 13, 1989, bill, Fordham added a charge of $5,000 as a \u201cretroactive increase\u201d in fees. On November 7, 1989, after the case was completed, Fordham sent Clark a bill for $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">Bar counsel and Fordham have stipulated that all the work billed by Fordham was actually done and that Fordham and his associates spent the time they claim to have spent. They also have stipulated that Fordham acted conscientiously, diligently, and in good faith in representing Timothy and in his billing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">We consider first Fordham\u2019s contentions that bar counsel has no right to appeal from the board\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition for bar discipline and that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Supreme Judicial Court Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>4:01, \u00a7 1 (1), as amended, 368 Mass. 900 (1976), provides: \u201cAny attorney admitted to, or engaging in, the practice of law in this Commonwealth shall be subject to [the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s] exclusive disciplinary jurisdiction and the provisions of these rules . . . .\u201d This court\u2019s right of exclusive jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary matters necessarily includes jurisdiction to review decisions of the board not to recommend discipline. If, as in the present case, there is an assertion that the board, in deciding to dismiss a petition for discipline, has misinterpreted or misapplied the disciplinary rules, which were promulgated by the court, there can be no legitimate doubt that the court has jurisdiction to review the board\u2019s interpretation and application of those rules. Furthermore, nothing in our rules or in reason suggests that the exercise of our disciplinary powers may not be invoked by bar counsel by appealing from a decision of the board to dismiss a petition for discipline. Indeed, who, other than bar counsel, who is independent of the board and is a party to all disciplinary proceedings, S.J.C. Rule 4.01, \u00a7 7 (3), 365 Mass. 696 (1974) and \u00a7 8 (3), as amended, 415 Mass. 1304 (1993), would be entitled to challenge the board\u2019s dismissal of a petition for discipline? A complainant does not have standing to do so. <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Overseers, </em>417 Mass. 516, 518 (1994). We conclude that, because this court has responsibility to review matters involving attorney discipline, bar counsel necessarily has a right to appeal to the court from the board\u2019s dismissal of petitions therefor and the court has jurisdiction to decide the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The board dismissed bar counsel\u2019s petition for discipline against Fordham because it determined, relying in large part on the findings and recommendations of the hearing committee, that Fordham\u2019s fee was not clearly excessive. Pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 2-106 (B), \u201ca fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence, experienced in the area of the law involved, would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is substantially in excess of a reasonable fee.\u201d The rule proceeds to list eight factors to be considered in ascertaining the reasonableness of the fee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201c(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u201c(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the chent, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201c(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">\u201c(4) The amount involved and the results obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">\u201c(5) The time limitations imposed by the chent or by the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">\u201c(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the chent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">\u201c(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">\u201c(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">In concluding that Fordham did not charge a clearly excessive fee, the board adopted, with limited exception, the hearing committee\u2019s report. The board\u2019s and the hearing committee\u2019s reasons for dismissing the petition are as follows: Bar counsel and Fordham stipulated that Fordham acted conscientiously, diligently, and in good faith in his representation of the chent and his billing on the case. Although Fordham lacked experience in criminal law, he is a \u201cseasoned and well-respected civil lawyer.\u201d The more than 200 hours spent preparing the OUI case were necessary, \u201cin part to educate [Fordham] in the relevant substantive law and court procedures,\u201d because he had never tried an OUI case or appeared in the District Court. The board noted that \u201c[although none of the experts who testified at the disciplinary hearing had ever heard of a fee in excess of $15,000 for a first-offense OUI case, the hearing committee found that [Clark] had entered into the transaction with open eyes after interviewing other lawyers with more experience in such matters.\u201d The board also thought significant that Clark \u201clater acquiesced, despite mild expressions of concern, in [Fordham\u2019s] billing practices.\u201d Moreover, the Clarks specifically instructed Fordham that they would not consider a guilty plea by Timothy. Rather they were interested only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>pursuing the case to trial. Finally, Timothy obtained the result he sought: an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Bar counsel contends that the board\u2019s decision to dismiss the petition for discipline is erroneous on three grounds: First, \u201c[t]he hearing committee and the Board committed error by analyzing only three of the factors set out in DR 2-106 (B) (1) - (8), and their findings with regard to these criteria do not support their conclusion that the fee in this case was not clearly excessive\u201d; second, the board \u201cmisinterpreted [DR 2-106\u2019s] prohibition against charging a clearly excessive fee by reading into the rule a \u2018safe harbor\u2019 provision\u201d; and third, \u201cby allowing client acquiescence as a complete defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqcH\">In reviewing the hearing committee\u2019s and the board\u2019s analysis of the various factors, as appearing in DR 2-106 (B), which are to be considered for a determination as to whether a fee is clearly excessive, we are mindful that, although not binding on this court, the findings and recommendations of the board are entitled to great weight. <em>Matter of Hiss, </em>368 Mass. 447, 461 (1975). We are empowered, however, to review the board\u2019s findings and reach our own conclusion. <em>Matter of Anderson, </em>416 Mass. 521, 525 (1993). In the instant case we are persuaded that the hearing committee\u2019s and the board\u2019s determinations that a clearly excessive fee was not charged are not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The first factor listed in DR 2-106 (B) requires examining \u201c[t]he time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.\u201d Although the hearing committee d\u00e9termined that Fordham \u201cspent a large number of hours on [the] matter &gt; in essence learning from scratch what others . . . already know,\u201d it \u201c[did] not credit Bar Counsel\u2019s argument that Fordham violated DR 2-106 by spending too many hours.\u201d The hearing committee reasoned that even if the number of hours Fordham \u201cspent [were] wholly out of proportion\u201d to the number of hours that a lawyer with experience in the trying of OUI cases would require, the committee was not required to conclude that the fee based on time spent was \u201cclearly excessive.\u201d It was enough, the hearing committee concluded, that Clark instructed Fordham to pursue the case to trial, Fordham did so zealously and, as stipulated, Fordham spent the hours he billed in good faith and diligence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Four witnesses testified before the hearing committee as experts on OUI cases. One of the experts, testifying on behalf of bar counsel, opined that \u201cthe amount of time spent in this case is clearly excessive.\u201d He testified that there were no unusual circumstances in the OUI charge against Timothy and that it was a \u201cstandard operating under the influence case.\u201d The witness did agree that Fordham\u2019s argument for suppression of the breathalyzer test results, which was successful, was novel and would have justified additional time and labor. He also acknowledged that the acquittal was a good result; even with the suppression of the breathalyzer tests, he testified, the chances of an acquittal would have been \u201c[n]ot likely at a bench trial.\u201d The witness estimated that it would have been necessary, for thorough preparation of the case including the novel breathalyzer suppression argument, to have billed twenty to thirty hours for preparation, not including trial time.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">A second expert, testifying on behalf of bar counsel, expressed his belief that the issues presented in this case were not particularly difficult, nor novel, and that \u201c[t]he degree of skill required to defend a case such as this . . . was not that high.\u201d He did recognize, however, that the theory that Fordham utilized to suppress the breathalyzer tests was impressive and one of which he had previously never heard. Nonetheless, the witness concluded that \u201cclearly there is no way that [he] could justify these kind of hours to do this kind of work.\u201d He estimated that an OUI case involving these types of issues would require sixteen hours of trial preparation and approximately fifteen hours of trial time. He testified that he had once spent ninety hours in connection with an OUI charge against a client that had resulted in a plea. The witness explained, however, that that case had involved a second offense OUI and that it was a case of first impression, in 1987, concerning new breathalyzer equipment and comparative breathalyzer tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">An expert called by Fordham testified that the facts of Timothy\u2019s case presented a challenge and that without the suppression of the breathalyzer test results it would have been \u201can almost impossible situation in terms of prevailing on the trier of fact.\u201d He further stated that, based on the particulars in Timothy\u2019s case, he believed that Fordham\u2019s hours were not excessive and, in fact, he, the witness, would have spent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>comparable amount of time. The witness later admitted, however, that within the past five years, the OUI cases which he had brought to trial required no more than a total of forty billed hours, which encompassed all preparation and court appearances. He explained that, although he had not charged more than forty hours to prepare an OUI case, in comparison to Fordham\u2019s more than 200 expended hours, Fordham nonetheless had spent a reasonable number of hours on the case in light of the continuance and the subsequent need to reprepare, as well as the \u201cvery ingenious\u201d breathalyzer suppression argument, and the Clarks\u2019 insistence on trial. In addition, the witness testified that, although the field sobriety test, breathalyzer tests, and the presence of a half-empty liquor bottle in the car placed Fordham at a serious disadvantage in being able to prevail on the OUI charge, those circumstances were not unusual and in fact agreed that they were \u201c[njormal circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The fourth expert witness, called by Fordham, testified that she believed the case was \u201cextremely tough\u201d and that the breathalyzer suppression theoiy was novel. She testified that, although the time and labor consumed on the case was more than usual in defending an OUI charge, the hours were not excessive. They were not excessive, she explained, because the case was particularly difficult due to the \u201cstakes [and] the evidence.\u201d She conceded, however, that legal issues in defending OUI charges are \u201cpretty standard\u201d and that the issues presented in this case were not unusual. Furthermore, the witness testified that challenging the breathalyzer test due to the .02 discrepancy was not unusual, but the theory on which Fordham proceeded was novel. Finally, she stated that she thought she may have known of one person who might have spent close to one hundred hours on a difficult OUI case; she was not sure; but she had never heard of a fee in excess of $10,000 for a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In considering whether a fee is \u201cclearly excessive\u201d within the meaning of S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 2-106 (B), the first factor to be considered pursuant to that rule is \u201cthe novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.\u201d DR 2-106 (B) (1). That standard is similar to the familiar standard of reasonableness traditionally applied in civil fee disputes. See <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, </em>411 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>754, 759 n.10 (1992) (reasonable hours, when calculating fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 [1994], requires consideration as to \u201cwhether that time was reasonable in light of the difficulty of the case and the results achieved\u201d). See also Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 46 comment f (Proposed Final Draft 1996) (\u201cThe standards that apply when fees are challenged as unreasonable in fee disputes are also relevant in the discipline of lawyers for charging unreasonably high fees\u201d). Based on the testimony of the four experts, the number of hours devoted to Timothy\u2019s OUI case by Fordham and his associates was substantially in excess of the hours that a prudent experienced lawyer would have spent. According to the evidence, the number of hours spent was several times the amount of time any of the witnesses had ever spent on a similar case. We are not unmindful of the novel and successful motion to suppress the breathalyzer test results, but that effort cannot justify a $50,000 fee in a type of case in which the usual fee is less than one-third of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The board determined that \u201c[b]ecause [Fordham] had never tried an OUI case or appeared in the district court, [Fordham] spent over 200 hours preparing the case, in part to educate himself in the relevant substantive law and court procedures.\u201d Fordham\u2019s inexperience in criminal defense work and OUI cases in particular cannot justify the extraordinarily high fee. It cannot be that an inexperienced lawyer is entitled to charge three or four times as much as an experienced lawyer for the same service. A client \u201cshould not be expected to pay for the education of a lawyer when he spends excessive amounts of time on tasks which, with reasonable experience, become matters of routine.\u201d <em>Matter of the Estate of Larson, </em>103 Wash. 2d 517, 531 (1985). \u201cWhile the licensing of a lawyer is evidence that he has met the standards then prevailing for admission to the bar, a lawyer generally should not accept employment in any area of the law in which he is not qualified. However, he may accept such employment if in good faith he expects to become qualified through study and investigation, as long as such preparation would not result in unreasonable delay or expense to his client.\u201d Model Code of Professional Responsibility EC 6-3 (1982). Although the ethical considerations set forth in the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility and Canons of Judicial Ethics are not binding, they none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>theless serve as a guiding principle. See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, as appearing in 382 Mass. 768 (1981) (Ethical Considerations \u201care not adopted as a rule of this court, but those Ethical Considerations form a body of principles upon which the Canons of Ethics and Disciplinary Rules, as herein adopted, are to be interpreted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">DR 2-106 (B) provides that the third factor to be considered in ascertaining the reasonableness of a fee is its comparability to \u201c[t]he fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.\u201d The hearing committee made no finding as to the comparability of Fordham\u2019s fee with the fees customarily charged in the locality for similar services. However, one of bar counsel\u2019s expert witnesses testified that he had never heard of a fee in excess of $15,000 to defend a first OUI charge, and the customary flat fee in an OUI case, including trial, \u201cruns from $1,000 to $7,500.\u201d Bar counsel\u2019s other expert testified that he had never heard of a fee in excess of $10,000 for a bench trial. In his view, the customary charge for a case similar to Timothy\u2019s would vary between $1,500 and $5,000. One of Fordham\u2019s experts testified that she considered a $40,000 or $50,000 fee for defending an OUI charge \u201cunusual and certainly higher by far than any I\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d The witness had never charged a fee of more than $3,500 for representing a client at a bench trial to defend a first offense OUI charge. She further testified that she believed an \u201caverage OUI in the bench session is two thousand [dollars] and sometimes less.\u201d Finally, that witness testified that she had \u201cheard a rumor\u201d that one attorney charged $10,000 for a bench trial involving an OUI charge; this fee represented the highest fee of which she was aware. The other expert witness called by Fordham testified that he had heard of a $35,000 fee for defending OUI charges, but he had never charged more than $12,000 (less than twenty-five per cent of Fordham\u2019s fee).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Although finding that Fordham\u2019s fee was \u201cmuch higher than the fee charged by many attorneys with more experience litigating driving under the influence cases,\u201d the hearing committee nevertheless determined that the fee charged by Fordham was not clearly excessive because Clark \u201cwent into the relationship with Fordham with open eyes,\u201d Fordham\u2019s fee fell within a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d and Clark acquiesced in Fordham\u2019s fee by not strenuously objecting to his bills. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>board accepted the hearing committee\u2019s analysis apart from the committee\u2019s reliance on the \u201csafe harbor\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The finding that Clark had entered into the fee agreement \u201cwith open eyes\u201d was based on the finding that Clark hired Fordham after being fully apprised that he lacked any type of experience in defending an OUI charge and after interviewing other lawyers who were experts in defending OUI charges. Furthermore, the hearing committee and the board relied on testimony which revealed that the fee arrangement had been fully disclosed to Clark including the fact that Fordham \u201cwould have to become familiar with the law in that area.\u201d It is also significant, however, that the hearing committee found that \u201c[djespite Fordham\u2019s disclaimers concerning his experience, Clark did not appear to have understood in any real sense the implications of choosing Fordham to represent Timothy. Fordham did not give Clark any estimate of the total expected fee or the number of $200 hours that would be required.\u201d The express finding of the hearing committee that Clark \u201cdid not appear to have understood in any real sense the implications of choosing Fordham to represent Timothy\u201d directly militates against the finding that Clark entered into the agreement \u201cwith open eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">That brings us to the hearing committee\u2019s finding that Fordham\u2019s fee fell within a \u201csafe harbor.\u201d The hearing committee reasoned that as long as an agreement existed between a client and an attorney to bill a reasonable rate multiplied by the number of hours actually worked, the attorney\u2019s fee was within a \u201csafe harbor\u201d and thus protected from a challenge that the fee was clearly excessive. The board, however, in reviewing the hearing committee\u2019s decision, correctly rejected the notion \u201cthat a lawyer may always escape discipline with billings based on accurate time charges for work honestly performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The \u201csafe harbor\u201d formula would not be an appropriate rationale in this case because the amount of time Fordham spent to educate himself and represent Timothy was clearly excessive despite his good faith and diligence. Disciplinary Rule 2-106 (B)\u2019s mandate that \u201c[a] fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence, experienced in the area of the law involved, would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is substantially in excess of a reasonable fee,\u201d creates explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>an objective standard by which attorneys\u2019 fees are to be judged. We are not persuaded by Fordham\u2019s argument that \u201cunless it can be shown that the \u2018excessive\u2019 work for which the attorney has charged goes beyond mere matters of professional judgment and can be proven, either directly or by reasonable inference, to have involved dishonesty, bad faith or overreaching of the client, no case for discipline has been established.\u201d Disciplinary Rule 2-106 plainly does not require an inquiry into whether the clearly excessive fee was charged to the client under fraudulent circumstances, and we shall not write such a meaning into the disciplinary rule. See <em>Private Reprimand PR-87-14, 5 </em>Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 501, 502 (1987) (violation of DR 2-106 [A] and [B], as appearing in 382 Mass. 772 [1981] found even where \u201cno evidence of bad faith on the part of respondent\u201d); <em>Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, </em>2 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 115, 117 (1980) (violation of DR 2-106 [A] and [C], as appearing in 382 Mass. 772 [1981] even though no \u201coverreaching or improper motivation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Finally, bar counsel challenges the hearing committee\u2019s finding that \u201cif Clark objected to the numbers of hours being spent by Fordham, he could have spoken up with some force when he began receiving bills.\u201d Bar counsel notes, and we agree, that \u201c[t]he test as stated in the DR 2-106 (A) is whether the fee \u2018charged\u2019 is clearly excessive, not whether the fee is accepted as valid or acquiesced in by the client.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the hearing committee and the board erred in not concluding that Fordham\u2019s fee was clearly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Fordham argues that our imposition of discipline would offend his right to due process. A disciplinary sanction constitutes \u201ca punishment or penalty\u201d levied against the respondent, and therefore the respondent is entitled to procedural due process. <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 550 (1968). <em>Matter of Kenney, 399 </em>Mass. 431, 436 (1987) (\u201cattorney has a substantial property right in his license to practice law\u201d). Fordham contends that the bar and, therefore, he, have not been given fair notice through prior decisions of this court or the express language of DR 2-106 that discipline may be imposed for billing excessive hours that were nonetheless spent diligently and in good faith. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 110 (1980), quoting <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., 269 </em>U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (\u201cAn essential principle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>due process is that a statute may not proscribe conduct \u2018in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning\u201d\u2019). It is true, as Fordham asserts, that there is a dearth of case law in the Commonwealth meting out discipline for an attorney\u2019s billing of a clearly excessive fee. There is, however, as we have noted above, case law which specifically addresses what constitutes an unreasonable attorney\u2019s fee employing virtually the identical factors contained within DR 2-106. See <em>Mulhern </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>398 Mass. 18, 25-30 (1986); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Old Colony Trust Co., </em>313 Mass. 329, 335 (1943); <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>284 Mass. 563, 569 (1933). See also <em>Beatty </em>v. <em>NP Corp., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 611 (1991) (\u201cfactors . . . to be considered in determining whether a lawyer\u2019s fee is fair and reasonable have been amply discussed in the cases\u201d). More importantly, the general prohibition in DR 2-106 (A) that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee,\u201d is followed by eight specific, and clearly expressed, factors, to be evaluated by the standard of \u201ca lawyer of ordinary prudence,\u201d in determining the propriety of the fee. Contrast <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., </em>501 U.S. 1030, 1049 (1991), quoting <em>Groyned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 112 (1972) (grammatical structure of attorney disciplinary rule and lack of clarifying interpretation by State court forced attorney to \u201cguess at [the rule\u2019s] contours\u201d thus failing to \u201cprovide \u2018fair notice to those to whom [it] is directed\u2019 \u201d). In addition, nothing contained within the disciplinary rule nor within any pertinent case law indicates in any manner that a clearly excessive fee does not warrant discipline whenever the time spent during the representation was spent in good faith. The fact that this court has not previously had occasion to discipline an attorney in the circumstances of this case does not suggest that the imposition of discipline in this case offends due process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>416 Mass. 114, 123, 125 n.13 (1993) (defendants not deprived of \u201cfair warning\u201d that particular conduct was proscribed by penal statute where criminal liability depended on \u201cdegree\u201d of conduct); <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 324 n.13 (1989) (absence of codified standards to govern attorney discipline proceedings does not offend due process). We reject Fordham\u2019s due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In charging a clearly excessive fee, Fordham departed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>substantially from the obligation of professional responsibility that he owed to his client. The ABA Model Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions \u00a7 7.3 (1992) endorses a public reprimand as the appropriate sanction for charging a clearly excessive fee. We deem such a sanction appropriate in this case. Accordingly, a judgment is to be entered in the county court imposing a public censure. The record in this case is to be unimpounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
