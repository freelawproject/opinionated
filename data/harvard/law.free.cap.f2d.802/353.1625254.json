United States, </em>721 F.2d 1199 (9th Cir.1983) <em>(\u201cCal Cartage I\u201d), </em>we reversed a ruling by the Commission that the appellants lacked standing under the Shipping Act to challenge an assessment agreement (\u201cLM-81\u201d), entered into by intervenors Pacific Maritime Association, an association of on-dock and off-dock container freight operators, and the International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union. The appellants challenged LM-81 under section 814 of the Shipping Act. This provision empowered the Commission to disapprove, cancel, or modify assessment agreements found to be \u201cunjustly discriminatory or unfair as between carriers, shippers, or ports, or to operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United States____\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">In <em>Cal Cartage I </em>we determined that the appellants lacked standing to assert a claim on the ground that LM-81 was discriminatory. 721 F.2d at 1205. We also discussed two other bases for the appellants\u2019 standing to challenge LM-81: 1) 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 821, which allows \u201c[a]ny person\u201d to file with the Commission \u201ca sworn complaint setting forth any violation of this chapter,\u201d and 2) the \u201czone of interests\u201d created by section 814\u2019s \u201cdetriment to commerce\u201d test. 721 F.2d at 1203-06. We held that the appellants, \u201cas part of the network that makes up waterborne commerce, are within section 814\u2019s zone of protected interests and have standing to challenge an assessment agreement under the detriment to commerce standard.\u201d 721 F.2d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-20\">In 1984, shortly after the <em>Cal Courtage I </em>decision, Congress amended the Shipping Act, eliminating the \u201cdetrimental to commerce\u201d basis for invalidating assessment agreements. Under the Shipping Act of 1984, the Commission is empowered to disapprove assessment agreements only if they are found to be \u201cunjustly discriminatory or unfair as between carriers, shippers, or ports.\u201d 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1704(d) (West Supp.1986). In addition, the Shipping Act of 1984, prohibits application of any provision of the Shipping Act to assessment agreements except sections 1704(d) and 1706(a) of the 1984 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>On remand, the Commission ruled that in light of the Shipping Act of 1984, the appellants no longer had standing or a cause of action to challenge LM-81. However, the Commission also determined that denying the appellants potential reparations for an unlawful \u201cdetriment to commerce\u201d would constitute \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d and that the appellants were therefore entitled to a decision on the merits. The Commission ruled that the appellants were not entitled to pursue the remedies of assessment adjustments or retroactive or prospective disapproval of LM-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The appellants waived their right to seek reparations on their own behalf and persisted in their claim for invalidation of LM-81 and reparations on behalf of their customers. The Commission then ruled that appellants could not assert the rights of their customers and issued a final order dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">A. <em>Our Holding in Cal Cartage I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The appellants argue that our <em>Cal Cartage I </em>decision set forth two independent, alternative bases for standing: 1) the zone of interests \u201cdetriment to commerce\u201d basis, and 2) the \u201cany person\u201d basis of section 821. They contend that even if the Shipping Act of 1984 eliminated the \u201cdetriment to commerce\u201d basis, they still have standing to sue under the \u201cany person\u201d provision of section 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Our decision in <em>Cal Cartage I </em>did not set forth two independent bases for standing. Rather, we determined that appellants\u2019 satisfaction of constitutional standing prerequisites alone was insufficient to give them standing to challenge assessment agreements and made clear that the appellants must also satisfy the prudential \u201czone of interests\u201d test. We held: \u201cPetitioners\u2019 assertions that they have suffered \u2018injury in fact\u2019 are insufficient to establish standing. While injury in fact is a crucial element of standing, petitioners must also satisfy the \u2018zone of interest\u2019 test set out in text.\u201d 721 F.2d at 1203 n. 3 (citations omitted). <em>See also id. </em>at 1205 n. 9. To have standing to challenge LM-81, the appellants must fall within the zone of interests protected by section 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">B. <em>Effect of the Shipping Act of 1984.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The Shipping Act of 1984, like the earlier Shipping Act, empowers the Commission to disapprove, cancel, or modify assessment agreements upon complaint filed. The appellants contend that to determine who can file such a complaint under the Shipping Act of 1984, the court must refer, as it did in <em>Cal Cartage I, </em>to the \u201cany person\u201d provision of the Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 821. However, by stating that <em>only </em>sections 1704(d) and 1706(a) of the Shipping Act of 1984 apply to assessment agreements, section 1704(d) precludes application of the \u201cany person\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Despite this clear and explicit language, the appellants contend that Congress did not intend to preclude application of the \u201cany person\u201d standard to section 1704(d). However, they cite no legislative history that supports this contention, other than general statements that section 821 should be broadly construed. We are unpersuaded by their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">The appellants also draw a substantive/procedural dichotomy for determining the preclusive effect of section 1704(d). They argue that Congress intended to preclude only the substantive provisions of the Shipping Act, such as rate, conference, and terminal regulations, and not procedural matters governing standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">The legislative history lends no support to the appellants\u2019 substantive/procedural analysis, which we decline to apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">C. <em>Inapplicability of Savings Provision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">The appellants also contend that their standing and cause of action are preserved under the savings provision of the Shipping Act of 1984. The savings provision preserves suits 1) \u201cfiled before March 20, 1984\u201d and 2) \u201cwith respect to claims arising out of conduct engaged in before March 20, 1984, filed within 1 year after March 20,1984.\u201d 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1719(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>However, the Commission has interpreted section 1719(e) as \u201cintended only to preserve antitrust actions;\u201d it has \u201cno application to cases pending before the Commission.\u201d 49 Fed.Reg. 21, 798 n. 1 (1984). Since the Commission is charged with administration of the Shipping Act, its interpretation of the Act is entitled to considerable deference. <em>Takazato v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>633 F.2d 1276, 1278 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of section 1719(e) is reasonable in light of the legislative history, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">Subsection (e) contains two savings provisions. One provides that service contracts entered into before the date of enactment may remain in full force and effect and are given until 15 months after enactment to comply with the requirements in this bill. This should permit sufficient time to meet all transitional requirements. The other savings provision is intended to preserve the rights of parties to <em>lawsuits </em>that are filed before the date of enactment. Since section 7(a)(7) of the bill makes the antitrust laws inapplicable to any agreement, modification, or cancellation that was approved by the Federal Maritime Commission under present law, there were some who thought this would adversely affect pending <em>lawsuits. </em>The intent of this savings provision is to permit such <em>suits </em>to continue to conclusion as if the legislation were never enacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">H.R.Rep. No. 53, Pt. 1, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 39, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 167, 204 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">D. <em>No Manifest Injustice Will Result.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Generally, a new statute applies to cases pending on the date of its enactment unless manifest injustice would result or there is a statutory directive or legislative history to the contrary. <em>Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). In determining whether manifest injustice results, we must consider \u201c(a) the nature and identity of the parties, (b) the nature of their rights, and (c) the nature of the impact of the change in law upon those rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 94 S.Ct. at 2019. <em>See also City of Great Falls v. U.S. Department of Labor, </em>673 F.2d 1065, 1068-69 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The Commission determined that manifest injustice would result if the appellants were deprived of reparation for any injury they suffered due to violation of the Shipping Act\u2019s \u201cdetriment to commerce\u201d standard. However, the appellants waived their right to reparations and instead sought disapproval of LM-81 and reparations on behalf of their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">The Commission\u2019s analysis in determining that the appellants were not entitled to retroactive or prospective disapproval of LM-81 is sound. The appellants have no absolute right to invalidation of the agreement. No legislative mandate preserves the appellants\u2019 requested relief. As discussed earlier, lawsuit savings provision of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719(e)(2), applies only to court actions and not to pending administrative cases. The Commission properly declined to invalidate LM-81 under a now defunct statute and contrary to existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">The appellants have not demonstrated that manifest injustice will ensue if the Shipping Act of 1984 is applied to deprive them of disapproval of LM-81. The appellants contend that denial of standing will deprive them of an antitrust remedy. However, because no case has yet interpreted the antitrust immunity provision in the context of an automatically approved assessment agreement, that result is uncertain. <em>See Cal Cartage I, </em>721 F.2d at 1204 n. 7. Moreover, because the antitrust immunity implications of the Shipping Act are not properly before the court at this time, we do not reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">The appellants also contend that because the statute of limitation for enforcement of the Shipping Act has run, dismissal of their action would bar the claims of those shippers who <em>would </em>have standing to challenge the assessment agreement as unjustly discriminatory. The appellants argue that these shippers relied on the pendency of this proceeding to protect their rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>consequently declined to bring their own actions for relief. However, apart from the testimony of one shipper (Testimony of John Merchant, Tr. No. 35, pp. 224-43), appellants presented no evidence to support their contention that other shippers, carriers, or ports relied on the appellants to protect their rights. Moreover, the very shippers whose claims the appellants assert here are Pacific Marine Association members, who, as intervenors in this action, resist appellants\u2019 petition to invalidate LM-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Manifest injustice would not result from application of the Shipping Act of 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Because the appellants lack standing under the \u201cany person\u201d provision of section 821, they cannot assert the rights of their customers to reparations -for LM-81\u2019s \u201cunjustly discriminatory\u201d effect. Moreover, we have already determined that appellants cannot assert standing under the \u201cunjustly discriminatory\u201d provisions of the Shipping Act. <em>Cal Cartage I, </em>721 F.2d at 1205. The appellants are therefore precluded from seeking invalidation of LM-81 and reparations on behalf of their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The Commission\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 action is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
