Costle, at that time Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, sent a letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>then Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie in which he concluded that \u201cacid deposition is endangering public welfare in the U.S. and Canada and ... U.S. and Canadian sources contribute to the problem not only in the country where they are located but also in the neighboring country.\u201d This appeal requires us to decide whether, under \u00a7 115 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7415 (1982), Administrator Costle\u2019s letter legally obligated his successors to identify the states in which pollution responsible for acid deposition originates and to order those states to abate the emissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-6\">Subsection (a) of \u00a7 115 of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. 685, 710 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7415(a) (1982)) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1527-7\">Whenever the [EPA] Administrator, upon receipt of reports, surveys or studies from any duly constituted international agency has reason to believe that any air pollutant or pollutants emitted in the United States cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in a foreign country ... the Administrator shall give formal notification thereof to the Governor of the State in which such emissions originate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aacs\">Subsection (b) provides that the \u201cformal notification\u201d issued under subsection (a) shall operate to force each state to revise as much of its state implementation plan (SIP) as is \u201cinadequate to prevent or eliminate the endangerment referred to in subsection (a).\u201d (SIP\u2019s impose controls upon individual polluters within each state sufficient to ensure that national ambient air quality standards are met.) Finally, subsection (c) makes subsections (a) and (b) applicable only if the endangered foreign country is one \u201cwhich the Administrator determines has given the United States essentially the same rights with respect to the prevention and control of air pollution occurring in that country as is given that country by this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-8\">On January 13, 1981, only days before President Reagan took office, outgoing EPA Administrator Costle wrote to then Secretary of State Muskie to express his belief that pollution emitted in the United States was at least partially responsible for acid deposition endangering public welfare in Canada. Acid deposition \u2014 often referred to as \u201cacid rain\u201d \u2014 is believed to occur when certain pollutants are transported through the atmosphere and chemically altered by atmospheric processes before being deposited in either dry or wet form. Administrator Costle based his \u201cendangerment\u201d finding on a report issued by the International Joint Commission, concededly a \u201cduly constituted international agency\u201d for purpose of \u00a7 7415(a). In his letter, Administrator Costle also concluded that newly enacted legislation authorized the Canadian government to provide the United States with essentially the same rights as the United States affords Canada under the Clean Air Act, although he recognized that this \u201creciprocity\u201d finding \u201ccould be changed should the U.S. conclude that future Canadian actions interpreting or implementing their legislation were not giving essentially the same rights to the U.S.\u201d Administrator Costle sent a similar letter to Senator George Mitchell of Maine and announced his findings in a press release. No advance notice of Administrator Costle\u2019s actions was given, no comments were solicited, and neither the letters nor the findings were published in the Federal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-9\">Administrator Costle\u2019s successors at the EPA did not regard his actions as sufficient to trigger any mandatory action under \u00a7 7415. Consequently, several eastern states, national environmental groups, American citizens who own property in eastern Canada, and a Congressman sued the EPA in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201ccitizen suit\u201d provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a)(2), which provides that \u201cany person may commence a civil action on his own behalf ... against the Administrator where there is alleged a failure of the Administrator to perform any act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>duty under this [Act] which is not discretionary with the Administrator.\u201d The plaintiffs argued that the Costle letters imposed upon the current EPA Administrator a duty to identify the states responsible for acid deposition and to issue SIP revision notices to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-4\">The District Court agreed. <em>New York v. Thomas, </em>613 F.Supp. 1472, 1481-86 (D.D.C. 1985). The court was not troubled by the EPA\u2019s argument that identifying <em>which </em>states to notify would be time consuming, costly and perhaps impossible; the Court simply stated that \u201cthe obligation to identify the polluting states is incidental to giving formal notification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1484 n. *. Likewise, the Court was untroubled that Administrator Costle made his findings in private correspondence, without notice, opportunity for comment, or publication in the Federal Register. The Court remarked that the EPA frequently uses correspondence to take \u201cformal action\u201d under the Clean Air Act, <em>id. </em>at 1484 n. **, and stated that publication of the Costle findings in the Federal Register \u201cwould be inappropriate for this kind of action because it is not a rule or policy statement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1484. The court ordered the EPA to reassess Administrator Costle\u2019s \u201creciprocity\u201d finding and, if it remained accurate, to issue SIP revision notices within 180 days thereafter. On October 22, 1985, the current EPA Administrator found that reciprocity continues to exist between the United States and Canada. The District Court then stayed its order to permit the EPA to bring this appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-6\">This case involves an unusual statute executed in an unexpected manner. On its face, \u00a7 7415 requires an EPA Administrator who has reason to believe in the existence of an international air pollution problem to issue SIP revision notices to <em>\u201cthe </em>Governor\u201d of <em>\u201cthe </em>State\u201d responsible for it. In the context of a complex, multi-source pollution problem like acid deposition, identification of the problem does not necessarily bring with it identification of the blameworthy states. Had the statute been executed as Congress probably anticipated, the present suit would not have arisen. Notice of the \u201cendangerment\u201d and \u201creciprocity\u201d findings would have been issued at the same time as the proposed SIP revision notices, comment would have been taken on both, and both would have been published in final form in the Federal Register. <em>Cf. National Asphalt Pavement Ass\u2019n v. Train, </em>539 F.2d 775, 778 (D.C.Cir.1976) <em>(\u201cNational Asphalt </em>\u201d) (finding that particular category of stationary source was \u201csignificant contributor\u201d to air pollution issued simultaneously with proposed standards of performance whose issuance was triggered by such finding). Because Administrator Costle chose to issue the \u201cendangerment\u201d and \u201creciprocity\u201d findings before attempting to identify the culpable states, however, we must determine appellants\u2019 claim that the findings legally bind the current Administrator to issue SIP notices. We conclude that, whatever the impact of Administrator Costle\u2019s letter, it cannot serve as a basis for judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-9\">Section 551(4) of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4) (1982), defines \u201crule\u201d as \u201cthe whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\u201d Clearly, an agency statement that bound subsequent EPA Administrators to issue SIP revision notices would be a statement of \u201cfuture effect designed to implement ... law or policy\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>and thus a rule. It requires notice-and-comment procedures, therefore, unless it comes within one of the APA\u2019s exceptions for \u201cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(A). The statement in the present case is none of these. The findings of \u201cendangerment\u201d and \u201creciprocity\u201d are not an interpretative rule because they are not a \u201cstatement interpreting an existing statute or rule,\u201d <em>Batterton v. Marshall, </em>648 F.2d 694, 705 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>see also Cabals v. Egger, </em>690 F.2d 234, 237-38 (D.C. Cir.1982); <em>Guardian Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. FSLIC, </em>589 F.2d 658, 664 (D.C.Cir.1978) <em>(\u201cGuardian Federal </em>\u201d); <em>Gibson Wine Co. v. Snyder, </em>194 F.2d 329, 331 (D.C.Cir.1952). They are not a \u201cgeneral statement of policy\u201d for (on the assumption that they bind subsequent Administrators to action) they do more than express, without the \u201cforce of law,\u201d the EPA\u2019s \u201ctentative intentions for the future.\u201d <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. FPC, </em>506 F.2d 33, 38 (D.C.Cir.1974). They are not a rule of \u201cagency organization, procedure, or practice\u201d because they \u201cgo[] beyond formality,\u201d <em>Pickus v. Board of Parole, </em>507 F.2d 1107, 1113 (D.C.Cir.1974), and \u201cjeopardize[ ]\u201d <em>Batterton, </em>648 F.2d at 708, or \u201csubstantially affect,\u201d <em>National Ass\u2019n of Home Health Agencies v. Schweiker, </em>690 F.2d 932, 950 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1205, 103 S.Ct. 1193, 75 L.Ed.2d 438 (1983), the rights and interests of private parties. The fact that it is not yet certain which particular states will receive SIP notices as a result of the findings, and which particular dischargers within those states will suffer injury, may be relevant to the question of when legal challenge to the findings would be <em>ripe, </em>but does not convert them into a mere general statement of policy or a procedural rule. We conclude that if Administrator Costle\u2019s findings left the EPA no alternative but to issue SIP notices ultimately causing the termination or restriction of the operations of many utilities and manufacturers \u2014 if they <em>forced </em>the EPA to take direct and substantial regulatory actions-they could not be promulgated without notice-and-comment procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-8\">Confirmation of this view is contained in <em>National Asphalt, </em>which held that an EPA Clean Air Act determination similar to the findings involved here was a rule that required notice-and-comment procedures. At issue in that case was the designation of a particular industry for inclusion on the list of stationary sources which \u201cmay contribute significantly to air pollution which causes or contributes to the endangerment of public health or welfare.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-6(b)(l)(A) (1970). Within 120 days after such designation, the Administrator was obligated to publish proposed standards of performance for members of that industry. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-6(b)(l)(B). We held that notice and comment was required <em>on the designation. National Asphalt, </em>539 F.2d at 779 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-9\">Appellees urge that a contrary result is demanded by <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Costle, </em>636 F.2d 1229, 1254-56 (D.C.Cir.1980) <em>(\u201cCostle\u201d), </em>which held that a settlement modification requiring the EPA to take certain investigatory actions was not a rule. <em>Costle, </em>however, like the cases upon which it relied, rests upon \u201ca classification \u2014 of investigative acts\u2014 that is set apart from either adjudication or rulemaking.\u201d <em>Guardian Federal, </em>589 F.2d at 663. No similar \u201cinvestigative acts\u201d are at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-10\">We need not address appellants\u2019 remaining arguments to the point that, even if the <em>Costle </em>findings <em>had </em>been published only after notice and comment, they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>nevertheless be insufficient to support the present suit. It suffices to say that, because the findings were issued without notice and comment, they cannot be the basis for the judicial relief appellees seek. How and when the agency chooses to proceed to the stage of notification triggered by the findings is within the agency\u2019s discretion and not subject to judicial compulsion. ******</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-4\">We reverse and remand to the District Court with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1528-7\"> Both appellants and appellees labor under the misconception that the classification of an agency statement as a <em>rule </em>depends upon whether it substantially affects the interests of private parties. While language in past decisions of this court is somewhat misleading on the point, <em>see Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Gorsuch, </em>713 F.2d 802, 814-15 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Costle, </em>636 F.2d 1229, 1254-55 (D.C.Cir.1980), other decisions, <em>see e.g., Batterton v. Marshall, </em>648 F.2d 694, 704-08 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Department of Labor v. Kast Metals Corp., </em>744 F.2d 1145, 1150 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1984), and the APA itself make clear that the impact of an agency statement upon private parties is relevant only to whether it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>the <em>sort </em>of rule that is a rule of procedure, <em>see National Ass\u2019n of Home Health Agencies v. Schweiker, </em>690 F.2d 932, 949 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1205, 103 S.Ct. 1193, 75 L.Ed.2d 438 (1983), or a general statement of policy, <em>see Cabais v. Egger, </em>690 F.2d 234, 237 (D.C.Cir.1982), and thus does not require notice and comment, not to whether it is a rule at all. Indeed, the APA expressly includes within the definition of rule \"an agency statement ... describing the organization ... of an agency\u201d \u2014 a statement that can rarely if ever have effect outside of the agency itself. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
