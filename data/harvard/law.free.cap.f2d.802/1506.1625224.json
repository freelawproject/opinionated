On June 28, the administrative law judge held that Butcher was not totally disabled on pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment and was not, therefore, entitled to black lung benefits. By a decision and order filed with the Clerk of the Board on May 16, 1985, the Benefits Review Board (BRB or Board) affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s denial of benefits. On July 18, 1985, Butcher filed his Petition for Review with this court. Big Mountain Coal, Inc. subsequently moved this court to dismiss Butcher\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-14\">Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), made applicable to the Black Lung Benefits Act by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a) (as amended), the BRB\u2019s final orders are reviewable \u201cin the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred, by filing in such court <em>within sixty days </em>following the issuance of such Board order a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside.\u201d (Emphasis added). Butcher concedes that he filed Jiis petition for review with this court sixty-three days after the BRB filed its decision and order with the Clerk of the Board. Nevertheless, Butcher contends that his Petition for Review was not untimely filed because there is no documentary proof that the Clerk subsequently complied with all the elements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.403(b), as required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.410(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 802.403(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1589-15\">The original of the decision shall be filed with the Clerk of the Board. A copy of the Board\u2019s decision shall be sent by certified mail or otherwise presented to all parties to the appeal and the Director. The record on appeal, together with a transcript of any oral proceedings, and briefs or other papers filed with the Board, and a copy of the decision shall be returned to the appropriate deputy commissioner for filing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1589-16\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.403(b) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-17\">In essence, Butcher contends that his Petition for Review is not untimely because there is no evidence that a copy of the Board\u2019s decision was served on all the parties, or that the record was ever returned to the appropriate deputy commissioner for filing. Thus, Butcher contends, the BRB\u2019s decision was never issued for purposes of the sixty-day appeal period. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-18\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has rejected a similar argument in the same context. See <em>Pittston Stevedoring Corp. v. Dellaventura, </em>544 F.2d 35, 42-44 (2d Cir.1976), <em>aff'd on other grounds </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number><em>sub nom. Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 522, 50 L.Ed.2d 607 (1977). Writing for the Second Circuit in <em>Dellaventura, </em>Judge Friendly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1590-4\">We see no reason not to read 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) as meaning what it says. The policy requiring that appeals be timely filed is so strong that ministerial failures by a clerk cannot be allowed to overcome it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1590-5\">We concur with the rationale and holding of the court in <em>Dellaventura. </em>Consequently, we reject Butcher\u2019s arguments in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-6\">Accordingly, Butcher\u2019s Petition for Review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to its untimely filing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1589-12\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.410(a) (1986) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahq\">Within 60 days after a decision by the Board has been filed pursuant to \u00a7 802.-403(b), any party adversely affected or aggrieved by such decision may file a petition for review with the appropriate U.S. court of appeals pursuant to section 21(c) of the LHWCA.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1590-21\">. Butcher had contended in his Petition for Review that there was no substantial evidence to support the BRB\u2019s finding that Butcher was not disabled by pneumoconiosis. Because we dismiss the Petition as untimely, we need not reach that question. Nevertheless, after briefing and oral argument, we note in passing that the appeal is without merit in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
