HUNTER, Jr., District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b908-26\">Baddour, Inc., brought this wrongful levy suit against the United States of America and Michael Posey, an IRS agent. Damages are claimed for losses allegedly sustained when its property, certain soft goods located in a taxpayer\u2019s plant, was seized to satisfy taxpayer\u2019s liability. Following a bench trial, the district court concluded that recovery against Posey, individually was barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity. It held, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Baddour was entitled to recover under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7426(b)(2) (West 1967), <em>amended by </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7426(b)(2) (West Supp. 1986), in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property at the time that it should have been sold pursuant to 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 6335 (West 1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This value was fixed at $64,775. The United States appeals. Baddour appeals from the Posey dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">We AFFIRM in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Baddour, Inc. entered into a contract with Brame Manufacturing Co., Inc., the \u201ctaxpayer\u201d, pursuant to which it periodically shipped raw material for athletic clothing from its facility in Memphis, Tennessee, to the Brame factory in Batesville, Mississippi. Brame manufactured the raw material into finished garments, shipped them to Baddour\u2019s pre-arranged purchasers, and received a portion of the purchase price as payment for its manufacturing work.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">In late 1981 and early 1982, the IRS assessed Brame for tax delinquencies of more than $170,000. The IRS filed tax liens in Batesville where the Brame factory was located and in Sardis, Mississippi. The IRS agent in charge of the case, cross-appellee Michael E. Posey, then met with Julius Brame, the president and owner of Brame, to ascertain what property was available to satisfy Brame\u2019s tax liability. Posey learned that Brame\u2019s plant in Bates-ville contained certain soft goods, work in progress, and completed garments. Based both upon Brame\u2019s description of the business arrangement and the absence of a U.C.C. filing statement, Posey concluded that Brame actually had title to the goods. On April 23, 1982, the IRS issued a levy and a Notice of Seizure to Brame and seized the goods in the Batesville factory by placing a padlock on the outside door.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some if not all of the goods inside, seized to satisfy Brame\u2019s tax liability, belonged to Baddour.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Following the seizure, Charles S. Vail, corporate secretary of Baddour, wrote a letter to Posey detailing their ownership of the property. Vail insisted that the taxpayer \u201chad no interest in the goods,\u201d that Baddour \u201cbought the goods, paid for the goods, and had them shipped\u201d to the taxpayer\u2019s plant; that the taxpayer was \u201cto do certain work to said goods and ship them\u201d to Baddour\u2019s customers, and that \u201cthe transaction was never intended as a security transaction\u201d because the goods were Baddour\u2019s at all times. Posey then reached an understanding with Brame and Fred Klyce, president of Panola County Bank (the holder of a security interest), that if the seizure were released, the goods would be transported to Mississippi Mills in Sardis, Mississippi, where manufacture would be completed. The finished goods would be sold, and the net proceeds disbursed 50 percent to the Internal Revenue Service, 25 percent to Panola County Bank and 25 percent to Brame for sales expenses. The understanding was memorialized in a letter to Posey from Klyce dated May 25, 1982. On that same day, Posey removed the padlock and seizure notice from taxpayer\u2019s premises and signed the notice indicating that the goods had been released from the seizure. The document was also signed by Klyce, as \u201cAgent for Brame,\u201d acknowledging receipt of the property and that the property was in the same condition as it had been prior to seizure. The soft goods were then removed to Mississippi Mills where some of the goods were made into finished products and sold. The United States eventually received $1,502 as its share of the sale proceeds pursuant to the agreement with Brame and Klyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">Following the \u201crelease,\u201d Baddour discovered that its goods were no longer in the Brame factory. They immediately contacted Posey to ascertain its whereabouts. Po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>sey replied merely that the goods had been \u201creleased to the taxpayer.\u201d Only after the commencement of litigation did Baddour learn of the contemporaneous agreement for manufacture and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The district court held that there had been a wrongful levy and that the strings-attached release was not a release under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6343(a) (West Supp.1986). It then analyzed the relationship between a \u201cdeemed sale\u201d under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6335(e) regarding the manner and conditions of the sale of seized property, and the recovery provisions of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7426(b)(2)(C). The district court concluded that if the provisions of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6335(e) are not followed and no \u201cminimum\u201d price is set, then the fair market value at the time that the property should have been sold pursuant to statute shall be considered the minimum price.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7426(a)(1) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-7\">If a levy has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">This statute constitutes a waiver by the United States of its sovereign immunity to suit; if the wrongful levy is released prior to the filing, no waiver exists and the court acquires no jurisdiction. <em>See Nickerson v. United States, </em>513 F.2d 31 (1st Cir.1975). To assess the jurisdictional issue, we are obliged to answer this inquiry: Was the levy released prior to the filing of this suit?</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6343(a), entitled \u201cRelease of Levy,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-10\">It shall be lawful for the Secretary or his delegate, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, to release the levy upon all or part of the property or rights to property levied upon where the Secretary determines that such action will facilitate the collection of the liability, but such release shall not operate to prevent any subsequent levy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Unfortunately, the statute and the regulations, <em>see </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 301.6343-l(a)(l)-(b)(3), delineate only circumstances in which a levy may be released. They do not establish a procedure for release. <em>Cf. </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6325 (West Supp.1986) (procedure for release of tax lien). Although the genesis of the Mississippi Mills-Posey-Brame arrangement is murky, the levy clearly would not have been \u201creleased\u201d in the absence of the contemporaneous agreement for manufacture and sale. The issue quickly narrows. Does the strings-attached release constitute a \u201crelease of levy\u201d under \u00a7 6343(a)?</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Plaintiff strenuously argues that a \u201crelease\u201d is a giving up or an abandonment and therefore may not be conditioned upon an agreement for transportation, manufacture, and sale. The regulations under \u00a7 6343, clearly indicate that a release may be conditioned upon the provision of a substitute for the property levied on, <em>see, e.g., </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 301-6343-l(a)(2)(i)-(v) (release of levy conditioned respectively on escrow arrangement, bond, payment of amount of United States\u2019 interest in property, assignment of salaries and wages, and installment payment arrangements) or the performance of some other action. There are sound reasons for permitting a release to be conditioned upon the taxpayer agreeing to send his own property to another factory for manufacture, sale, and satisfaction of a tax liability. However, neither reason, common sense nor equity can justify a strings-attached release of property which was owned by a third party. We fully agree with the district court that a strings-attached release is not a \u201crelease\u201d under \u00a7 6343(a). The property was not validly released. Jurisdiction exists under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7426(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">The statute in effect at the time of the wrongful levy on April 23,1982 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>(b) <em>Adjudication. </em>\u2014 The district court shall have jurisdiction to grant only such of the following forms of relief as may be appropriate in the circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-6\">(2) <em>Recovery of property. </em>\u2014 If the court determines that such property has been wrongfully levied upon, the court may\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">(A) order the return of specific property if the United States is in possession of such property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-8\">(B) grant a judgment for the amount of money levied upon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">(C) grant a judgment for an amount not exceeding the amount received by the United States from the sale of such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">For the purposes of subparagraph (C), if the property was declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e) (relating to manner and conditions of sale), the United States shall be treated as having received an amount equal to the minimum price determined pursuant to such section or (if larger) the amount received by the United States from the resale of such property-</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7426(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Relief is not proper under \u00a7 7426(b)(2)(A), because the specific property levied on is no longer in existence. Moreover, although \u00a7 7426(b)(2)(B) appears to allow recovery for the amount of the assessment, it has been limited to instances where a specific sum of money is levied on. <em>See, Flores v. United States, </em>551 F.2d 1169 (9th Cir.1977); <em>cf. </em>S.Rep. No. 1708, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 30, <em>reprinted in </em>1966 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3722, 3751 (relief for wrongful levy on money limited to amount of money levied on). Baddour may recover only under \u00a7 7426(b)(2)(C), which deals with an actual or deemed sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">\u00a7 7426(b)(2)(C) was amended, effective for levies after December 31, 1982, to provide that upon a wrongful levy, the court may,</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">(C) if such property was sold, grant a judgment for an amount not exceeding the greater of\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-15\">(i) the amount received by the United States from the sale of such property, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-16\">(ii) the fair market value of such property immediately before the levy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-17\"><em>Id. </em>Inasmuch as the levy in issue took place on April 23, 1982, prior to the effective date of the amendment, the parties dispute the proper measure of recovery, <em>i.e., </em>the fair market value of its property immediately prior to the levy, which allegedly is $64,775 or the $1,502 received by the United States from sale of the goods. Specifically, the parties dispute whether the statutory amendment allowing recovery of fair market value codifies existing law or excludes such recovery by negative implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">The statutory boilerplate language of \u00a7 7426(b)(2), which was unaltered by the amendment, addresses the relationship between a \u201cdeemed sale\u201d under \u00a7 6335(e) and the recovery provisions of \u00a7 7426(b)(2)(C). Our inquiry regards the manner and conditions relating to a sale. The Secretary is to set the \u201cminimum price.\u201d \u00a7 6335(e)(1). Thereafter, the properly is to be sold either at public auction or public sale with sealed bids. \u00a7 6335(e)(1). If the minimum price is not bid, the United States shall be treated as having purchased the property at such amount. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 301.6335-1(c)(3). The boilerplate language of \u00a7 7426(b)(2) provides that, upon a deemed sale, the minimum price shall be considered the \u201camount received by the United States\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 7426(b)(2)(C). Furthermore, if the provisions of \u00a7 6335(e) are not followed and no minimum price is set, case law indicates that fair market value at the time the property should have been sold pursuant to that statute shall be considered the minimum price. <em>United States v. Pittman, </em>449 F.2d 623, 628 (7th Cir.1971) (section 6335 procedures not followed; taxpayer entitled to credit in amount of fair market value at time property should have been sold). \u00a7 6335 protects the property owner in two important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ways. First, it requires the property be sold promptly. Second, it requires an appraisal to set a minimum price. Where the law protects the taxpayer himself when his property is seized and sold, surely it must protect an innocent third party whose property was wrongfully seized and sold to pay the debt of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The district court held that in the absence of any evidence regarding a change in value of plaintiffs\u2019 property from the time of the levy to the time at which the property should have been sold by the government, the plaintiffs are entitled to an award of $64,775 being the fair market value of the property at the time of the levy. This finding of fact is amply supported by the record. We find no error in the district court\u2019s award of damages against the United States under the unique facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">In its amended complaint, Baddour sought to hold Revenue Officer Posey individually liable, asserting that he acted \u201cin bad faith and violated [Baddour\u2019s] rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution\u201d in failing to follow the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. Under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), in appropriate situations federal courts may fashion a damages remedy for violation of constitutional rights by government agents. The Supreme Court \u201chas expressly cautioned, however, that such a remedy will not be available when \u2018special factors counselling hesitation\u2019 are present.\u201d <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 298, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 2365, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983) (quoting <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 396, 91 S.Ct. at 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Following a bench trial, the District Court dismissed the damage claim insofar as it seeks damages against the individual defendant for alleged excesses in the performance of his official duties. The record lends overwhelming support to the district judge\u2019s finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-8\">In the instant case, Posey undoubtedly possesses qualified immunity. Posey\u2019s actions undisputedly [sic] were taken pursuant to his duties as a revenue officer. Furthermore, Posey reasonably could have believed that Brame had an interest in the goods levied on for at least the value of its work performance; thus, Posey\u2019s acts were within the scope of his discretionary authority and establish a prima facie case for immunity. Furthermore, the plaintiff has failed to adequately demonstrate either a lack of good faith or a malicious intent by Posey. Thus, the court determines that recovery from the defendant Posey in this case is barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-9\"><em>Baddour, Inc. v. United States, </em>614 F.Supp. 159, 166-67 (N.D.Miss.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">We must view the problem from a different legal perspective than did the district court, but reach the same result. In <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), the Supreme Court reformulated the standard for determining qualified immunity. Prior to <em>Harlow, </em>the qualified or \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity test had two prongs: one objective and one subjective. <em>See, e.g., Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 318, 95 S.Ct. 992, 999, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975). Under the objective prong, an official was not shielded from liability if he \u201cknew or reasonably should have known that the action he took within his sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of [plaintiffs].\u201d <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 815, 102 S.Ct. at 2737. An official would be denied immunity under the subjective prong if \u201che took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because of its concern that the subjective good faith component of qualified immunity would entail wide-ranging discovery into the official\u2019s motivation, the Court in <em>Harlow </em>eliminated the subjective prong. 457 U.S. at 815-19, 102 S.Ct. at 2736-39. Instead, it fashioned a new test for qualified immunity as follows: \u201c[G]overnment officials performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate <em>clearly established </em>statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738 (emphasis added). No other inquiry is relevant. <em>Davis v. Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3018, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984); <em>See also Saldana v. Garza, </em>684 F.2d 1159, 1165 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Posey did not violate any of Baddour\u2019s clearly established constitutional rights. The levy in question did constitute a seizure. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6331(b) (West Supp.1986). However, any doubts as to its validity were resolved by the Supreme Court in <em>G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 338, 97 S.Ct. 619, 50 L.Ed.2d 530 (1977). There, the Supreme Court noted that where the government seizes property to collect delinquent taxes, the seizure, if it involves no invasion of one\u2019s premises, does not violate the Fourth Amendment. 429 U.S. at 351-52, 97 S.Ct. at 627-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Baddour\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument is similarly devoid of substance. A seizure under \u00a7 6331 is provisional and does not determine the rights of third parties until after the levy is made in a post seizure administrative or judicial hearing. The Commissioner\u2019s summary assessment and collection activities do not run afoul of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, so long as there is an adequate opportunity for post-collection review of his actions. Indeed, the Supreme Court has specifically upheld the constitutionality of the Internal Revenue Service levy procedures in a variety of contexts. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, </em>424 U.S. 614, 630-32 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1062, 1072 n. 12, 47 L.Ed.2d 278 (1976); <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 91-92, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1999-2000, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); <em>Phillips v. Commissioner, </em>283 U.S. 589, 593-600, 51 S.Ct. 608, 610-13, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931); <em>G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, </em>429 U.S. at 352 n. 18, 97 S.Ct. at 628 n. 18; <em>United States v. National Bank of Commerce, </em>472 U.S. 713, 105 S.Ct. 2919, 86 L.Ed.2d 565 (1985). Thus \u00a7 6331 has withstood numerous constitutional challenges predicated on the lack of preseizure judicial hearings. <em>Myers v. United States, </em>647 F.2d 591 (5th Cir. 1981). A person alleging that his property has been wrongfully levied upon has an opportunity for \u201cfull judicial consideration, in an adversary context, of the validity of the levy.\u201d More than that the Constitution does not guarantee. <em>Id. </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">It is apparent that plaintiff\u2019s complaint utterly failed to state any claim upon which relief could be granted against Posey cognizable under either the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment. In order to impose personal liability upon the agent, plaintiff was not only required to show that the seizure was illegal, it was necessary that they show that the seizure was so illegal as to violate clearly established law. In this case and on these facts the plaintiff clearly has not done so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Were Baddour\u2019s failure to overcome Posey\u2019s qualified immunity defense not enough, the damages suit against Posey could have been dismissed for failure to state a claim on the ground that Baddour\u2019s statutory remedies for correcting this situation were adequate, thus obviating the need for a court-created damages remedy. Related to this proposition is the recognition that creation of a damages remedy under circumstances where Congress has provided for corrections of tax collection errors could wreck havoc with the federal tax system. As the Seventh Circuit recently articulated in <em>Cameron v. Internal Rev</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>enue Service, </em>773 F.2d 126 (7th Cir.1985), a complaint for damages based upon an alleged constitutional tort may be dismissed for failure to state a claim <em>either </em>because (1) no constitutional source for the plaintiff\u2019s claim exists, <em>or </em>(2) \u201cCongress has created explicit remedies,\u201d <em>or </em>(3) \u201ca court-created remedy would interfere with the effective functioning of the government.\u201d 773 F.2d at 129. <em>See also Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 388-90, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 2416-18, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983). Thus, even assuming that the complaint states a claim that is cognizable under the Constitution, no cause of action for damages may be maintained if either the second or third elements set forth above are present. The <em>Cameron </em>court observed in this regard that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-4\">Congress has given taxpayers all sorts of rights against an overzealous officialdom, including, most fundamentally, the right to sue the government for a refund if forced to overpay taxes, and it would make the collection of taxes chaotic if a taxpayer could bypass the remedies provided by Congress simply by bringing a damage action against Treasury employees. It is hard enought to collect taxes as it is; additional obstructions are not needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">773 F.2d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The instant case plainly presents a situation where Baddour had available \u201call sorts of rights against an overzealous officialdom.\u201d It is a case where \u201cspecial factors counselling hesitation are present.\u201d <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 298,103 S.Ct. 2362, 2365, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983). The Regulations under \u00a7 6343(b) specifically provide that a written request for the return of property wrongfully levied upon may be submitted to the District Director. Treas.Reg. Sec. 301.6343-l(b)(2). Judicial review of a levy is available in an action, such as this, brought pursuant to \u00a7 7426(a). Baddour could have sought immediate review of Revenue Officer Posey\u2019s collection actions from the appropriate Internal Revenue Service District Director, in addition to bringing this wrongful levy action. To open up an entirely new avenue of relief resulting in the personal liability of Internal Revenue Service employees would serve to hamper the ability of such employees to perform a function that is a difficult one and one that is vital to our nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Baddour relies on <em>Rutherford v. United States, </em>702 F.2d 580 (5th Cir.1983), to justify its request for damages against Posey. Its reliance is misplaced. There, it was alleged that a revenue agent had deliberately harassed the taxpayers with tax assessments that he knew to be unjustified. This court viewed the taxpayers\u2019 complaint as sketching \u201ca portrait of lawless and arbitrary vendetta,\u201d and of an intentional campaign designed to abuse the taxpayers for purely personal reasons. 702 F.2d at 584. In those circumstances, this court suggested that taxpayers <em>might </em>be entitled to relief beyond that available in a refund suit to compensate them both for their mental anguish and for their legal expenses in recovering the taxes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, it remanded the case to the District Court for a determination whether taxpayers\u2019 clearly established substantive due process rights had been violated. 702 F.2d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">In this case, by contrast, there was not the slightest hint of a deliberate, personally-motivated campaign to harass by means of the tax collection process. Posey\u2019s actions were solely based upon his belief that the taxpayer had an interest in the soft goods from which the Government could realize the delinquent taxes. None of the evidence submitted remotely suggests that Posey was attempting to make the type of deliberately improper use of the collection process that was alleged in <em>Rutherford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Congress has provided that erroneously collected taxes are to be refunded with interest at a statutorily-prescribed rate. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6611, 6621, 6622 (West Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>1986). Congress has also provided that successful efforts in the courts for the recovery of federal taxes may result in the award of attorney\u2019s fees. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7430 (West Supp.1986). Neither the Constitution nor the Internal Revenue Code requires more relief than this.</p>\n<p id=\"AjH\">There are sound reasons not to subject the taxing system to an extra-statutory measure of damages without express Congressional authority. Express authority on the subject negatives any implied Congressional intent to do so. Baddour\u2019s action is explicitly barred by 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7426(d) (West Supp.1986). That section provides: \u201cNo action may be maintained against any officer or employee of the United States ... with respect to any acts for which an action could be maintained under this section.\u201d This is as clear a statement as there can be that Congress did not intend an IRS agent, such as Posey, to be a defendant with respect to any acts for which an action could be maintained under \u00a7 7426. Since this is both a suit brought against the United States pursuant to \u00a7 7426 and one against an employee of the United States with respect to the levy on Baddour\u2019s property, it follows that the plain language of \u00a7 7426(d) necessarily precludes the claim against Posey.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajc\">Having carefully considered the record and all of Baddour\u2019s arguments, we find that Posey is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"AeC\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-8\">.
