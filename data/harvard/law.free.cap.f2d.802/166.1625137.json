(NOPSI). NOPSI unsuccessfully attempted to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>move the action to federal district court. NOPSI now brings an action in federal court, seeking a declaration that Majoue\u2019s state claims are artfully pled claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq., </em>and an injunction of the state court proceeding. The district court, in an unpublished opinion, dismissed NOPSI\u2019s claim, holding that Majoue\u2019s wrongful discharge claim was only peripherally and remotely related to ERISA and thus not preempted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> NOPSI appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">We find it unnecessary to decide whether Majoue\u2019s claims are pre-empted by ERISA. Rather, we hold that NOPSI\u2019s suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief is an attempt to seek collateral review of the district court\u2019s original order remanding the case to the state court. We thus vacate the judgment of the court below and remand for an order dismissing the case for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It is beyond cavil, and NOPSI concedes, that a district court\u2019s order remanding a cause to state court may not be appealed, if erroneous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Gravitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>430 U.S. 723, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977) (per curiam); <em>Volvo Corp. of America v. Schwarzer, </em>429 U.S. 1331, 97 S.Ct. 284, 285 &amp; n. 3, 50 L.Ed.2d 273 (1976); <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 96 S.Ct. 584, 46 L.Ed.2d 452 (1976); <em>United States v. Rice, </em>327 U.S. 742, 66 S.Ct. 835, 90 L.Ed. 982 (1946); <em>Smith v. Winter, </em>717 F.2d 191, 192-93 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Royal v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>685 F.2d 124 (5th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Not only may the order not be appealed, but the district court itself is divested of jurisdiction to reconsider the matter. Thus, even if it later decides the order was erroneous, a remand order cannot be vacated even by the district court. <em>See, e.g., Browning v. Navarro, </em>743 F.2d 1069, 1078 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Pelleport Investors, Inc. v. Budco Quality Theatres, </em>741 F.2d 273, 279 n. 3 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Three J Farms, Inc. v. Alton Box Board Co., </em>609 F.2d 112, 115 (4th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 911, 100 S.Ct. 1090, 63 L.Ed.2d 327 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">The only vehicle for relief from a remand order is the writ of mandamus. A writ of mandamus lies only if the district court \u201chas affirmatively stated and relied upon a non-1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Royal, </em>685 F.2d at 126; <em>see also Gravitt, </em>97 S.Ct. at 1439; <em>In re Weaver, </em>610 F.2d 335, 337 (5th Cir.1980); <em>In re Merrimack Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>587 F.2d 642 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">NOPSI removed Majoue\u2019s claim from the state court. The district court in that case by minute order granted Majoue\u2019s petition and remanded the cause to the state court. NOPSI then sought writs of mandamus and certiorari before this court, which we summarily denied, and filed a petition for certiorari, which the Supreme Court likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">Throughout the jurisdictional controversy NOPSI argued that Majoue\u2019s claims \u201carise under\u201d federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, since they are \u201con their face\u201d ERISA claims within \u00a7 1140; thus, Majoue\u2019s state claims are allegedly pre-empted pursuant to \u00a7 1144(a). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>NOPSI advances identical arguments. NOPSI again asserts that Majoue\u2019s state claims are artfully pled ERISA claims, and that they must be pre-empted. The same arguments NOPSI advances here were fully before the court on the petition for removal and subsequent petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>remand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The conclusion is thus inescapable that NOPSI\u2019s suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief is nothing more than an artful, if not subtle, attempt to circumvent the plain language and meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that a remand order \u201cis not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u201cIt is clear that [NOPSI can] not attack that order collaterally by alleging an independent action involving the same parties and claims that were present in the initial action.\u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Haydu, </em>637 F.2d 391, 396 (5th Cir.1981) (citations and footnotes omitted); <em>see also Browning, </em>743 F.2d at 1078 (\u201cfederal courts of appeals are precluded from reviewing in an ancillary proceeding the remand orders of a district court.\u201d). Nor can \u201cthis policy ... be avoided by invoking the provision of the declaratory judgment act in a case which has been remanded to a state court.\u201d <em>Chandler v. O\u2019Bryan, </em>445 F.2d 1045, 1057 (10th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 964, 92 S.Ct. 1176, 31 L.Ed.2d 241 (1972) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">The wholesome purposes of declaratory acts would be aborted by its use as an instrument of procedural fencing either to secure delay or to choose a forum. It was not intended by the act to enable a party to obtain a change of tribunal and thus accomplish in a particular case what could not be accomplished under the removal act, and such would be the result in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>H.J. Heinz Co. v. Owens, </em>189 F.2d 505, 508 (9th Cir.1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>324 U.S. 905, 72 S.Ct. 294, 96 L.Ed. 677 (1952), <em>(quoting American Automobile Ins. Co. v. Freundt, </em>103 F.2d 613, 617 (7th Cir.1939) ).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Any other result would elevate form over substance. Section 1447(d) is not merely a formal rule, but was enacted by Congress to avoid \u201cinterruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed\u201d <em>United States v. Rice, </em>66 S.Ct. at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">In sum, the District Court\u2019s order remanding Majoue\u2019s original action to the state court is <em>res judicata </em>as to the <em>forum. </em>The issue of whether Majoue\u2019s wrongful discharge claim is pre-empted by ERISA should now be determined together with the merits, in the first instance, by the Louisiana courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">We thus VACATE and REMAND for an order dismissing NOPSI\u2019s claims for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">. <em>See Shaw v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 85, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2901 n. 21, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">. Section 1447(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-17\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) provides in pertinent part that \"[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, the district court shall remand the case.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\">. The case thus is distinguishable from <em>Rath Packing Co. v. Becker, </em>530 F.2d 1295, 1303 &amp; n. 11 (9th Cir.), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom., Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">. <em>See United States v. James, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 3116, 3121, 92 L.Ed.2d 483 (1986) (\"legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.\"), <em>(quoting American Tobacco Co. v.

The fact that Congress assigned exclusive jurisdiction to the federal courts over ERISA actions which seek injunctions and other equitable relief pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1) does not serve to defeat the plain meaning and policy underlying \u00a7 1447(d). Congress also provided that \u201c[n]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
