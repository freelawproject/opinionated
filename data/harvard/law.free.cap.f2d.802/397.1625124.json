Nies, U.S. Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Gregory L. Zatler, a former inmate of the State of Florida Department of Corrections, brought this civil rights action alleging that prison officials failed to protect him from sexual assault while he was in prison. He seeks monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) and the eighth and fourteenth amendments. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida entered an order dismissing this action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Zatler, proceeding pro se, initiated this action by filing a complaint on March 4, 1982. The complaint alleged that Zatler had been sexually assaulted at three different institutions within the State of Florida in which he had been incarcerated. Zatler named as defendants the appellee, Louie L. Wainwright, as Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections, and Robert Medlock, a correctional officer at Florida State Prison. On November 21, 1983, the district court dismissed Medlock as a defendant in this action for failure to perfect service of process upon him. In so doing, the court noted that Zatler had failed to name the individuals who were responsible for his protection when he was assaulted. Accordingly, in view of defendant Med-lock\u2019s dismissal, the court granted Zatler an opportunity to amend his complaint to name those individuals responsible for his protection at the various institutions in which he was assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">On December 14, 1983, Zatler, represented by counsel, filed an amended complaint naming Wainwright, R.D. Massey, R.V. Turner, John Shaw, K.W. Helms, Ana Gispert and Clayton Strickland, Jr., as defendants. These six additional defendants were superintendents of the institutions in which Zatler had been incarcerated and in which he had been sexually assaulted. In the amended complaint, Zatler alleged that he had been forcibly raped by inmates at six different institutions on eight occasions. Zatler complained that as \u201ca young, white, slightly built man,\u201d he was \u201ca member of an identifiable group of prisoners who, because of their size, age, and race, suffer [sic] a pervasive risk of harm from sexual assault by other prisoners.\u201d The complaint stated that the defendants, by virtue of their positions, were required to provide Zatler with reasonable protection. The complaint alleged, however, that \u201c[t]he Defendants acted with reckless disregard of [Zatler\u2019s] right to be free from violent attacks by fellow inmates, and were, therefore, deliberately indifferent, to his constitutional rights.\u201d Finally, Zatler complained that he suffered \u201cembarrassment, humiliation, and great mental distress\u201d as a result of the assaults upon him and \u201cthe Defendants\u2019 failure to prevent such attacks by either inadequate training or supervision of their staff, or improper classification of [Zatler].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">The defendants filed an answer on January 24, 1984. Discovery then commenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 17, 1984, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>and/or summary judgment. The defendants later filed a number of affidavits in support of the motion. On September 19, 1984, Zatler responded by filing a memorandum opposing the defendants\u2019 motion. Thereafter, Zatler\u2019s affidavit and the defendants\u2019 answers to Zatler\u2019s interrogatories were filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On July 1,1985, the district court entered an order dismissing all the defendants named in the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The six superintendent defendants were dismissed, without prejudice, for insufficient service of process. Zatler does not appeal the dismissal of these defendants. The court also dismissed Wainwright. In so doing, the court pointed out that Wainwright was named because of his role as chief policy-maker of the Florida Department of Corrections. The court further noted that Zatler did not allege that Wainwright had any personal knowledge of the assaults. Accordingly, in view of the fact that the eighth amendment requires proof of a defendant\u2019s deliberate indifference and section 1983 requires proof of a causal connection between the actions of the defendant and the constitutional deprivation, the court dismissed Wainwright as a defendant in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Zatler\u2019s amended complaint added a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief. At the time the amended complaint was filed, Zatler was an inmate of the Florida correctional system. At the time the district court rendered its opinion, Zatler continued to be incarcerated, although he had been transferred to another correctional institution. Thereafter, on October 29, 1985, Zatler was released from prison. \u201cThis court is under a duty to review its jurisdiction of an appeal at any point in the appellate process.\u201d <em>Wahl v. McIver, </em>773 F.2d 1169, 1173 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam). In view of Zatler\u2019s subsequent release, we find that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are now moot. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cAbsent class certification, an inmate\u2019s claim for injunctive and declaratory relief in a section 1983 action fails to present a case or controversy once the inmate has been transferred.\u201d); <em>Kellerman v. Askew, </em>541 F.2d 1089, 1090 n. 1 (5th Cir.1976)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (prisoner\u2019s motion for equitable relief deemed moot due to his having been paroled).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">The sole issue which remains on appeal, therefore, is whether Zatler\u2019s claim for damages against Wainwright, in both his individual and official capacities, was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">Wainwright argues that the eleventh amendment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> bars Zatler\u2019s claim for damages against Wainwright in his official capacity. Although Wainwright raised eleventh amendment immunity as an affirmative defense in his answer, the district court did not address this issue. Nevertheless, we are under a continuing duty to review our jurisdiction at any point on appeal, <em>Wahl v. McIver, </em>773 F.2d 1169, 1173 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam), and the eleventh amendment \u201cpartakes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar,\u201d <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>415 U.S. 651, 678, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1363, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">It is well established that the eleventh amendment immunizes an unconsenting state from suits brought in federal court by its citizens and citizens of other states. <em>Id. </em>at 662-63, 94 S.Ct. at 1355-56. Moreover, \u201ceven though a State is not named a party to the action, the suit may nonetheless be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 94 S.Ct. at 1355. \u201c \u2018[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, </em>323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 350-51, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945)). <em>See also Williams v. Bennett, </em>689 F.2d 1370, 1376-77 (11th Cir.1982) (the eleventh amendment has been applied to bar prisoner\u2019s section 1983 damage claims brought in federal court against prison officials in their official capacities), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 932, 104 S.Ct. 335, 78 L.Ed.2d 305 (1983). Therefore, \u201c[a]bsent a legitimate abrogation of immunity by Congress or a waiver of immunity by the state being sued,\u201d <em>Gamble v. Florida Department of Health &amp; Rehabilitative Services, </em>779 F.2d 1509, 1511 (11th Cir.1986), Zatler may not maintain a suit against Wainwright in his official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">It is clear that Congress did not intend to abrogate a state\u2019s eleventh amendment immunity in section 1983 damage suits. <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 340-45, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1144-45, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979). Furthermore, after reviewing specific provisions of the Florida statutes, we recently concluded that Florida\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign immunity was not intended to encompass section 1983 suits for damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Gamble, </em>779 F.2d at 1513-20. Accordingly, Wainwright is immune from suit in his official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The eighth amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d requires that punishment be compatible \u201cwith \u2018the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 102, 97 S.Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (quoting <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958)). Thus, it is well settled that a prison inmate has a constitutional right to be protected from the constant threat of violence and from physical assault by other inmates. <em>Gullatte v. Potts, </em>654 F.2d 1007, 1012 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See also Harmon v. Berry, </em>728 F.2d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam); <em>Jones v. Diamond, </em>636 F.2d 1364, 1373 (5th Cir.1981) (en banc). However, \u201c[t]his does not mean that the constitutional rights of inmates are violated every time a prisoner is injured. It would not be reasonable to impose such an absolute and clearly unworkable responsibility on prison officials.\u201d <em>Gullatte, </em>654 F.2d at 1012. \u201c \u2018In order to state a \u00a7 1983 cause of action against prison officials based on a constitutional deprivation resulting from cruel and unusual punishment, there must be at least some allegation of a conscious or callous indifference to a prisoner\u2019s rights, thus raising the tort to constitutional stature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Bennett, </em>689 F.2d 1370, 1380 (11th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Wright v. El Paso County Jail, </em>642 F.2d 134, 136 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 932, 104 S.Ct. 335, 78 L.Ed.2d 305 (1983)). <em>See also Martin v. White, </em>742 F.2d 469, 474 (8th Cir. 1984) (\u201c[Pjrison officials may be liable where they are \u2018deliberately indifferent to [a prisoner\u2019s] constitutional rights, either because they actually intended to deprive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>him of some right, or because they acted with reckless disregard of his right to be free from violent attacks by fellow inmates.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Branchcomb v. Brewer, </em>669 F.2d 1297, 1298 (8th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">In addition, section 1983 requires proof of an affirmative causal connection between the official\u2019s acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation. <em>Williams, </em>689 F.2d at 1380, 1381. Moreover, \u201cwhen individuals are being sued in individual capacities for damages for personal injuries, the causation inquiry must be more refined and focused than that undertaken ... where only declaratory and injunctive relief [are] sought for constitutional violations pervading an entire prison system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A causal connection may be established by proving that the official was personally involved in the acts that resulted in the constitutional deprivation. <em>See Ancata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., </em>769 F.2d 700, 706 (11th Cir.1985). Zatler does not allege, however, that Wainwright was personally involved in acts which deprived Zatler of his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the contrary, Wainwright is sued in his capacity as the chief policy-maker of the Florida Department of Corrections who is charged \u201cwith the care, control and supervision of all inmates of and personnel employed by the State of Florida Department of Corrections.\u201d <em>See </em>Amended Complaint at 3. Personal participation, however, is only one of several ways to establish the requisite causal connection. <em>Williams, </em>689 F.2d at 1381. An official may also be liable where a policy or custom that he established or utilized results in deliberate indifference to an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Ancata, </em>769 F.2d at 706. \u201c \u2018Another theory ... is that a supervisory defendant is subject to \u00a7 1983 liability when he breaches a duty imposed by state or local law, and this breach causes plaintiff\u2019s constitutional injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>689 F.2d at 1381 (quoting <em>Sims v. Adams, </em>537 F.2d 829, 831 (5th Cir.1976)). <em>See also Ancata, </em>769 F.2d at 706. Here, \u201cthe inquiry into causation must be a directed one, focusing on the duties and responsibilities of each of the individual defendants whose acts or omissions are alleged to have resulted in a constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>689 F.2d at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Fla.Stat. \u00a7 20.315(4)(a) (1985) provides that the Secretary of the Department of Corrections shall have the \u201cresponsibility to plan, direct, coordinate, and execute the powers, duties, and responsibilities assigned to the department.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 20.-315(1) (1985) outlines the goals of the department. These include \u201cthe protection of the offender from victimization within the institution,\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 20.315(l)(c) (1985), and the provision of \u201cthe necessary level of security in institutions,\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 20.-315(l)(g) (1985). Finally, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 20.-315(17) (1985) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">PLACEMENT OF OFFENDERS.\u2014 The department shall classify its programs according to the character and range of services available for its clients. The department shall place each offender in the program or facility most appropriate to the offender\u2019s needs, subject to budgetary limitations and the availability of space.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">Wainwright can be found individually liable under section 1983 if he breached the above statutorily imposed duties and this breach caused Zatler\u2019s alleged constitutional injury-</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Zatler argues that he is a member of a category of persons exposed to the threat of sexual assault and that Wainwright has failed to adopt a policy which provides sufficient protection to Zatler and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>others similarly situated. To maintain a cause of action against Wainwright, however, any alleged failure to adopt adequate policies for inmate protection must amount to a breach of Wainwright\u2019s duty and must evidence reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to Zatler\u2019s constitutional rights. Wainwright\u2019s responses to Zatler\u2019s interrogatories establish the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Wainwright was first asked to describe any and all measures taken to protect Zatler and other inmates from sexual abuse. He responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">As Secretary of the Department of Corrections, my role is supervisory in nature and does not involve the making of day-to-day decisions with regard to individual inmates in each of the Florida correctional facilities. However, staffing of institutions is continuously monitored to ensure that staff is appropriately assigned in order to provide the maximum possible supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">Current classification procedures enable us to better identify the more aggressive inmates. When these inmates are identified, attempts are made to place them in an area provided with greater security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">An inmate seeking sexual, or other favors, is not always easy to identify. For this reason we have established a procedure whereby an inmate who feels he needs protection from other inmates or staff can immediately request protection. Once institutional staff receive this request, the inmate requesting protection is immediately placed in secure confinement. Rule 33-3.082 outlines the procedure by which an inmate may seek protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Thereafter, with respect to measures taken to protect Zatler specifically, Wainwright explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">Mr. Zatler has been assigned to eight facilities in an attempt to find an environiment in which he can adjust to open 'population. This has been difficult due to , problems created by his admitted homosexuality. At each institution, Mr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">Zatler has been housed in protective confinement to assure his personal safety. The record further reveals that Zatler has been immediately placed in protective custody every time he requested it and has been released therefrom only at his own request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">In addition, Wainwright was also asked to identify all documents which provide instruction on classification of potential victims of sexual abuse, prevention of inmate sexual abuse, and investigation of complaints of sexual abuse by inmates, including disciplinary procedures for those inmates found guilty. Wainwright responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">Sexual abuse is not the subject of specific instructions. Rather, instructions are for review and monitoring of each case by a team of staff members on a regular basis with authority to make any programming changes as dictated by the facts of the case. In extreme cases, inmates may be designated as \u201cspecial review,\u201d which requires more individual review as changes are made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">Inmates found guilty of sexual abuse are disciplined through the established disciplinary procedures, with punishment imposed as set forth in the Rules of Prohibited Conduct. When the case is accepted for prosecution, it is handled through the judicial process. Aggressive sexual abusers that are identified are separated from those that may be abused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-14\">The offender that is sexually abused will be worked with by the classification team, psychologist and/or psychiatrist on an individualized basis if requested or if staff determines such a need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-15\">Sexual abuse or sexual offenders are handled as a serious problem. Any staff neglect of duty would be handled through the personnel disciplinary procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">Based on these responses, it is clear that Wainwright\u2019s attitude is not at all one of reckless disregard of Zatler\u2019s right to be free of violent attacks or deliberate indifference to his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Moreover, Zatler does not dispute Wainwright\u2019s responses except to the extent that he states that prison officials discouraged inmates from seeking protective custody because of the harsh conditions of such protective custody. In his affidavit, Zatler describes those conditions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Zatler does not argue, however, that he was ever refused protective custody, nor does he argue that the conditions of protective custody were cruel and unusual. Rather, Zatler complains only that he did not like the conditions of protective custody. Clearly, this does not establish a cause of action for damages against Wainwright for failure to provide Zatler with reasonable protection. Nor does it establish Wainwright\u2019s reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to Zatler\u2019s constitutional right to be free from physical assault while in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Zatler also alleges in his affidavit that \u201c[o]n at least one occasion,\u201d while in protective custody, he was housed with another inmate who physically attacked him. The mere fact that an assault occurs, however, does not establish the requisite indifference to a prisoner\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Cf. Gullatte, </em>654 F.2d at 1012 (a constitutional right is not violated every time a prisoner is injured). Nor has Zatler attempted to establish that the assault in protective custody was caused by Wainwright\u2019s indifference, or by a breach of Wainwright\u2019s duty as Secretary of the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Accordingly, after reviewing the record, we conclude \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that [Wainwright] is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). <em>See also McLaughlin v. City of LaGrange, </em>662 F.2d 1385, 1388 (11th Cir.1981) (footnote omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>456 U.S. 979, 102 S.Ct. 2249, 72 L.Ed.2d 856 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-17\">. It should be noted that very little discovery has been completed in this action. The only effort to obtain information from Wainwright has been to serve him with interrogatories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. Although the district court referred to its order as an order of dismissal, we treat the order as one granting summary judgment. In view of the fact that the order explicitly referred to the fact that affidavits and interrogatories had been filed in this action, we presume that the district court considered the entire record in rendering its decision. <em>See Milburn v. United States, </em>734 F.2d 762, 765 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cIt has been held that the court converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment by considering matters beyond the complaint.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-16\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc) we adopted as precedent decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-17\">.

Two Florida District Courts of Appeal have also concluded that Florida has not waived its sovereign immunity in \u00a7 1983 actions. <em>See Skoblow v. Ameri-Manage, Inc., </em>483 So.2d 809, 812 (Fla. 3d Dist.Ct.App.1986); <em>Spooner v. Department of Corrections, </em>488 So.2d 897 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App.1986).

The duties of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections are largely supervisory in nature and do not include the day-to-day operations of the various institutions. It is not surprising, therefore, that Wainwright has little direct contact with individual inmates. In fact, the only indication in the record that Wainwright had any personal involvement with Zatler prior to the institution of this suit, was a letter from Wainwright dated April 17, 1980 responding to Zatler\u2019s request for a transfer. In that letter, Zatler was informed that his request for a transfer had been approved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b517-28\">.

It has been plaintiff\u2019s complaint that defendant Wainwright had an affirmative duty to provide a safe environment from sexual assault and that the only alternative available to plaintiff was to obtain protective custody under conditions that amounted to evidence of deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>It may be that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this case. However, the pleadings, affidavit, and answers to interrogatories reflect that there is a genuine issue of fact as to the conditions under which Zatler was confined. There is no issue of fact as to Zatler having been raped since this is disclosed by the defendant\u2019s own admissions in the Record, Vol. 1, Tab 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The foregoing matter was not addressed by the district court nor the state in its brief. My individual research indicates that the regulation, Florida Administrative Code Rule 33-8.13(13), provides that prisoners may be placed in administrative confinement as a disciplinary punishment. However, Rule 33-3.081 defines administrative confinement and states that inmates in such confinement are not being punished. Upon a preliminary review there seems to be a question as to the conditions prescribed for administrative confinement. Since this matter was not dealt with by the state nor the district court, I do not pursue it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The majority opinion acknowledges at page 400 that under the evolving standards of decency that mark our maturing society, a prison inmate is entitled to be protected from the constant threat of violence and assault by other inmates. If operation of the Florida prison system results in a conscious and callous indifference to such rights, a constitutional tort has been committed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">There is no question about the legal principle that where prison supervisors with knowledge of \u201ca pervasive and unreasonable risk of harm\u201d to the prisoners, fail to take reasonable remedial steps to prevent such harm, their conduct may be properly characterized as \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or as \u201ctacit authorization of the offensive acts,\u201d for which they may be held independently liable under \u00a7 1983. (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\"><em>Orpiano v. Johnson, </em>632 F.2d 1096 (4th Cir.1980). As reflected by Secretary Wainwright\u2019s answers to interrogatories, \u201csexual abuse is not the subject of specific instructions.\u201d As other answers reflect, Wainwright has had knowledge of sexual abuses and the only specific assistance to offenders who have been sexually abused is the opportunity to have after-the-fact counseling by a psychologist or psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">I conclude that the truth in this case has not been reached because of the district court\u2019s premature ruling that Wainwright was not legally responsible. The material issue of fact as to whether the protective or administrative confinement of Zatler as an alternative to being raped constituted a form of punitive response to Zatler\u2019s request for help has not been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">I would remand this case to the district court for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
