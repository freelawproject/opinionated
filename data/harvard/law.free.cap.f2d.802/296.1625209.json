GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">This case is before the court on remand from the United States Supreme Court for further consideration in light of <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986). The issue we must decide is whether, in light of <em>Pembaur, </em>municipal liability may be imposed upon the City of Little Rock under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for the single unconstitutional discharge of a municipal court clerk by the municipal judge to whom the city had delegated final authority concerning employment matters involving municipal court personnel. We hold that municipal liability may be imposed upon the city in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-22\">William R. Butler was an elected municipal judge for the traffic court of the City of Little Rock, Arkansas. The municipal traffic court was under investigation by a grand jury for possible corruption. Both Debbie Williams and Linda Stanley, municipal court clerks, had witnessed Butler deliberately destroy traffic tickets. After Butler learned that Williams told the police what she had witnessed, he fired her. After testifying before the grand jury as to what she had witnessed, Stanley allegedly was harassed until she resigned. Williams and Stanley filed suit in federal district court against Butler seeking damages and equitable relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of their first amendment rights. Although the plaintiffs named Butler as defendant in his official capacity, which in essence was a suit against the city, Butler filed a third-party complaint against the city alleging that it was responsible for any judgment against him. At the close of the evidence and in response to motions by the city, the district court found as a matter of law that Butler acted in his official capacity and within the authority delegated to him by the city if he, in fact, had discharged Williams or Stanley. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The court specifically found that the undisputed evidence demonstrated that Butler had been delegated policy-making authority by the city and that he was acting pursuant to that authority. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Williams on her claim against Butler, awarding her damages. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Butler, however, on Stanley\u2019s claim. Consistent with its ruling at the close of the evidence, the court entered judgment in favor of Butler on his third-party complaint against the city, and the city appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">On appeal, a panel of this court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment that the city was liable for Butler\u2019s unconstitutional discharge of Williams. <em>Williams v. Butler, </em>746 F.2d 431 (8th Cir.1984) (Judge McMillian dissenting). The panel held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">(1) if, according to a policy or custom established by a governing body, an official is delegated the authority, either directly or indirectly, to act on behalf of a governing body; and (2) if a decision made within the scope of the official\u2019s authority ends the matter, then the acts of the official may fairly be said to be those of the local governing body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 438. The panel decision was vacated, however, when a rehearing en banc was granted. On rehearing, the district court\u2019s decision was affirmed by an equally divided court. <em>Williams v. Butler, </em>762 F.2d 73 (8th Cir.1985). The Supreme Court granted the city\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and vacated the judgment of the en banc court, remanding the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, supra. City of Little Rock v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1508, 89 L.Ed.2d 909 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">In <em>Pembaur </em>the plaintiff, an Ohio physician and proprietor of a medical clinic located in Cincinnati, Ohio, filed suit in federal district court against, among others, the City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, seeking damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Doctor Pembaur alleged that his rights were violated when police forcibly entered his clinic to serve capiases on two of his employees. After meeting with resistance from Doctor Pembaur, the Deputy Sheriffs called the County Sheriff's office and were directed to call the County Prosecutor\u2019s office for instructions. Upon the prosecutor\u2019s instructions to \u201cgo in and get\u201d the employees, the Deputy Sheriffs and city police obtained an axe and chopped down the door of the clinic. The Deputy Sheriffs searched unsuccessfully for the employees. Doctor Pembaur alleged that absent exigent circumstances the Fourth Amendment prohibited the officials from searching his place of business without a search warrant in an attempt to execute a capias on a third person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the complaint against both the county and the city, ruling that the county and city were not liable because the individual officers were not acting pursuant to \u201cofficial policy\u201d necessary to impose municipal liability. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s decision with respect to city policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and affirmed the court\u2019s decision concerning county policy, but for different reasons. The court of appeals held that, although pursuant to Ohio law the Hamilton County Sheriff and Prosecutor were authorized to establish official county policy, Pembaur had failed to prove the existence of county policy in this case. Pemb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>aur failed to show \u201canything more than that, on this <em>one occasion, </em>the Prosecutor and the Sheriff decided to force entry into his office. That single, discrete decision is insufficient, by itself, to establish that the Prosecutor, the Sheriff, or both were implementing a governmental policy.\u201d <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>746 F.2d 337, 341 (6th Cir.1984) (citation and footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The Supreme Court granted Pembaur\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and reversed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision. The majority concluded that in the appropriate circumstances municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision made by municipal policymakers. The majority described four of those circumstances as follows: (1) when the single decision is made by the properly constituted legislative body \u2014 \u201cbecause even a single decision by such a body unquestionably constitutes an act of official government policy.\u201d (citing <em>Owen v. City of Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980); <em>Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 U.S. 247, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981)); (2) when the single decision is made pursuant to formal rules or understandings (citing the written rule in <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)); (3) when the single decision adopts a particular course of action tailored to a specific situation and is properly made by the government\u2019s authorized decisionmakers (citing <em>Owen </em>and <em>Newport, </em>supra); and (4) when the single decision is directed by those who establish governmental policy. <em>Pembaur, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Under Ohio law, the County Sheriff and Prosecutor could establish county policy. The Deputy Sheriffs were following standard procedure when they sought instructions from the County Sheriff and Prosecutor. The Court ruled that \u201c[i]n ordering the Deputy Sheriffs to enter [Pembaur\u2019s] clinic the County Prosecutor was acting as the final decisionmaker for the county, and the county may therefore be held liable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The Supreme Court recognized that the authority to make municipal policy often is spread among various officers and official bodies. The Court emphasized, however, that not every decision by municipal officers subjects the municipality to \u00a7 1983 liability. \u201cMunicipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299 (plurality opinion) (footnote omitted). Justice Brennan, in his plurality opinion, phrased the Court\u2019s holding as follows: \u201cWe hold that municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 attaches where \u2014 and only where \u2014 a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300 (citing <em>City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, </em>471 U.S. 808, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 2436, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">In concurring opinions, Justices White and O\u2019Connor focused on the policy of forcible entry of third-party property to effect an arrest warrant and reasoned that the decision to use force by the sheriff and prosecutor, authorized policymakers in this case, \u201csufficiently manifested county policy to warrant reversal of the judgment below.\u201d 106 S.Ct. at 1301 and 1304. In his concurring opinion, Justice Stevens focused on the fact that the unconstitutional acts were committed by municipal agents in the course of their employment. <em>Id. </em>at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Justice Powell was joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist in dissent. Justice Powell took the position that no prior county policy existed and the offhand telephone response from a busy prosecutor amounted to a mere <em>ad hoc </em>decision, which cannot create a policy. <em>Id. </em>at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pembaur, </em>we hold that \u00a7 1983 municipal liability may be imposed upon the City of Little Rock in this case. The record before us indicates that Butler was delegated final policy-making authority concerning employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ment matters in the municipal court, and that he acted pursuant to that authority when he chose to discharge Williams for exercising her first amendment rights. At the conclusion of the evidence the district court found that the undisputed evidence demonstrated that Butler was the policymaker with respect to employment matters in Little Rock Municipal Court. The district court specifically found that the city delegated to Butler, as judge and chief administrative officer of the municipal court, the final authority for administering personnel decisions in the municipal court. Butler \u201chad the sole and exclusive control of the hiring, termination, discipline, [and] discharge of his employees.\u201d Transcript at 493-94. In response to the city\u2019s question whether Butler set policy, the district court stated: \u201cI\u2019m finding that they completely turned it over to him, and he operated it exclusively. Yes.\u201d The court added, \u201cI think he not only set the policy, he did it all. I don\u2019t know how I could go into it other than just reaching that conclusion. The fact and the legal conclusion is that he did it all.\u201d Transcript at 494-95. The district court also found that Butler was acting in his official capacity if he in fact terminated the plaintiffs. The court therefore concluded that the city would be liable for Butler\u2019s conduct if the jury found that Butler violated the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The record amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that Butler possessed policy-making authority and was acting pursuant to that authority when he, as the jury found, discharged Williams. Therefore, we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous. Butler admitted in his response to requests for admissions that his personnel served at his \u201csole pleasure\u201d because of the city\u2019s policy of delegating to him the final authority in employment matters. He also admitted that he did not consult the personnel office or the City Board of Directors when he discharged Williams or any other clerks. Record at 164, 165.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Butler testified that after he was elected in 1969, he went to the personnel director, Coy Adams, to inquire about assembling a staff. Butler stated that Adams told him that \u201cit had always been traditional that the City of Little Rock left it up to the judges of the courts.\u201d Transcript at 430. The personnel office was involved only to the extent that Butler would send his newly hired personnel to the office \u201cto let an application be filed, and * * * to sign up for insurance.\u201d Transcript at 431. Butler had followed this procedure since he took office in 1969. Williams and a witness for Williams testified that they had been fired by Butler. The city introduced no evidence to the contrary. Indeed, it was the city\u2019s position at trial that Butler possessed the sole and exclusive authority and ultimate responsibility concerning employment matters in the municipal court. The city\u2019s sole responsibility, it argued, was paying the salaries. In its counterclaim, the city stated, \u201cThe City of Little Rock has always agreed with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that defendant Butler is responsible for hiring and terminating his chief clerk and deputy clerks.\u201d Record at 124 (paragraph 7). In its brief in support of a motion to dismiss, the city argued that it was not empowered to hire or fire municipal court personnel. It was \u201cdefendant Butler <em>only\u201d </em>who possessed such power. Record at 71-72 (emphasis in original). <em>See </em>Record at 252 (the city\u2019s post-trial brief); Record at 130 (paragraphs 8 and 9 of the city\u2019s answer in which the city denies that it had the power to reinstate the plaintiffs, and denies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Butler did not possess such power). We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in finding as a matter of law that Butler was the policymaker with respect to employment matters in the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The city now argues that Butler was given only the discretion to hire and fire employees, and his decision to fire Williams was simply an unconstitutional exercise of that discretion, which cannot be attributed to the city. In support of its argument, the city calls our attention to footnote twelve of the <em>Pembaur </em>opinion. In footnote twelve, the plurality drew a distinction between an official who possessed mere discretion and one who possessed final policy-making authority, stating that only the acts of the policymaker will represent municipal policy and could give rise to municipal liability. The city\u2019s characterization of Butler\u2019s authority as merely discretionary is without merit. This characterization is contrary to the city\u2019s position at trial and also contrary to the evidence, as we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The record indicates that Butler possessed more than discretionary power; as the district court found, Butler \u201cnot only set the policy, he did it all.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Contrary to its position at trial and contrary to the evidence in the record, the city now argues that it never delegated the authority in question to Butler. The city\u2019s argument, even if true, does not help its position. Even if the city did not actually delegate the authority, the record amply demonstrates that the city acquiesced to it. For at least fifteen years, and probably longer, Butler possessed and exercised <em>carte blanche </em>authority with respect to employment matters in municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">By statute, municipal court judges are authorized to employ necessary court personnel. Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 22-713 (Supp. 1985). The salary range for court personnel is set by statute, which also authorizes the city\u2019s governing body to set specific salaries within that range. Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 22-704.1(45) (Supp.1985). During oral argument, counsel for the city relied on the Arkansas Statutes and Exhibit 5 in support of the city\u2019s argument that the city possesses final authority concerning employment matters in municipal court. Exhibit 5 is a Status Change report, authorizing a change in plaintiff Williams\u2019 salary while she was employed as a clerk. Such reports usually contain three authorizing signatures: Butler\u2019s (in this instance apparently signed by the police department\u2019s business manager), the personnel director\u2019s, and the city manager\u2019s (in this instance signed by his secretary). The city argues that this document and the statute demonstrate that all employment decisions must be approved by the city, thereby making it the final authority with respect to employment matters. We disagree. At most the document demonstrates that the city, consistent with the statute, approves salary changes that are within the statutory range. Moreover, the city\u2019s argument here contradicts the position it took in its post-trial brief that it had no control whatsoever over the municipal court concerning employment matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEX\">The Arkansas General Assembly * * * has authorized Judge Butler to employ persons to fill [the] staff positions. Inherent in the power to hire is the power to discharge or terminate. The Arkansas Constitution, Art. 7, Sec. 2, makes it very clear the legislative and executive branches of the City are not to inter-fer[e] with those powers in the municipal court. The City submits that the Court should find plaintiffs to be employees of the Court, and not employees of the City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azh\">Record at 252.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">In this case, the unconstitutional act is that of the municipality, not merely that of one of its employees. Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>imposing municipal liability on the City of Little Rock is the result of a fault-based determination, rather than the application of <em>respondeat superior </em>principles. <em>See Pembaur, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1298; <em>City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2433-34 (plurality) (the purpose of <em>Monell\u2019s </em>policy or custom requirement is to require a determination of fault on the part of the municipality, not merely one of its employees). Butler\u2019s acts, pursuant to an unwritten policy, became the city\u2019s acts. The City of Little Rock certainly would have been liable if the city\u2019s governing body had made the decision to discharge Williams. <em>See Owen </em>and <em>Newport, supra. </em>In other words, if Butler had not possessed the final authority in this matter, if Williams had followed the grievance procedures available to employees outside the municipal court, and if the city\u2019s properly constituted governing body had upheld the discharge, then clearly the city would have been liable for the governing body\u2019s action. We see no constitutional difference between imposing \u00a7 1983 liability on the city in those circumstances and imposing liability on the city where, as here, it has delegated that final authority to discharge employees to a policy-making official such as Butler.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, we hold that where, pursuant to municipal policy or custom, an official is delegated final policy-making authority, and acts unconstitutionally pursuant to that authority, the official\u2019s conduct may fairly be said to be that of the city, and the city may be held liable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In conclusion, the record amply supports the district court\u2019s finding that Butler possessed final policy-making authority with respect to employment matters in the municipal court, and that he exercised that authority when he discharged Williams. Consequently, in light of <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>\u00a7 1983 liability may be imposed upon the City of Little Rock. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In the original appeal, issues were raised concerning punitive damages, attorney fees, remarks made during closing argument, and the admission into evidence of recorded conversations. These issues were not resubmitted to this court on remand from the Supreme Court, nor were they briefed, submitted and argued in this en banc hearing. We therefore consider them waived, or if not waived, we decide all but the attorney fees issue in accordance with the reasoning set forth in the original panel opinion. <em>See </em>746 F.2d at 440-44. The attorney fees issue was decided by the court on the first rehearing en banc, and we decide that issue according to our reasoning in that opinion. <em>See </em>762 F.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Costs assessed against the City of Little Rock.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\">. In <em>Steagald v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981), decided the day after Doctor Pembaur filed his lawsuit, the Supreme Court held that absent exigent circumstances or consent an officer may not make a warrantless search for the subject of an arrest warrant in a third party\u2019s home. Defendant County of Hamilton did not challenge the retroactive application of <em>Steagald. </em>In fact, the county conceded that <em>Steagald </em>applied retroactively, and the Supreme Court decided the case in light of the county\u2019s concession. <em>Pembaur, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1297 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b412-13\">. The Sixth Circuit held that the district court\u2019s finding that no city policy existed was clearly erroneous in light of the city police chief's testimony that the city police took whatever steps were necessary, including forcible entry, to serve warrants. 746 F.2d at 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-5\">. The district court prepared a post-trial memorandum and order in which it clarified the findings it made at the conclusion of the evidence. The court listed the factual basis for its findings. The court stated that although Butler\u2019s staff was processed through the city personnel office, paid by the city, assigned city parking places, and worked in city buildings, Butler hired, controlled, and supervised his staff. No evidence was introduced to the contrary. Record at 271.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\">. These were not self-serving admissions at the time Butler responded to the city\u2019s request. The city\u2019s position throughout the trial was that Butler, not the city, had exclusive control and ultimate responsibility with respect to employment matters in the municipal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\">. Attached to Exhibit 5 is another Status Change report filed when Williams was hired. Counsel for the city also relied on this report in support of the argument that the city possesses the final authority concerning employment matters. In addition to the reasons we discussed above concerning Exhibit 5, we note that the signatures by the officials\u2019 assistants indicate that the authorization was pro forma and as a practical matter Butler possessed the final authority here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. The constitutional violation in this case is not the result of a mere aberrant act by a person in a policy-making position. <em>See Pembaur, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1302 (White, J., concurring) (municipal liability would not have attached had there been a statute or ordinance that provided the proper constitutional protection). To characterize Williams\u2019 discharge in this case as merely the result of an aberrant act ignores the finality of Butler\u2019s decisions with respect to employment matters. The record does not indicate that grievance procedures existed whereby municipal court personnel could appeal adverse employment decisions. Rather, the record indicates that as a result of an unwritten policy or custom, giving municipal judges final authority concerning municipal court employment matters, court personnel were subject to Butler\u2019s final decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b416-10\">ROSS, Circuit Judge, with whom JOHN R. GIBSON, BOWMAN, WOLLMAN, and MAGILL, Circuit Judges,</author>\n<p id=\"ANR\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">For the third time,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court holds the City of Little Rock liable for Judge Butler\u2019s unlawful decision to fire a court employee who helped expose Butler\u2019s corruption. In doing so, this court essentially holds that the City has a policy of firing employees who attempt to help the City uncover corruption. This decision was wrong the first two times. After the decision was vacated by the Supreme Court with instructions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>read and apply <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986), the decision is entirely unsupported. Based on <em>Pembaur, </em>this court should reverse the district court\u2019s finding in favor of Butler on his third party complaint against the City. Butler alone was responsible for his firing decision and Butler alone should be held accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In <em>Pembaur, </em>the Court held that \u201cmunicipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>106 S.Ct. at 1298. The Court then added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">Having said this much, we hasten to emphasize that not every decision by municipal officers automatically subjects the municipality to \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>Municipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered. </em>The fact that a particular official \u2014 even a policy-making official \u2014 has discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not, without more, give rise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion. * * * The official must also be responsible for establishing final government policy respecting such activity before the municipality can be held liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7q\"><em>Id. </em>at 1299-1300 (footnotes omitted, emphasis supplied). This policymaking requirement was illustrated in footnote 12 with an employment example directly applicable to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">Thus, for example, the County Sheriff may have discretion to hire and fire employees without also being the county official responsible for establishing county employment policy. If this were the case, the Sheriff\u2019s decisions respecting employment would not give rise to municipal liability, although similar decisions with respect to law enforcement practices, over which the Sheriff is the official policymaker, would give rise to municipal liability. Instead, if county employment policy was set by the Board of County Commissioners, only that body\u2019s decisions would provide a basis for county liability. This would be true even if the Board left the Sheriff discretion to hire and fire employees and the Sheriff exercised that discretion in an unconstitutional manner; the decision to act unlawfully would not be a decision of the Board. However, if the Board delegated its power to establish final employment policy to the Sheriff, the Sheriff\u2019s decisions would represent county policy and could give rise to municipal liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1300, n. 12 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">In the case before us, Judge McMillian\u2019s dissent to the panel opinion stated that \u201cthere was no evidence that Butler was delegated authority to set city personnel policy.\u201d <em>Williams v. Butler, </em>746 F.2d 431, 444 (8th Cir.1984) (McMillian, J., dissenting). We now know that a municipality cannot be held liable for an employee\u2019s decisions absent such evidence. Because there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that Butler had the authority to make final employment <em>policy </em>for the City, as opposed to mere final employment <em>decisions </em>for the City, the City cannot be held liable for Butler\u2019s decision to fire Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Even if Butler had somehow been given authority to make employment policy for the City, the facts in this case do not support a conclusion that Butler\u2019s vengeful and self-motivated decision to fire Williams actually created employment policy for the City. In my view, a policy decision is distinguishable from other types of decisions in that it results in \u201ca general position that would govern future cases.\u201d <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, supra, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1309 n. 7 (Powell, J., dissenting). The City of Little Rock never adopted a policy of firing employees who attempt to help the city uncover corruption, and it certainly cannot be said to have adopted such a policy for general application in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">A plurality of the Court in <em>Pembaur </em>adopted a different definition of the term \u201cpolicy\u201d. According to the plurality, a policy decision simply involves \u201ca deliberate choice to follow a course of action * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>made from among various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300. This standard was contained in Part II-B of the opinion. It received the approval of only four justices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, one of the four, Justice White, interpreted the standard quite narrowly. In deciding to cast his vote with the majority, Justice White relied heavily upon the fact that the unlawful act committed in <em>Pembaur </em>(a forcible entry without a search warrant) was not unlawful at the time committed. Based on this fact, he found it reasonable to infer that the municipal officials\u2019 decision to commit the unlawful act was consistent with municipal policy. But this inference would not have been proper, Justice White continued, if the unlawful act had been illegal under federal, state, or local law at the time the act was committed. His point was demonstrated with the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">Local law enforcement officers are expected to obey the law and ordinarily swear to do so when they take office. Where the controlling law places limits on their authority, they cannot be said to have the authority to make contrary policy. Had the sheriff or prosecutor in this case failed to follow an existing warrant requirement, it would be absurd to say that he was nevertheless executing county policy in authorizing the forceful entry in this case and even stranger to say that the county would be liable if the sheriff had secured a warrant and it turned out that he and the magistrate had mistakenly thought there was probable cause for the warrant. If deliberate or mistaken acts like this, admittedly contrary to local law, expose the county to liability, it must be on the basis of <em>respondeat superior </em>and not because the officers\u2019 acts represents local policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1301-02 (White, J., concurring). Justice O\u2019Connor expressed her agreement with Justice White\u2019s approach in a separate concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In the case before us, the unlawful act (retaliatory firing) was clearly unlawful at the time it was committed, and the municipal official who committed the act (a municipal traffic judge) was expected to obey the law and presumably swore to do so when he took office. As such, the judge \u201ccannot be said to have [had] the authority to make * * * [employment] policy\u201d which was inconsistent with the law. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. In other words, Butler\u2019s decision to fire Williams was \u201cforbidden by * * * [the] law * * * [and was a decision] that [he] then had * * * [no] authority to make.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1302. As such, the City cannot be held responsible for Butler\u2019s aberrant act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-13\">. Once by the panel, once by this court <em>en banc </em>by virtue of a tie vote, and now by a majority vote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-5\">. The four concurring justices were Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun. Justice O\u2019Con-nor joined in the judgment but refused her approval of Part II-B because of a \u201cfear that the standard the majority articulates may be misread to expose municipalities to liability beyond that envisioned by the Court in <em>Monell.\" Id. </em>at 1305 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Likewise, Justice Stevens joined in the judgment but not Part II-B of the opinion. His refusal to join Part II-B was founded on his view that municipalities can be liable under a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
