SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This is an appeal by the United States from the September 30, 1985, judgment of the United States Claims Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (taxpayer), was not subject to a penalty under section 6655 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (code)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> even though taxpayer did not make quarterly payments of estimated tax. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The issue is whether the section 47(a) investment tax credit recapture liability constitutes a \u201ctax imposed by section 11\u201d of the code within the meaning of section 6655(f) (formerly section 6655(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">This suit for refund arises under section 6655 of the code, which section imposes an addition to tax upon corporations for the failure to pay estimated income taxes. At issue here is an addition to tax for 1976 of $92,691. The relevant facts were undisputed and the case was submitted to the Claims Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. The opinion of the Claims Court (Judge Wiese), ruling in favor of the taxpayer, was filed on September 30, 1985. By judgment entered on the same date, taxpayer\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted and the Government\u2019s motion was denied. The Government timely filed its notice of appeal on November 27, 1985. Jurisdiction of this court is derived under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">The parties are in agreement that the relevant facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Berkshire Hathaway is incorporated under the laws of Delaware. For its tax year ending September 30, 1975, taxpayer had a net operating loss. Taxpayer nonetheless was required to pay a tax of $1,136 due to the \u201crecapture\u201d of previously claimed investment credits upon its premature disposition of certain section 38 property. The code provides for recapture because allowable investment credits, which are claimed when section 38 property is placed in service, increase directly with the useful life of the section 38 property. Thus, if the property is disposed of before the end of the useful life used in claiming the credit, the credit must be reduced and based on the shorter useful life during which the property was actually in service. The reduction in the previously claimed credits causes an increase in tax \u2014 commonly referred to as recapture \u2014 for the year of the premature disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">For its fiscal year ending September 30, 1976, taxpayer\u2019s taxable income was $9,966,093 and its federal income tax liability was $2,852,418. Taxpayer, however, did not make any installment payments of estimated taxes during its 1976 tax year. Acting under code section 6655, the Commissioner assessed an addition to tax of $92,-691 for the failure to pay estimated taxes. Taxpayer paid the assessment, filed a claim for refund that was denied, and ultimately filed a refund suit in the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">In the court below, taxpayer sought shelter from the addition to tax for failure to pay estimated income taxes under, <em>inter alia, </em>section 6655(d)(2) and section 6655(f). Section 6655(d) provides that the addition to tax for a corporation\u2019s underpayment of estimated tax shall not apply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK9\">if the total amount of all payments of estimated tax * * * equals or exceeds the amount which would have been required * * * if the estimated tax were * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-17\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-18\">(2) An amount equal to the tax computed at the rates applicable to the taxable year but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the return of the corporation for, and the law applicable to, the preceding taxable year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Section 6655(f) states in pertinent part that the \u201ctax\u201d upon which an obligation to pay estimated tax is based is \u201cthe tax imposed by section 11 * * * over * * * the credits against tax.\u201d Taxpayer urged that it was not liable for estimated taxes because the tax arising upon recapture of investment tax credits was not \u201cthe tax imposed by section 11.\u201d Therefore, it contended it had no 1975 tax liability, in the context of its obligation to pay estimated taxes for 1976 and, hence, did not have to pay estimated taxes during its 1976 tax year by virtue of the pertinent \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of section 6655(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Government, on the basis of the recent decisions of the Seventh Circuit in <em>A.O. Smith Corp. v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the Sixth Circuit in <em>Sifco Industries, Inc. v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> involving the same issue, countered with the argument that recaptured investment tax credits are a part of the section 11 (26 U.S.C.) tax. The court below rejected the Government\u2019s argument, as upheld by the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, and entered judgment for taxpayer. The Government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Generally, section 6154 of the code requires a corporation to make quarterly payments of estimated tax during its taxable year. Section 6655 imposes a penalty on a corporation which fails to make (or underpays) such quarterly payments, with certain exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In 1976, taxpayer made no quarterly payments of estimated tax. Thus, taxpayer would be subject to the section 6655 penalty unless the exception in section 6655(d)(2) asserted by taxpayer applies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 6655(d)(2) allows a taxpayer to pay estimated tax in the current year based on the known facts of the prior year\u2019s return:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJh\">(d) Exception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">* * * [T]he addition to the tax with respect to any underpayment * * * shall not be imposed if the total amount of all payments of estimated tax * * * equals or exceeds the amount which would have been required to be paid * * * if the estimated tax were * * *\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-16\">(2) An amount equal to the <em>tax </em>computed at the rates applicable to the taxable year but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the return of the corporation for, and the law applicable to, the preceding taxable year. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">The present appeal hinges on the meaning of the word \u201ctax\u201d for purposes of the (d)(2) exception.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The controlling definition is furnished in section 6655(f) (formerly section 6655(e)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-18\">(f) Definition of tax</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1P\">For purposes of subsections (b), (d), (e), and (i), the term \u201ctax\u201d means the excess of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-19\">(1) the tax imposed by section 11 * * over</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-20\">(2) the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-21\">(A) the credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter ^ * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">Thus, the question becomes whether in 1975 taxpayer had any \u201ctax imposed by section 11.\u201d Section 11 is the basic corporate tax imposed on the \u201ctaxable income\u201d of every corporation. Here, the Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Court\u2019s finding that taxpayer had \u201cno taxable income\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in 1975 is undisputed. Since there was no tax imposed on taxable income, it follows that there was no \u201ctax imposed by section 11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The only tax paid for 1975 was the section 47 recapture of investment tax credit. The section 47 recapture tax had no effect, directly or indirectly, on taxpayer\u2019s 1975 taxable income or on taxpayer\u2019s section 11 tax liability. Section 47 operates independently to increase the \u201ctax under this chapter.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 11 and section 47 are each self-contained; neither section makes any reference to the other, explicitly or implicitly-</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We hold that the section 47 recapture tax is not a \u201ctax imposed by section 11.\u201d Thus, for 1975 taxpayer paid no tax imposed by section 11, and for 1976 taxpayer was protected by the safe harbor of section 6655(d)(2). Therefore, taxpayer was not subject to the section 6655 penalty even though it made no quarterly payments of estimated tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Thus, we agree with the analysis of the United States Claims Court in the present case, and with the analysis of the dissenting opinion in <em>A.O. Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The statutory language compels us to disagree with the result reached by the majority in <em>A.O. Smith, </em>which decision was followed in <em>Sifco Industries.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">We disagree with the majority\u2019s reasoning in <em>A.O. Smith </em>that section 38 investment tax credits \u201cfeed into\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> section 11 in the same manner that deductions feed into section 11. It is true that deductions reduce taxable income and, thus, reduce the \u201ctax imposed by section 11.\u201d There is a distinction, however, between income deductions and tax credits. Tax credits have no effect on taxable income or on the tax calculated according to section 11. It is only after the calculation of the section 11 tax that the tax credit is subtracted from the \u201ctax imposed by this <em>chapter.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Similarly, the section 47 recapture tax has no effect on taxable income or on the tax imposed by section 11. Section 47 increases the \u201ctax under this chapter\u201d separately and independently from any section 11 tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">The section 47 recapture tax is not a tax imposed by section 11. In 1975 taxpayer paid no tax imposed by section 11; therefore, in 1976, taxpayer was protected by the safe harbor of section 6655(d)(2). Taxpayer was not subject to the section 6655 penalty even though it did not make quarterly estimated tax payments in 1976. The judgment of the United States Claims Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-12\">. <em>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. v.

The Government suggests that the \u00a7 6655(d)(2) exception is inappropriate because the tax rates did not change during the years at issue, and taxpayer, therefore, must be relying on the \u00a7 6655(d)(1) exception. We consider taxpayer\u2019s reliance on (d)(2) to be proper even though there was no change in the tax rates. Furthermore, the distinction between (d)(1) and (d)(2) makes no difference in the outcome of this case, since the definition of \u201ctax\u201d is the same for both subsections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b545-24\">. We agree with the Claims Court that \u00a7 6655 imposes a penalty and, therefore, the strict construction rule would apply. <em>See Commissioner v.
