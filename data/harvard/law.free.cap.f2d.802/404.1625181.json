See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x)(l) (Supp. II 1985). He challenges the constitutionality and the application of \u00a7 402(x)(l), under which his disability benefits were suspended while he was incarcerated. Section 402(x)(l) suspends benefits to a prisoner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY3\">for any month during which such individual is confined in a jail, prison, or other penal institution or correctional facility, pursuant to his conviction of an offense which constituted a felony under applicable law, unless such individual is actively and satisfactorily participating in a rehabilitation program which has been specifically approved for such individual by a court of law and, as determined by the Secretary, is expected to result in such individual being able to engage in substantial gainful activity upon release and within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">We hold that \u00a7 402(x)(l) is constitutional\u2014 we find no violation of due process, no punishment without trial, and no bill of attainder or ex post facto law. <em>Cf. Fleming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960) (holding constitutional the <em>termination </em>of old-age benefits payable to an alien who is deported on certain grounds). Andujar\u2019s other claims are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
