Headley (hereinafter \u201cthe State\u201d), Superintendent of the New York State correctional facility at which petitioner Patsy Kelly Jarrett is imprisoned, appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, David N. Edelstein, <em>Judge, </em>conditionally granting Jarrett\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the identification of Jarrett at her state trial was unreliable and resulted from impermissibly suggestive police and prosecutorial procedures, in violation of her right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. <em>See </em>633 F.Supp. 1403 (1986). The State contends principally that the police and prosecutorial procedures were not impermissibly suggestive and that, in any event, the identification of Jarrett was independently reliable. We conclude that the district court erred in finding that the in-court identification of Jarrett at trial was the result of impermissibly suggestive law enforcement procedures, and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">In the summer of 1973, Jarrett and her paramour Billy Kelly drove Jarrett\u2019s blue Oldsmobile from their hometown in North Carolina to Utica, New York, where the two lived together. They remained in Utica until about the middle of August, when they returned together to North Carolina. In 1977, in connection with events that had occurred in Utica in 1973 about two days before their departure, Jarrett, along with Kelly, was found guilty on two counts of murder, in violation of N.Y.Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 125.25(1) and (3) (McKinney 1975), and two counts of robbery, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 160.15(1) and (3) (McKinney 1975). Jarrett was sentenced to a prison term of 25 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">A. <em>The Events and Robert Hyland\u2019s Initial Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">In the early afternoon of August 11, 1973, a Seaway gas station near Utica was robbed and its attendant bound and slain. On August 13, 1973, Robert Hyland went to State Police Headquarters in Oneida, New York, and made a sworn statement to Investigator Ronald Hojnacki. As transcribed by Hojnacki and signed by Hyland, the statement described Hyland\u2019s observation of the events of August 11 as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">At approximately 12:50 p.m. on August 11, Hyland drove into the Seaway station and pulled up to the pumps. Shortly after he got out of his car to look for the attendant, a blue/green car backed around from the side of the station and parked opposite him near the pumps. Hyland described the car\u2019s driver as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-17\">I am not sure, but I believe the operator was a white female. She had long black shoulder length hair and was wearing dark clothing____ Upon moving closer to the gas pumps I observed this female going through items in a brown hexagon type pattern pocketbook____ The type of hairstyle that this person had did not allow me to see her face. The girl did have a tan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>A few seconds after the other car had parked, a white male, whom Hyland described in detail, approached Hyland\u2019s car, and sold him $5 worth of gas. Hyland paid for his gas, received change, and left the station. The man who sold Hyland gas was not the station\u2019s attendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">B. <em>Hyland\u2019s Pretrial Identifications of Jarrett</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">More than two years later, police matched a latent fingerprint, lifted from the tape that had been used to bind the slain attendant, with that of Billy Kelly. In December 1975, New York State Police Investigator John Ingraham went to Hyland\u2019s home and showed him two groups of photographs. From the first array, of males, Hyland selected two pictures, both of Billy Kelly, as the man who sold him gas at the Seaway station on August 11, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Ingraham then gave Hyland a dozen photographs of females. Three bore the notation \u201cNew York State Police,\u201d one the notation \u201cNY STA,\u201d and the one of Jarrett, \u201cSheriff\u2019s Department.\u201d The other seven bore no markings. Hyland initially selected two photographs, the one of Jarrett and one of the three photographs bearing a \u201cNew York State Police\u201d legend, and eventually settled on the photograph of Jarrett as the driver of the other car at the Seaway station on August 11, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In March 1976, Hyland testified before the grand jury. He stated that the driver of the other car at the gas station \u201cwas combing her hair in the car\u201d and \u201clooked like a female.\u201d Shown the picture of Jarrett, Hyland testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">A. Well, I can\u2019t say positive about this, about the way \u2014 it was the same style, long hair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">Q. Is it safe to say then that the best you can say is that it could be the girl but you can\u2019t say for sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Following the grand jury\u2019s indictment, Jarrett moved to preclude the State from offering an in-court identification of her by Hyland at trial, on the ground that the identification procedures used by the police had been unduly suggestive. In February 1977, a <em>Wade </em>hearing, <em>see United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), was held in State Supreme Court, at which Jarrett was present at the counsel table. Hyland testified that the other car at the gas station had been driven by a woman. He described the process of his selection of Jarrett\u2019s picture from among those shown him by Ingraham in December 1975, stating that he had initially selected two photos and then narrowed his choice to one. He testified that he had selected the one photo as \u201cpossibly being the female that was in the car at the gas station,\u201d but that he still thought that both of the photos he had initially selected looked like the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">He testified that Ingraham had given him the photographs in a pile and had not suggested which he should select or otherwise engaged him in conversation about the photos, even after he had made his selection. He said that he \u201cmay have\u201d observed the \u201cNew York State Police\u201d and \u201cSheriffs Department\u201d markings on four photographs and that \u201cI figured it was police pictures,\u201d but did not have the markings \u201cin mind, at all____ I was more concerned with the picture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">On cross-examination, in response to Jarrett\u2019s counsel\u2019s inquiry as to whether he could describe the woman in the car, Hyland stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">A. Yes. It was a question whether I was going to be served first with the gasoline or the girl. And this girl had long, darker hair, it seemed, than the one that\u2019s right there, now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\">Q. Darker than the one right there, right now, you\u2019re referring to who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">A. That girl, right, there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-20\">Q. At the Defense table?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-22\">Following the <em>Wade </em>hearing, the state court denied Jarrett\u2019s motion to preclude Hyland\u2019s identification testimony, holding that the photographic identification procedures had not \u201ccreate[d] a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>[Hyland] observed ... Jarrett under favorable lighting conditions at close range, for a sufficient length of time and under such conditions as to make an impression upon him. The series of photographs of persons having approximately the same physical characteristics do not contain any element of suggestiveness, nor were any suggestive statements made to him by Investigator Ingraham. In response to a question as to certain photographs bearing police notations, the witness said he thought at the time that all the photographs were police shots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\">The court also pointed out that Hyland \u201ctestified he could see [Jarrett] sitting in the car and that at the time her hair was darker than in the courtroom,\u201d and noted that in a companion hearing there had been evidence that Jarrett had worn her hair longer and dyed darker in August 1973 than it was in March 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">C. <em>Hyland\u2019s Testimony at Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5X\">Jarrett and Kelly were tried together on the murder and robbery charges. At trial, Hyland identified Jarrett as the other driver he had seen at the Seaway station.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">When confronted on cross-examination with his initial statement that he had not seen the driver\u2019s face and was \u201cnot sure\u201d even that the driver was a \u201cfemale,\u201d Hyland\u2019s responses as to the gender of the driver grew far more certain than they had been prior to trial. Although perhaps occasionally displaying his earlier lack of certainty, he now stated that he was sure the driver was a female based on her \u201cmotion and everything\u201d; that while her hair \u201cwas covering up a lot of her face,\u201d he could see her nose, eyes, and forehead; and that he \u201cknew\u201d on the day of his August 13, 1973 statement that the driver was a female. He maintained that the typed version of his initial statement was wrong and that he did not know how it had come to include the statement that he was \u201cnot sure.\u201d He said he did not read the statement but may have \u201cscanned\u201d it and have \u201cthought it was probably right.\u201d On redirect examination by the district attorney and recross examination by counsel for Kelly, Hyland\u2019s testimony on this issue included the following questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">Q. [By district attorney Wolff] ... Let me ask you this: When you were in the station, on August 11th, were you sure in your own mind that it was a girl that was in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">A. Yes. I would stake my life on that, that it was a girl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">Q. Is Patsy Jarrett the female you saw sitting in the car in front of the Seaway gas station on August 11, 1973?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">MR. WOLFF: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">RECROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. AUSTIN [counsel for Kelly]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">Q. That\u2019s your best judgment? Would you stake your life on that one, Mr. Hyland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">Q. You wouldn\u2019t want to stake your life on that, would you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">A. I put my trust in the Lord with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">Q. How about your life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">A. Well, I have my life with the Lord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-18\">Q. You wouldn\u2019t want that stake through your heart, would you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-19\">A. (No response)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">On cross-examination as to the circumstances surrounding his initial identification of Jarrett, Hyland testified that \u201cat one time\u201d he thought the driver might have been the girl in another photo and that he had \u201cdoubt\u201d as to which photo was correct. However, he \u201cthought\u201d the girl in the photo he eventually settled on \u201cwas the one.\u201d He confirmed that both of the pictures he had initially selected looked like the Seaway driver. He testified that five of the photographs shown him bore police notations but that as to the other seven he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say that [he] could tell\u201d whether they were taken by a police agency. He testified that after he had made his final selection, Ingraham told him who the man and woman he had selected might be and where they were from.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Hyland was also asked whether he had received any briefing from the district attorney on the day he testified. His testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">Q. Did you talk to anyone as to how you were going to testify today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">A. I talked to the fellow, here. He told me to say what was in my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">Q. Did you discuss this case with the District Attorney, today, is that correct? You discussed this case a little bit today with Mr. Wolff, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">Q. Did he go over the testimony, at all, today with you? Did he tell you the kind of questions he was going to ask you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">A. He just told me to say what I thought on my mind and stick to my guns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">Q. Stick to your guns in response to his questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">A. No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">Q. What guns have you got?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">A. Well, that\u2019s an expression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-14\">Q. ... Were you told to stick to your guns, in any event?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-15\">A. Well, to say what I believe, what was in my mind. I wouldn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t in my mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">Jarrett called Investigator Hojnacki to testify with respect to Hyland\u2019s 1973 written statement. Hojnacki had typed Hyland\u2019s statement bit by bit as Hyland gave it and testified that the contents of the typed statement were what Hyland had told him, that he had not added anything Hyland had not said, and that he would not have included a statement that Hyland did not see the face of the girl unless Hyland had said it. Hojnacki testified that he had instructed Hyland that only truthful and accurate information should be in the statement and that Hyland then read the statement before signing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-17\">Both the prosecution and the defense presented other evidence as to the gender and identity of the driver of the car Hyland had seen in the gas station. Three prosecution witnesses had seen a blue car at the station at the approximate time of the crimes. Two of the witnesses testified that a woman or girl had been at the station at that time, and one of them said the woman had emerged from the blue car. Jarrett testified that Kelly had often used her car without her and that she had told him he was free to date other women. One acquaintance of Kelly in Utica that summer testified that he had never seen Kelly with another woman. The testimony of other witnesses suggested that during that summer Kelly had frequented a homosexual bar and had liaisons with other young men; the defense also pointed out that in 1973 it was not uncommon for young men to wear their hair very long.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-18\">The jury, after deliberating over the course of two days, during which it requested a rereading of the testimony of both Hyland and Hojnacki, returned verdicts of guilty on all counts. On appeal to the Appellate Division, Jarrett\u2019s conviction was affirmed without opinion; leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">D. <em>The Present Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-20\">Jarrett commenced the present habeas proceeding in 1984 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1982), contending (1) that the admission of Hyland\u2019s identification testimony at trial had denied her due process, (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction, and (3) that the failure to sever her trial from Kelly\u2019s had denied her a fair trial. After the State objected that Jarrett had not exhausted her state remedies on the severance claim, Jarrett withdrew that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-21\">Jarrett\u2019s petition was referred to United States Magistrate Michael H. Dolinger, who recommended that the writ be granted on the first ground but not on the second. He found that certain of the state court\u2019s findings, including the finding that Hyland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>had believed that all of the photographs shown him were police photos, were not entitled to deference because the findings were \u201centirely unsupported by the record.\u201d <em>See </em>633 F.Supp. at 1406, 1409, 1414 n. 21. The magistrate concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">a series of steps taken and not taken by the police from the time of the crime until Hyland took the witness stand were sufficiently suggestive in their cumulative impact to satisfy the first stage of the two-part analysis and thus to require the Court to review the independent basis, if any, for Hyland\u2019s in-court identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Id. at 1414. In particular, the magistrate found that \u201cthe manner in which [the array] was handled contributed significantly to the process of suggestion\u201d in two respects: (1) the photo array in which Jarrett\u2019s picture was presented to Hyland had included only other women; and (2) four of these photographs had plainly visible law enforcement markings, with the marking \u201cSheriff\u201d appearing only on Jarrett\u2019s photograph. <em>Id. </em>at 1415-16. He further found it particularly significant that Ingraham had, after Hyland\u2019s selection of Kelly\u2019s and Jarrett\u2019s photos, told Hyland who they might be and where they were from, since these disclosures \u201cplainly would be expected to have a suggestive impact on an uncertain witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1416. The magistrate found that Hyland was also encouraged to view his selection of Jarrett\u2019s photograph as correct by the presence of Jarrett at the <em>Wade </em>hearing, the abundant pretrial publicity about the case, the absence of any lineup, and the prosecutor\u2019s telling Hyland just before he testified to \u201cstick to [his] guns.\u201d The magistrate concluded that the \u201ccollective effect\u201d of all the factors was sufficiently suggestive to require a review of the independent reliability of Hyland\u2019s identification. <em>Id. </em>at 1418. He found that reliability lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The magistrate recommended that the petition\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence be rejected, reasoning that if the identification by Hyland was admissible, the evidence was sufficient to support Jarrett\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The district court adopted the report of the magistrate and conditionally granted the petition, directing the State to release Jarrett unless she was retried within ninety days. The State appealed, and this Court granted a stay pending our decision of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">On appeal, the State argues principally (1) that the district court erred in failing to give deference to the state court\u2019s findings of fact, (2) that the record shows that the pretrial identification procedures leading to Hyland\u2019s selection of Jarrett\u2019s photograph were not impermissibly suggestive, and (3) that events occurring after Hyland\u2019s selection of Jarrett\u2019s photograph were not grounds for excluding his in-court identification of her. Jarrett asks that the district court\u2019s ruling as to the identification procedures be upheld; she has not pursued her claim, rejected by the district court, that the evidence to convict her was insufficient. We find merit in the State\u2019s contentions and we reverse the judgment granting the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">A. <em>General Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The substantive and procedural framework within which we consider the issues on appeal is well established. The substantive principles govern the right of an accused to exclude from evidence an identification that has resulted from improperly suggestive law enforcement procedures, <em>e.g., Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), and the \u201cright to avoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is positively certain,\u201d <em>Solomon v. Smith, </em>645 F.2d 1179, 1185 (2d Cir.1981). The procedural principles define the proper role of the federal habeas court in determining the facts to which the substantive principles are to be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">In general, a pretrial photographic identification procedure used by law enforcement officials violates due process if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>procedure \u201cis so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1969); <em>accord Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 198, 93 S.Ct. 375, 381, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972). When the number of photographs shown has not been so small as to make the presentation itself unfairly suggestive, <em>see United States v. Boston, </em>508 F.2d 1171, 1177 (2d Cir.1974) (eight not impermissibly suggestive), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1001, 95 S.Ct. 2401, 44 L.Ed.2d 669 (1975); <em>see also United States v. Bennett, </em>409 F.2d 888, 898 (2d Cir.) (six not impermissibly suggestive), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>396 U.S. 852, 90 S.Ct. 113, 24 L.Ed.2d 101 (1969), and there is nothing suggestive in the officials\u2019 manner of presentation, the principal question is whether the picture of the accused, matching descriptions given by the witness, so stood out from all of the other photographs as to \u201csuggest to an identifying witness that [that person] was more likely to be the culprit.\u201d <em>United States v. Archibald, </em>734 F.2d 938, 940 (2d Cir.1984). We have found, for example, that a photographic array was impermissibly suggestive when witnesses had described a bank robber as a light-skinned Black man with an Afro haircut, and of the six photographs presented, only that of defendant showed a Black having a light skin tone. <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>456 F.2d 638 (2d Cir.1972). And in addressing the similar question of the suggestiveness of a lineup, we have held that the presence of only the defendant wearing a shirt of the color described by witnesses was impermissibly suggestive. <em>United States ex rel. Cannon v. Montanye, </em>486 F.2d 263 (2d Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 962, 94 S.Ct. 1982, 40 L.Ed.2d 313 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">It is not required, however, that all of the photographs in the array be uniform with respect to a given characteristic. Thus, in <em>Archibald, </em>in connection with a conviction for a bank robbery that occurred in New York City\u2019s Borough of Manhattan, we rejected the argument that the six-photograph array was impermissibly suggestive because only the defendant\u2019s photograph bore a legend indicating that he had been arrested in Manhattan, with the other photographs indicating that those persons had been arrested in other boroughs of the city. 734 F.2d at 940. Similarly, in <em>Fernandez, </em>we noted that if the impermissibly suggestive array that included the defendant had been combined with another five-photo array that included one other light-skinned Black with an Afro haircut, the resulting 11-man array that included two men fitting the witnesses\u2019 description would not have been improperly suggestive. 456 F.2d at 642. In <em>Cannon, </em>we noted that if \u201cone or two\u201d others in the five-person lineup had also worn a shirt of the color the attacker wore, \u201cthe inference [of undue suggestion] would weaken very considerably.\u201d 486 F.2d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">When the witness\u2019s initial identification of the accused has been tentative and his later identifications are \u201cpositively certain,\u201d there may be a question as to whether the newfound certainty resulted from impermissibly suggestive law enforcement procedures. <em>Solomon v. Smith, </em>645 F.2d at 1185. In <em>Solomon, </em>we concluded that the witness\u2019s certain in-court identification of the petitioner should have been excluded because her initially tentative identification was followed by, <em>inter alia, </em>repeated showings of the selected photograph in isolation, a courtroom showup, a lineup in which the witness identified someone else as the culprit, and eventually a highly suggestive lineup from which the witness selected the petitioner. We reached the same conclusion in <em>Dickerson v. Fogg, </em>692 F.2d 238, 241-42, 244-45 (2d Cir.1982), where the initially tentative identification was transformed into a positive one by the combined effect of the police officer\u2019s conducting a showup, pressuring the witness into taking a second and third look at the suspect after his initial tentativeness, and then arresting the suspect in the witness\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">On the other hand, police suggestiveness does not require the suppression of an identification if the witness was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>thereby influenced, as, for example, when the witness\u2019s identification was already positive. <em>See United States v. Jarvis, </em>560 F.2d 494, 499 &amp; n. 8 (2d Cir.1977) (positive identification prior to confirmatory remarks and repeated showings), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 934, 98 S.Ct. 1511, 55 L.Ed.2d 532 (1978); <em>United States v.

Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. at 2253; <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 382; <em>Styers v. Smith, </em>659 F.2d 293, 299 (2d Cir.1981). On the other hand, if the procedures were not impermissibly suggestive, independent reliability is not a constitutionally required condition of admissibility, <em>see United States v. Archibald, </em>734 F.2d at 941; <em>United States v. Leonardi, </em>623 F.2d at 755; <em>United States v. Bubar, </em>567 F.2d 192, 199 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 872, 98 S.Ct. 217, 54 L.Ed.2d 151 (1977), and the reliability of the identification is simply a question for the jury, <em>see Foster v. California, </em>394 U.S. 440, 442 n. 2, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 1128 n. 2, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In applying these substantive principles in the context of a habeas petition by a state prisoner pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the federal court is restricted as to the amount of de novo factfinding it may conduct. Section 2254(d) provides, in essence, that where the petitioner has received a full and fair hearing adequately developing the material facts of his claim in a proper state court proceeding at which he has been accorded due process, and the state court\u2019s resolution of the merits of the factual dispute is recorded in writing, the factual determination of the state court shall be presumed to be correct ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">(8) ... unless that part of the record of the State court proceeding in which the determination of such factual issue was made, pertinent to a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support such factual determination, is produced as provided for hereinafter, and the Federal court on a consideration of such part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determination is not fairly supported by the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). In the face of the required presumption, the burden is on the petitioner to show by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the state court was erroneous. <em>Id.; see Sumner v.

The ultimate question of the constitutionality of pretrial identification procedures is a mixed question of fact and law, and hence is not governed by the presumption. <em>Sumner v.

But the questions of fact that underlie this ultimate conclusion <em>are </em>governed by the statutory presumption____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the district court\u2019s determinations as to (1) the fairness of the photographic array presented to Hyland and (2) the suggestiveness of the other procedures that preceded Hyland\u2019s in-court identification of Jarrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>B. <em>The Character of the Photographic Array</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The district court found that the group of photographs that included Jarrett\u2019s photo was impermissibly suggestive because</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">(1) it included only pictures of women, and</p>\n<p id=\"Afr\">(2) some of the pictures bore law enforcement notations, with only Jarrett\u2019s bearing the legend, \u201cSheriff\u2019s Department.\u201d These conclusions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The argument that the array was impermissibly suggestive because it included no long-haired males should have been rejected on its merits. Although Hyland\u2019s initial written statement said <em>\u201cI am not sure, </em>but I believe the operator [of the other car] was a white female\u201d (emphasis added), the statement as a whole plainly confirmed that Hyland believed the operator was female. It proceeded to refer to this person as \u201cthe girl\u201d four times, \u201cshe\u201d or \u201cher\u201d three times, and \u201cthis female\u201d once. The written statement does not reflect that Hyland ever referred to the other driver as a male, or used a male pronoun, or even used a he-or-she formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Further, according to the trial testimony, other witnesses who observed the Seaway station at the pertinent time had stated that they had seen a woman there. Thus, the police had been given independent reason to infer that the person consistently referred to in Hyland\u2019s statement as a female was in fact a female. In all the circumstances, it was not impermissibly suggestive for the police to restrict its 12-photograph array to persons of that gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">As to the district court\u2019s conclusion that the array was impermissibly suggestive because Jarrett\u2019s photograph bore the legend \u201cSheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d we consider that conclusion doubly flawed. First, the court found that it was probable that Hyland would have ascribed undue significance to those photographs bearing a law enforcement legend, rejecting, as \u201centirely unsupported by the record,\u201d the state court finding that in fact Hyland had assumed that all the photographs shown him had originated with the police. At the <em>Wade </em>hearing that preceded the state court\u2019s finding, Hyland was asked a series of questions relating to his understanding of the provenance of the 12 photos he had been shown. Having elicited the response that Hyland would have no way of knowing who had taken the photographs that bore no legend, Jarrett\u2019s counsel asked whether there was any doubt in Hyland\u2019s mind that at least four of the pictures had been taken by law enforcement agencies. The response and follow-up questions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">A. I really did look at those. I didn\u2019t have that in mind at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">Q. You didn\u2019t look at that portion of the photographs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">A. I was more concerned with the picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-15\">Q. Are you telling us then that when you looked at these four photographs you did not see the police identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-16\">A. <em>I figured it was police pictures.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-17\">Q. I didn\u2019t ask you that. I asked you whether or not did you observe the police identification on those photographs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\">(Emphasis added.) The state court\u2019s finding that Hyland had assumed that all of the photographs were from law enforcement agencies was doubtless based on his statement that he had \u201cfigured it was police pictures\u201d he was being shown. The \u201cit\u201d in this statement appears to have referred to the entire group of pictures, since the answer was, as counsel obviously recognized, not responsive to the question directed solely at the four photos bearing the legends. Thus read, Hyland\u2019s statement plainly provided support for the state court\u2019s finding, which was contradicted by the district court\u2019s finding that Hyland was probably unduly influenced by the four law enforcement legends.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">More importantly, even if Hyland had not assumed that all of the photographs had been taken by law enforcement agencies, the fact that several pictures displayed such an origin would not provide a basis for concluding that the array was impermissibly suggestive. As discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>above, the array need not consist of photographs all of which display the culprit\u2019s described characteristics, and the presence \u25a0of several similarly marked photographs in the array meant that no single one suggested itself in that respect as depicting the person suspected by law enforcement agents. Indeed, the propriety of this array in particular is underscored by the fact that there were two photographs initially selected by Hyland that he said looked like the person he had seen \u2014 Jarrett\u2019s and one of those marked \u201cNew York State Police\u201d\u2014 and he had difficulty choosing between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Finally, we think little significance can be ascribed to the fact that of the several photos bearing law enforcement notations, only Jarrett\u2019s read \u201cSheriff\u2019s Department\u201d while the others read \u201cNew York State Police.\u201d The likely significance of either legend to a witness is the fact that the person shown has had some problem with the law, not the identity of the agency that made the arrest. Hyland, for example, referred to all the pictures generally as \u201cpolice\u201d shots. And since Hyland was shown the photographs by a New York State Police investigator rather than a member of a sheriff\u2019s department, the sheriff\u2019s legend was likely to have little positive suggestive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In sum, we conclude that the state court\u2019s findings of historical fact with regard to the procedures leading to Hyland\u2019s initial selection of the photograph of Jar- \u25a0 rett as the driver he had seen in the Seaway station were entitled to deference, and that the district court\u2019s conclusion that those procedures were impermissibly suggestive did not conform to the proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We turn, therefore, to the question of whether Hyland\u2019s in-court identification of Jarrett should not have been permitted because the certainty of that identification was unfairly produced by the events that followed his selection of her photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">C. <em>The Subsequent Events</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The magistrate found that the events that followed Hyland\u2019s initial selection of Jarrett\u2019s photograph contributed to the impermissible suggestiveness of the pretrial procedures, citing principally (1) Investigator Ingraham\u2019s postselection statement to Hyland as to who Jarrett and Kelly might be and where they were from, (2) the pretrial publicity given the case, (3) the failure of the state to conduct a lineup, and (4) the prosecutor\u2019s instruction to Hyland to \u201cstick to [his] guns\u201d at trial. Further, although concluding that the <em>Wade </em>hearing itself could not be considered unduly suggestive, the magistrate found it to be \u201csurely one of the \u2018surrounding circumstances\u2019 that properly affect the court\u2019s evaluation of the appropriateness of what the police and prosecutors chose to do in obtaining the witness\u2019s in-court identification testimony.\u201d 633 F.Supp. at 1417. While the investigator\u2019s postidentification confirmatory information and the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial exhortation were plainly statements that should have been avoided, we cannot agree that in the circumstances of this case the postselection events, singly or in combination, required the suppression of Hyland\u2019s in-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">1. <em>The Investigator\u2019s Postselection. Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">The record is clear that until Hyland had settled on the photograph of Jarrett as that of the driver he had seen at the Seaway station, Ingraham did not make any statements about any of the persons whose pictures were in the array. After the selection had been made, however, In-graham told Hyland \u201cwho they might be\u201d and \u201cwhere they were from.\u201d While this information, the details of which do not appear in the record, might well have been capable of confirming in Hyland\u2019s mind that his selection of the Jarrett photo was correct in the eyes of the police, especially given his certainty that Kelly was the man he had seen, the record reveals that Ingraham\u2019s statement simply did not have this effect. Thus, when next questioned three months later before the grand jury, Hyland remained equivocal as to his selection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the photo of Jarrett: He testified that \u201cthe best\u201d he could \u201csay [was] that it could be the girl but [he] can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d Even at the 1977 <em>Wade </em>hearing a year later, he did not positively identify Jarrett: he stated merely that the driver he had seen at the Seaway station had had lighter and longer hair than the girl at the counsel table. He stated that he still thought both of the photographs he had initially selected looked like the person he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Thus, it cannot reasonably be inferred that Ingraham\u2019s December 1975 statement had the effect of turning Hyland\u2019s tentative identification into one that was certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">2. <em>Jarrett\u2019s Presence at the Wade Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Although the presence of a defendant at the counsel table during a proceeding at which a witness is expected to identify the defendant may, in certain circumstances, be tantamount to a showup, and the court has discretion to take steps to avoid any unfairness in the identification, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Archibald, </em>734 F.2d at 941-43, there was no impropriety attributable to the prosecution in the present case because, as the district court found, Jarrett \u201cdid not request either not to be present or to be seated somewhere other than at counsel table.\u201d 633 F.Supp. at 1417. <em>See Boyd v. Henderson, </em>555 F.2d 56, 61-62 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 927, 98 S.Ct. 410, 54 L.Ed.2d 286 (1977); <em>cf. United States v. Brown, </em>699 F.2d 585, 594 (2d Cir.1983) (where defendant has prior notice of an in-court identification, no constitutional rights are violated if defendant did not request either prior line-up or that defendant be allowed to sit in audience with others of similar appearance). Jarrett\u2019s argument that her presence was induced by the prosecution because it had indicated that the identification of her by Hyland was only to be tentative is nonsensical. The district court properly found that Jarrett\u2019s presence at the <em>Wade </em>hearing was not the fault of the state. Since a defendant\u2019s voluntary acts cannot transform a permissible law enforcement procedure into one that is constitutionally infirm, Jarrett\u2019s appearance at the hearing should not have been considered a circumstance contributing to the conclusion that Hyland\u2019s in-court identification should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">3. <em>The Pretrial Publicity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">We also reject the magistrate\u2019s view that pretrial publicity, although concededly not attributable to the law enforcement officials, had significance because it was \u201clikely\u201d to have made Hyland more sure of his identification of Jarrett. Preliminarily, we note that Jarrett\u2019s petition did not make any claim based on pretrial publicity. Further, had the petition contained such a claim, it would not have been properly before the district court because she had not asserted it in state court and hence had not exhausted her state court remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b). <em>See, e.g., Twitty v. Smith, </em>614 F.2d 325, 331 (2d Cir.1979). Finally, the pretrial publicity relied on by Jarrett preceded even the <em>Wade </em>hearing. The magistrate noted that Hyland did not identify Jarrett at that hearing. Since his testimony at the first hearing following that publicity was about as equivocal as had been his initial selection of Jarrett\u2019s photograph, it was not reasonable to infer that that publicity made him more certain at a later stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">4. <em>The Failure to Conduct a Linewp</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The failure of the prosecution to hold a lineup was also not a factor that should have been considered in assessing the suggestiveness of the procedures that were used. We have previously held that if the procedures actually used were not impermissibly suggestive, \u201cit is immaterial whether any other or different procedures could have been pursued.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Henderson, </em>555 F.2d at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">5. <em>\u201cStick to Your Guns </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Finally, we turn to the fact that on the day Hyland testified, the prosecutor told him to \u201cstick to [his] guns.\u201d There are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>several problems with reliance on this statement as a basis for suppressing Hyland\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">First, while obviously it would be preferable for any prosecutor\u2019s preparation of his trial witnesses to be phrased in a way that does not appear to exalt steadfastness over accuracy, the statement here is not of a type we have found sufficiently suggestive to warrant suppression of an in-court identification. <em>See United States v. Danzey, </em>594 F.2d 905, 910, 915-16 (2d Cir.) (though preferable for prosecutor, in second showing of photos, to ask witness to pick out the person she had seen rather than to \u201csee if [she] could still pick out the same person as [she] picked out the last time,\u201d this phrasing was not impermissibly suggestive), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 951, 99 S.Ct. 2179, 60 L.Ed.2d 1056 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Second, the stick-to-your-guns statement need not be interpreted as urging Hyland to adhere willy-nilly to his prior identification of Jarrett but could have been understood simply as urging him to adhere to what he believed was true and not to feel compelled to say anything he did not believe. Hyland in fact introduced the prosecutor\u2019s statement in just that way: \u201cHe just told me to say what I thought on my mind and stick to my guns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Third, the problem in Hyland\u2019s trial testimony was not that he stuck to his prior statements but that he went beyond them to display certainty that the driver he had seen at the Seaway station was female and to deny that he had ever said he was uncertain. Hyland\u2019s emphatic certainty at trial in contrast to his prior consistent equivocation would not appear to have been induced by the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The urging to \u201cstick to your guns\u201d does not appear to implore the witness to invent new guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Fourth, it is highly doubtful that Hyland\u2019s increased certainty at trial played a significant role in the jury\u2019s deliberations, since his flamboyant statements of certainty were made only with respect to his belief that the driver was a girl, not that the girl was Jarrett. He reiterated the differences between Jarrett as she appeared at trial and the girl he had seen, confirmed that he had selected two photographs that looked like the girl he had seen, and refused to \u201cstake [his] life\u201d on the proposition that Jarrett was the girl he had seen. Given the many references in Hyland\u2019s written statement to the driver as a female and the testimony of other trial witnesses that they had seen a girl at the Seaway station at the pertinent time, it is difficult to conclude that Hyland\u2019s attempt to recant his initial expression of uncertainty over the driver\u2019s sex had any substantial impact on the jury. We note that the jury apparently took its responsibility as factfinder with appropriate seriousness, asking for a rereading of the testimony of both Hyland and Hojnacki, the latter having strongly endorsed the accuracy of Hyland\u2019s written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Finally, we note that Hyland\u2019s identification of Jarrett at trial <em>preceded </em>his revelation on cross-examination of the prosecutor\u2019s stick-to-your-guns statement. Thus, that statement was not argued to the trial court in advance as a possible basis for preventing Hyland\u2019s in-court identification. Since the record does not indicate that after disclosure of the statement Jarrett\u2019s counsel made either a motion to strike Hyland\u2019s identification or a motion for a mistrial on this ground, there was no occasion for the trial court to exclude Hyland\u2019s testimony on this basis. We mention this not so much to suggest that there was a procedural default as to indicate that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was probably viewed as trivial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">We have reviewed all of the other grounds relied on for the proposition that the use of impermissibly suggestive procedures should have foreclosed Hyland\u2019s in-court identification of Jarrett and have concluded that none, singly or in combination, warranted such an exclusion. The district court concluded that the stick-to-your-guns statement \u201cin itself would not justify setting aside the conviction.\u201d We agree and we reverse the granting of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The judgment of the district court is reversed. The cause is remanded for the entry of judgment dismissing the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
