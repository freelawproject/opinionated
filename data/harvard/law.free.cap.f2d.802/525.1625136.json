After pursuing its administrative remedies,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NTEU received the Service\u2019s final decisions on November 10, 1982, announcing that nineteen plans would be withheld and forty-four released with substantial redactions. The agency\u2019s decision<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was claimed to be based on section 552(b)(2) of the FOIA, under which information \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency\u201d is exempt from disclosure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> NTEU brought an action to challenge these denials,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the District Court dismissed the suit upon USCS\u2019s motion for summary judgment, 602 F.Supp. 469 (1984).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That decision is now before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Appellants first contend that the affidavits submitted to the District Court were conclusory and did not \u201cdescribe the documents and the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,\u201d <em>Military Audit Project v. Casey, </em>656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C.Cir.1981), and therefore cannot support a grant of summary judgment under the rule of <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974). The index required by <em>Vaughn </em>is designed to permit adequate adversary testing of the agency\u2019s claimed right to an exemption. <em>Mead Data Central v. United States Department of Air Force, </em>566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>Vaughn, </em>484 F.2d at 828. A claim of exemption will be honored when the agency meets its burden of showing that the withheld records are actually of such a character as to fit one or more of the section 552(b) exemptions. <em>Shaw v. FBI, </em>749 F.2d 58, 61 (D.C.Cir. 1984).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">Upon its review of the agency affidavits, the District Court concluded that they were adequate to satisfy the requirements of <em>Vaughn. </em>We see no reason for disagreeing with that conclusion. The issues in this case were relatively simple and straightforward. All of the documents were withheld under a single exemption. <em>Compare Vaughn, </em>484 F.2d at 827-28. The documents, while numerous, were all of the same general type and all had the same purpose. The agency\u2019s theory regarding each crediting plan was the same: that disclosure would compromise the fairness and reliability of the promotion process and thus have the effect of circumventing agency efforts designed to protect that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">More specifically, the deleted material was described as either (1) \u201cqualifying language used in each criteria to evaluate the experience claimed by each candidate\u201d or (2) specific \u201cexamples of experience under each criteria\u201d which the agency considered relevant to its rating.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These descriptions, when read together with those portions of the crediting plans that were disclosed, provide facts sufficient to sustain a meaningful adversarial process, and they appropriately enabled the District Court to go on to consider whether the described documents qualify as exempt under section 552(b)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>See, e.g., Military Audit Project, </em>656 F.2d at 738; <em>Baez v. United States Department of Justice, </em>647 F.2d 1328, 1335 (D.C.Cir. 1980) .</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Exemption (b)(2) covers materials \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2). The court below analyzed the case under the two-prong test applied to claims for (b)(2) exemptions in <em>Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>670 F.2d 1051, 1074 (D.C.Cir. 1981) <em>(en </em>banc). That test asks (1) whether the document meets a test of predominant internality and (2) whether disclosure would significantly risk circumvention of agency regulations or statutes. We agree with the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Crook-er </em>even though this case does not snugly fit that decision\u2019s reference to agency regulations and statutes. <em>See </em>Part IV, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The <em>Crooker </em>test was a response to the difficulties that had arisen in applying the language of exemption (b)(2) to particular cases. In <em>Crooker </em>itself, for example, the appellant had sought the release of portions of an agent\u2019s training manual from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF). The requested material consisted of instructions to the BATF agents on the conduct of their official duties, and in that respect it was obviously related to \u201cpersonnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d The more difficult question, however, was whether the material related <em>solely </em>to internal personnel rules and practices, and in that respect it was illustrative of many exemption (b)(2) issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">On the one hand, as we acknowledged in <em>Crooker, </em>every action of the federal government has in one sense \u201csome effect on the public-at-large,\u201d <em>Crooker, </em>670 F.2d at 1073, for \u201c \u2018there are few events in our society today that occur without so much as a tiny ripple effect outside their area of prime impact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1073 <em>(quoting Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>523 F.2d 1136, 1150 (D.C.Cir.1975) (Leventhal, J., concurring)). Thus, government records that relate to the management of agency employees will almost never qualify as records \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency\u201d if the statutory language is narrowly construed. On the other hand, however, this Court was able in <em>Crooker </em>to conclude from the legislative history of the FOIA that Congress intended the exemption to be broad enough to cover personnel rules and practices that are \u201cnot \u2018the subject of legitimate public interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1065.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On this basis, we held that an agency may withhold material under exemption (b)(2) if it is able to demonstrate that (1) the material is \u201cpredominantly internal!]\u201d and (2) \u201cdisclosure [would] significantly riskQ circumvention of agency regulations or statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">The parties to the instant appeal agree that the <em>Crooker </em>test governs this case, but they disagree as to the appropriate result when <em>Crooker </em>is applied to these facts. Before addressing the legal questions raised by the parties, it is useful to analyze the practical reasons underlying USCS\u2019s reluctance to disclose the plans, as well as NTEU\u2019s policy arguments in favor of disclosure. <em>See Ginsburg, Feldman and Bress v. Federal Energy Administration, </em>591 F.2d 717, 730 (D.C.Cir.), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g by an equally divided en banc court, </em>591 F.2d 752 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 906, 99 S.Ct. 1994, 60 L.Ed.2d 374 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">The Service regards crediting plans as being tantamount to lists of examination questions, and it argues that disclosure of the plans would undercut the personnel evaluation process they are designed to assist, providing those who have access to the crediting plans (through NTEU or otherwise) with an unfair advantage over oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>er applicants. NTEU argues, on the other hand, that the plans are simply akin to lists of job requirements pertinent to particular positions. In its view, because the plans are designed only to elicit information about an applicant\u2019s actual experience and demonstrated abilities,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> advance knowledge of a particular plan will not provide him with any special advantage. On the contrary, familiarity with the plans by the general pool of applicants will enhance the evaluation process by encouraging each applicant to point out to the examiners those elements of his background that are relevant to the position he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The crediting plans are designed to measure actual experience and proven ability; it would seem to follow, in theory, that advance knowledge of their content should not affect the rating of the candidates. But the theoretical assumption is valid only if all applicants can be depended upon to be meticulously correct in describing their past experience and their quantified or quantifiable abilities. The uncontradicted affidavits of agency officials lead to the conclusion, however, that advance knowledge of the plans by applicants would allow and induce at least some of them to embellish \u2014 or perhaps even fabricate \u2014 their backgrounds to suit the appropriate crediting plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the indications are that the USCS does not possess the human and financial resources needed to identify fabrications, to verify their falsity, and to pursue the offending applicants with appropriate legal action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed, it appears that a great many of the elements in a crediting plan are capable of embellishment by an applicant in a manner that is not strictly fraudulent, or that cannot be proven to be fraudulent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">On this basis, we agree with the USCS contention<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that release of the plans creates a significant risk that the Service\u2019s applicant evaluation program will be seriously compromised, in violation of a cornerstone of the congressionally mandated merit system' principle: that selection and advancement in the federal civil service should be based solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition \u201cwhich assures that all receive equal opportunity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">NTEU argues that this risk, even if it does exist, does not sustain application of the section (b)(2) exemption under <em>Crooker </em>unless the Service is also able to demonstrate that \u201cdisclosure significantly risks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>circumvention of agency regulations or statutes.\u201d The Service contends that such a regulation exists in subchapter S6-1 of the Federal Personnel Manual Supp. 335-1 (Aug. 20, 1982), which instructs supervisory personnel in the federal service to identify</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">examination materials (such as ... crediting plans) ... which, if exposed to unauthorized persons, might provide unfair advantage to some candidates or otherwise compromise the ... selection procedure____<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Manual further specifies that such materials \u201cshall be controlled and safeguarded because their release would be detrimental to the validity and fairness of the evaluation process____\u201d From the foregoing discussion of the risks created by release of the crediting plans, it is apparent that disclosure in this case would run counter to the directive of subchapter S6-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Nevertheless, we do not regard these regulatory provisions as dispositive of the issue before us for the reason that an agency cannot be regarded as having satisfied the second prong of the <em>Crooker </em>test simply by promulgating a regulation<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> designating certain material as confidential. If such a regulation were sufficient, the result would be a de facto abdication by the courts of their responsibility to review <em>de novo </em>agency actions withholding documents. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B); <em>Weisberg v. Department of Justice, </em>489 F.2d 1195, 1202 (D.C.Cir.1973) (en <em>banc), cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 993, 94 S.Ct. 2405, 40 L.Ed.2d 772 (1974). What a court obviously must do in this context is to determine whether the release of purportedly confidential material risks circumvention of some statute or regulation other than the one designating the material as confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Normally, an agency will be unable to satisfy the <em>Crooker </em>test unless it identifies such a statute or regulation and persuades the reviewing court that disclosure of the disputed documents will facilitate conduct that the statute or regulation proscribes. That was the case in <em>Crooker </em>itself, where disclosure of manuals used by law enforcement personnel would have made it easier for criminals to violate statutes regulating the use of tobacco, alcohol and firearms. <em>Accord Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. v. Smith, </em>721 F.2d 828 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Hardy v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, </em>631 F.2d 653 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Caplan v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, </em>587 F.2d 544 (2d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">Although the Service cannot here rely on a specific statute or regulation (other than subchapter S6-1 discussed above), the instant case is nevertheless factually very similar to <em>Crooker </em>and controlled by that decision. There, it was found that disclosure of the investigative strategy used by BATF agents to detect criminal violators would make that detection more difficult. Here, it is apparent that disclosure of the evaluative criteria used by USCS personnel will make it more difficult correctly to evaluate job candidates. Like <em>Crooker, </em>this is a case where disclosure of certain government documents would quickly render those documents obsolete for the purpose for which they were designed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Freedom of Information Act\u2019s nine exemptions balance a strong public policy in favor of disclosure against \u201cthe legitimate but limited need for secrecy to maintain the effective operation of Government.\u201d <em>Crooker, </em>670 F.2d at 1062. Where disclosure of a particular set of documents would render those documents operationally useless, the <em>Crooker </em>analysis is satisfied whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>not the agency identifies a specific statute or regulation threatened by disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Obviously, the operations for which such documents are designed must themselves be legitimate activities of government, authorized by statute. Exemption (b)(2) emphatically does not authorize the promulgation of \u201csecret law\u201d governing members of the public, and such documents would be unprotected whether or not disclosure threatened to make them operationally obsolete. <em>See Department of the Air Force, </em>425 U.S. at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 1603; <em>Crooker, </em>670 F.2d at 1073. That is not the case here, however. The crediting plans do not regulate the conduct of members of the public; rather, they are concerned only with the core personnel functions of hiring and promotion. Evaluative criteria of this type have customarily been safeguarded in both the public and private sectors, and it seems plain that Congress meant to protect such material under exemption (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Whatever else may be included within exemption (b)(2), we are of the view that Congress meant to include materials traditionally used by personnel officials to evaluate candidates for job promotion. First, these materials fall squarely within the statutory language: matters \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d Although, as we have noted, appointment decisions, like any government activity, have some impact upon the public, the appointments of individual members of the lower federal bureaucracy is primarily a question of \u201cinternal\u201d significance for the agencies involved.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As a number of district courts have noted, the management of its own employees is a matter of intra-agency functioning and is the agency\u2019s responsibility.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The crediting plans at issue here are indisputably concerned with \u201cpersonnel rules and practices\u201d under even the narrowest reading of that phrase. Second, the legislative history of the FOIA, while not without some ambiguity, supports the view that \u201cmanuals setting forth guidelines for auditing or inspection procedures should not be released to the public.\u201d <em>Crooker, </em>670 F.2d at 1063.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Third, it is entirely consistent with sound policy objectives and common sense to conclude that Congress did not intend to mandate the release of evaluative criteria that are commonly treated as confidential by personnel departments in both the public and private sectors.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">The District Court correctly decided that the crediting plans are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, and its decision is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\">.

For example, a crediting plan for the position of Customs Inspector, obtained by appellant in 1979 from the Miami, Florida office of USCS, asks evaluators to rate the applicant\u2019s \"ability to interpret and apply laws and regulations\u2019\u2019 as either excellent, good, moderate, limited or poor. The plan gives \"typical examples\" of factors in an applicant\u2019s background that would support each rating, such as a baccalaureate degree (indicative of excellent ability) or experience in a \"position[ ] which required [the] applicant to obtain and apply technical information\u201d (indicative of good ability).

An adversary cannot challenge, and a court cannot review, the agency's claim of exemption without (1) an adequate description of the records; (2) a plain statement of the exemptions relied upon to withhold each record; and (3) arguments that relate the documents to the claimed exemption.

A crediting plan consists of two basic parts: (1) a set of evaluative criteria which reflect the specific knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics deemed necessary for the successful performance of a particular job; and (2) measurement devices used to determine to what extent a candidate possesses the requisite criteria deemed necessary for successful performance. Only the second part is in dispute here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">. Thus, B. James Fritz, a Customs personnel official, submitted an affidavit in which he stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">In the crediting plans released ..., examples of experience were withheld which consist of responsibilities and assignments concerning, for example, the complexity of duties, the degree of supervision, the levels and types of personal interactions, which, if released, could be claimed by any cand\u00edate with impunity because the candidates\u2019 responses would not be verifiable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">J.A. at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Similarly, William R.

The Supreme Court also addressed that history in <em>Department of the Air Force, </em>425 U.S. at 362-70, 96 S.Ct. at 1599-1603, but declined to decide whether circumvention of statutes or regulations is a necessary ingredient of the exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b645-14\">. That conclusion is buttressed by the merit principles codified in such statutes as 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(1), which provides that \u201cselection and advancement [of federal employees] should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
