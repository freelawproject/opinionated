We find no merit in Whitley\u2019s contentions, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-5\">In its opinion denying Whitley\u2019s direct appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court fully summarized the facts, as they were proved at trial, concerning the brutal murder with which Whitley was charged and convicted. See <em>Whitley v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 70-71, 286 S.E.2d 162, 164-65 (1982). Consequently, we need not recount those facts in great detail here. Suffice it to say that Whitley brutally attacked his neighbor, Phoebe Parsons, age 63, in her home in Fairfax County, Virginia. He first strangled Mrs. Parsons with his hands, and then with a rope; he next cut her throat with his pocket knife; and then, while the victim was near death, or immediately thereafter, Whitley sexually abused her with two umbrellas. The evidence also showed that Whitley on that occasion robbed Mrs. Parsons of various items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-18\">In a bifurcated trial in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, a jury convicted Whitley of capital murder in the commission of a robbery, while armed with a deadly weapon. See VA.CODE \u00a7 18.2-31(d) (1982). The jury fixed Whitley\u2019s punishment at death. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed both the conviction and the sentence in <em>Whitley v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 286 S.E.2d 162 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court subsequently denied Whitley\u2019s petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>a writ of certiorari. <em>Whitley v. Virginia, </em>459 U.S. 882, 103 S.Ct. 181, 74 L.Ed.2d 148 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"ANhf\">On May 27, 1983, Whitley filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>court dismissed the majority of Whitley\u2019s claims due to his failure to raise them at trial or on direct appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 27, 1984, following an evidentiary hearing on certain of the issues,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the circuit court dismissed in its entirety Whitley\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArPV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>17.

See <em>Whitley v. Bass, </em>No. 84-1767 (Va. Apr. 16, 1985) (citing <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (U.S. Jan. 21, 1985), and <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066-67, 80 L.Ed. 674 (1984)); see also note 24 <em>infra. </em>The U.S. Supreme Court subsequently denied Whitley\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari on November 12, 1985. <em>Whitley v. Bair, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 398, 88 L.Ed.2d 350 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-7\">On November 27, 1985, Whitley filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In this petition, Whitley reraised nineteen of the claims that he had previously raised in his state habeas corpus petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court concluded that the majority of Whitley\u2019s claims were not cognizable in federal court because Whitley had procedurally defaulted on the claims either at the trial level, on direct appeal, or in his state habeas corpus action. The district court held, therefore, that under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), Whitley\u2019s procedural defaults in the state proceedings were a procedural bar to consideration, in the subsequent federal habeas corpus proceeding, of those claims on which he had defaulted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1573-13\">The district court considered five of Whitley\u2019s claims on the merits, primary among them being Whitley\u2019s claim that his court-appointed trial counsel violated Whitley\u2019s right to reasonably effective assistance of counsel by failing adequately to investigate, prepare, present, and argue evidence at the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On this claim, the district court, on the same record as was in the state circuit court and without another evidentiary hearing, did not accept the state court finding and ruled that Whitley\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s performance during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial was outside the range of competence required of attorneys in capital cases. Nevertheless, applying the two-part test that the Supreme Court enunciated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the district court held that his attorneys\u2019 errors in the case were not sufficiently prejudicial to Whitley\u2019s defense to warrant granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>him relief on this claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With regard to Whitley\u2019s remaining four claims,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the district court rejected each on their merits and dismissed Whitley\u2019s habeas corpus petition. Upon dismissing Whitley\u2019s habeas corpus petition, the district court denied his application for a stay of execution and refused to grant him a certificate of probable cause to appeal.I. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1574-4\">On December 12, 1985, this court considered Whitley\u2019s application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal and for a stay of execution, both of which were granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1574-5\">In his appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas corpus petition, Whitley raises two principal issues: whether Whitley\u2019s trial counsel failed to provide Whitley with constitutionally effective legal representation at the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial, and whether the district court properly ruled that substantive claims that Whitley had not appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court, either on direct appeal or in his state habeas corpus appeal, were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action under the doctrine set forth in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Initially, we consider Whitley\u2019s allegation that his trial counsel ineffectively represented Whitley at the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-7\">Whitley\u2019s primary contention is that the district court erred when it concluded that Whitley\u2019s court-appointed counsel provided Whitley with constitutionally effective representation during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. Specifically, Whitley contends that his trial counsel failed adequately to investigate possible mitigating circumstances to present to the jury during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. As a result, Whitley contends that he had no defense in this crucial phase of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-12\">During Whitley\u2019s state habeas corpus proceeding, the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on certain issues relating to Whitley\u2019s representation during the sentencing phase of his trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At that hearing, Whitley presented evidence of mitigating circumstances that he claimed his trial counsel could have discovered and presented during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial had counsel investigated Whitley\u2019s case adequately. This evidence included information that Whitley\u2019s trial counsel could have presented to the sentencing jury through the testimony of Whitley's employer, Gary Monahan, as to Whitley's alcohol consumption in the days preceding the murder, the testimony of Patricia Soberg, Whitley\u2019s sister, as to the tragic circumstances of Whitley\u2019s childhood, and psychiatric and like evidence of Whitley's organic brain dysfunction and his antisocial personality disorder. Because his trial counsel was unaware of this potentially mitigating information, Whitley contends that they were unable to prepare or present an effective defense during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>Whitley concludes, the district court erred in holding that, despite the unreasonability of trial counsel\u2019s performance, there was no resulting prejudice to Whitley, and, therefore, that Whitley\u2019s representation during sentencing was not constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-4\">As noted above, the Supreme Court has established a two-part test for determining whether an attorney\u2019s performance during trial was so ineffective as to deprive a criminal defendant of his sixth amendment right to counsel. See <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The first part of the test requires a defendant to show that his counsel was deficient by identifying the counsel\u2019s acts or omissions that the defendant alleges were not the result of reasonable professional judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 690,104 S.Ct. at 2066. Indulging a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, the district court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, as viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct and not through hindsight, the defendant has carried his burden of showing that his counsel\u2019s acts or omissions fell outside the range of reasonably competent assistance. <em>Id.; </em>see also <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>- U.S. -, -, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2473-75, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-6\">If counsel\u2019s performance was outside the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases, the defendant must then establish that any deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance were actually prejudicial to the defense. See <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066-67, 80 L.Ed.2d 674: \u201cAn error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d Such a showing requires the defendant to establish that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. Thus, if a defendant challenges a death sentence such as the one at issue in this case, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that absent counsel\u2019s errors, the sentencer, including an appellate court to the extent it may weigh evidence, would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant the imposition of a death sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-9\">In this case, the district court found that Whitley had met the first part of the test set forth in <em>Strickland. </em>More specifically, the district court found that defense counsel\u2019s failure to investigate potentially mitigating circumstances in Whitley\u2019s background, including Whitley\u2019s psychiatric history and his traumatic childhood, constituted performance outside the wide range of acceptable conduct for counsel in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-10\">Although the district court did find Whitley\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance to be unreasonably deficient, it also found that such deficiency did not actually prejudice Whitley\u2019s defense. Weighing each piece of additional mitigating evidence that Whitley proffered against the potentially negative evidence accompanying it, the district court found that the cumulative effect of this evidence was simply to add to the weight of aggravating circumstances, thereby tipping \u201cthe scales more drastically in favor of the sentence of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-11\">On appeal, Whitley contends that the district court erred in concluding that his attorneys\u2019 deficiencies at trial did not prejudice his defense, arguing \u00bfhat competent defense counsel could have minimized the negative aspects of the testimony of those witnesses who could have been called in mitigation but whom Whitley\u2019s trial counsel failed to present during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that the district court erred in concluding that Whitley\u2019s trial counsel were constitutionally deficient in their representation of Whitley during the sentencing phase of his trial, arguing that the district court\u2019s finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>no prejudice rendered a finding on the performance component of the <em>Strickland </em>test superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">We agree with the Commonwealth. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that there was no prejudice to Whitley\u2019s defense as a result of his attorneys\u2019 allegedly deficient performance during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. Although we are by no means convinced that Whitley\u2019s attorneys\u2019 performance during sentencing was outside the wide range of competence expected of counsel in criminal cases,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as a result of our affirming the holding of the district court that there was no prejudice to Whitley\u2019s defense, we do not decide that issue. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, at 697,104 S.Ct. 2052, 2069-70, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, plainly states that a court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining prejudice that defendant allegedly suffered as a result of alleged deficiencies, and, if it is easier to dispose of an ineffective assistance claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, a court should follow that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">With respect to the evidence of Whitley\u2019s troubled family history that his trial counsel allegedly failed to develop or present adequately, a review of the record indicates that Whitley\u2019s sister, Patricia Soberg, was willing to testify on Whitley\u2019s behalf as to the abuse and neglect that he suffered as a child. This testimony would have indicated, among other things, that Whitley\u2019s father had abandoned the family while Whitley was an infant, that Whitley\u2019s mother drank heavily, that she beat her children with a belt, sometimes knotted with a buckle, that she left Whitley in the care of his sister from the time he was a small child, that Whitley left school at age 15, that Whitley\u2019s family was mired in poverty, that Whitley had injured his head in a train accident while a child, and that Whitley\u2019s older brother frequently beat Whitley and exercised an undue criminal influence on him during his adolescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-10\">Admittedly, such testimony could have had a mitigating effect on Whitley\u2019s sentencing jury. In addition to this potentially mitigating information about Whitley\u2019s background, however, Mrs. Soberg\u2019s testimony also included information that was very damaging to Whitley\u2019s defense at sentencing. For example, Mrs. Soberg\u2019s testimony would have disclosed information relating to Whitley\u2019s extensive criminal background of which Whitley\u2019s trial counsel had scrupulously and successfully kept the jury unaware throughout the course of the entire trial. Mrs. Soberg\u2019s testimony also would have included information about Whitley\u2019s prior abuse of elderly women, as well as information as to Whitley\u2019s alleged rape of his own mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-11\">Whitley now contends that although there were negative aspects to the testimony that Mrs. Soberg could have presented during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>trial, had trial counsel called her to testify, this court should not consider those negative aspects because they were predicated on hearsay and thus inadmissible. We do not conclude that the negative aspects of Mrs. Soberg\u2019s testimony absolutely would have been admitted during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. We do concur with the district court, however, that there was a strong possibility that the negative aspects of Mrs. Soberg\u2019s testimony would have been admissible (some of them certainly were), and that, if admitted, the negative aspects of her testimony would have far outweighed the mitigating effect on the jury that her testimony might have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-4\">Whitley also contends that certain psychiatric and like testimony presented during his state habeas corpus proceeding would have been persuasive to the jury in mitigation of his sentence if his trial counsel had presented it during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. Dr. John D. Follansbee, a psychiatrist, and Dr. T. Richard Saunders, a clinical psychologist, testified on Whitley\u2019s behalf during Whitley\u2019s state habeas corpus proceeding. Dr. Saunders testified that he had found evidence that Whitley had an organic brain dysfunction that impaired Whitley\u2019s ability to reason and make judgments. Dr. Follansbee testified that Whitley had an antisocial personality disorder and that this disorder, when combined with Whitley\u2019s organic brain dysfunction, accentuated Whitley\u2019s inability to control his extreme impulses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">Once again, the mitigating aspects of this evidence are markedly outweighed by the negative information that would have accompanied it. Thus, although Dr. Saunders testified as to Whitley\u2019s mild organic brain dysfunction during Whitley\u2019s state habeas corpus proceeding, in statements that he made prior to this testimony, Dr. Saunders made repeated references to Whitley\u2019s sadistic behavior patterns. For example, as the district court noted, in a report dated April 18, 1984, Dr. Saunders stated that, \u201c[sjadistic treatment of other people and dealing with other people in ways which inspire anxiety or guilt are quite common to [Whitley];\u201d that Whitley \u201cseems to approach others in an extraordinarily aggressive, uncontrolled affective state that is exceptionally vicious and hostile;\u201d and that Whitley exhibits \u201ca pattern of fear-induction and anxiety induction in other people, both showing a willingness to respond aggressively and actually doing so when it suits his purpose.\u201d Dr. Saunders also mentioned in his report Whitley\u2019s extensive criminal history, including Whitley\u2019s recent conviction for raping a male hitchhiker, as well as Whitley\u2019s alleged rape of his mother, and his alleged sexual misconduct with his eleven-year-old stepdaughter. We find that this negative testimony from Dr. Saunders would have far outweighed any positive benefit that Whitley would have obtained in mitigation of his sentence had the jury been informed of Whitley\u2019s organic brain dysfunction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1577-9\">We further conclude that Dr. Follansbee\u2019s testimony would have been similarly ineffective in mitigation of Whitley\u2019s sentence. Thus, although Dr. Follansbee discussed in his testimony the effect of Whitley\u2019s organic brain dysfunction on Whitley\u2019s ability to control his extreme impulses, he also made numerous negative comments about Whitley\u2019s personality and background that would inevitably have come out during the Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination had Whitley\u2019s trial counsel put Dr. Follansbee on the stand during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. In a report submitted into evidence in the state habeas corpus proceeding, Dr. Follansbee noted many of the same negative incidents to which Dr. Saunders had alluded in his report of April 18, 1984, and also included a reference to an incident in prison in which Whitley had brutally beaten another inmate and had ended the assault by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>wedging a broom stick in the inmate\u2019s rectum. We agree with the district court that these negative aspects of Dr. Follansbee\u2019s testimony outweigh the mitigating effect that his testimony might have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-4\">In his argument on appeal, Whitley relies principally on a recent unpublished opinion of this court and on a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which cases held that a habeas corpus petitioner had been denied effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of petitioner\u2019s trial. See <em>Clark v. Townley, </em>791 F.2d 925 (4th Cir.1986) (unpublished); <em>Pickens v. Lockhart, </em>714 F.2d 1455 (8th Cir.1983). In both cases, the courts found that the defendants\u2019 attorneys' failure adequately to explore and present mitigating evidence demonstrating defendants\u2019 troubled backgrounds was unreasonable representation and prejudicial to the defendants\u2019 defense at sentencing. Thus, each court concluded that the defendants\u2019 were entitled to resentencing. Whitley now contends , that these two decisions constitute persuasive authority for a finding that Whitley\u2019s defense at sentencing was prejudiced by his trial attorneys\u2019 failure to develop and use the potentially mitigating evidence described above. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-5\">The Supreme Court has recognized that the determination of whether an attorney's unreasonable performance prejudiced his client\u2019s defense is one that must be judged according to the circumstances of each case. See <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067-68, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. On the facts of this case, in particular those overwhelming facts relating to the heinous nature of the crime with which Whitley was charged and convicted, as well as the fact that any mitigating evidence that Whitley\u2019s trial counsel might have developed and presented would have been accompanied by additional aggravating evidence, we conclude that Whitley\u2019s trial attorneys\u2019 alleged errors in failing to develop such mitigating evidence did not result in such prejudice to Whitley\u2019s defense at sentencing that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s alleged unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. See <em>Moore v. Maggio, </em>740 F.2d 308, 318 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Briley v. Bass, </em>750 F.2d 1238, 1248 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1855, 85 L.Ed.2d 152 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-8\">In sum, we find that the negative aspects of any testimony that Whitley now contends his trial counsel failed to present during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial far outweighed any positive mitigating effect that such testimony might have had. Thus, we find that the district court correctly determined that there was no prejudice to Whitley as a result of his trial counsel\u2019s alleged deficiencies during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling on that ground. We reiterate that we do not reach the question of whether or not Whitley\u2019s trial counsel actually were deficient in their representation of Whitley at this phase of the proceedings, and we emphasize that we do not in any way adopt the district court\u2019s finding in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-10\">As his second point on appeal, Whitley contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that the majority of Whitley\u2019s claims in his federal habeas corpus petition were barred from consideration in federal court under the doctrine of procedural default set forth in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes. </em>Whitley argues that such error necessitates a remand to the district court for consideration of these claims on their merits. We conclude that the district court correctly disposed of these claims on procedural grounds and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in this regard as well.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>In his federal habeas corpus petition, Whitley raised numerous issues that he had previously raised in his state habeas corpus petition, but that he had not raised at trial or on direct appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whitley did not appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court, moreover, the circuit court\u2019s adverse ruling on the majority of these claims in Whitley\u2019s state habeas corpus proceeding.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">In addition to this large category of claims, Whitley also reraised in his federal habeas corpus petition one claim that he had raised at trial, on direct appeal, and in his state habeas corpus petition, but not in his appeal from the circuit court\u2019s denial of his state habeas corpus petition.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, there were also in Whitley\u2019s federal habeas corpus petition three claims that Whitley had raised on direct appeal and in his state habeas corpus petition, but not at his trial, nor in his state habeas appeal.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1580-13\">The federal district court considered to be procedurally barred under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>any claim which either had not been presented to the Virginia Supreme Court or had been held by the state courts to be procedurally barred.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, of the nineteen claims that Whitley raised in his federal habeas corpus petition, the district court considered only five on the merits,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> dismissing each as being without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>In this appeal, the only substantive ruling that Whitley challenges concerns the district court\u2019s disposition of Whitley\u2019s claim that his trial counsel allegedly failed to investigate and present potentially mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of Whitley\u2019s trial. We have in this opinion already affirmed the district court\u2019s disposition of this claim. Because Whitley does not appeal from the district court\u2019s disposition on the merits of his other four claims, we need not, and do not, address them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-5\">Whitley does appeal from the district court\u2019s disposition of the majority of his claims on the ground of procedural default.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In particular, Whitley argues that the district court erroneously applied the doctrine of procedural default to those of his claims that he raised in his state habeas corpus petition, but did not appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court in his state habeas appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Whitley raises three separate arguments in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-12\">First, in a footnote in his brief, Whitley argues that the district court erred in concluding that the doctrine of procedural default is applicable to a federal habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s failure to raise issues on appeal in a state postconviction proceeding. Second, Whitley argues that he did not default on his state habeas corpus claims by failing to appeal them to the Virginia Supreme Court because he complied with applicable Virginia procedure, thereby preserving his claims for federal habeas corpus review. Third, and finally, Whitley claims that he can show \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d for his failure to appeal any defaulted claim, thereby preserving for federal review those claims for which he can make such a showing, see <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. at 87, 97 S.Ct. at 2506-07, and that he should be given an opportunity to make such a showing on remand to the district court.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We consider each of these arguments separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>A. <em>Applicability of Procedural Default Bar to Claims that Whitley Raised in State Habeas Corpus Petition, but Failed to Raise in State Habeas Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1582-4\">In his argument on this point, Whitley recognizes, as did the district court, that this circuit has already decided that failure to appeal claims disposed of by a state habeas trial court constitutes a procedural bar to further federal review of such claims. See <em>Mason v. Procunier, </em>748 F.2d 852 (4th Cir.1984). In a brief opinion in <em>Mason, </em>another Virginia death penalty case, this court affirmed a federal district court\u2019s conclusion that the doctrine of procedural default barred federal review of any claim that the petitioner had raised in his state habeas corpus petition, but had failed to appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 853. Relying on the brevity of the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mason, </em>and on dictum in a recent decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, see <em>Francis v. Spraggins, </em>720 F.2d 1190, 1192 n. 3 (11th Cir.1983) (noting that extension of procedural default doctrine to defaults at state habeas corpus level was undecided in that circuit and that court thought the question might raise serious policy questions perhaps best left to Congress), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1059, 105 S.Ct. 1776, 84 L.Ed.2d 835 (1984),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Whitley now argues that our decision in <em>Mason </em>is both casual and inappropriate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-5\">In the first place, the holding of the court in <em>Mason </em>with regard to the procedural default issue constitutes circuit precedent which we follow. In the second place, our conclusion in <em>Mason </em>is supported by quite recent Supreme Court reasoning. A State\u2019s procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack. See <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2646-48, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). And, as the Supreme Court has stated in another context, the concerns of comity and finality which underpin <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>and its progeny are virtually identical regardless of the timing of a petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with legitimate state rules of procedure. See <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 2665-67, 91 L.Ed.2d 434 (1986). These concerns cause us to conclude, even apart from our previous decision in <em>Mason, </em>that the doctrine of procedural default should apply in state postconviction appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-12\">B. <em>Whitley\u2019s Compliance with Virginia\u2019s Procedural Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1582-13\">In his second argument with regard to the procedural default issue, Whitley contends that the district court misinterpreted Virginia\u2019s procedural default requirements for the preservation of issues for appeal. As a result, Whitley further contends that the district court erred in holding that Whitley violated state procedural rules by failing to appeal his defaulted claims in his state habeas appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-14\">There are two Virginia procedural rules that are relevant to Whitley\u2019s appeal in this regard: Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:21, and the rule of <em>Slayton v. Parrigan, </em>215 Va. 27, 205 S.E.2d 680 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1108, 95 S.Ct. 780, 42 L.Ed.2d 804 (1975). Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:21, in effect at the time of Whitley\u2019s trial and state habeas corpus proceeding,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1582-15\">The petition for appeal shall contain assignments of error____ Error will not be sustained to any ruling below unless the objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable this court to attain the ends of justice. Only errors assigned in the petition for appeal will be noticed by this Court and no error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>not so assigned will be admitted as a ground for reversal of a decision below. An assignment of error which merely states that the judgment is contrary to the law and the evidence is not sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgR\">VA.S.CT.R. 5:21 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-5\">The Virginia Supreme Court has held Rule 5:21 to be applicable in both civil and criminal cases. See <em>Peterson v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 302 S.E.2d 520, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1004, 104 S.Ct. 202, 78 L.Ed.2d 176 (1983) (death penalty case); <em>First Charter Land Corp. v. Middle Atl. Dredging, Inc., </em>218 Va. 304, 237 S.E.2d 145 (1977). This court has held that a federal habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the contemporaneous objection requirement embodied in Rule 5:21 is a legitimate ground for the application of the procedural default doctrine to bar a federal court\u2019s consideration of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims. <em>Frazier v. Weatherholtz, </em>572 F.2d 994, 997 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 876, 99 S.Ct. 215, 58 L.Ed.2d 191 (1978); see also <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2665-67. We have previously noted that the Virginia courts have consistently applied this procedural default rule with little flexibility. See <em>Conquest v. Mitchell, </em>618 F.2d 1053, 1056 (4th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-8\">In <em>Slayton v. Parrigan, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court effectively extended the preclusive effect of Rule 5:21 to Virginia habeas corpus proceedings. In <em>Slayton, </em>the defendant was convicted of armed robbery and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal. <em>Slayton v. Parrigan, </em>215 Va. at 27-28, 205 S.E.2d at 681. In his subsequent state habeas corpus petition, the defendant alleged, among other things, that his pretrial identification was impermissibly suggestive and that it had tainted his in-court identification. On appeal from the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s habeas corpus petition, the Virginia Supreme Court declared that the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the pretrial identification, either at trial or on direct appeal, precluded the defendant from raising the issue in his state habeas corpus proceeding. The Virginia Supreme Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1583-11\">The trial and appellate procedures in Virginia are adequate in meeting procedural requirements to adjudicate State and Federal constitutional rights and to supply a suitable record for possible habeas corpus review. A prisoner is not entitled to use habeas corpus to circumvent the trial and appellate processes for an inquiry into an alleged non-jurisdictional defect of a judgment of conviction. Since the issue of the alleged constitutionally improper pretrial identification could have been raised and adjudicated at petitioner\u2019s trial and upon his appeal to this court, Parrigan had no standing to attack his final judgment of conviction by habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1583-12\"><em>Id. </em>215 Va. at 30, 205 S.E.2d at 682.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1583-13\">Whitley now argues that his state habeas counsel\u2019s failure to appeal claims that the circuit court had dismissed under the rule of <em>Slayton v. Parrigan </em>did not violate any Virginia procedural rule. Emphasizing the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Slayton </em>to the effect that a state habeas corpus petitioner lacks <em>standing </em>to raise claims in his state habeas corpus petition that he could have raised at trial or on direct appeal, Whitley contends that the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the majority of his claims fell within the rule of <em>Slayton v. Parrigan </em>deprived Whitley of the standing necessary to appeal the merits of those claims to the Virginia Supreme Court. Thus, Whitley concludes, the absence of those issues from his petition for appeal in his state habeas corpus proceeding cannot be deemed an unwarranted bypass of an available state remedy that would bar a federal court from considering those same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>issues in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-4\">Although superficially appealing, Whitley\u2019s argument in this regard is ultimately unpersuasive for it assumes the correctness of the state circuit court\u2019s finding of procedural default at the trial or on direct appeal, thereby rendering superfluous the question whether Whitley defaulted a second time by failing to appeal the merits of his defaulted claims in his state habeas appeal. Indeed, it is Whitley\u2019s failure to appeal from the circuit court\u2019s finding of procedural default on these claims that exposes the inherent weakness of Whitley\u2019s argument in this regard. If, on appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court had concluded that the circuit court had incorrectly found Whitley\u2019s claims were barred from consideration due to his procedural defaults, then Whitley would have had standing either to have the Virginia Supreme Court consider those claims on their merits in that appeal, or, more likely, to have the circuit court consider them on remand.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Whitley\u2019s failure to appeal from the circuit court's ruling on procedural default, therefore, deprived the Virginia Supreme Court of the opportunity to rule on the merits of his claims. We consider such failure to constitute a violation of the requirements of Rule 5:21, which applies to appeals of all Virginia cases, civil or criminal, and conclude that such violation constitutes a procedural default sufficient to preclude federal court review of the merits of those claims on which the circuit court declared Whitley to have defaulted.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> See <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2665-67 (\u201c \u2018[allowing criminal defendants to deprive state courts of [the] opportunity\u2019 to reconsider previously rejected constitutional claims is fundamentally at odds with the principles of comity that animate <em>Sykes </em>and its progeny\u201d) (quoting <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 130, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1573, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-10\">C. <em>Cause for Whitley\u2019s Failure to Raise His Defaulted Claims and Prejudice Resulting Therefrom.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-11\">Having concluded that the district court correctly determined that Whitley did procedurally default on the majority of his claims in his federal habeas corpus petition, Whitley may still escape the bar of procedural default if he can establish a valid cause for his default and actual prejudice resulting therefrom. See <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>466 U.S. at 87, 97 S.Ct. at 2506-07. Thus, as his third, and final, argument with regard to procedural default, Whitley contends that the district court erroneously concluded that Whitley had failed to establish sufficient cause for his procedural de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>faults to escape <em>Sykes\u2019 </em>procedural bar.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Whitley contends, therefore, that if this court should find, as we have, that Whitley did procedurally default on the majority of his claims, then we should remand the case to the district court for reconsideration of Whitley\u2019s claims of cause for his procedural defaults both at the trial and on direct appeal, as well as for his procedural defaults in his state habeas corpus proceeding. Once again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">The Supreme Court has recently addressed the definition of cause for purposes of the <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>procedural bar. See <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986); see also <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 91 L.Ed.2d 434 (1986). In <em>Carrier, </em>Clifford Carrier was indicted for rape and abduction. Before trial, Carrier\u2019s court-appointed counsel moved for discovery of the victim\u2019s statements concerning her assailants, the vehicle her assailants were driving, and the location at which the rape occurred. The circuit court denied the motion. After Carrier\u2019s conviction, his counsel filed a notice of appeal with the Virginia Supreme Court, which assigned seven errors as bases for reversing Carrier\u2019s conviction. One of these alleged errors was that the trial court erred in denying Carrier\u2019s motion for discovery of the victim\u2019s statements. Carrier\u2019s counsel- subsequently failed to include this claim in Carrier\u2019s petition for appeal, however, thereby precluding the Virginia Supreme Court from considering it pursuant to Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:21.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See <em>Id. </em>at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2642-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-10\">After exhausting his state habeas corpus remedies, Carrier filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court. Carrier included his procedurally defaulted discovery claim in his federal habeas corpus petition. The district court denied the petition, holding that under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>Carrier\u2019s procedural default precluded federal review of Carrier\u2019s discovery claim. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1585-13\">On appeal, Carrier asserted that his procedural default should be excused because his counsel\u2019s failure to include the discovery claim in Carrier\u2019s petition for appeal had been the product of the attorney\u2019s ignorance or oversight, and not a deliberate tactical choice. En banc, this court held that oversight or ignorance that was not deliberately tactical could constitute cause for purposes of the <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>showing. See <em>Carrier v. Hutto, </em>754 F.2d 520 (4th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (en banc), adopting the majority opinion in 724 F.2d 396 (4th Cir.1983), rev\u2019d sub nom, <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). The Supreme Court explicitly rejected this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-16\">In broad language, the Court stated that the question of cause for a procedural default does not turn on whether a habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s counsel erred or on the kind of error that counsel may have made. Rather, the Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1585-17\">[s]o long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>[466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) ], we discern no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default. Instead, we think that the existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense imped<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>ed counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1586-4\"><em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2644-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-6\">The Supreme Court went on to discuss external objective factors that would constitute cause.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> These factors included a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, that government officials interfered with the defense, or that the procedural default was the result of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 4822-23. Finally, to prevent manifest miscarriages of justice, the Court recognized another narrow exception to the procedural default bar, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1D\">in an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal court may grant the writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1586-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 4825.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-8\">Because the Court was not certain whether the victim\u2019s statements actually established Carrier\u2019s innocence, the Court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with that opinion. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-9\">In the present case, Whitley has pointed to no objective factor, external to his defense, either at his trial, on direct appeal, or in his state habeas corpus proceeding, that would constitute cause under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent definition of that term in Carrier.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2665-67 (holding that deliberate tactical decision not to pursue particular claim is very antithesis of kind of circumstance that would warrant excusing defendant\u2019s procedural default). Moreover, although the Supreme Court in <em>Carrier </em>remanded that case for a determination of whether the victim\u2019s statements could have established Carrier\u2019s actual innocence, thereby exploring another possible exception to the requirement of a showing of cause for a procedural default, we do not believe such a remand is called for in this case. Given the extensive record below establishing Whitley\u2019s guilt, including, among other things, Whitley\u2019s own admissions, we do not believe that refusal to consider Whitley\u2019s defaulted claims on their merits carries with it the risk of a manifest miscarriage of justice. See <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2667-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1586-19\">In sum, we hold that the district court properly found the majority of Whitley\u2019s claims to be barred from federal review as a result of Whitley\u2019s procedural defaults either at the trial level, on direct appeal, or in his state habeas corpus proceeding.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We further hold that the district court properly found that Whitley was not denied effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1586-20\">In affirming the district court\u2019s denial of Whitley\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, we note that the seriousness of the penalty imposed on Whitley for his crimes makes us reluctant to dismiss the majority of his claims on the ground of procedural default. Nevertheless, the recent statements of the Supreme Court on the subject persuade us not only that further discussion of the merits of those defaulted claims is unnecessary, but also that such discussion is inappropriate. See <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2665-67 (stating that although federal habeas court must at all times retain power to look beyond state procedural forfeitures, exercise of that power ordinarily is inappropriate unless defendant succeeds in showing both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>cause for his noncompliance with state rule and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional violation); see also <em>id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2667-69 (explicitly rejecting suggestion that principles of <em>Wainwright v.

See <em>Whitley v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. at 72-82, 286 S.E.2d 162. Although the Virginia Supreme Court noted its inclination to rule against Whitley on the merits of his prejudicial closing remarks claim, the court concluded that due to Whitley\u2019s failure to object to the allegedly prejudicial remarks at the time they occurred, Virginia\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule precluded a ruling on the merits on that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 286 S.E.2d 162.

With regard to Whitley's claim that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance during the guilt phase of Whitley\u2019s trial (claim 11), the district court considered all but Whitley\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance during voir dire of the jury to be procedurally barred from consideration by a federal habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-14\">Of the eleven claims on which the Virginia Supreme Court ruled on the merits in Whitley\u2019s direct appeal, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>Whitley raised only three in his federal habeas corpus petition. See note 2, <em>supra </em>(claims 1, 2 &amp; 3). The district court disposed of each of these claims on the merits, a disposition from which Whitley does not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1580-15\">. See note 8, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text; see also note 2, <em>supra </em>(claims 1, 2, 3, 11 (in part) &amp; 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-16\">In ruling on Whitley\u2019s contentions in his state habeas appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court relied on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wainwrigkt v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), to dispose of Whitley\u2019s claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the guilt phase of Whitley\u2019s trial by failing to conduct adequate voir dire of certain jurors concerning their willingness to impose the death penalty. See note 2, <em>supra </em>(claim 11). In <em>Witt, </em>the Supreme Court held that the proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his views on capital punishment is whether the juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror. Given this standard, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals grant of a writ of habeas corpus, holding that the Court of Appeals had focused unduly on the lack of clarity of the questioning of the prospective juror, and on whether the juror\u2019s answers indicated she would automatically vote against the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-17\">By relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Witt </em>in disposing of Whitley\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance during voir dire, the Virginia Supreme Court apparently was holding that it was rejecting Whitley\u2019s contention that his counsel unreasonably represented him by failing to ask certain questions during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>voir dire because the holding in <em>Witt </em>indicated that such questions were not required. Thus, in passing on the merits of Whitley\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, the Virginia Supreme Court also arguably commented on the merits of Whitley\u2019s claim that he was deprived of due process by the trial court\u2019s alleged premature exclusion for cause of several jurors who gave equivocal answers concerning their readiness to impose the death penalty. See note 2, <em>supra </em>(claim 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-7\">If the Virginia Supreme Court did, in fact, comment on the merits of Whitley\u2019s claim 14, then the district court\u2019s conclusion below that Whitley had defaulted on this claim was error. Nevertheless, assuming without deciding that such was the case, we would conclude that such error, if any was committed, was harmless inasmuch as we have examined the substance of Whitley\u2019s claim 14 and have concluded that it is without merit. See <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 429-32, 105 S.Ct. 844, 854-56, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985); <em>Lockhart v.

In an effort to expand the scope of his contentions concerning the procedural default issue, Whitley argues in his brief that the district court held that the majority of Whitley\u2019s claims were procedurally barred not because they were not raised at trial or on direct appeal but rather because Whitley\u2019s state habeas counsel did not include those claims in Whitley\u2019s petition for appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court in Whitley\u2019s state habeas appeal. We do not believe that the district court\u2019s holding was so narrow. Rather, our reading of the district court\u2019s opinion is that the district court considered the majority of Whitley\u2019s claims to be procedurally barred due to Whitley's defaults at trial and on direct appeal, as well as to those defaults in the state habeas proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1581-14\">. Whitley recognizes in his brief that there are numerous issues, later raised, for which his appellate counsel on direct appeal failed to fulfill the requirements of Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:21. Nevertheless, Whitley contends that he should not be barred from raising these claims in his federal habeas corpus petition because he can show valid cause for his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise these claims and prejudice resulting therefrom. Consequently, our ruling with regard to Whitley\u2019s contentions concerning his ability to show a valid cause and prejudice for his defaults at the state habeas level also encompasses Whitley\u2019s contentions concerning claims for which Whitley\u2019s appellate counsel failed to fulfill the requirements of Rule 5:21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1582-8\">. We note in passing that the court in <em>Spraggins </em>explicitly left open the question of the applicability of the doctrine of procedural default to defaults at the appellate level in a state habeas corpus proceeding. See <em>Francis v. Spraggins, </em>720 F.2d at 1192 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1582-17\">. Rule 5:21 was repealed effective August 1, 1985.

The primary exception to the Virginia courts' strict application of the <em>Slayton </em>rule arises in situations in which a state habeas corpus petitioner can show that the issue in question was not raised previously due to the ineffective assistance of petitioner\u2019s trial and appellate counsel. See <em>Slayton v. Parrigan, </em>215 Va. at 29, 205 S.E.2d at 682; see also <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Zahradnick, </em>571 F.2d 1257, 1259, n. 2 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1584-5\">. If, on the other hand, on appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court had ruled that the circuit court did correctly rule that Whitley had procedurally defaulted on the majority of his claims, such default would constitute a sufficient basis for the application of the <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>procedural bar. See <em>Frazier v. Weatherholtz, </em>572 F.2d 994, 997 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 876, 99 S.Ct. 215, 58 L.Ed.2d 191 (1978); cf. <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233, 237 n. 3, 238, 97 S.Ct. 2339, 2342 n. 3, 2342, 53 L.Ed.2d 306 (1977) (noting that if state supreme court rules on merits of claim on which habeas corpus petitioner had procedurally defaulted, then federal court may rule on merits of claim as well).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1584-6\">. As a corollary to this argument, Whitley argues that even if Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:21 did require him to present his defaulted claims in his state habeas appeal, along with a claim the circuit court\u2019s procedural default ruling was incorrect, the doctrine of procedural default is nevertheless inapplicable in his circumstance because the rule is not so firmly established and regularly followed as to compel federal deference. See <em>James v. Kentucky, </em>466 U.S. 341, 348, 104 S.Ct. 1830, 1835, 80 L.Ed.2d 346 (1984) (stating that federal habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with applicable state procedures can prevent federal review of petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims only if the state\u2019s procedures are firmly established and regularly followed). We have previously noted that the Virginia courts have consistently applied their procedural default rules. See <em>Conquest v. Mitchell, </em>618 F.2d 1053, 1056 (4th Cir.1980). And our decision in <em>Mason v. Procunier, </em>748 F.2d 852 (4th Cir.1984), as we have stated, decided that the doctrine of procedural default is applicable in the context of a state habeas appeal. Consequently, we reject Whitley\u2019s arguments in this regard as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1585-11\">. Whitley contends that his research has uncovered a valid cause for his state habeas counsel\u2019s procedural defaults, namely that his state habeas counsel did not present many claims in Whitley\u2019s state habeas appeal because she, being demoralized by a recent decision against her, had the understanding that Virginia law did not require the inclusion in the petition for appeal of all claims on which the circuit court had ruled Whitley had procedurally defaulted in order to preserve those claims for future federal review. Whitley does not raise any contention in this appeal regarding a valid cause for his trial and appellate attorneys' procedural defaults on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1585-19\">.
