We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Coleman was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by an Oklahoma jury on October 12, 1979. Evidence at trial showed that while Coleman was burglarizing the home of Dale and Delthea Warren, John and Roxie Seward walked in on him. John Seward was the brother of Delthea Warren. Coleman shot and killed the Sewards with a .28 gauge shotgun, apparently after he took them into the basement. Although there were no witnesses to the murders, the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming. There was evidence that this particular gauge shotgun was very rare and that Coleman owned one. Several hours after the murders, Coleman was stopped for a traffic violation and found in possession of Mrs. Seward\u2019s wallet. The police discovered in Coleman\u2019s truck sixty-four pounds of meat, marked \u201cHogle, Not for Sale.\u201d Lon Hogle testified that he had given this meat to the Warrens. The police also found Mrs. Warren\u2019s watch beneath the back seat of the police car. Coleman\u2019s wife testified that Coleman gave her this watch while they were in the back seat of that vehicle. There was also testimony placing Coleman\u2019s truck at the Warren\u2019s home at the estimated time of the murder. None of this evidence was refuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Coleman\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Coleman v. State, </em>668 P.2d 1126 (Okla.Crim.App.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1073, 104 S.Ct. 986, 79 L.Ed.2d 222 (1984). After the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, Coleman filed an application for post-conviction relief in the state district court in Muskogee County. <em>See </em>Okla.Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 1080-1088. That court denied the application, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. <em>Coleman v. State, </em>693 P.2d 4 (Okla.Crim. App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">Coleman then filed in federal district court these applications for a writ of habeas corpus, an evidentiary hearing, and a stay of execution. The district court denied each of Coleman\u2019s applications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court granted a stay of execution, 753 F.2d 832, and has given full consideration to the appeal after briefing and oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">Coleman first contends that the trial court erred in excluding four jurors for cause under <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968). In <em>Witherspoon </em>the Supreme Court indicated that prospective jurors in a capital case could be excluded if they made it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-13\">\u201cunmistakably clear (1) that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 522 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 n. 21 (original emphasis). Many lower courts treated this as an absolute standard which had to be met fully before jurors could be excluded on the grounds of their scruples against the death penalty. But in <em>Wain</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number><em>wright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), the Court rejected this restricted view of exclusion and adopted language from <em>Adams v. Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980), as the exclusive standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-4\">\u201c[A] juror may not be challenged for cause based on his views about capital punishment <em>unless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath. </em>The State may insist, however, that jurors will consider and decide the facts impartially and conscientiously apply the law as charged by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvJ\"><em>Id. </em>469 U.S. at 420, 105 S.Ct. at 850 (quoting <em>Adams, </em>448 U.S. at 45, 100 S.Ct. at 2526 and adding emphasis); <em>accord Darden v. Wainwright, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2468, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">To be excluded from service, therefore, it is not necessary that prospective jurors would vote automatically against the death penalty or that their opinions on capital punishment would prevent them from rendering an impartial verdict. If a prospective juror conscientiously disapproves of the death penalty, that juror can be eliminated if any of that person\u2019s jury duties would be \u201csubstantially impaired.\u201d We must apply this standard to petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">Of the four prospective jurors the trial court excused, the most questionable <em>voir dire </em>involved Larry Halpain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-8\">\u201cCourt: [I]f you were sitting on a jury and in a case where the law and the evidence warranted and you were told it was a proper case to consider the death penalty, could you, if you felt it was proper, agree to a death penalty that did not [sic] without doing violence to your own conscience?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-12\">Juror: No, I don\u2019t think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-13\">Court: In other words, you\u2019re telling me that if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was guilty of Murder in the First Degree and if under the law and the evidence and all the circumstances you could consider a death penalty, you tell me that you have such reservations that you just simply could under no circumstances impose a death penalty upon another human being? Juror: I don\u2019t think I could, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-14\">R. VI, 23. Halpain\u2019s responses sufficiently demonstrated that his beliefs about capital punishment would \u201csubstantially impair\u201d his ability to serve as a juror.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His answers were markedly similar to those of the juror in <em>Witt, </em>whom the Court found justifiably excluded for cause. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. at 412, 105 S.Ct. at 846, 850. In effect Halpain stated that he did not believe he would be able to apply the law as instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">Notably, the <em>Witt </em>Court ceded a great deal of authority to state trial judges to determine whether a juror should be excluded. A trial judge\u2019s finding that a prospective juror is biased'is a \u201cfactual finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 105 S.Ct. at 849-50; <em>Darden, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2468. Accordingly, a federal court, when reviewing a state decision pursuant to a petition for habeas corpus, must accord such findings a \u201cpresumption of correctness.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We see no grounds for overturning the trial judge\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Coleman claims that the exclusion of jurors opposed to the death penalty from the guilt/innocence phase of his trial violated his right to a jury comprised of a fair cross-section of the community, and to a fair and impartial jury, in violation respectively of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lockhart v. McCree, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 90 L.Ed.2d 137 (1986), forecloses these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">Coleman next claims that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. He asserts that his representation was inadequate in both the guilt and sentencing stages of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the Supreme Court adopted a two-part test for determining whether a criminal defendant has been denied reasonably effective counsel. The defendant must show \u201cthat counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\u201d and that \u201ccounsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The defendant must meet both of these requirements to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Id. </em>A claim may thus be disposed of by a failure to show either of them. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"AP5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">Coleman raises several issues concerning the adequacy of his representation during the guilt stage of his trial; the essence of the claim is inadequate time to prepare. Specifically, Coleman asserts as error his counsel\u2019s failure to (1) investigate and present alibi evidence; (2) submit written briefs on particular motions; (3) prepare adequately for cross-examination of a particular witness; and (4) request an instruction that Coleman\u2019s refusal to testify should not be used against him. Although several of these claims are based on statements taken out of context, we have reviewed each of the contentions carefully and conclude that there is no reversible error. We address each of Coleman\u2019s arguments briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">Regarding the alibi evidence, an attorney has a duty \u201cto make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066; <em>accord Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 2588, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986). The reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s decision not to conduct an investigation is directly related to the information the defendant has supplied. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066; <em>see also Mitchell v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 886, 888-89 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. DeCoster, </em>624 F.2d 196, 209 (D.C.Cir.1979) (en banc). In a capital case the attorney\u2019s duty to investigate all possible lines of defense is strictly observed. <em>See generally House v. Balkcom, </em>725 F.2d 608, 615 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 870, 105 S.Ct. 218, 83 L.Ed.2d 148 (1984); <em>United States v. Golub, </em>694 F.2d 207, 215 (10th Cir.1982); <em>cf. Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320,-&amp; n. 2, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 2640 &amp; n. 2, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985) (Eighth Amendment requires \u201cgreater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination\u201d (quoting <em>California v. Ramos, </em>463 U.S. 992, 998-99, 103 S.Ct. 3446, 3451-52, 77 L.Ed.2d 1171 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-18\">On the second day of trial, Coleman specifically requested before the court that his attorney subpoena an elderly woman who lived across the street from Coleman\u2019s brother, in order to establish an alibi.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Coleman did not know this witness\u2019 name, he did know and reveal where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>lived. Coleman\u2019s attorney apparently made no effort to contact this witness. In light of the strong case against Coleman and the seriousness of the charges, it was improper for his attorney to fail to investigate what was perhaps Coleman\u2019s sole line of defense. A defendant is not entitled to an attorney who will \u201cleave not the smallest stone unturned,\u201d <em>see DeCoster, </em>624 F.2d at 210, but when the defendant has but one stone, it should at least be nudged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">We must therefore address the prejudice question. Absent this failure, was there a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different? <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. at 2067-68. The answer is no. Even today, as Coleman faces execution, the name of this alleged witness has not been provided. We have only two affidavits from Coleman\u2019s relatives, stating that they spoke to this witness. Weighing this potential evidence, whose very existence is dubious, against the evidence produced at trial on Coleman\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the murders, we are unable to conclude that the alibi testimony would have altered the trial\u2019s outcome. <em>See Wallace v. Lockhart, </em>701 F.2d 719, 730 (8th Cir.) (evidentiary hearing unnecessary when name of potential witness not provided), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 934, 104 S.Ct. 340, 78 L.Ed.2d 308 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">Coleman argues that his attorney failed to file written briefs on certain motions and that he never requested additional time to file reply briefs. This court has held that the Sixth Amendment does not require that every possible motion be filed, but only those having a solid foundation. <em>See United States v. Afflerbach, </em>754 F.2d 866, 870 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3506, 87 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985); <em>United States v. Crouthers, </em>669 F.2d 635, 643 (10th Cir.1982). And an attorney\u2019s decision whether to file a written brief on a given motion is strategic. This is especially so when, as in the instant case, an attorney has only limited resources. The <em>Strickland </em>Court instructed .reviewing courts to be \u201chighly deferential\u201d to strategic decisions of attorneys. 466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066-67. Accordingly, we find that the attorney\u2019s decision not to submit written briefs on each of the myriad motions made during trial was reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">Coleman next claims that his attorney failed to prepare adequately for the testimony of Eli Maghee, an inmate at the Tulsa County Jail who testified that Coleman admitted murdering the Sewards. Although Coleman\u2019s attorney did not attend the hearing at which Maghee testified, he was given a transcript of this hearing shortly after trial began. Coleman has now presented evidence suggesting that Maghee committed penury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-11\">Perhaps Coleman\u2019s attorney could have prepared more completely for this witness. Counsel did, however, call one witness who stated that Maghee was a liar. Other testimony would have been cumulative. Further, Maghee was only one of several witnesses the state used to prove that Coleman committed the murder and, with respect to sentencing, was likely to commit further crimes. This court must take notice of the virtually unchallenged evidence of Coleman\u2019s guilt. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695-96, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69. We cannot conclude that the jurors would have reached a contrary decision with respect to guilt or sentence had they not heard the testimony of Maghee, or if that testimony had been more thoroughly discredited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-12\">Coleman finally contends that his attorney erred in failing to request an instruction that a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify cannot be used against him. If a defendant requests an instruction on silence, it must be given. <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 305, 101 S.Ct. 1112, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>1121, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 (1981). A court is not obligated to so instruct, however, unless a request is made. <em>Dutton v. State, </em>674 P.2d 1134, 1140 (Okla.Crim.App.1984). And whether to request a particular instruction is within an attorney\u2019s tactical discretion. <em>See Bashor v. Risley, </em>730 F.2d 1228, 1241 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 838, 105 S.Ct. 137, 83 L.Ed.2d 77 (1984). Here, counsel admitted that attorneys often decide not to request such an instruction because it calls attention to the defendant\u2019s silence. We do not find it improper that Coleman\u2019s attorney failed to request this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">With respect to the sentencing phase of the trial, the crux of Coleman\u2019s claim is that his attorney was unprepared; that counsel did not investigate other criminal charges pending against Coleman, which the state introduced as evidence of aggravating circumstances; and that counsel did not present any mitigating evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Coleman contends that his attorney had \u201cgiven up\u201d and in closing argument separated himself from his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-7\">On the preparedness issue, even at this late date petitioner has not pointed to any specific evidence that investigation of the charges pending against him would have revealed. Without a showing that an investigation would have uncovered mitigating evidence, this court may not presume prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">Similarly, Coleman asserts that his trial attorney should have had members of Coleman\u2019s family testify on his behalf. But during state hearings on post-conviction relief, Coleman\u2019s attorney responded to a question on the existence of mitigating evidence by saying, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even put his family on.\u201d R. III, 97. This indicates that Coleman\u2019s attorney considered using such testimony but decided against it. Such a decision is well within the range an attorney is entitled to make. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 699, 104 S.Ct. at 2066-67, 2070; <em>Mitchell v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 886, 890 (11th Cir.1985). The <em>Strickland </em>Court noted that when there is overwhelming evidence of both guilt and aggravating factors, testimony that the defendant is a \u201cgood\u201d person is unlikely to alter the outcome of a sentencing proceeding. 466 U.S. at 700, 104 S.Ct. at 2071; <em>see also Stanley v. Zant, </em>697 F.2d 955, 970 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1219, 104 S.Ct. 2667, 81 L.Ed.2d 372 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-14\">In reaching the conclusion that Coleman has failed to prove prejudice, we emphasize that the jury found that <em>five </em>aggravating factors existed beyond a reasonable doubt, and Coleman has not challenged the validity of any of them. Only one aggravating factor is needed to allow the jury to consider the death penalty. Okla.Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.11. Coleman has not met his burden of proving that his attorney\u2019s failure to present mitigating evidence prejudiced his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-15\">Finally, Coleman claims that his attorney\u2019s closing argument in the sentencing stage of his trial was prejudicial. He focuses on isolated portions of the closing argument to argue that his trial attorney failed to \u201chumanize\u201d Coleman and that he disassociated himself from his client. <em>See, e.g., King v. Strickland, </em>748 F.2d 1462, 1464-65 (11th Cir.1984) (attorney\u2019s focus on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>reprehensible nature of the crime and his court-appointed status were factors justifying reversal), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1016, 105 S.Ct. 2020, 85 L.Ed.2d 301 (1985). But the closing argument here shows only an experienced criminal attorney\u2019s strategic decision to appeal to a jury\u2019s religious beliefs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It was the plea for mercy the defendant himself chose not to make. Faced with overwhelming evidence of both guilt and aggravating factors, Coleman\u2019s attorney made a reasoned decision not to focus on Coleman\u2019s guilt or innocence but to appeal to the jury's merciful instincts. Counsel expressly testified that his closing argument was \u201cintended to create some sympathy for a man who had been convicted of Murder One.\u201d R. III, 84.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A reviewing court cannot second guess the decisions of experienced trial attorneys. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066-67; <em>Darden, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2473. Viewing this closing argument as a whole, we hold that the argument did not prejudice Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">In determining that Coleman received effective assistance of counsel, we have focused not only on alleged errors, but also on what counsel did for Coleman. Courts should not judge the overall quality of representation by focusing unduly on isolated incidents. <em>See Tucker v. Zant, </em>724 F.2d 882, 894 (11th Cir.1984), <em>reversed on other grounds sub. nom. Tucker v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1480 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc). Although certain individual errors may be so fundamental that they alone constitute reversible error, <em>see Morrison, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2586-89, when a series of errors of lesser magnitude are asserted, a court should consider the quality of representation as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2588.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-18\">Coleman\u2019s attorney was an experienced criminal lawyer who had participated in several other capital trials. Although the record shows he was beleaguered, he nevertheless vigorously defended Coleman. He succeeded in obtaining a change of venue and in excluding from the guilt stage of the trial testimony that Coleman had escaped from jail and that his brother had thrown the murder weapon into a river. <em>See United States v. Winkle, </em>722 F.2d 605, 608-09 (10th Cir.1983). He made numerous objections and motions throughout the guilt and sentencing stages. Having reviewed the entire record, we are convinced this attorney was an effective advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-19\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-20\">Coleman asserts that the trial court\u2019s refusal to appoint a private investigator to help his attorney violated his due process and equal protection rights. Oklahoma only permits courts in counties with populations greater than 200,000 to appoint private investigators to aid indigent defendants. Okla.Stat. tit. 19, \u00a7 138.6. The trial court found that it had no authority to appoint an investigator because the trial was taking place in Muskogee County, which has fewer than 200,000 people.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-21\">We need not decide whether the Constitution requires appointment of a private investigator to aid in the defense\u2019s preparation for trial if the defendant makes no showing that the requested assistance would be beneficial. <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320,-n. 1, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 2637 n. 1, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985). Other than the possible existence of one unnamed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>alibi witness, Coleman has alleged only that his attorney was overworked, that many witnesses were involved in the case, and that the state\u2019s resources far surpassed those of the defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These factors do not invariably preclude a defense attorney from rendering a reasonably effective defense. <em>Cf United States v.

Even if such general showings would have been sufficient before trial, they are insufficient post-trial. <em>See Mason v.

Remarks that would cause us to reverse in a direct appeal of a federal conviction are not necessarily grounds for reversal when spoken in state courts. <em>Brooks v.

Further, to determine whether a state prosecutor\u2019s remarks were so flagrant as to deny a defendant a fair trial, we must take notice of all the surrounding circumstances, including the strength of the state's case. <em>See United States v. Haskins, </em>737 F.2d 844, 850 (10th Cir.1984)); <em>see also Darden, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2472.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-17\">In his closing argument during the guilt stage, the prosecutor asked: \u201cWhy did he leave at 3:15 with a .28 gauge shotgun in his hand? Why did he leave with the shotgun____\u201d R. VII, 832. He continued along these lines, prefacing bits of unanswered inculpatory evidence with the word \u201cwhy.\u201d Coleman construes this as unconstitutional comment on his silence. Further, Coleman observes, the state commented on the \u201cuncontradicted\u201d evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-19\">In <em>Knowles v. United States, </em>224 F.2d 168 (10th Cir.1955), we held that reversible error exists if a prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u201cmanifestly intended or [were] of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take [them] to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170; <em>accord United States v. Hooks, </em>780 F.2d 1526, 1533 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1657, 90 L.Ed.2d 199 (1986). In <em>Knowles, </em>a tax fraud case, the prosecutor stated that the defendant \u201chad every opportunity in the world given to make an explanation of it, to prove it was in error, to cast doubt upon it. And it wasn\u2019t done.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>224 F.2d at 170. We construed this as a comment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>fact that the evidence was unrefuted, not that the defendant failed to testify. <em>Id,.; see also United States v. Walton, </em>552 F.2d 1354, 1362-63 (10th Cir.) (statement that particular witness was the only one willing to testify did not violate Fifth Amendment), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 959, 97 S.Ct. 2685, 53 L.Ed.2d 277 (1977); <em>Sanchez v. Heggie, </em>531 F.2d at 967 (statement that no one attempted to explain evidence did not violate Fifth Amendment). The remarks in the instant case were far more innocuous than those in <em>Knowles. </em>They were not \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to draw attention to Coleman\u2019s silence; they were no more than a rhetorical device.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">The prosecutor also stated in closing argument in the guilt stage that, following the police, the witnesses, and the district attorney\u2019s office, the jury was the final link in the chain of law enforcement. We agree with Coleman that this \u201cfinal link\u201d statement was improper. By suggesting that the jury is only the last link in a long decision, the statement tends to trivialize the jury\u2019s importance. <em>See Tucker v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1480, 1485-86 (11th Cir.) (en banc) (finding similar argument improper at sentencing stage), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 517, 88 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985). This argument also misstates the role of the jury, placing it in an adversarial position with respect to the defendant. To the extent that the prosecutor\u2019s argument portrayed the jury as part of a team opposing the defendant, it was improper. But we do not find that this \u201clast link\u201d remark made during the guilt stage of the trial \u2014 even taken together with the prosecutor\u2019s persistent attempts to evoke sympathy for Coleman\u2019s victims and his comments on matters not in evidence \u2014 rose to the level of constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-7\">Regarding Coleman\u2019s third argument, the Supreme Court recently has explained that an improper closing argument in the guilt stage of a capital case warrants reversal only if the \u201cprosecutors\u2019 comments \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darden, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2472 (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). This standard was not met here. The prosecutor\u2019s improper comments generally were limited to the introduction of a lengthy closing argument. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (remarks must be viewed in context of entire record); <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>771 F.2d 1382, 1401 (10th Cir. 1985) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 579, 88 L.Ed.2d 561 (1985). In view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, they cannot be said to have violated Coleman\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-13\">The prosecutor also did not manipulate or misstate the evidence. Rather, many of the prosecutor\u2019s most graphic remarks were in fact accurate descriptions of the evidence. <em>See Hance v. Zant, </em>696 F.2d 940, 951 (11th Cir.) (\u201cunquestionably inflammatory\u201d evidence accurately depicting scene of murder admissible), <em>cert. denied, </em>463 U.S. 1210, 103 S.Ct. 3544, 77 L.Ed.2d 1393 (1983), <em>overruled on other grounds, Brooks v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1383 (11th Cir. 1985) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-15\">Coleman also contends that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks in the sentencing stage of his trial rendered it fundamentally unfair. The standard governing appellate review of closing arguments during the sentencing stage of capital cases is whether the comments might have affected the sentencing decision. <em>See Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, -, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 2644, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985) (\u201cBecause we cannot say that this effort [improper comment] had no effect on the sentencing decision, that decision does not meet the standard of reliability that the Eighth Amendment requires.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-17\">Death is qualitatively different from all other punishments, therefore \u201cthere is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\u201d <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 305, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976). A decision on the propriety of a closing argument must look to the Eighth Amendment\u2019s command that a death sentence be based on a complete assessment of the defendant\u2019s individual circumstances, <em>see Brooks v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1383, 1406 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 3325, 92 L.Ed.2d 732 (1986), and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that no one be deprived of life without due process of law, <em>see Darden, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2472.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">Some emotion is inevitable in capital sentencing. <em>Brooks, </em>762 F.2d at 1404-OS. Thus, appeals to emotion <em>ordinarily </em>do not alone render an argument improper. <em>Id. </em>at 1405 &amp; n. 34; <em>see also Darden, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2472 (emotional argument during guilt stage did not render trial fundamentally unfair). But, as we discuss below, even if a prosecutor\u2019s comments are confined to permissible subjects, if those comments are nevertheless designed to evoke a wholly emotional response from the jury, constitutional error can result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">With respect to the subjects that a prosecutor may address, comments are permissible only to the extent they are relevant to factors the jury may properly consider. <em>Drake v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1449,1458 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 3333, 92 L.Ed.2d 739 (1986). Thus the prosecutor may comment on evidence concerning the existence of an aggravating factor the state statute requires to be found before the jury may impose the death penalty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Brooks, </em>762 F.2d at 1408. The prosecutor also may comment on \u201cinformation about the defendant, his character, and the circumstances of his offense made known to the jury throughout the bifurcated trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1406.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-14\">Comments on the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness and the chances for rehabilitation also are permissible. <em>Id. </em>at 1406-08 (citing <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976)); <em>Drake, </em>762 F.2d at 1458. Similarly, comments concerning the penological justifications for the death penalty, i.e., retribution, incapacitation, and general deterrence, are appropriate. <em>Brooks, </em>762 F.2d at 1407-08; <em>Drake, </em>762 F.2d at 1458.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-15\">Here, Coleman alleges the prosecutor improperly gave his personal opinion on whether Coleman felt remorse for his actions, and commented on Coleman\u2019s future dangerousness. In addition, the prosecutor sought to shift responsibility for the death penalty from the jurors to Coleman. We address these in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-16\">Coleman challenges the following statements of the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-17\">\u201cLet\u2019s not even consider the ones that were killed, murdered, that we\u2019ve proven to you, but the ones he tried to kill and murder. I just appeal to simple justice. In our Second Stage we showed you about the escape. We showed you what happened in five days. <em>You talk about regret and remorse for what he did to John Seward. </em>My gosh! Here we are 60 days later cutting Tommie Dotson\u2019s throat. Tells him \u2018I\u2019m looking for a place to leave you for a while.\u2019 He\u2019s already stabbed him in the throat. He\u2019s bleeding to death, so he handcuffs his hands behind him, then throws him back of the patrol car, and then destroys any communication he can have with anybody by ripping all of the wires out. Do we have to tolerate that? That\u2019s on April 24th. That\u2019s the day after he escaped and he <em>feels a lot of regret and remorse for what he did to John and Roxie Seward. </em>And we can tell here \u2014 here he is a day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>later after he escaped \u2014 60 days after the murder. Tommie Dotson \u2014 what has he got to do with anything. He just stopped the man \u2014 but we need a gun so we stab him and put him in the back of the car with his hands handcuffed behind him. That\u2019s April 24th. On April 26th, two days later, now he\u2019s in Tulsa. He\u2019s in Tulsa and Billy Wilson told you what he saw. What have we got?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">R. VII, 1001-02 (emphasis added). Although Coleman\u2019s contention that the prosecutor should not give his personal opinion is correct, <em>see Darden, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2477 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), we do not believe that occurred here. Instead, the quoted argument is directly relevant to the \u201cprobability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society,\u201d one of the Oklahoma aggravating circumstances. Okla.Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.-12(7). Coleman\u2019s failure to show regret or remorse for his actions may have helped the jury determine whether he was likely to commit crimes in the future. Thus these comments were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">Coleman also challenges the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning his future dangerousness. He contends that Oklahoma law forbids such remarks. Oklahoma, however, permits such commentary as long as the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is listed as an aggravating circumstance in the bill of particulars. <em>Brewer v. State, </em>650 P.2d 54, 58 n. 1 (Okla.Crim.App.1982), <em>cert denied, </em>459 U.S. 1150, 103 S.Ct. 794, 74 L.Ed.2d 999 (1983). The state did include Coleman\u2019s future dangerousness as an aggravating circumstance in its bill of particulars, and thus was free under state law to argue that Coleman constituted a continuing threat. In addition, such comments are constitutionally appropriate. <em>See Brooks, </em>762 F.2d at 1411-12. Comments on a defendant\u2019s future dangerousness are relevant to specific deterrence, one of the purposes of the death penalty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-8\">The prosecutor also stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-9\">\u201cIn closing I say to you that they try to put the responsibility on you, like it\u2019s all your fault. To a certain extent \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to imply, I don\u2019t mean to imply that it\u2019s put on you like it\u2019s your fault if you do something in this case. I don\u2019t mean to imply that necessarily, but let me make it real clear that you\u2019re not writing the verdict in this case. Don\u2019t\u2014 don\u2019t be mistaken into believing that it\u2019s your responsibility that this happened, that you\u2019re, you\u2019re writing the verdict. I, I say to you, this man wrote the verdict on February 9th, and all those days after when he got out of jail and went on [sic] spree of knifing and kidnapping and killing. He wrote the verdict. This man. He wrote it in blood over and over.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-11\">R. VII, 1018-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-12\">In <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. at ---, 105 S.Ct. at 2638-46, the Supreme Court condemned somewhat analogous remarks which emphasized that appellate courts ultimately would determine the appropriate penalty. The Court concluded that \u201cit is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant\u2019s death rests elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 105 S. Ct. at 2638. It condemned such arguments because (1) it is the duty of the jury rather than an appellate court to impose the sentence; (2) the jury, believing that an appellate court will correct an error, may sentence the defendant to death even though they are not convinced this penalty is necessary; (3) jurors may conclude that a life sentence cannot be increased to death and impose the death penalty so that the appellate court can impose it if it so desires; and (4) the argument may be used as a means to obtain the votes of undecided jurors. <em>Id. </em>at---, 105 S.Ct. at 2638-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-16\">We believe the dangers the Court identified in <em>Caldwell </em>are not present in the remarks made here. This method of argument does not permit the jury to rely on someone else to make the ultimate sentencing decision or otherwise dilute or trivialize the jury\u2019s responsibility. Unlike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>argument in <em>Caldwell, </em>the argument used here did not suggest to the jury that someone else now has <em>control </em>over the defendant\u2019s fate. Instead, it only brought into focus that defendant is responsible for his own plight. <em>See Brooks, </em>762 F.2d at 1410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Moreover, viewing this argument in context, it is evident that the prosecutor had no intention of diminishing the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-6\">\u201cHe [Coleman\u2019s attorney], he said something about, come out here, and I can\u2019t remember what he said. He said, you bring back the death penalty, come back here and slap everybody on the back and joke around \u2014 my gosh, folks! Let\u2019s don\u2019t take it that lightly. He makes it sound like it would be easy for you to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-7\">I say to you the toughest thing you may do in your whole life \u2014 the toughest thing you may do in your whole life is to come back and do what you know you\u2019ve got to do in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-8\">And it will be something you\u2019ll pray about and think about forever. It won\u2019t be something you\u2019re popular about and want to joke about and run around to the coffee shop and barber shop to brag about it. It won\u2019t be. It will be one of the most serious things you\u2019ve ever done in your life and it won\u2019t be easy. I don\u2019t care what he says. I know that it won\u2019t be. It\u2019s not easy to be here now. It\u2019s a grave responsibility you have. It\u2019s an important responsibility you have, and it\u2019s not easy to shoulder that kind of load, but somebody\u2019s got to. Somebody\u2019s got to. Somebody\u2019s got to stop what this man did. Somebody\u2019s got to take that responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-12\">Is it easy? No, it\u2019s not easy, but you\u2019ve got to do it. If you don\u2019t, it just goes on and on and what are we just supposed to accept that? We\u2019ve got to draw a line and stand for something.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-13\">R. VII, 1017-18. The prosecutor\u2019s argument that Coleman was responsible for his own plight thus was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-14\">We are disturbed by the tenor of some of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument at sentencing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although discussion of the heinousness of the crime or the likelihood that the defendant will commit future violent acts will inevitably evoke some emotion, the prosecutor\u2019s primary role is to give the jury the facts necessary to decide if the death penalty is warranted. Prosecutorial playing on jurors\u2019 passion can only subvert the delicate process of preventing the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty, with which the courts have long struggled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-15\">Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s argument here was im-, proper. Other courts have tolerated far more egregious arguments. <em>See, e.g., Brooks, </em>762 F.2d at 1413 (prosecution\u2019s description of defendant as a \u201ccancer on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>body of society\u201d not improper). Although the prosecutor\u2019s emotional argument came close to the line dividing proper from improper argument, we cannot conclude that he transgressed Coleman\u2019s Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">Coleman\u2019s final claim is that the district court erred in not granting him an evidentiary hearing. He contends he did not receive a full and fair hearing in state court because he was not permitted to testify at hearings conducted on his application for post-conviction relief. But Coleman has alleged only in the most general terms what he would have testified to had he been permitted to attend the state hearing. Most of his claims concern his counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness. These general and conclusory assertions do not warrant an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Tucker v. Zant, </em>724 F.2d 882, 897-98 (11th Cir.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>762 F.2d 1480 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc); <em>Wallace v. Lockhart, </em>701 F.2d at 730. Further, we are convinced by our review that the record was sufficient, without augmentation through an evidentiary hearing, to show that Coleman had effective counsel. <em>See Pierce v. Cardwell, </em>572 F.2d 1339, 1343 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus. In light of the fact that this is a capital case, following the consideration of any rehearing petition that may be filed, when the final order of this court is entered, or when the judgment becomes final without further order and issuance of the mandate of this court which would otherwise occur, we will stay our mandate and execution of petitioner\u2019s death warrant for thirty days pending the filing of a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States; if such a petition for certiorari is filed within such time, then the stay of our mandate and of petitioner\u2019s execution will continue until disposition by the Supreme Court of the petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">. We have noted a significant error, which we must discuss, in the district court\u2019s January 18, 1985 \"Order Denying Petitioner\u2019s Application for Evidentiary Hearing, Denying Petition For Writ of Habeas Corpus, And Denying Petitioner\u2019s Application For Stay of Execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">At page 23 of that Order, the district court stated that \"petitioner has filed a previous request for habeas corpus relief before the court in No. 80-312-C, which was denied by order of this court on December 22, 1980.\u201d The Order then quoted language from <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 895, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3395, 77</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-15\">L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), about the State\u2019s legitimate interest in preventing a mere delaying tactic by abuse of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-16\">The record before us shows that the prior case No. 80-312-C was not a habeas petition attacking the John Seward murder conviction and death sentence involved in the instant case. That case dealt instead with claims that the petitioner was denied his right to a speedy trial on the charge that he murdered Roxie Seward. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s statements about successive proceedings and the prior case were clearly in error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">. In addition to dispensing with Witherspoon\u2019s reference to \"automatic\u201d decisionmaking, the <em>Witt </em>Court eliminated the requirement that a juror's bias be shown with \"unmistakable clarity.\u201d <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. at 419, 105 S.Ct. at 850. <em>See generally </em>Comment, <em>Excluding Death Penalty Opponents from Capital Juries: </em>Witt, Wither-spoon, <em>and the Impartial Juror, </em>34 U.Kan.L.Rev. 149 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">. The trial judge has the power, and indeed the duty, to ask his own questions to explore the depth of a juror\u2019s convictions regarding imposition of the death penalty. <em>See Witt, </em>469 U.S. at 419, 105 S.Ct. at 850; Darden,-U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2469. Had the juror indicated that he could impose the death penalty in an exceptional case, the trial judge'could have found the juror qualified under the <em>Witt </em>standard. The record reveals that Coleman's attorney made no attempt to question these jurors. He did, however, take strong exception to the excusing of each of these four jurors by various motions and comments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">. On appeal, Coleman offered two affidavits by his relatives stating that they had talked to the woman and that she said she saw Coleman at his brother\u2019s house during the time the crimes were committed. The relatives further stated that they had conveyed this information to Coleman's attorney prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">. Coleman specifically notes his attorney's failure to brief the question whether Jeanette Coleman\u2019s testimony fell within the husband-wife privilege. But the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to admit this testimony. <em>Coleman v. State, </em>668 P.2d 1126, 1134 (Okla.Crim.App.1983). We therefore cannot find that Coleman\u2019s attorney\u2019s decision not to brief this issue may have altered the trial\u2019s outcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">. Oklahoma requires a jury to find the existence of an aggravating circumstance before it may consider imposing the death penalty. Okla.Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.10-.12. In this case, the jury found the following aggravating circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-10\">\u201c1. The Defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-11\">2. The Defendant knowingly created a risk of death to more than one person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-12\">3. The Murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-16\">4. The Murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-17\">5. There exists a probability that the Defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1317-18\">R. IV, 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-19\">Oklahoma law, as it must, also permits the introduction of mitigating evidence. Okla.Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">. This appears to be a common trial tactic. <em>See Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320,-, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 2637, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1318-13\">. The Supreme Court recently has granted certiorari in a case challenging a jury instruction that a jury must not consider sympathy in deciding whether to impose the death penalty. <em>California v. Brown, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2274, 90 L.Ed.2d 717 (1986). Although a similar instruction was given in the instant case, R. VII, 993, we cannot consider this issue. It has not been raised either here or in the state courts. Such an issue must be presented to the state courts before it may be treated in federal proceedings. <em>See Crisp v. Mayabb, </em>668 F.2d 1127, 1132 (10th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 827, 103 S.Ct. 62, 74 L.Ed.2d 64 (1982); <em>Drennon </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>642 F.2d 1204, 1205 (10th Cir.1981); L.

The only specific evidence that Coleman has brought to the court\u2019s attention are reports suggesting that one of the state\u2019s witnesses may have committed perjury. As discussed above, we do not believe that introduction of this evidence would have altered the outcome of either stage of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1321-12\">. Both Georgia and Oklahoma require the jury to find the existence of at least one statutorily designated aggravating factor before it may consider imposing the death penalty. <em>See </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 17-10-30; Okla.Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.11. But regardless of how many aggravating factors are found, the jury may decline imposition of the death penalty. Okla.Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.11, <em>Brooks, </em>762 F.2d at 1405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1323-9\">. The following is an example of the prosecutor\u2019s playing to the jury\u2019s emotions while commenting on permissible subjects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-10\">\"I talked to you about one thing \u2014 not vengance, not even punishment. I talked about one word \u2014 PROTECTION. And nobody tells us, Scriptures or otherwise \u2014 nobody tells us we don\u2019t have the right to protect ourselves. He talks about family. Why didn\u2019t he ask them? Why didn\u2019t he ask Mrs. Warren how she felt? She\u2019s a Christian lady. Why didn\u2019t he ask her how she felt about this and what her understanding of her religion was? Why didn\u2019t he ask Mr. Parish when he took the witness stand? Why didn\u2019t he ask those people? If he wants to get up here and tell you that those people didn\u2019t feel that way, then why didn\u2019t he ask them when they sat right up there, you know, why didn\u2019t he ask them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-16\">Because they\u2019re Christian, God-fearing people! That they also want to be protected from being like a sheep. Like a sheep at the hands of that man, being marched down to slaughter. Being thrown in a ravine. PROTECTION. I\u2019m not talking vengance. I\u2019m not talking punishment. We\u2019ve got to do something to protect ourselves from something that kills so callously, that kills so senselessly, and I\u2019m not saying \u2018No big deal,' I\u2019m saying that\u2019s how he felt about life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-17\">The gun\u2019s more important \u2014 a gun is more important.
