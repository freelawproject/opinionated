Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1480 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc), we concluded that, although the prosecutor had made several improper comments at the sentencing phase of Tucker\u2019s trial, his sentencing proceeding was not thereby rendered fundamentally unfair. On December 2,1985, the Supreme Court granted Tucker\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and remanded the case to our court for reconsideration in light of <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985). Upon reconsideration, we conclude that our previous decision was consistent with <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi </em>and hold that, viewing the record as a whole, Tucker was not denied a fundamentally fair sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">Subsequent to its decision in <em>Caldwell, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986), which provides further guidance for our inquiry. The Court in <em>Darden </em>reiterated that the standard in a habeas case for assessing improper prosecutorial comment is, as initially enunciated in <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974), whether the proceeding at issue was rendered fundamentally unfair by the improper argument. <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2472.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>Darden </em>Court explained that <em>Caldwell </em>was a unique case. In <em>Caldwell, </em>the prosecutor, in the sentencing phase of a capital case, provided the jury with misleading information as to its role in the sentencing process, telling it that its decision was not final and was automatically reviewable by the state supreme court, thus diminishing the importance of the jury\u2019s role and allowing it to feel less responsible for the awesome decision before it. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014 n. 15,106 S.Ct. at 2473 n. 15. Of critical importance in <em>Caldwell </em>was the fact that the trial judge approved of the prosecutor\u2019s comments, stating that it was proper that the jury be told that its decision was automatically reviewable. <em>See id.; Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. at-, 105 S.Ct. at 2638. Because of the trial judge\u2019s agreement with the prosecutor\u2019s comments, it was as if the jury received an erroneous instruction from the court at the sentencing phase of a capital proceeding, thus triggering the eighth amendment\u2019s heightened requirement of reliability in a capital case and mandating reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-19\">We now apply the preceding principles to the case before us. When this case was last before the en banc court, we applied the fundamental fairness standard to petitioner\u2019s sentencing proceeding and concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not render the proceeding fundamentally unfair. To make the fundamental fairness determination, we borrowed what has become known as the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 693-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and asked whether there was \u201ca reasonable probability that, in the absence of the offending remarks, the sentencing outcome would have been different.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d at 1483. \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the out-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>come.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1483-84; <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. We continue to believe that this standard properly describes the fundamental fairness inquiry \u2014 whether the improper remarks were of sufficient magnitude to undermine confidence in the jury\u2019s decision. If a reviewing court is confident that, absent the improper remarks, the jury\u2019s decision would have been no different, the proceeding cannot be said to have been fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">The en banc court identified four instances of improprieties in the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in this case. Two of these, the interjection of the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinions and the reference to the financial burden on the taxpayers of imposing a life sentence, are unrelated to the jury\u2019s role in the capital sentencing process and thus fit squarely into the <em>Darden v. Wainwright </em>analysis. As set out in our prior opinion, neither of these instances was sufficiently egregious to render the proceeding fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s other two inappropriate remarks, which have been referred to as the \u201cprosecutorial expertise\u201d argument and the \u201cjury dilution\u201d or \u201clast link\u201d argument, partake of some of the elements found in Caldwell.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It could be argued that both comments tended to lessen the jury\u2019s role in the sentencing process because the comments advised the jury that others, including the prosecutor\u2019s office, the police, the grand jury, and the trial judge, participated in the proceedings culminating in a decision whether to impose the death penalty. Unlike <em>Caldwell, </em>however, the trial judge in this case correctly instructed the jury and did not put his imprimatur on erroneous information. The court\u2019s instruction emphasized to the jury that it had the responsibility of making the sentencing decision. Viewing the entire sentencing proceeding, there can be little doubt that the jury understood it had the sole responsibility to determine the sentence to be received by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">As discussed in our prior opinion, although the prosecutor told the jury that his office had made a careful decision that this case warranted seeking the death penalty, he did not stop there. He went on to describe why that decision was made, focusing on the individual characteristics of this crime and this defendant, allowing the jury to assess for itself the appropriateness of a death sentence. Defense counsel vociferously argued to the jury that it had the sole discretion to impose death or grant mercy, and the trial judge so instructed the jury. Defense counsel also took issue with the notion of prosecutorial expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">The \u201cjury dilution\u201d comments could arguably have tended to heighten or lessen the jury\u2019s awareness of its sense of responsibility, depending upon how the remarks are viewed. The prosecutor argued that the jury would not be alone in sentencing petitioner to death, but was the \u201clast link\u201d in a process that included police officers, the grand jury, the district attorney, and the trial judge. Although this argument could be said to spread the responsibility for imposing a death sentence, it also had the effect of informing the jury that the process stopped with it, and that if the petitioner was to receive a death sentence, it was the jury that must impose it. Regardless of the interpretation given this comment, the jury was told repeatedly by defense counsel, and instructed by the trial judge, that if it found an aggravating circumstance, it had the sole discretion to impose a life or death sentence. The jury was told that the decision was \u201ccompletely within your discretion,\u201d that it was \u201cabsolutely your decision,\u201d and that it was its \u201cprerogative\u201d to grant mercy and spare the petitioner\u2019s life even if it found an aggravating circumstance. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that it was \u201centirely within your discretion to impose either the death penalty or life imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>ment.\u201d The judge repeated this admonition just before the jury retired to deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">When the record of the entire sentencing proceeding is reviewed, we are convinced that the jury was fully apprised of, and appreciated, the decision that it alone had to make \u2014 whether to impose a sentence of death or one of life imprisonment. The prosecutor\u2019s improper comments, in light of his entire argument, defense counsel\u2019s argument, and a proper instruction from the court, did not render the sentencing proceeding fundamentally unfair. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on petitioner\u2019s prosecutorial argument claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1377-11\">. The habeas inquiry is \" \u2018the narrow one of due process, and not the broad exercise of supervisory power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2472 (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 642, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">. The Court in <em>Caldwell </em>noted that in <em>Donnelly v.

In contrast, in <em>Caldwell, </em>the trial judge \u2018\u2018not only failed to correct the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, but in fact openly agreed with them; he stated to the jury that the remarks were proper and necessary, strongly implying that the prosecutor's portrayal of the juicy's role was correct.\u201d <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. at-, 105 S.Ct. at 2645.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">.

Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985), notwithstanding, the prosecutorial misconduct at issue here did not deprive Tucker of a fundamentally fair sentencing hearing. Because in my view the misconduct which occurred in Tucker\u2019s case violated core principles enunciated in <em>Caldwell </em>and was not rendered harmless, I respectfully dissent. I further dissent because the majority continues to adhere to its position that a petitioner who has shown prosecutorial misconduct at his sentencing hearing must further satisfy the heightened prejudice showing required of petitioners alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">I. THE SENTENCING PROCEEDING</p>\n<p id=\"AZb\">On March 9, 1978, William Boyd Tucker was convicted by a jury in Muscogee County, Georgia of murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, and robbery by intimidation. During the sentencing proceeding, Tucker called witnesses who testified as to his previously peaceful nature and his lack of any prior trouble with law enforcement. Tucker\u2019s witnesses also focused on his troubled relationship and recent reconciliation with his alcoholic father, the stress placed on Tucker by the sudden death of his father three months prior to the crime, and Tucker\u2019s serious problem with alcohol and marijuana following his father\u2019s death and including the day of the crime. The state presented no evidence at the sentencing proceeding. After the close of evidence, both parties presented closing arguments to the jury. Pursuant to Georgia procedural rules, the state argued first and the defense followed. The court then instructed the jury on the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-15\">During his closing argument to the jury, the state prosecutor, Gray Conger, repeatedly minimized the importance of the jury\u2019s sentencing responsibility. He emphasized that the district attorney\u2019s office had already considered all legally relevant factors and concluded that Tucker\u2019s case was one of the very few cases that warranted imposition of the death penalty. Conger also argued his personal opinion that Tucker could not be rehabilitated, his personal distaste for Tucker, his belief that Tucker posed a potential threat to other prisoners and guards, the financial burden taxpayers would bear if Tucker were incarcerated for life, his opinion that the evidence of Tucker\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, the difference in the comparable worth to society of the victim and Tucker, and the retributive and deterrent justifications for executing Tucker. Conger also suggested that Tucker further evidenced a lack of remorse because he declined to testify until after the jury had returned a guilty verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>The court\u2019s charge to the jury was brief. The judge explained that the jury could only consider the death penalty if it found the existence of an aggravating circumstance. The judge at first stated that it was the jury\u2019s duty to determine the penalty that should be imposed and that it was within the jury\u2019s discretion to impose either the death penalty or life imprisonment. The court then, however, proceeded to characterize the jury\u2019s role as deciding whether to <em>recommend </em>the death penalty. In the last three paragraphs of its six paragraph charge, the court indicated six times that the jury\u2019s choice of the death penalty would be a recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">II. THE <em>CALDWELL </em>STANDARD AND THE <em>STRICKLAND </em>STANDARD ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE</p>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">The majority, as did our court in our earlier en banc opinion, adopts the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), to assess the impact of prosecutorial misconduct. The shortcomings of this approach have been discussed by our court on several occasions. <em>See Tucker v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1496, 1496 (11th Cir.1985) (Clark, J., dissenting), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S.-, </em>106 S.Ct. 517, 92 L.Ed.2d 743 (1985); <em>Brooks v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1383, 1426 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.1985) (Johnson, J., dissenting), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 3325, 92 L.Ed.2d 732 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\"><em>Strickland </em>and <em>Caldwell </em>are fundamentally different in that <em>Strickland </em>places the prejudice burden on the habeas petitioner. Once the petitioner shows the defense attorney\u2019s performance fell below professional norms, the petitioner must show that absent this deficiency, there is a reasonable probability that the proceeding\u2019s outcome would have been different. 104 S.Ct. at 2068. <em>Caldwell, </em>however, places the prejudice burden on the state. Once the petitioner has shown that the prosecution attempted to minimize the jury\u2019s responsibility at the capital sentencing hearing, the state must show that \u201cthis effort had no effect on the sentencing decision.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 2646. Because this case presents virtually the same prosecutorial misconduct as <em>Caldwell </em>in the exact procedural posture of <em>Caldwell, </em>the <em>Caldwell </em>\u201cno effect\u201d standard, and not the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice analysis, must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">At its core, my objection to the majority\u2019s extension of <em>Strickland </em>remains that <em>Strickland </em>establishes a rigorous prejudice showing that a habeas petitioner must satisfy before he may prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim precisely because: \u201c[T]he government is not responsible for, and hence not able to prevent, [defense] attorney errors that will result in reversal of a conviction or sentence.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2067. On the other hand the state <em>can </em>control prosecutorial conduct and, in the capital sentencing context, is constitutionally obligated to do so. See <em>Caldwell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2639 (constitutional limits \u201con imposition of capital punishment are rooted in a concern that the sentencing process should facilitate the responsible and reliable exercise of sentencing discretion.\u201d (citations omitted)); cf. <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) (plurality opinion) (\u201cdecision to impose the death sentence [must] be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-13\">It is significant that the Supreme Court did not extend its <em>Strickland </em>prejudice analysis to Caldwell's claim of prosecutorial misconduct at sentencing but instead reaffirmed the long line of cases requiring heightened reliability in capital sentencing proceedings. <em>Caldwell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2639-40 &amp; n. 2, 2642 &amp; nn. 4-6. Our continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>use of <em>Strickland </em>in this context is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-4\">III. APPLYING THE CORRECT LEGAL STANDARD TO THE PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">A. <em>The </em>Caldwell v. Mississippi <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">The Supreme Court' has reiterated on several occasions that \u201cthe qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination.\u201d <em>California v. Ramos, </em>463 U.S. 992, 998-99, 103 S.Ct. 3446, 3452, 77 L.Ed.2d 1171 (1983). This requirement is firmly rooted in the eighth amendment. <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 305, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) (plurality opinion). <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985) clarified one of the specific limitations on prosecutorial closing arguments and was the first instance in which the Supreme Court addressed the standard for assessing claims of improper prosecutorial argument at the penalty phase of a capital trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">In <em>Caldwell </em>the Supreme Court found that a Mississippi prosecutor, through his argument to the jury that its decision would be automatically reviewed by an appellate court, had \u201csought to minimize the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of death.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 2646. The Court held that because it could not say that \u201cthis effort had no effect on the sentencing decision,\u201d that decision did not meet the eighth amendment requirement of capital sentencing reliability and had to be vacated. <em>Id. </em>Contrasting the fundamental fairness inquiry of <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974), the Court indicated that the state\u2019s burden to establish that prosecutorial misconduct did not constitute fundamental unfairness is heaviest where a specific constitutional safeguard, such as the eighth amendment\u2019s heightened reliability requirement of determinations to impose a capital sentence, has been compromised. 105 S.Ct. at 2645.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">The Supreme Court clarified the reach of <em>Caldwell </em>and <em>Donnelly </em>in <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). The Court indicated that the <em>Donnelly </em>inquiry as to whether \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s comments \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process\u2019 \u201d is still the relevant question when reviewing claims of prosecutorial misconduct at the guilt phase of a trial. The <em>Darden </em>majority expressly noted that it did not apply the heightened eighth amendment standard of <em>Caldwell </em>because Darden\u2019s claim involved misconduct only at the <em>guilt </em>phase of the trial and not at the <em>sentencing </em>phase. <em>Darden, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2473 n. 15. The Court also noted that the prosecutorial arguments that Darden challenged had not trivialized the role of the jury as had the invalid arguments in <em>Caldwell. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-14\">Unlike <em>Darden, </em>however, the principles of <em>Caldwell </em>are directly applicable here. Tucker challenges comments by the prosecutor during the sentencing phase of his trial, comments that trivialized the jury\u2019s responsibility for the sentencing decision. Hence, the heightened reliability in capital sentencing, required by the eighth amendment, was compromised. Unlike <em>Darden </em>and <em>Donnelly, </em>this case concerns the denial of eighth amendment protection, and therefore this court\u2019s fundamental fairness inquiry entails the enhanced scrutiny required of cases \u201cin which the State has denied a defendant the benefit of a specific provision of the Bill of Rights.\u201d <em>Donnelly, </em>416 U.S. at 643, 94 S.Ct. at 1871. As the <em>Caldwell </em>Court framed the inquiry, this court\u2019s role is to determine whether the state\u2019s effort to minimize the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of a death sentence in this case had no effect on the sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>B. <em>The Effect of the Prosecutor\u2019s Comments Analyzed Pursuant to Caldwell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">The central theme of the prosecutor\u2019s argument at Tucker\u2019s sentencing proceeding falls squarely within the category of arguments prohibited by <em>Caldwell. </em>The principal thrust of the argument was that the jury did not have an especially significant responsibility in sentencing the defendant to death, but was only one of numerous decisionmakers. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument directly invited the jury to focus on other decisionmakers and to feel that the responsibility for determining the appropriate sentence rested elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-5\">But I for one want to tell you that you are not the ones who do it if he\u2019s executed. <em>It does not rest on your shoulders, ladies and gentlemen. </em>Policemen did their duty and they went out and made the case. The Grand Jury down there did its duty and it indicted him and charged him with these horrible offenses. The District Attorney\u2019s Office prosecuted the case, located the witnesses and brought them in. The Judge, the Court came in and presided at the trial. And ladies and gentlemen, you are the last link in this thing, and <em>if this man suffers the death penalty it\u2019s no more up to you than it is to anybody else, </em>the Grand Jury, or the police, or the District Attorney\u2019s Office. All of us are coming in and doing our duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">Tr. at 887 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-7\">The prosecutor also emphasized the care with which his office selected cases in which to seek the death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-8\">Now, ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve been here a number of years in the District Attorney\u2019s Office and I\u2019ve tried a number of cases, many cases as a matter of fact, and the death penalty is seldom requested in Columbus, it\u2019s very infrequently requested. And since I\u2019ve been here, it\u2019s been requested as a matter of fact, in the five years I\u2019ve been here, something less than a dozen times. It\u2019s not very often that we come in here and ask you to bring in a verdict of a death sentence on an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">Tr. at 877.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-12\">The prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the District Attorney\u2019s Office as the state\u2019s specialist in ferreting out cases appropriate for the death penalty could only have been intended to encourage the jury to rely on that office\u2019s selection of Tucker as an appropriate candidate for the death sentence rather than undertaking an individualized examination of the case itself. The prosecutor reinforced this argument in other comments. Instead of presenting a clear explanation to the jury of the factors it should consider, the prosecutor couched his whole presentation in terms of the factors that the state authorities had considered in deciding that Tucker deserved the death penalty: \u201cAnd there, of course, are a number of factors we look at when we consider bringing in a case and asking for a death sentence on it.\u201d Tr. at 877. \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, when we ask for a death sentence, as we are doing in this case, we consider a number of things, as I\u2019ve already mentioned. Tr. at 880. In sum, the prosecutor urged the jury to regard the sentencing decision as a fait accompli \u2014 the decision that Tucker deserved the death penalty had already been made by a responsible legal authority. As in <em>Caldwell, </em>the improper comments here were \u201cfocused, unambiguous, and strong,\u201d and \u201csought to give the jury a view of its role in the capital sentencing procedure that was fundamentally incompatible with the Eighth Amendment.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 2645.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-13\">As in <em>Caldwell, </em>the trial court did not give strong curative instructions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>the instructions given by the court to Tucker\u2019s sentencing jury exacerbated the effect of the improper comments. As noted above, the court stated several times that the jury\u2019s decision would be a recommendation and thus underscored the prosecutor\u2019s argument minimizing the jury\u2019s responsibility for the verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even though the court\u2019s instructions may not have constituted reversible error in and of themselves, they increased the possibility that the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument affected the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for the sentencing decision. In any event, the trial court did not give <em>any </em>curative instructions similar to those considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Donnelly </em>in determining that the prosecutorial error there was harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-4\">Finally, we must consider the effect of the comments minimizing the jury\u2019s responsibility in light of the overall circumstances of the sentencing phase. First, the comments were <em>not </em>an invited response to an argument by the defendant. This factor, which has been considered in cases of prosecutorial misconduct at the guilt phase, <em>see, e.g., Darden, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2471; <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), cannot excuse the misconduct in this case where the prosecutor\u2019s argument did not respond to the evidence presented by Tucker and preceded Tucker\u2019s closing argument. Second, and more important, the prosecution\u2019s other improper arguments increased the probability that the comments had an effect on the sentencing decision. There was persistent prosecutorial misconduct throughout the closing argument which violated the canons of professional responsibility as well as judicial precedent. Conger repeatedly presented irrelevant and inflammatory argument to the sentencing jury. Judge Johnson, in his opinion for the original panel in this case, 724 F.2d 882 (11th Cir.1984), and Judge Clark, in his dissenting opinion in the first en banc consideration of this case, 762 F.2d 1480, 1491 (11th Cir.1985), discussed at length the numerous improprieties in the other arguments advanced at the sentencing hearing by the prosecution. I will not revisit all of those improprieties here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-7\">Several of these other arguments, such as the focus on the victim\u2019s character as opposed to Tucker\u2019s and the emphasis on the taxpayers\u2019 money that would support Tucker in prison, drew the jury\u2019s attention away from the narrowly channeled discretion that must attend a decision to impose the death sentence. <em>See Zant v. Stephens, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>462 U.S. 862, 876-77, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 2742-43, 77 L.Ed.2d 235 (1983) (consensus of <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) was that sentencing discretion must be suitably limited to minimize the risk of arbitrary action).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, unlike the state\u2019s case of aggravation in <em>Caldwell </em>which included four aggravating factors, including two prior convictions for armed robberies, here the state presented only one aggravating factor: the murder was committed during the commission of another capital felony, kidnapping with bodily injury. The state relied on the facts surrounding the one instance of serious criminal behavior. In mitigation, however, there was evidence presented as to several aspects of Tucker\u2019s character and record. Perhaps most significantly, the defense pointed out that Tucker did not have a previous criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">Applying the <em>Caldwell </em>standard, I cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s effort to minimize the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of death \u201chad no effect on the sentencing decision.\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2646. Accordingly, Tucker\u2019s sentence \u201cdoes not meet the standard of reliability that the Eighth Amendment requires,\u201d <em>id., </em>and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">. This latter argument distinguishes this case from <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (improper prosecutorial argument at <em>guilt </em>phase did not violate Caldwell), in that here the prosecutorial misconduct \"implicate[d] ... specific rights of the accused such as the right to counsel [and] the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Darden, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2472. <em>See United States v. Hopkins, </em>464 F.2d 816, 822 (D.C.Cir.1972) (sentence may not be premised on defendant\u2019s refusal to express remorse).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-17\">Conger also urged the jury to return a death sentence because Tucker, unlike the victim, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>had the benefit of an attorney and a jury trial and had been advised of his rights at the time of his arrest. Sentencing Hearing T. (Tr.) at 878-79. Conger thus argued that the death sentence was appropriate because, until the sentencing hearing, Tucker had received due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-14\"><em>See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S.Ct. 663, 667, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (\"For an agent of the State to pursue a course of action whose objective is to penalize a person\u2019s reliance on his legal rights is \u2018patently unconstitutional.' \").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1381-8\">. I do not agree with the majority\u2019s assumption that the precedential reach of <em>Caldwell </em>is limited to cases involving improper jury instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">. The record below reveals that Tucker\u2019s case was the <em>tenth </em>case within the preceding <em>sixteen months </em>in which the prosecutor\u2019s office had sought the death sentence. See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit Seven, The Columbus Ledger at B-l (Dec. 3, 1977). Even if the prosecutor\u2019s statement was technically correct and his office had only sought the death penalty once in the first three years and eight months of his tenure, his statement was undeniably misleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1382-15\">. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s observation that \"the trial judge in this case correctly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>structed the jury and did not put his imprimatur on erroneous information.\" As previously noted, the court\u2019s brief charge six times erroneously suggested to the jury that its verdict was merely advisory. Moreover, in considering the effect of erroneous jury instructions, we do not examine for a judicial imprimatur on erroneous information. In <em>Francis v. Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985), the Court indicated that the correct standard for reviewing improper instructions is whether a reasonable juror <em>could </em>have interpreted the instruction in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution. 105 S.Ct. at 1975 n. 8. <em>Franklin </em>further teaches that a defective charge is not rehabilitated by a subsequent correct charge: a charge must unambiguously reject the defective charge and state the law correctly. <em>Id. </em>I believe the same analysis applies in capital sentencing proceedings. It is not enough that a capital sentencing charge remain silent in the face of opposing counsels\u2019 misstatements of the law: the trial court must clearly reject the misstatements and unambiguously instruct as to the proper legal standard. <em>See Donnelly, </em>416 U.S. at 644, 94 S.Ct. at 1872 (\u201ctrial court took special pains to correct\" prosecution\u2019s misleading argument). Here, the court did not reject the prosecution\u2019s argument negating the jury\u2019s responsibility and further compounded its error by suggesting that the jury\u2019s verdict was merely a \u201crecommendation\u201d and hence nonbinding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1383-9\">. Although O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-31 provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed unless the jury <em>finds </em>an aggravating circumstance and <em>recommends </em>the death penalty, the jury's sentencing verdict is not advisory. The Georgia trial court <em>must </em>pronounce the sentence determined by the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1383-10\"><em>. </em>In <em>Donnelly </em>the prosecution improperly argued at the guilt phase that the defense wanted a conviction on a lesser included offense. The trial court unambiguously instructed the jury that it could not consider this argument. 416 U.S. at 640-41, 94 S.Ct. at 1870. Thus even if <em>Donnelly </em>controls here, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Tucker </em>trial instructions negated the prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1384-18\">. At sentencing the relevant issue is not whether there was overwhelming evidence of guilt. Rather, once a guilty verdict has been entered, a Georgia jury\u2019s attention must turn to determining what aggravating factors, if any, exist, and to assessing the appropriateness of a death sentence in light of \"the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense.\" <em>Woodson, </em>428 U.S. at 304, 96 S.Ct. at 2991. Thus Conger\u2019s repeated expression of his opinion that the evidence of Tucker\u2019s guilt was overwhelming further misled the jury from its task at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
