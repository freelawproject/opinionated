Wallace contends that the Commission\u2019s application of the 1983 Parole Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) to his parole determination violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution, art. 1 \u00a7 9, cl. 3. He also argues the Commission abused its discretion and was arbitrary and capricious in determining his \u201coffense behavior\u201d rating for parole purposes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-13\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-14\">In November 1982 a jury found Wallace guilty of extortion (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951), use of an explosive to commit a felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h)), and possession of an unregistered destructive device (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d)). Wallace and his brother (the \u201cdefendants\u201d) had attempted to extort $400,000 by making a bomb threat via telephone to American Airlines ground personnel at Los Angeles International Airport. The defendants stated that a bomb had been placed in a suitcase which was located in the luggage loading area for an American Airlines flight scheduled to depart later that day. They provided a description of the location of the suitcase, and told officials that they would reveal the location of two other bombs after the airline paid them $400,000. Security officers subsequently removed the bomb from the loading area. The bomb contained explosives. Although the bomb was not completely wired and, therefore, not operational, it could have been set off by radio transmissions at the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-15\">On January 6, 1983 Wallace was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(2). A copy of Wallace\u2019s sentence and prior record was forwarded to the Western Region, United States Parole Commission (the \u201cregional commission\u201d) for a parole evaluation. His first parole hearing was held in November 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-16\">Between the time Wallace was sentenced and his first parole hearing, the Commission revised the Parole Commission Offense Behavior Severity Index portion of the Guidelines. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20. Adopted on an experimental basis in 1972 and promulgated pursuant to the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-233, 90 Stat. 219-231 (1976) (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4201-18) [the \u201cParole Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d], the Guidelines take the form of a \u201cgrid\u201d or \u201cmatrix\u201d for the setting of presumptive parole dates. On the vertical side, the prisoner is given an \u201coffense behavior\u201d rating from category one through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>eight (\u201clow severity\u201d to \u201cGreatest II severity\u201d) based upon the type of offense committed and the characteristics of the offense in that particular case (i.e., use of force, value of items stolen, if any). The 1983 revision added to the \u201coffense behavior\u201d categories a category seven \u201cInterference with a Flight Crew.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20 (242)(a). On the horizontal side, the prisoner is given a \u201csalient factor\u201d score ranging from \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201cvery good\u201d based upon such factors as prior convictions, parole violations and escapes, age, and drug dependence. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20, at 101; <em>United States Parole Commission Rules and Procedures Manual, </em>61-66 (1983). The \u201coffense behavior\u201d rating and \u201csalient factor\u201d score are then correlated to arrive at a presumptive parole range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-5\">Applying the 1983 Guidelines, as amended, and after notice and hearing, the regional commission classified Wallace\u2019s \u201coffense behavior\u201d as \u201cInterference with a Flight Crew\u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1623-6\">This offense certainly had the potential to cause injury or death and destruction of aircraft. At least one bomb was placed in luggage about to be placed on flight 75 to San Diego and allegedly two other bombs were to have been placed on two other flights. Certainly the explosive device which was found in luggage as described by the call to the FBI which was destined for flight 75 had the potential to cause death or serious injury to innocent bystanders and certainly to those law enforcement personnel charged with disarming the device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1623-7\">The regional commission gave Wallace a \u201csalient factor\u201d score of \u201cgood.\u201d The \u201coffense behavior\u201d rating of seven, when correlated with a \u201csalient factor\u201d score of \u201cgood,\u201d gave Wallace a presumptive parole range of sixty-four to ninety-two months. The regional commission set a presumptive parole date of seventy-eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-10\">Wallace filed an appeal with the full Commission alleging that application to his case of the 1983 Guidelines, as amended, violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the United States Constitution. He contended that had the Guidelines been applied at the time he was committed and began serving his sentence, the only offense classification then applicable would have been \u201cExtortion.\u201d Wallace argued he would have received an \u201coffense behavior\u201d rating of \u201cfive\u201d instead of the \u201cseven\u201d applied by the regional commission under the amended Guidelines for \u201cInterference with a Flight Crew.\u201d Wallace also argued that the regional commission\u2019s calculation of his \u201coffense behavior\u201d as \u201cseven\u201d was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-11\">The full Commission denied Wallace\u2019s appeal, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1623-12\"><em>Reasons: </em>In response to your claim that your offense severity has [been incorrectly] rated as Category Seven, this claim is without merit. Your conduct had the potential for creating a significant safety risk to an aircraft or passengers and has been correctly placed in the Category Seven rating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1623-13\">It is the Commission\u2019s policy that the ex post facto clause does not apply to paroling policy guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1623-14\">In July 1984 Wallace filed the present habeas corpus petition in the district court realleging the claims made before the full Commission. The district court denied the petition and Wallace appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-16\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-17\">A. <em>Review of Commission\u2019s Decisions Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4203(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1623-18\">We first consider our jurisdiction to review decisions made by the Commission acting under the authority granted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4203(b)(1), (2), (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>of the Parole Act empowers the Commission, by majority vote and under proper procedures, to grant, deny, modify or revoke, or impose reasonable conditions upon (hereinafter \u201cgrant or deny\u201d) parole. Wallace argues that our jurisdiction to review these decisions is plenary and extends to a claim that the Commission abused its discretion in determining an \u201coffense behavior\u201d rating and a \u201csalient factor\u201d score. The government responds that our jurisdiction to review any decision of the Commission is limited to claims that the Commission violated the Constitution, a statute, or a regulatory command.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-4\">Previous cases in this circuit have referred to an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard as the basis for review of Commission decisions, and have implicitly assumed the existence of jurisdiction to conduct that analysis. <em>See, e.g., Tatum v. Christensen, </em>786 F.2d 959, 963 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Torres-Macias v. United States Parole Commission, </em>730 F.2d 1214, 1216 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Roth v. United States Parole Commission, </em>724 F.2d 836, 839-40 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Williams v. United States Parole Commission, </em>707 F.2d 1060, 1063-64 (9th Cir. 1983); <em>Hatton v. Keohane, </em>693 F.2d 88, 90 (9th Cir.1982); <em>O\u2019Brien v. Putman, </em>591 F.2d 53, 55 (9th Cir.1979). We took this case en banc to reconsider this assumption and evaluate our standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-5\">1. <em>Preliminary Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1624-6\">We begin our analysis by acknowledging an enduring principle of federal jurisdiction. The federal courts, both primary and appellate, were created and remain courts of limited jurisdiction. <em>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, </em>437 U.S. 365, 374, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 2402, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978); <em>Sheldon v. Sill, </em>49 U.S. 441, 445-46, 12 L.Ed. 1147 (8 How. 1850); <em>Jones v. Giles, </em>741 F.2d 245, 248 (9th Cir.1984). In each case, the threshold question of jurisdiction must be addressed and answered before the merits may be reached and resolved. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>That we have assumed the existence of jurisdiction to review an agency\u2019s determinations on previous occasions does not end our present analysis. Our task is to examine the relevant statutory framework, specific review provisions, and congressional intent to determine whether we may review an agency\u2019s decisions. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 366-74, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1165-69, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (examining these factors involving decisions by Veterans\u2019 Administration); <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 139-41, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1510-11, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (same, decisions under Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act); <em>Garcia v. Neagle, </em>660 F.2d 983, 987-88 (4th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1153, 102 S.Ct. 1023, 71 L.Ed.2d 309 (1982) (same, Parole Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-9\">We bring an important presumption to this inquiry. Established principles of separation-of-powers counsel against loosely inferring a congressional intent to preclude judicial review of administrative decisions. <em>See, e.g., Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 2135-36, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986); <em>Abbott Laboratories, </em>387 U.S. at 140, 87 S.Ct. at 1511. <em>See also Barlow v. Collins, </em>397 U.S. 159, 165-66, 90 S.Ct. 832, 836-37, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970); Sunstein, <em>Reviewing Agency Inaction After Heckler v. Chaney, 52 </em>U.Chi.L.Rev. 653, 678-79 (1985). Judicial review, therefore, is presumed unless the statute precludes review or the action is \u201ccommitted ... entirely to administrative discretion.\u201d <em>Barlow, </em>397 U.S. at 165, 90 S.Ct. at 837 (discussing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2)); <em>Morris v. Gressette, </em>432 U.S. 491, 500-01, 97 S.Ct. 2411, 2418-19, 53 L.Ed.2d 506 (1977). Conversely, we may not review an agency decision \u201cto the extent that ... statutes preclude judicial review ... [or] agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 1654, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) <em>(quoting 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(1), (2)); <em>see also Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); <em>Barlow, </em>397 U.S. at 165, 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>S.Ct. at 836.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have recently stated that where agency action is committed by law to agency discretion, a court has no jurisdiction to review for abuse of discretion the informed judgments of administrative officials. <em>Abdelhamid v. Ilchert, </em>774 F.2d 1447,1450 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(citing Strickland v. Morton, </em>519 F.2d 467, 470 (9th Cir.1975), and other authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-5\">With these general principles in mind, we turn to a consideration of the statutory scheme of the Parole Act, the review provisions, and congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-6\">2. <em>Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1625-7\">The Parole Act of 1976 was the product of nearly a decade of study and evaluation by the executive and legislative branches. S.Rep. No. 94-369, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 16, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 335, 338 [hereinafter <em>Senate Report </em>]. The principal elements of the legislation were the establishment of: (a) a Parole Commission to grant or deny parole and promulgate guidelines; (b) formalized procedures governing parole dispositions to assure fairness and uniformity; and (c) an administrative appeals process to expedite dispositions. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 336-37. The drafters of the Act stated: \u201cIt [was] not the purpose of this legislation to either encourage or discourage the parole of any prisoner____ Rather, the purpose [was] to assure ... that parole decisions are openly reached by a fair and reasonable process after due consideration has been given to the salient information.\u201d <em>Joint House-Senate Conference Report </em>No. 94-838, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. 19, 20, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 351, 353 [hereinafter <em>Joint Report </em>]. Although Congress recognized that a prisoner is not entitled to parole as a matter of right, it sought to establish a system of parole that would \u201c[have] both the fact and appearance of fairness to all.\u201d <em>Senate Report, supra </em>at 19, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 340. <em>See also </em>121 Cong.Rec. 15705 (1975) (statement of Rep. Drinan) (\u201cIs there a right to parole? Is this a qualified right? I would say no to both of those questions____ Parole is the implementation of a correctional policy and if a prisoner abides by the rules of the prison, and that is the given condition, then he has a right to due process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-18\">To achieve these objectives, Congress established a general procedural and substantive framework within which parole deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>sions would be made. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4208 (procedures governing parole hearing), and 4215 (administrative appeal provisions). Section 4205(a) of the Act requires the Commission to consider parole when a prisoner has served one-third of his or her sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4205(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.53(a). <em>See also Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 991. In making parole determinations, the Commission must consider certain information, if available and relevant, including reports and recommendations by staff, physical and mental examinations, and statements by victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.19 (1983). The Commission must also consider the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and the \u201chistory and characteristics of the prisoner,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(a), and take into account whether release would \u201cdepreciate the seriousness of [the] offense,\u201d \u201cpromote disrespect for the law,\u201d or \u201cjeopardize the public welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4206(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-5\">Section 4203(a)(1) of the Act requires that the Commission \u201cpromulgate rules and regulations establishing guidelines for the powers enumerated in [section 4203(b)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4203(a)(1). Although Congress recognized that parole decisions often involve \u201csubjective judgments],\u201d <em>Senate Report, supra </em>at 16, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 337,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it sought to reduce the disparity among similarly situated prisoners and provide fairer and more predictable parole determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 18, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 340. <em>See Kills Crow v. United States, </em>555 F.2d 183, 186 (8th Cir.1977); 61 A.L.R.Fed. 135, 146-48, \u00a7 3 (1983 &amp; Supp.1985) (citing authorities). As evidence of Congress\u2019s intent to promote more uniform parole dispositions, section 4206(c) of the Act provides that the \u201cCommission may grant or deny release on parole notwithstanding the guidelines referred to in subsection (a) of this section if it determines there is good cause for so doing....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(c). Commenting on this section, Senator Burdick stated: \u201cAlthough exceptions to these guidelines would be permitted when the Parole Commission can establish reason that warrants it, it is anticipated that most decisions to grant or deny parole will be based on guidelines.\u201d 122 Cong.Rec. 4861 (1976) (statement of Sen. Burdick). Congress intended that \u201cgood cause\u201d to deviate from the Guidelines would include \u201conly those grounds put forward by the Commission in good faith and which are not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, irrelevant or capricious.\u201d <em>Joint Report, supra, </em>at 27, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-10\">3. <em>Review Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AoG7\">As part of the foregoing statutory framework, section 4218 of the Parole Act contains provisions governing the availability of judicial review. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4218. Section 4218(c) of the Act provides that actions of the Commission in promulgating the Guidelines, which are <em>procedural </em>in nature, are \u201creviewable in accordance with the provisions of sections 701 through 706 of title Five, United States Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4218(c); <em>Joint Report, supra </em>at 36, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 368 <em>(citing Pickus v. United States Board of Parole, </em>507 F.2d 1107 (D.C.Cir.1974)). <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (establishing procedures governing enactment of agency rules). Section 4218(d) of the Act, however, provides that decisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>Commission in granting, denying, conditioning, modifying or revoking parole under section 4203(b)(1), (2), (3), which are <em>substantive </em>in nature, are committed to the discretion of the Commission and are not reviewable under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">By these provisions, Congress has specifically rebutted the presumption of reviewability of the Commission\u2019s substantive decisions to grant or deny parole, and, therefore, these decisions may not be reviewed even for abuse of discretion. <em>See Farkas v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 37, 38-39 (6th Cir.1984) (\u201csubstantive decisions\u201d of Commission unreviewable); <em>Garafola v.

Although Congress was concerned that individual parole decisions be both fair and uniform, it also recognized the imprecise nature of many parole determinations. <em>Joint Report, supra </em>at 26, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S. Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News at 358. Several members of the House of Representatives expressed concern that promulgation of the Guidelines would cause an increase in litigation in the district courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1627-9\">The other thing that disturbs me about this bill, and there is not anything in this bill that would say there is any right of judicial review when a parole is denied, but once we write into the law even a qualified right of an individual for certain relief, I cannot see how we can avoid giving a prisoner the opportunity to test the denial of that relief in the courts, and I am very apprehensive that the U.S. district courts will begin to receive a great many petitions based upon the proposition that the Parole Board did not fulfill the requirements of the statute in denying the parole of the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1627-10\">121 Cong.Rec. 15704 (1975) (statement of Rep.

Drinan).</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-5\">Hence, the legislative history of the Act substantiates our conclusion that Congress intended to exempt from judicial review the Commission\u2019s substantive decisions to grant or deny parole and that these decisions, therefore, are unreviewable even for abuse of discretion. <em>Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 988 &amp; n. 5 (discussing legislative history).</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-6\">B. <em>Scope of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1628-7\">This conclusion alone, however, does not end our jurisdictional inquiry. The Commission\u2019s decisions to grant or deny parole are not rendered in a vacuum or made without reference to standards. Rather, each substantive parole decision is the product of a carefully delineated process established by Congress and implemented by the Commission. Congress has directed that the Commission establish Guidelines and make parole determinations on the basis of these Guidelines except for \u201cgood cause.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4203(a)(1), 4206(c). As noted, the Guidelines prescribe the method by which the Commission calculates the \u201csalient factor\u201d score and the \u201coffense behavior\u201d rating. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20. The Commission has declared that its regional commissions may deviate from the presumptive parole range of the Guidelines \u201c[wjhere circumstances warrant,\u201d 28 C. F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.20(c); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 2.21(c), but consistent with congressional mandate, the Commission must provide a statement of reasons for such deviation. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(c); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.20(d), (e), 2.26(e). The Commission\u2019s substantive decisions to grant or deny parole under section 4203(b), therefore, are rendered only <em>after </em>it has evaluated the relevant factors, interpreted and applied the Guidelines, determined whether to deviate from them, and established a presumptive parole date. <em>See Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. at 188, 99 S.Ct. at 2242 (\u201cThe decision as to when a lawfully sentenced defendant shall actually be released has been committed by Congress, <em>with certain limitations, </em>to the discretion of the Parole Commission\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-10\">To recognize, as we must, that the Commission\u2019s substantive decisions to grant or deny parole are unreviewable does not necessarily answer whether the Commission\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines are also shielded from review. <em>See, e.g., Garcia, </em>660 F.2d 988-90 (recognizing that decision to grant or deny parole is unreviewable but then considering whether application of the Guidelines is subject to review); <em>Dye v. United States Parole Commission, </em>558 F.2d 1376, 1378 (10th Cir.1977) (same); <em>Brown v. Lundgren, </em>528 F.2d 1050, 1054-55 (5th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 917, 97 S.Ct. 308, 50 L.Ed.2d 283 (1976). We must still determine whether and to what extent the removal of our jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s <em>decisions </em>to grant or deny parole also precludes our review of the Commission\u2019s decision-making <em>processes. </em>We recognize that framing the issue in this manner tends to invite an \u201call or nothing response.\u201d That is, one might be tempted to reply that a court may either review <em>all </em>of the Commission\u2019s interpretations and applications of the Guidelines or it may review <em>none </em>of these processes. We believe the proper answer lies somewhere in between. Before rendering our view on this issue, however, and perhaps as a means of doing so, we think it will prove helpful to consider the two \u201call or nothing\u201d positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-11\">1. <em>The No Review Position</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1628-12\">The first view is that we may not review any aspect of the Commission\u2019s decision-making processes. According to this view, Congress has committed to agency discretion all action taken by the Commission \u201cpursuant\u201d to its power to grant or deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>parole. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4218(d). The Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is an element of the ultimate decision to grant or deny parole. Since the court has no power to review the Commission\u2019s ultimate parole decision, therefore, it has no power to review the process by which the Commission reaches that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-4\">While this argument has a certain syllogistic appeal based on a mathematical hypothesis that the greater includes the lesser, this axiom is not necessarily logical or compelling when applied to the question of jurisdiction under the Parole Act. In construing a statute, we begin with the language employed by Congress. <em>United, States v. James, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 3116, 3121, 92 L.Ed.2d 483 (1986); <em>Vance v. Hegstrom, </em>793 F.2d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 1986). The language of the Act indicates that Congress has limited the scope of discretion granted the Commission. Under section 4206 of the Act the Commission may deviate from the Guidelines, but only for \u201cgood cause.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(c). <em>See also </em>122 Cong.Rec. 4861 (1976) (statement of Sen. Burdick) <em>(quoted supra). </em>The Commission must also consider certain information and factors in rendering parole determinations. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4206(a)(1), (2), 4207(1), (2), (3), (4), (5). The language of the Parole Act reveals no congressional design to allow the Commission to transgress these limitations. <em>See Farkas, </em>744 F.2d at 39 (court may consider claim that Guidelines violate statute); <em>Garafola, </em>721 F.2d at 424 (same); <em>Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 988 (court may consider whether Guidelines \u201cas promulgated and applied, violate the intent and directives of the Parole Act\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We must therefore reject the view that Congress has placed no limits on the scope of discretion granted the Commission, or that the Commission\u2019s decision-making processes are completely shielded from judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-10\">The legislative history of the Act reinforces these conclusions. <em>See Michigan Academy, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2139-40 (examining legislative history to analyze certain statutory provisions of Medicare Act, notwithstanding that Congress excluded certain aspects of Medicare decisions from review). By excluding decisions under section 4203(b) from the review provisions of the APA, Congress did <em>not </em>intend to modify then existing case law on the limitations on judicial review of parole decisions. <em>See, e.g., Joint Report, supra </em>at 36, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 368 <em>(quoted supra </em>in full; section 4218 \u201creflects the present law with respect to limitations on judicial review of individual parole decisions\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 21, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 353 (\u201cThe legislation provides a new statement of criteria for parole determinations, which are within the discretion of the agency, but <em>reaffirms existing case law </em>as to judicial review of individual case decisions.\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also Luther, </em>627 F.2d at 75 &amp; n. 5. At the time the full House and Senate considered the passage of the Act, Senator Burdick stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-11\">The legislation provides for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s rulemaking procedure, but also carefully preserves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>existing limitations on judicial review of individual parole decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-4\">122 Cong.Rec. 4862 (1976) (statement of Sen. Burdick).</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-5\">Representative Drinan echoed this understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-6\">It should be kept in mind however, that the conferees do not intend to preclude review under provisions of law other than the APA. It may be, for example, that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus might lie for certain allegedly unlawful acts of the Commission even if they involve individual parole decisions. But that is a matter left to the courts and this bill expresses no opinion, one way or the other in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-7\">In short, the bill which emerged from the conference did not alter to any significant degree the applicability of the APA to the acts and practices of the Parole Commission. And those provisions as contained in this bill, recognizing to a limited degree the peculiar nature of the parole process, are fair and equitable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7gt\">122 Cong.Rec. 5164 (1976) (statement of Rep. Drinan).</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-8\">The decisions among the various circuits at the time Congress passed the Parole Act, and Congress\u2019s perception of this case law, is thus crucial to understanding the Commission\u2019s discretion under section 4218(d). The courts at the time of the Act were not entirely unanimous on the issue of review of parole determinations by the (then) Parole Board. Several courts had held that these decisions, and the Board\u2019s decision-making processes, were unreviewable. <em>See, e.g., Pickus, </em>507 F.2d at 1113; <em>Tarlton v. Clark, </em>441 F.2d 384, 385 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 934, 91 S.Ct. 2263, 29 L.Ed.2d 713 (1971); <em>Thompkins v. United States Board of Parole, </em>427 F.2d 222-23 (5th Cir.1970). Other courts had stated that these decisions were reviewable for abuse of discretion. <em>Dye, </em>558 F.2d at 1378 (recognizing commitment to discretion but reviewing decisions for abuse of discretion); <em>Billiteri v. United States Board of Parole, </em>541 F.2d 938, 944 (2nd Cir.1976) (citing authorities).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nearly all of the circuits, however, agreed that the decisions of the Parole Board were committed to discretion, and that the Board\u2019s decisions (and interpretation of the Guidelines) could not be so \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d as to violate the Constitution. <em>See id. </em>(and cases cited <em>supra). See also Brown, </em>528 F.2d at 1054; <em>Calabro, </em>525 F.2d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-11\">At the time Congress considered the House version of the Parole Act, Congressman Wiggins (now our colleague on this court) expressed his understanding of these cases in language that we find significant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ankp\">Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a few additional observations with respect to judicial review. As I have indicated, the bill neither adds to nor subtracts from any judicial review rights presently enjoyed by an inmate in an institution. Some may feel that existing judicial review is unwarranted. How could we tolerate for one moment in this country arbitrary governmental action? Clearly, it should not go unchallenged. Existing law, which this bill does not add to, permits challenges to a decision of a parole board where the claimed action of the parole board is arbitrary, capricious, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>in violation of law. Retreat from this existing law would be wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1631-5\">It seems to me that it is consistent with the American system of fairness that if a parole applicant can demonstrate in a judicial proceeding that the parole authorities have violated their own rule, or that the parole authorities have acted arbitrarily, that man should not be denied a remedy. This bill does not create the remedy. That is already available to him under existing law. Accordingly this argument about excessive judicial review, I think, is overdrawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ2L\">121 Cong.Rec. 15706 (1975) (statement of Rep. Wiggins).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1631-6\">The Senate Report contained the following statement regarding the limits on the Commission\u2019s decision-making powers in the context of constitutional challenges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Add_\">The constitutional test to be applied to parole is not one of right, but whether or not parole is administered in a fashion that is neither arbitrary nor capricious to the individual, nor unfairly jeopardizes the legitimate aim of society to control deviant behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1631-7\"><em>Senate Report, supra, </em>at 19, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-8\">Hence, the language and legislative history of the Parole Act do not indicate that Congress intended to give the Commission an unbridled discretion or remove the Commission\u2019s decision-making processes entirely from judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-9\">2. <em>The Plenary Review Position</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1631-10\">The second view builds upon the foregoing analysis but goes a step farther. According to this view, although the ultimate decision to grant or deny parole may be committed to discretion, see <em>Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. at 188-89, 99 S.Ct. at 2242, the <em>process </em>of decision-making is not. At a minimum, the requirement that the Commission show \u201cgood cause\u201d for rendering a decision \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d the Guidelines (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(c)) authorizes a court to review the Commission\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines for abuse of discretion. If the Commission has abused its discretion in interpreting and applying the Guidelines, then it has rendered a decision outside the scope of discretion granted by Congress. In short, the greater <em>excludes </em>the lesser; the power to exercise discretion to grant or deny parole does not include the power to abuse that discretion in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-14\">Like the first view, however, the second also ignores significant parts of the legislative history. In the Joint Report on the Parole Act, Congress repeatedly emphasized that certain \u201cprocess\u201d decisions were committed to the Commission\u2019s discretion and were, in the words of Congressman Drinan, therefore \u201cexempted ... from review in the courts under the APA.\u201d 122 Cong.Rec. 5164 (1976) (statement of Rep. Drinan). The Joint Report stated: \u201cIt is the intent of the Conferees that the Parole Commission make certain judgments pursuant to [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206 (establishing criteria for parole decisions) ], and that the substance of those judgments is committed to the discretion of the Commission.\u201d <em>Joint Report, supra </em>at 25, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 358. Specifically, Congress intended that these decisions should include \u201cjudgments\u201d as to: the \u201cinstitutional behavior of each prospective parolee,\u201d <em>id.; </em>the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the prisoner,\u201d <em>id.; </em>the \u201cconcepts of general and special deterrence, retribution and punishment____,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 26, 1976 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News at 358; the \u201crelevance of material before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>Commission,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 28, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 360; and the \u201cstatement of criteria for parole determinations, ...\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 353. By committing these judgments to discretion, Congress created a zone or field within which the Commission could exercise \u201cabsolute discretion.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 989. Congress did not intend to permit review within this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-4\">The contention that we may review all aspects of the parole decision-making process for abuse of discretion contains two other serious problems. First, Wallace and other prisoners who contest the Commission\u2019s parole determinations proceed in federal court by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The purpose of the \u201cGreat Writ\u201d is to release individuals from <em>unlawful </em>or <em>illegal </em>confinement. <em>See, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>Nguyen Da Yen v. Kissinger, </em>528 F.2d 1194, 1202 (9th Cir.1975). A prisoner, however, has no general right to release on parole. <em>See, e.g., Stroud v. United States Parole Commission, </em>668 F.2d 843, 847 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Brown, </em>528 F.2d at 1054-55. As the drafters of the Parole Act stated: \u201cParole is neither a matter of right for the inmate nor a matter of grace for the state, it is a matter of administrative discretion.\u201d <em>Senate Report, supra </em>at 19, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 341. In light of the unmistakable congressional intent to shield the decision to grant or deny parole from the review provisions of the APA, we cannot agree that every potential \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d within the Commission\u2019s scope of discretion constitutes an \u201cillegal\u201d detention. <em>See Luther, </em>627 F.2d at 76 (also recognizing that detention may be illegal in some circumstances; <em>see </em>our discussion <em>infra)', Brown, </em>528 F.2d at 1054-55; <em>de la Cova v. Gonzalez Abreu v. United States, </em>611 F.Supp. 137, 140 (D.P.R.1985) (same).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1632-7\">Second, a plenary review of the Commission\u2019s decision-making processes effectively nullifies the congressional directive that the decision to grant or deny parole is committed to discretion. The <em>process </em>of decision-making may not be separated, conceptually or practically, from the ultimate <em>decision </em>to grant or deny parole. This is because the Commission always interprets and applies the Guidelines in rendering parole decisions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(a) (and our discussion at section B <em>supra). </em>To state that a court may review the decision-making process but not the product effectively nullifies the scope of absolute discretion granted by Congress. For if a court may review the Commission\u2019s analysis and interpretation of the Guidelines, it may always second-guess the substantive decision to grant or deny parole. We find unacceptable a statutory construction which eviscerates the limitations on judicial review established by Congress in the Parole Act. <em>See Chaney, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1655 (rejecting similar mode of analysis; recognizing \u201cthe commonsense principle of statutory construction that sections of a statute generally should be read \u2018to give effect, if possible, to every clause ... [.]\u2019 see <em>United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538, 75 S.Ct. 513, 520, 99 L.Ed. 615 [ (1955) ]....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-8\">3. <em>Resolution and Jurisdictional Conclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1632-9\">From the foregoing critique of the two \u201call or nothing\u201d approaches we draw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>following conclusions regarding our jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s decision-making processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-5\">a. Our review of the provisions of the Parole Act and its legislative history reveals that Congress intended to carve out an area of decision-making which, like the decision to grant or deny parole, is committed to agency discretion and hence unreviewable even for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 988-89 (and cases cited <em>supra). </em>This area includes \u201cjudgments\u201d made by the Commission involving a broad range of factors which it takes into account in arriving at the ultimate decision to grant or deny parole. <em>See Joint Report, supra </em>at 21, 25-26, 28, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 353, 358, 360 <em>(see </em>our discussion in section B2 <em>supra). </em>It follows that unless a petitioner alleges the Commission acted beyond the scope of discretion granted by Congress, a federal court has no jurisdiction to entertain his claim. By definition, a bare allegation that the Commission has abused <em>its discretion </em>acknowledges that the Commission has exercised a judgment, if improperly, within its discretion. Congress has specifically withdrawn such cases from our jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 990; <em>Brown, </em>528 F.2d at 1055. <em>See also infra </em>note 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-6\">b. Congress has, however, delineated boundaries beyond which the Commission may not act. A court may consider whether the Commission has acted outside these statutory limits. <em>See, e.g., Farkas, </em>744 F.2d at 39; <em>supra </em>note 4. A claim that the Commission has acted outside its statutory limits typically involves an issue of statutory construction which we review de novo. <em>See Arizona Department of Economic Security v. United States Department of Labor, </em>790 F.2d 782, 784 (9th Cir.1986). The Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Parole Act (and, if applicable, the Guidelines, see infra), however, is entitled to deference. <em>See id. See, e.g., Markair, Inc. v. CAB, </em>744 F.2d 1383, 1385 (9th Cir. 1984) <em>(citing NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 274-75, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1761-62, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974)). We have mentioned the limitations placed by Congress upon the Commission\u2019s decision-making processes. For example, Congress has provided that the Commission must take into account certain factors in rendering an individual parole decision. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4206(a)(1), (2), 4207 (if relevant and available). Although the relevance of the information considered by the Commission is a matter committed to discretion, <em>Joint Report, supra, </em>at 28, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News at 360, a court may review whether the Commission completely failed to consider these factors which by statute it is required to consider in rendering its parole decision. Similarly, Congress has provided that the Commission may render a parole decision \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d or \u201coutside\u201d the Guidelines upon a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4206(c); <em>Joint Report, supra, </em>at 27, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 359-60. A court has jurisdiction to consider a claim that the Commission failed to show \u201cgood cause.\u201d As noted, Congress has indicated that \u201cgood cause\u201d includes reasons put forth by the Commission in good faith which are not \u201carbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, irrelevant or capricious.\u201d <em>Joint Report, supra, </em>at 27, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-9\">A court may also consider whether the Commission rendered a decision \u201coutside\u201d the Guidelines and hence must show \u201cgood cause.\u201d If a court could not consider this issue, the requirement that the Commission show \u201cgood cause\u201d to render a decision \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d the Guidelines would be meaningless. To conclude otherwise would be novel and contrary to controlling precedent. Congress has written into the Act express limits on the Commission\u2019s actions, and hence we have jurisdiction to review whether those limits have been exceeded. <em>See supra </em>note 4 and accompanying text, and <em>infra </em>note 8 and accompanying text. <em>See Michigan Academy, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2136-42 (examining Medicare statute which precludes review of benefit \u201cdeterminations,\u201d but not the \u201cmeth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>od\u201d by which such decisions are made). However, Congress has recognized that the Commission must often make \u201cjudgments\u201d in applying the Guidelines on matters such as the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the prisoner, and has indicated that \u201cthe substance of those judgments is committed to the discretion of the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 358. In determining whether the Commission has \u201cgone outside\u201d the Guidelines, <em>id. </em>at 26, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 358, therefore, it is appropriate for the court to inquire whether the Commission has in fact made a \u201cjudgment\u201d within its discretion. Specifically, the court\u2019s inquiry is addressed to whether the Commission\u2019s decision involves the exercise of judgment among a range of possible choices or options, or involves a plain violation of a matter which does not admit of discretion and choice. <em>See Abdelhamid, </em>774 F.2d at 1450 (informed judgments of administrative officials unreviewable where action is committed to discretion). If the decision falls into the former category, the Commission has merely exercised a judgment within its discretion and judicial review must cease. <em>See Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 990 (applying this method of analysis in dispute over classification of \u201coffense behavior\u201d); <em>Brown, </em>528 F.2d at 1055 (same). If the decision falls into the latter category, however, the Commission\u2019s failure to follow the Guidelines renders its decision one made outside the Guidelines and the Commission must show \u201cgood cause\u201d for that action. To paraphrase former Congressman Wiggins, a prisoner should not be without a remedy where he can show a \u201cviolation\u201d of a non-discretionary standard (i.e., a \u201crule\u201d). 121 Cong.Rec. 15706 (1975) (statements of Rep. Wiggins).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1634-7\">c. Finally, a court has jurisdiction to consider whether the Commission violated the Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 109, 97 S.Ct. 980, 986, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 367-68, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1165-66, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (legislative history in that case indicated no intent to preclude constitutional review under particular statute); <em>Garcia, </em>660 F.2d at 988. We therefore have jurisdiction to entertain a claim that the Guidelines violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause, and this and other constitutional claims are reviewable de novo. <em>United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1200-01 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984). Similarly, a court could consider a claim that the Commission\u2019s action in granting or denying parole was so arbitrary as to violate due process. <em>Luther, </em>627 F.2d at 76; <em>Billiteri, </em>541 F.2d at 944; <em>Zannino, </em>531 F.2d 687, 690-91; <em>Senate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number><em>Report, supra </em>at 19, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 341. <em>See generally Wong Wing Hang v.

The Guidelines permit the classification of an offense as \u201cInterference with a Flight Crew\u201d if \u201cthe conduct or attempted conduct has potential for creating a significant safety risk to an aircraft or passengers....\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20 (242)(a). The Commission found that Wallace\u2019s offense had the potential to cause injury or death and destruction to an aircraft and passengers. The Commission\u2019s determination did not violate a mandatory or non-discretionary standard, but rather, involved a judgment among a range of possible choices and options relating to the severity of Wallace\u2019s offense. Wallace has pointed to no provision in the Act or Guidelines removing discretion from the Commission to classify his offense in this category. We hold that the Commission acted within the scope of discretion granted by Congress and hence our review of the Commission\u2019s classification of Wallace\u2019s offense is complete.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1635-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-10\">EX POST FACTO CHALLENGE TO THE GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-11\">We next consider Wallace\u2019s contention that the application of the 1983 Guidelines, as amended, violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-12\">\u201cEvery law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed\u201d violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution. <em>Colder v.

Our previous decisions in <em>Roth, </em>724 F.2d 836, 840; <em>Rifai, </em>586 F.2d at 697-99, and the decisions in the vast majority of other circuits, <em>see, e.g., Inglese v.

McCall, </em>709 F.2d 852, 859-63 (3rd Cir.1983), have held that the guidelines are not laws for purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. That Congress has placed boundaries on the Commission\u2019s discretion does not transform the Guidelines into law. As we stated in <em>Rifai, </em>the Guidelines are \u201cprocedural guideposts without the characteristics of laws.\u201d 586 F.2d at 698 (footnote omitted) <em>(citing Ruip v. United States, </em>555 F.2d 1331 (6th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1635-15\">We are not persuaded by Wallace\u2019s argument that the Guidelines are laws because the Commission allegedly sets presumptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>parole dates within the guidelines in roughly eighty-five percent of all cases. <em>See </em>U.S. Parole Commission Report 38, <em>Workload and Decision Trends: Statistical Highlights Fiscal Years 1981-1983. See also Forman, </em>709 F.2d 861 <em>&amp; </em>n. 21 (collecting cases which have noted the high frequency of Commission decisions within the Guidelines). <em>But see </em>Eskridge, <em>Sentencing Guidelines: To Be Or Not To Be, </em>Fed.Probation 70, 73 (March 1986) (discussing report indicating that the Guidelines are applied inconsistently). The Commission retains the discretion to set presumptive parole dates above or below the Guidelines for \u201cgood cause.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(c). <em>See Rifai, </em>586 F.2d at 699 &amp; n. 7. As noted, the Guidelines were adopted to promote greater consistency in parole decision making. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20(a). This objective would not be achieved if the Commission did not set presumptive parole dates within the Guidelines in a high percentage of cases. <em>See Inglese, </em>768 F.2d at 937. Given the discretion retained by the Commission, the frequency with which the Guidelines are followed does not convert the Guidelines into laws for purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1636-6\">The application to Wallace of the 1983 Guidelines, as amended, did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution. The Parole Commission did not act outside the Guidelines in classifying Wallace\u2019s offense as \u201cInterference with a Flight Crew.\u201d We have no jurisdiction to entertain Wallace\u2019s claim that the Commission abused its discretion in classifying his \u201coffense behavior\u201d in category seven.

The latter applies in different circumstances; even where Congress has not affirmatively precluded review, review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion. In such a case, the statute (\u2018law\u2019) can be taken to have \u2018committed\u2019 the decisionmaking to the agency\u2019s judgment absolutely. This construction avoids conflict with the \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard of review in \u00a7 706 \u2014 if no judicially manageable standards are available for judging how and when an agency should exercise its discretion then it is impossible to evaluate agency action for \u2018abuse of discretion.\u2019 In addition, this construction satisfies the principle of statutory construction mentioned earlier, by identifying a separate class of cases to which \u00a7 701(a)(2) applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1625-20\"><em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 1655. The Court discussed subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of section 701 in <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 410, 91 S.Ct. at 820. By clarifying and reaffirming <em>Overton Park, </em>the Court in <em>Chaney </em>resolved the long-standing uncertainty and dispute over the proper interpretation of these two subsections. <em>See, e.g., </em>Berger <em>Administrative Arbitrariness: A Synthesis, </em>78 Yale L.J. 965 (1969); Saferstein <em>Nonreviewability:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1625-21\"><em>A Functional Analysis of \"Committed to Agency Discretion, \u201d </em>82 Harv.LJRev. 367 (1968); Davis <em>Administrative Arbitrariness Is Not Always Reviewable, </em>51 Minn.L.Rev. 643 (1967).

Section 4218(d) of the Parole Act, which limits review, does not cross-reference to the limitations established in sections 4206 and 4207.

All of the courts at the time the Parole Act was enacted agreed that the Parole Board\u2019s decisions were committed to discretion. <em>See, e.g., </em>text accompanying this note. See <em>also Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. at 187-88, 99 S.Ct. at 2241-42 (applying the former Parole Act). The only \"disagreement\u2019\u2019 was over whether these decisions were reviewable for abuse of discretion. <em>Compare Calabro v.

In discussing actions committed to agency discretion, one commentator has forcefully stated: Even assuming that courts have the prestige and power to remedy all such abuses when found, to demand that courts give review whenever a complainant utters the formula \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 is to hazard a serious misallocation of judicial resources as well as a stifling of agency and congressional programs. The capacity of individuals to bring frivolous claims cannot be overlooked. Nor can it be assumed that the scope of review can be so limited that agencies will remain free to administer their programs creatively. Even the well-intentioned court may find it impossible to review agency actions without expending an inordinate amount of time analyzing its functions, or without somewhat constricting valid agency discretion, given the vagaries of any standard of review, including review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-11\">Saferstein, <em>supra </em>note 2, at 374-75 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1634-4\">. The Commission, like other agencies, is thus bound by its own regulations so long as they remain in force. <em>See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Skaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 267, 74 S.Ct. 499, 503, 98 L.Ed.2d 681 (1954). The Guidelines are unusual regulations in that Congress has authorized the Commission to exceed them when it shows \"good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-5\">The concurrence by Judge Hall acknowledges that a court has jurisdiction to determine whether the Commission has shown good cause for rendering a decision outside the Guidelines, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(c), but maintains that a court has no jurisdiction to determine whether the Commission has rendered a decision outside the Guidelines and hence must show good cause. According to this view, the Commission's statement that it has followed the Guidelines is binding on a federal court, even though the Commission has plainly violated a Guideline provision which does not admit of discretion and choice, and the Commission has denied the prisoner\u2019s request to show good cause for such deviation. In contrast, we believe that the provision committing Commission decisions to discretion (section 4218(d)) and the provision requiring good cause (section 4206(c)) should not be construed so that one provision effectively nullifies the other. <em>See Chaney, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1655 (every provision in statute should be given effect). <em>See also Michigan Academy, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2136-42. Further, contrary to the statement in the concurrence by Judge Hall, we do not apply an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See supra </em>section 3a (so stating). Under that standard, a court will reverse if it finds a clear error in judgment. <em>See e.g., Fjelstad v. American Honda Motor Co., </em>762 F.2d 1334, 1331 (9th Cir.1985).

Bell, </em>432 U.S. 404, 409-14, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 2431-34, 53 L.Ed.2d 439 (1977) (holding that determination or certification of the Attorney General under section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(b), was not subject to judicial review when section 4(b) provided that such actions were \u201cnot reviewable in any court\u201d). The legislative intent to prohibit judicial review would be easier to perceive if, in the Parole Act, Congress had referred to section 701(a)(1), rather than section 701(a)(2), but the reference to section 701(a)(2) is sufficient. There is no need to consider the application of section 701(a)(2) because the exception to judicial review in section 701(a)(1) is applicable. <em>See United States v. Erika, Inc., </em>456 U.S. 201, 211,102 S.Ct. 1650, 1655, 72 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982) (Court concluded that its \u201ctask was at an end\u201d once it found legislative intent to preclude judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b1637-16\">Federal courts have jurisdiction to review claims that the Commission\u2019s actions violated the constitution. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 366-74, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1165-69, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (finding jurisdiction to review constitutionality of veteran\u2019s benefits legislation even though statute prohibited judicial review of certain administrative decisions). Federal courts also have jurisdiction to review allegations that the Commission has violated the Parole Act by failing to consider certain factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4206, 4207, or setting a presumptive parole date outside of the Guidelines without good cause, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(c). These are statutory limits on the Commission\u2019s discretion over which we have jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; <em>see Garcia v. Neagle, </em>660 F.2d 983, 988-89 (4th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1153, 102 S.Ct. 1023, 71 L.Ed.2d 309 (1982). This is where our jurisdiction ends however. Section 4218(d) is an expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>of legislative intent to preclude judicial review which deprives federal courts of the authority to review Commission decisions for an abuse of discretion under the APA, even when mandatory Guidelines or regulations are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-5\">The majority, however, continues past this logical conclusion by stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS3T\">to recognize, as we must, that the Commission\u2019s substantive decisions to grant or deny parole are unreviewable does not necessarily answer whether the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines are also shielded from review____ We must still consider whether and to what extent the removal of our jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s <em>decisions </em>to grant or deny parole also precludes our review of the Commission\u2019s decision making <em>processes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1638-8\">The majority then relies on conflicting statements regarding judicial review in the legislative history of the Parole Act to conclude that Congress intended for courts to review Commission decisions which are governed by a mandatory standard under the Guidelines or other regulations, but not those decisions in which the Guidelines or other regulations permit the Commission <em>\u201ca </em>range of choices.\u201d This analysis is troublesome in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-9\">The inquiry into whether there are regulations which a court may look to in reviewing an agency decision is a component of the section 701(a)(2) determination of whether a matter is committed to agency discretion by law. <em>See Abdelhamid v. Eckert, </em>774 F.2d 1447, 1450 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Ness .Investment Corp. v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>512 F.2d 706, 714-15 (9th Cir.1975). If there are no statutory or regulatory directives then a court may conclude that the agency action at issue falls into that narrow class of cases in which there is no law to apply. <em>See Abdelhamid, </em>774 F.2d at 1450. However, the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>that section 701(a)(1) and section 701(a)(2) provide separate exceptions to judicial review, demonstrates that the majority\u2019s inquiry into the existence and mandatory nature of regulations should not be undertaken when Congress \u201chas expressed an intent to preclude judicial review.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 1655. Once Congress has specified that a decision is committed to agency discretion we should not dissect that decision into its smallest components and then review each of the components to determine if it is \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law.\u201d <em>See Farkas, </em>744 F.2d at 38 (Commission\u2019s factual findings are \u201cnecessary components of the Commission\u2019s ultimate decision to deny parole and are not subject to [judicial] review\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1638-13\">Holding that we have jurisdiction to review Commission decisions governed by mandatory regulations under the APA even though Congress has specified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>the decision to grant or deny parole is committed to agency discretion creates two practical problems. First, under this approach, Congress will have difficulty specifying areas of agency action which are not subject to judicial review as contemplated by the APA. A statement that a matter is committed to agency discretion will be given effect at the ultimate decision level, but when the decision is broken down into its component parts the result may be that the decision is actually subjected to judicial review for an abuse of discretion. Second, agencies will have a disincentive to adopt regulations guiding their decisions because matters which would not otherwise be subject to judicial review would become reviewable if a court determines that the regulation is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-5\">The due process clause of the fifth amendment provides the appropriate means for addressing claims that the Commission has failed to follow the Guidelines or its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-6\">Under this approach, the first question is whether the Parole Act creates a liberty interest which is subject to due process protection. The Supreme Court has held that mandatory language in a Nebraska parole statute created a liberty interest which was protected under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 12, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2106, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has determined whether the language of the federal Parole Act is sufficiently mandatory to create such a liberty interest under the fifth amendment. <em>Compare Solomon v. Elsea, </em>676 F.2d 282, 284-85 (7th Cir.1982) (finding liberty interest) <em>with Shahid v. Crawford, </em>599 F.2d 666, 670 n. 5 (5th Cir.1979) (noting that language of the federal Parole Act is less mandatory than the Nebraska act analyzed in <em>Greenholtz, </em>but avoiding issue of whether the federal Parole Act ever creates a liberty interest by finding that there is no liberty interest before minimum time for parole eligibility has been served).</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-8\">If the federal Parole Act is found to create a liberty interest, then the question is whether the prisoner has been afforded the \u201cquantum and quality\u201d of process due in this particular situation. <em>See Greenholtz, </em>442 U.S. at 13, 99 S.Ct. at 2106 (citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)). Although the availability of judicial review under both the due process analysis outlined by the Supreme Court in <em>Greenholtz </em>and the majority\u2019s analysis under the APA is determined by the existence of mandatory language, the inquiry into the amount and quality of due process required to protect a liberty interest specified in <em>Greenholtz </em>is a more deferential review of the Commission\u2019s actions than the abuse of discretion review the majority would apply under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-9\">Because Wallace has not claimed that the Commission\u2019s application of the Guidelines violated his due process rights, I find it unnecessary to undertake the due process inquiry in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1638-10\">. The majority places undue emphasis on the legislative history in drawing its distinction between mandatory Guidelines or regulations and those which permit the Commission a range of choices. Although legislative history should be considered in determining whether there is clear and convincing evidence of a legislative intent to preclude judicial review, <em>see Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>467 U.S. 340, 345, 104 S.Ct. 2450, 2454, 81 L.Ed.2d 270 (1984), the legislative history should not be used to contradict a statutory directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-11\">Much of the legislative history discussed thoroughly in the majority opinion demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to limit judicial review of Commission decisions. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.Conf.Rep. No. 94-838, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 25, 36, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 358, 368 <em>(Joint House-Senate Conference Report) </em>[hereinafter <em>Joint Report). </em>The majority places great emphasis on portions of the legislative history which indicate Congress\u2019 concern that judicial review not be completely abrogated, or that Congress believed judicial review would remain the same as before the adoption of the Parole Act. <em>See, Joint Report </em>at 19, 36, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 341, 368; 122 Cong.Rec. 5164 (1976) (statement of Rep. Drinan); 121 Cong.Rec. 1570 (1975) (statement of Rep. Wiggins). But section 4218(d), as adopted, precludes judicial review of Commission decisions to grant or deny parole. The legislative history, especially the statements of individual congressmen or senators, should not be used to circumvent this statutory directive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1639-10\">KOZINSKI, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judge J. BLAINE ANDERSON</author>\n<p id=\"A7U\">joins, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-11\">It is only fair to start with the concession that today\u2019s opinion is the product of invited error. By and large the court follows the path suggested by the government in its brief and at oral argument; no one should therefore be heard to complain that the court fails to adequately preserve the Parole Commission\u2019s prerogatives. Yet, the majority opinion is troubling in a number of ways: it perpetuates the myth that laws constraining executive action mean nothing unless they are judicially enforceable; it elevates bits and pieces of legislative history over clear and unambiguous statutory language; and it draws gossamer distinctions that invite litigation. I write not to respond to the majority\u2019s reading of the law; Judge Hall\u2019s concurrence, which I join, does this lucidly and persuasively. My observations concern the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>methodology and the unfortunate implications of its approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-5\">As the majority recognizes, <em>supra </em>p. 1544, the Parole Act of 1976 commits the decision whether to grant or deny parole to the Parole Commission\u2019s unreviewable discretion. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4218(b) (1982). The court nevertheless rejects the \u201csyllogistic\u201d conclusion that this necessarily precludes review of \u201cthe process by which the Commission reaches that decision.\u201d <em>Supra </em>p. 1547. The court\u2019s reluctance to accept the logic of the statute is based on its observation that the Act limits \u201cthe scope of discretion granted the Commission\u201d and \u201cthe Parole Act reveals no congressional design to allow the Commission to transgress these limitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concludes that judicial review is necessary to keep the agency from going astray. <em>Id. See also supra </em>p. 1551 (\u201c[i]f a court could not consider this issue, the requirement that the Commission show \u2018good cause\u2019 to render a decision \u2018notwithstanding\u2019 the Guidelines would be meaningless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-6\">The court\u2019s unspoken but powerful premise is that executive branch officials cannot be trusted to stay within the law and that limitations on their authority are empty words on paper unless they can be judicially enforced. This does not, in my view, comport with reality; nor does it show appropriate deference to officers of a coordinate branch of our government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-7\">Contrary to the court\u2019s assertion, a statutory limitation on executive action is not rendered meaningless because a judge can\u2019t be called upon to enforce it; nor is judicial review the only way to ensure that the law will be followed. An Act of Congress is the law of the land, a law all federal officials are sworn to uphold whether they be in the judicial, legislative or executive branches of government. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 453 (1982) (judicial); 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21, 25 (1982) (legislative); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331 (1982) (executive). The first and by far the most important assurance that the law will be followed lies in the diligence and good faith of those administering it. For the overwhelming number of the millions of decisions made by our federal government every year, this is the <em>only </em>assurance. Our system would be gridlocked if executive officials could not be trusted to carry out the law whenever their actions escape judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-14\">Even where Congress chooses not to rely on the acting official\u2019s good faith alone, judicial review is not the only available safeguard. One option is to provide administrative appeals within the executive branch itself. Formal and informal review within the agency can correct errors of law, curb abuses of discretion and ensure that the decision is not the product of a single official\u2019s passion or prejudice. The Parole Act provides for such internal administrative review. It establishes a three-member National Appeals Board to which prisoners such as Wallace may appeal denials, modifications or revocations of parole. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4204(a)(5), 4215 (1982). Under Parole Commission regulations, appeal may be based on misapplication of the guidelines, mistaken conclusions of fact or failure to follow proper procedures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, a Regional Commissioner may reopen a case at any time based on new information. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.28(a) (1985). This \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>ternal appeal process is provided to assure fairness in every decision, and to be sure that both law and guidelines are administered fairly across the country.\u201d S.Rep. No. 94-369, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 335, 336.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1641-5\">Finally, Congress itself can and does monitor the behavior of executive branch officials. This is not an empty threat. Proliferation of congressional committees and subcommittees, aided by burgeoning congressional staff, has led to extensive micromanagement of executive agency practices. A recent study describes this phenomenon as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1641-6\">Congress has expanded the scope of its concern for executive branch activities to include the most minute details of operations. These range from dictating the size and style of agency wall calendars to overruling a Treasury Department decision on a mailbox address for payments of tobacco taxes, to requiring the assignment of an attorney to a government office in Stillwater, Okla.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1641-7\">R. Fitzgerald &amp; G. Lipson, <em>Pork Barrel: The Unexpurgated Grace Commission Story of Congressional Profligacy </em>xxv (Cato Inst.1984); <em>see also id. </em>at 44-49, 92--98 (citing numerous examples of legislative micromanagement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-8\">Judicial review is, of course, yet another way to assure fidelity to statutory and regulatory standards. But it is not the only way. Congress, it seems to me, should have the option to invoke judicial review, rely on its own oversight or leave matters entirely to executive officials. Here, Congress expressly left to the executive branch the decision to grant or deny parole. As Judge Hall points out, at 1557, by refusing to honor that choice, the court denies Congress the flexibility of placing constraints on executive action while avoiding the cost and delay of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-12\">As Judge Hall further notes, the majority places far too much reliance on legislative history. <em>Supra </em>pp. 1556-57 n. 1. The fact of the matter is that legislative history can be cited to support almost any proposition, and frequently is. The propensity of judges to look past the statutory language is well known to legislators. It creates strong incentives for manipulating legislative history to achieve through the courts results not achievable during the enactment process. The potential for abuse is great. Judge (now Justice) Scalia has persuasively warned against relying on detailed discussions in legislative reports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlzS\">[T]he authoritative, as opposed to the persuasive, weight of the Report depends entirely upon how reasonable it is to assume that [its view] was reflected in the law <em>Congress </em>adopted. I frankly doubt that it is ever reasonable to assume that the details, as opposed to the broad outlines of purpose, set forth in a committee report come to the attention of, much less are approved by, the house which enacts the committee\u2019s bill. And I think it time for courts to become concerned about the fact that routine deference to the detail of committee reports, and the predictable expansion in that detail which routine deference has produced, are converting a system of judicial construction into a system of committee-staff prescription.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1641-13\"><em>Hirschey v. FERC, </em>777 F.2d 1, 7-8 (D.C. Cir.1985) (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis original; footnote omitted). A footnote to this passage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> vividly demonstrates the dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>ger of according legislative reports controlling weight: Reports are usually written by staff or lobbyists, not legislators; few if any legislators read the reports; they are not voted on by the committee whose views they supposedly represent, much less by the full Senate or House of Representatives; they cannot be amended or modified on the floor by legislators who may disagree with the views expressed therein. Committee reports that contradict statutory language or purport to explicate the meaning or applicability of particular statutory provisions can short-circuit the legislative process, leading to results never approved by Congress or the President. Of course, all this goes doubly for floor statements by individual legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-4\">None of the legislative history cited by the court today specifically addresses the effect of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4218(d) which, by any fair reading, appears to preclude judicial review of all aspects of the Commission\u2019s decision to grant or deny parole. The most that can be said about these excerpts from the legislative record is that their authors labored under the impression that the Parole Act would not affect judicial review. No one bothers to reconcile this hoped-for result with the language of the law about to be enacted. Taken literally, all this nay-saying would read section 4218(d) right out of existence; if the law is to remain unchanged, why bother passing the section at all? Surely such predictions about how courts are likely to interpret a statute should not become self-fulfilling prophecies. If a legislator is troubled by a particular provision in a bill, he should try to modify or excise it during the enactment process. Courts should not allow individual legislators and their staffs to usurp the uniquely judicial function of statutory interpretation by countenancing unexplicated assertions that the law to be enacted won\u2019t mean much anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-23\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-24\">Having bypassed clear statutory language in favor of nebulous assertions in the legislative history, the court confronts a dilemma that those who wrote the legislative reports did not have to deal with: how to reconcile the clear mandate of section 4218(d) with the assertions that the Parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>Commission\u2019s decisions are judicially reviewable after all. Seeking to serve two masters, the opinion winds up faithful to neither. On the one hand, the law .plainly <em>is </em>changed by section 4218(d), contrary to what some legislators apparently hoped. On the other hand, the effect of section 4218(d) is blunted, shielding from judicial review some, but not all, aspects of the Parole Commission\u2019s decision. The result reflects its mixed pedigree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-5\">The opinion seeks to draw a distinction between claims that the Commission has acted outside the scope of its discretion, which are reviewable, and claims that the Commission abused its discretion, which are not. <em>See, e.g., supra </em>pp. 1550-51. The distinction is, at best, counterintuitive. In trying to reconcile what are basically irreconcilable positions, the court has come up with a standard that is extremely difficult to apply and will therefore clog the courts with cases brought by prisoners, many having claims that at least colorably fall within the class reserved for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-6\">The court\u2019s attempt to flesh out this standard doesn\u2019t help much. Thus, the court cautions that \u201cunless a petitioner alleges the Commission acted beyond the scope of discretion granted by Congress, a federal court has no jurisdiction to entertain his claim.\u201d <em>Supra </em>p. 1551. Moreover, \u201ca bare allegation that the Commission has abused <em>its discretion </em>acknowledges that the Commission has exercised a judgment, if improperly, within its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis original). This will surely deter prisoners from charging abuse of discretion. They will allege instead that the Commission acted \u201cbeyond the scope of [its] discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1643-7\">The majority explains what it means for the Commission to act beyond the scope of its discretion in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1643-8\">In determining whether the Commission has \u201cgone outside\u201d the Guidelines, therefore, it is appropriate for the court to inquire whether the Commission has in fact made a \u201cjudgment\u201d within its discretion. Specifically, the court\u2019s inquiry is addressed to whether the Commission\u2019s decision involves the exercise of judgment among a range of possible choices or options, or involves a plain violation of a matter which does not admit of discretion and choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1643-11\"><em>Supra </em>p. 1552 (citation omitted). This gives litigants and the district courts little useful guidance. There are, it seems to me, few Parole Commission decisions that could not fairly be challenged on either ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-12\">Take this case, for example. The petitioner here was convicted of extortion, use of an explosive to commit a felony, and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Because the criminal conduct involved an airplane, the Commission classified his offense as \u201cInterference With a Flight Crew.\u201d The regulations provide two levels of offense behavior in this category: \u201cif the conduct or attempted conduct has potential for creating a significant safety risk to an aircraft or passengers, grade as Category Seven.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20.242(a). \u201cOtherwise, grade as Category Two.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.20.242(b). The Commission graded the offense as a seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-13\">Wallace\u2019s case gives rise to two possible objections to the Commission\u2019s action: first, that the Commission incorrectly classified his conduct as \u201cInterference with a Flight Crew;\u201d and second, that (even accepting the \u201cInterference with a Flight Crew\u201d classification) the. Commission should have graded the offense as a two because \u201cthe conduct or attempted conduct [did not have] potential for creating a significant safety risk to an aircraft or passengers.\u201d In support of the first contention, Wallace argues that his offense should have been classified as extortion, a crime of which he was actually convicted, and which carries an offense behavior categorization of five. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20.322(a). Supporting the latter contention is the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>explosives were found early, long before they could pose any realistic danger to the aircraft, passengers or crew and, in any case, were allegedly not even operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-4\">These two objections to the Parole Commission\u2019s action are quite different from each other. The first is, in effect, that the Commission misapplied its own guidelines, what I would have thought was a question of law, not of discretion. The second challenges judgments as well as findings of fact: the Commission\u2019s determination that Wallace\u2019s conduct endangered passengers, plane and crew. The court resolves both of these questions in a single paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1644-5\">The Commission found that Wallace\u2019s offense had the potential to cause injury or death and destruction to an aircraft and passengers. The Commission\u2019s determination did not violate a mandatory or non-discretionary standard, but rather, involved a judgment among a range of possible choices and options relating to the severity of Wallace\u2019s offense. Wallace has pointed to no provision in the Guidelines removing discretion from the Commission to classify his offense in this category. We hold that the Commission acted within the scope of discretion granted by Congress and hence our review of the Commission\u2019s classification of Wallace\u2019s offense is complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1644-6\"><em>Supra </em>p. 1553 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-7\">The court does not adequately explain its conclusion. For example, even though Wallace was actually convicted of extortion, the court approves the Commission\u2019s decision to classify his offense as \u201cInterference with Flight Crew.\u201d Was that because in doing so the Commission was acting within the scope of its discretion? Because the Commission did not abuse its discretion? Or because the Commission was right as a matter of law? Would the result have been the same if the Commission had classified the conduct as demand for ransom, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20.222; aircraft piracy, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 .241; assault, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 .212; burglary or unlawful entry, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 .311; espionage, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 .1021; or tax evasion, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 .501? If review is to mean anything, I would think that somewhere along the line the court will have to consider whether the Commission has totally misclassified the offense. Because the court does not tell us why it is satisfied with the classification here, those of us not participating in the majority opinion remain in the dark even as to the standard by which the conclusion was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-9\">Equally unexplicated is the court\u2019s approval of the Commission\u2019s determination that \u201cWallace\u2019s offense had the potential to cause injury or death and destruction to an aircraft and passengers\u201d because this \u201cinvolved a judgment among a range of possible choices and options relating to the severity of Wallace\u2019s offense\u201d and was therefore \u201cwithin the scope of discretion granted by Congresss.\u201d <em>Supra </em>p. 1553. Would the court have reached the same conclusion if the Commission had uttered this finding as to a defendant convicted of an offense wholly unrelated to aircraft such as forgery, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20.331, or importation of illegal aliens, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2.20.402? Or what if Wallace had merely written a letter or made a crank telephone call threatening the existence of a totally nonexistent bomb? Will all such matters be left to the Commission, and if so, what precisely is the area the court maps out for judicial scrutiny?</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-10\">The summary fashion in which the court resolves Wallace\u2019s claims masks the difficulty of applying the standard enunciated today even to his case. I fear that courts will have even more trouble in future cases trying to apply the pronouncement of an en banc panel of this court. It seems to me we are inflicting another layer of complexity on district courts and litigants already overburdened with rules, tests, standards of review and a variety of other fine distinctions that are not intuitively obvious. Judges and lawyers will study today\u2019s opinion long and hard seeking guidance of the type that can actually be used in resolving disputes. As always, uncertainty will spawn litigation which will necessitate further guidance from this court. In the end, I fear that those who predicted section 4218(d) will mean nothing may have their way. When all is said and done, we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>find ourselves having run around the block once, only to wind up where we were before section 4218(d) was passed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1640-8\">.
