They filed an action alleging that they were deprived of property rights in certain funds without due process of law in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. They appended state-law claims against prison officials, alleging various fraudulent and illegal uses of inmate funds and breaches of fiduciary duty. The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We reverse and remand for a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The appellants filed this action in July 1984. Their pro se complaint is a bewildering assortment of allegations concerning the financial wrongdoings of state prison officials. The officials are alleged to have violated both state and federal laws. Reviewing the complaint with the patience and liberality required by law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and with the aid of counsel appointed for this appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there are two federal claims that can be gleaned from these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The appellants object to the handling of two kinds of accounts maintained for the inmates by the Department of Corrections. The first is the prisoner\u2019s personal account authorized by article 6166y, Texas Revised Civil Statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This account consists of all monies found on the inmate at the time of his incarceration, or earned or received by him during his incarceration. The appellants allege that the Department of Corrections pools these accounts into an \u201cInmate Trust Fund.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> earns interest on the money, but does not pay the interest to the prisoners. They argue that the interest on these accounts is their property which is taken by the Department without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">The second disputed account is the \u201cEducation and Recreation Fund,\u201d into which are deposited proceeds from the operation of the prison commissary. 37 Tex.Admin. Code \u00a7 61.26. According to the Administrative Code, \u201cThese [commissary] proceeds are used to complement treatment programs for the inmates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appellants allege that inmates have a state-created property interest in the commissary proceeds, that some of the proceeds are spent on items that do not benefit the inmates, and that this amounts to a deprivation of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">In July 1985, the district court dismissed the action <em>sua sponte </em>under Rule 12(h)(3), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for want of subject matter jurisdiction. The court\u2019s order of dismissal simply stated that the complaint did not allege a deprivation of any right, privilege, or immunity secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, and that the court was therefore without jurisdiction. The court also taxed costs for this action against the appellants, who were proceeding <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">When the basis of federal jurisdiction is intertwined with the plaintiff's federal cause of action, the court should as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>sume jurisdiction over the case and decide the case on the merits. <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 681-82, 66 S.Ct. 773, 775-76, 90 L.Ed. 939, 943 (1945); <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 415 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981). \u201cThe question of subject matter jurisdiction and the merits will normally be considered intertwined where the [same] statute provides both the basis of federal court subject matter jurisdiction and the cause of action.\u201d <em>Clark v. Tarrant County, Texas, </em>798 F.2d 736, 742 (5th Cir.1986) (citation omitted). In <em>Williamson, </em>we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9C\">no purpose is served by indirectly arguing the merits in the context of federal jurisdiction. Judicial economy is best promoted when the existence of a federal right is directly reached and, where no claim is found to exist, the case is dismissed on the merits____ Therefore as a general rule a claim cannot be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of the absence of a federal cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">645 F.2d at 415-16. The basic reason for this rule is obvious. If federal jurisdiction turned on the <em>success </em>of a plaintiff\u2019s federal cause of action, no such case could ever be dismissed on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The exceptions to the rule of <em>Bell v. Hood </em>are that jurisdictional dismissal is proper if the federal claim \u201cclearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. at 682-83, 66 S.Ct. at 776, 90 L.Ed. at 943. This \u201cstandard is met only where the plaintiff\u2019s claim \u2018has no plausible foundation\u2019 or \u2018is clearly foreclosed by a prior Supreme Court decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 416 (quoting <em>Bell v. Health-Mor, Inc., </em>549 F.2d 342, 344 (5th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The appellants claim that officials of the Department of Corrections have deprived them of rights secured by the Constitution under color of state law in violation of \u00a7 1983. They invoked general \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. This is a classic example of a case in which the federal cause of action and federal jurisdiction are interdependent. Thus, the only question is whether the appellants\u2019 claim \u201cclearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction\u201d or if \u201csuch a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d This case does not fall within either of those exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">The appellants\u2019 federal claims are not immaterial or designed solely to obtain jurisdiction. While the appellants have advanced various claims that can only be read as grounded in state law, they also clearly allege violations by state officials of federal constitutional protections. The first exception to the rule of <em>Bell v. Hood </em>is designed to capture those cases in which a plaintiff with state law claims merely trumps up federal jurisdiction for strategic reasons. It does not appear from this complaint that appellants\u2019 federal claims are any less serious than their state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">The appellants\u2019 claims are not wholly insubstantial or frivolous. Similar claims about interest on inmate savings accounts have been successfully maintained. <em>See Fayerweather v. Wainwright, </em>No. TCA 75-3 (N.D.Fla. Aug. 20, 1976), Pov.L.Rep. 1123, 325 (CCH 1976) (nonconsensual taking of interest from an inmate\u2019s account and the placing of it in a general welfare fund to be expended for the benefit of other prisoners as well as employees of the prison is clearly a taking of property without due process of law and violates equal protection). In <em>Douglas v. Ward, </em>Civ. No. 77-2559 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 1977) (Frankel, J.), a similar complaint survived a motion to dismiss. Another Southern District judge later described the outcome of <em>Douglas: </em>\u201cMorrison and three other ... inmates succeeded in overturning the Correction Department\u2019s practice of neither paying interest on prisoners\u2019 savings accounts nor allowing prisoners to deposit their money in outside interest-bearing accounts.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Lefevre, </em>592 F.Supp. 1052, 1060 (S.D.N.Y.1984). <em>See also Gray </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number><em>v. Lee, </em>486 F.Supp. 41 (D.Md.1980) (refusal to pay interest on inmate accounts did not deprive inmates of property without due process \u201c[i]nasmuch as prisoners may transfer funds from their spending account to a \u2018free-world\u2019 interest bearing savings account\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>661 F.2d 921 (4th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Also, appellants\u2019 claim that they have a state-created property interest in the \u201cEducation and Recreation Fund\u201d is not frivolous on its face. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Connell v. Southworth, </em>422 F.Supp. 182, 185 (D.R.I. 1976) (prisoners\u2019 first amendment rights violated when administrators of Inmates Welfare Fund refused to pay for leaflet mailing; parties stipulated that Fund, derived from profits from vending machines, inmate store, etc., \u201cbelongs to the inmates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Because the federal causes of action in appellants\u2019 complaint were neither immaterial nor frivolous, the district court erred in dismissing this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">We hold only that appellants\u2019 federal claims are minimally sufficient to require a decision on the merits. We express no further views on the merits. That is entirely for the district court in the first instance. Furthermore, we express no opinion on the proper disposition of the appellants\u2019 pendant state law claims. These decisions as well are for the informed discretion of the district court. <em>See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 1139, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966); <em>Laird v. Board of Trustees of Institutions of Higher Learning, </em>721 F.2d 529, 534 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\">. <em>See, e.g., Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1971) (per curiam reversal of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of prisoner\u2019s pro se complaint).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-9\">. We sympathize with the district judge who made the jurisdictional determinations under the time pressures of a crowded docket and without the help of competent counsel on behalf of appellants. The appellants' legal position, however, is now clear and we must decide the case as it is presented to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b898-10\">. Prisoners, when received into the penitentiary, shall be carefully searched. If money be found on the person of the prisoner, or received by him at any time, it shall be taken in charge by the manager, and placed to the prisoner\u2019s credit, and expended for the prisoner\u2019s benefit on his written order, and under such restrictions as may be prescribed by law or the rules____</p>\n<p id=\"b898-18\">Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 6166y.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b898-19\">.The Texas Administrative Code instructs those sending money to prisoners to specify the name and number of the prisoner and to make their certified check or money order payable to \"Inmate Trust Fund.\u201d <em>See </em>37 Tex.Admin.Code \u00a7 61.25(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\">.
