The issues presented are (1) whether section 14(b) is unconstitutionally vague, and (2) if the statute passes constitutional muster, whether the SEC\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. We conclude that, in light of a narrowing administrative construction by the SEC, section 14(b) is not void for vagueness, and that ample evidence in the record undergirds the Commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"AuRU\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AHI\">In October 1980, Raymond Dirks joined John Muir &amp; Co. (\u201cMuir\u201d), an established securities brokerage firm, as a limited partner. In April 1981, Dirks became a general partner, with a 54% equity interest in the firm. Dirks shared responsibility for Muir\u2019s management and control with John Sullivan, the firm\u2019s managing partner and 26% owner.</p>\n<p id=\"AWMp\">From January to April 1981, Muir had steadily increased the volume of securities trading for its own account. The firm\u2019s heavy stock purchases, however, placed a severe strain on its available cash. To compensate, Muir began borrowing money, using customer-owned securities as collateral. By April 1981, the customer-backed loans had reached such a level that the firm was forced to begin setting aside large amounts of cash in an insulated customer reserve account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These set-asides exacerbated Muir\u2019s already serious cash-flow problem.</p>\n<p id=\"AyZ\">Donald Katz, Muir\u2019s comptroller, became increasingly disturbed by Muir\u2019s deteriorating financial situation. When the reserve deposits reached the $1 million mark in late April 1981, Katz warned Sullivan about the situation and advised him to partially liquidate the firm\u2019s trading positions in order to generate cash for day-to-day operations. Despite Katz\u2019s advice, Muir continued to increase its trading account.</p>\n<p id=\"A-c\">Toward the end of May 1981, when the reserve account had climbed to nearly $5 million dollars (over 75% of the firm\u2019s capital), Katz arranged a meeting of Dirks, Sullivan, and other Muir officials. At that meeting, Katz strongly recommended that Muir reduce its trading positions to alleviate the firm\u2019s liquidity crisis. Notwithstanding their commitment to take this remedial action, Dirks and Sullivan failed to decrease Muir\u2019s trading account. To the contrary, Muir appears to have permitted its trading account to increase after Katz\u2019s admonition and in the face of mounting financial problems.</p>\n<p id=\"A_M\">As the spring and summer progressed, Muir\u2019s financial condition continued to deteriorate. In view of the firm\u2019s growing cash-flow problems, Dirks procured $6.9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>million in loans. How the loan proceeds were in fact employed, however, remains unclear,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the firm\u2019s unpaid bills mushroomed from $109,000 in May 1981 to $281,000 in June to $793,000 in July and finally to over $1 million in August.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-4\">In early August 1981, with the firm in acute financial distress, Muir\u2019s principals unsuccessfully tried to find a merger partner for the firm or to sell its retail business. When those efforts proved unavailing, Sullivan attempted to close the firm, a proposed step that was forbidden by an official of the New York Stock Exchange on the ground that Muir was in apparent compliance with the Commission\u2019s net capital rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, however, Katz's net capital computations revealed that Muir was in serious violation of the rule, with a deficiency of $1.7 million. At that point, Muir\u2019s general partners, including Dirks, agreed to the firm\u2019s liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act (\u201cSIPA\u201d), \u00a7 5(b), 15 U.S.C. 78eee(b) (1982). When it entered liquidation, Muir held $200 million in customer securities, several million dollars in cash, and had over 19,000 active customer accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-5\">The SEC thereafter instituted an enforcement proceeding against Dirks and Sullivan. Following an evidentiary hearing, the Administrative Law Judge found both Dirks and Sullivan responsible for Muir\u2019s demise culminating in the SIPA liquidation. He also found that Dirks and Sullivan aided and abetted the firm\u2019s net capital violations during the period July 31-August 14, 1981. The AU concluded that Dirks and Sullivan should be permanently barred, pursuant to section 14(b) of SIPA, from association with any broker or dealer in a supervisory, managerial, financial, principal, or proprietary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-9\">On review, the SEC rejected the AU\u2019s finding that Dirks and Sullivan had aided and abetted Muir\u2019s net capital violations. However, the Commission decided to sanction both Dirks and Sullivan under section 14(b) of SIPA for their respective roles in Muir\u2019s financial collapse. Specifically, the Commission imposed a six-month suspension on Dirks and a one-year suspension on Sullivan. This petition for review followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1552-10\">Section 14(b) of SIPA reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1552-11\">The Commission may by order bar or suspend for any period any officer, director, general partner, owner of ten percentum or more of the voting securities, or controlling person of any broker or dealer for whom a trustee has been appointed ... from being or becoming associated with a broker or dealer, if after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, <em>the Commission shall determine such bar or suspension to be in the public interest.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1552-12\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78jjj(b) (1982) (emphasis added). In this court, Dirks contends <em>first, </em>that section 14(b) is unconstitutionally vague, and <em>second, </em>that the SEC\u2019s finding of negligence is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-14\"><em>First. </em>We conclude that Dirks\u2019 void-for-vagueness argument is without merit. Although emphasizing the breadth of the statutory language, Dirks recognizes, as he must, that the SEC in 1976 placed a narrowing gloss on the provision in <em>Carrol P. Teig, </em>46 S.E.C. 615 (1976). There, the SEC determined that section 14(b) did not impose a regime of strict liability on individuals whose firms enter SIPA liquidation. Instead, the Commission concluded that a broker\u2019s failure to act in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>responsible manner would form the basis for a bar or suspension. The SEC squarely held that simple neglect or nonfeasance provides an adequate basis for imposition of sanctions under section 14(b). <em>Id. </em>at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"AnI9\">The SEC based its conclusion in <em>Teig </em>on two factors. In the SEC\u2019s view, brokerage officials can reasonably be expected to be aware of the broker-dealer\u2019s practices and financial condition, and to take or demand remedial action to avoid the firm\u2019s financial demise. In addition, the fiscal irresponsibility and resulting collapse of brokerdealers during the 1960s was seen by the Commission as the major factor motivating Congress to enact SIPA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amb\">Under settled law, a broadly worded statute can be sufficiently clarified by a narrowing, authoritative interpretation to fend off a vagueness challenge. <em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, </em>455 U.S. 489, 497, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1192, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982); <em>Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, </em>382 U.S. 399, 403, 86 S.Ct. 518, 521, 15 L.Ed.2d 447 (1966). Dirks\u2019 principal response to this well-established principle is that this statute, containing a broad public interest standard, is vague beyond redemption. We disagree. \u201cPublic interest\u201d criteria are, of course, found with regularity in the modern administrative state. <em>See, e.g., </em>Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a)(1) (1982); Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307 (1982); Rail Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11344(c) (1982); Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(b)(l) (1984).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Over the years, Congress has seen fit to confer power upon various agencies to act in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d with respect to a broad range of matters, including the imposition of sanctions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Securities &amp; Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(b)(6) (1984).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4xV\">More fundamentally, Dirks\u2019 approach of turning a blind eye to administrative glosses on the statute brushes past the core concern of vagueness doctrine, namely that an individual be provided with sufficient warning that certain conduct is proscribed. <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 497-99, 102 S.Ct. at 1192-93; <em>National Dairy, </em>372 U.S. at 33-36, 83 S.Ct. at 598-99; <em>A.B. Small Co. v. American Sugar Refining Co., </em>267 U.S. 233, 45 S.Ct. 295, 69 L.Ed. 589 (1925). In its <em>Teig </em>opinion, the SEC authoritatively interpreted section 14(b) of SIPA to require a showing of negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That narrowing and clarifying interpretation, in our view, eliminates any uncertainty that might otherwise have infected section 14(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number><em>Second. </em>Dirks\u2019 remaining contention is that substantial evidence is wanting to support the Commission\u2019s finding of negligence. Dirks emphasizes that he acted diligently by obtaining approximately $7 million in loans. As we observed above, however, the disposition of these proceeds remains enshrouded in mystery. No evidence was adduced to the effect that the proceeds were actually employed to stave off the impending disaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-4\">Dirks also urges that he acted responsibly since he attempted to merge, sell, or close Muir in August 1981. While those may well have been sound remedial measures, Dirks did not undertake those efforts until after his firm was in dire financial straits. And in any event, the SEC sanctioned Dirks for his negligence in permitting the firm to deteriorate to that extent in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-5\">Next, Dirks emphasizes that he was unaware of Muir\u2019s net capital violation until August 15, 1981, when the firm closed. This argument misses the mark. The SIPA charges brought against Dirks focus on his overall responsibility for the firm\u2019s collapse, not his responsibility <em>vel non </em>for the firm\u2019s net capital violation. In short, the SEC visited the suspension sanction upon Dirks because he failed to take reasonable measures in response to Muir\u2019s deepening financial crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-9\">We are satisfied that the record evidence amply supports the Commission\u2019s determination. Finding no constitutional defect in the statute itself, as authoritatively construed, we conclude that the petition for review must be</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-10\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AHl\">. These set-asides were required by the SEC\u2019s Rule 15c3-3, 17 C.F.R. 240.15c3-3 (1986). Known as the Customer Protection Rule, this requirement is designed to ensure that a broker-dealer cannot use its customers\u2019 assets for operating capital. The rule thus requires a firm to create a special reserve account, which cannot be used for daily operations, when the firm is in a condition of net indebtedness <em>vis-a-vis </em>its customers. Respondent\u2019s Brief at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1552-6\">. At the evidentiary hearing, Dirks invoked the Fifth Amendment, leaving the record silent as to the purpose and eventual use of the loan proceeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1552-7\">. Rule 15c3-l, 17 C.F.R. 240.15c3-l (1986). Under the Commission\u2019s rule, \"net capital\" is defined as net worth reduced by certain specified deductions. Broadly speaking, the rule provides that a broker-dealer must maintain a specified level of liquid assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1552-16\">. Sullivan, whose sanction exceeded that imposed on Dirks, did not seek review. The proceeding before us therefore involves only Dirks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AJoP\">. Once Congress has directed an agency to act in the \"public interest,\" it then falls to the agency to elucidate and give specific content to the public-interest standard. For instance, under the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC is empowered to grant communications licenses where the public interest, convenience, or necessity will be served. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(a). Pursuant to its statutory authority, the FCC has developed extensive, public-interest criteria to apply in determining whether a license should be granted. <em>See Radio Comm\u2019n v. Nelson Bros., </em>289 U.S. 266, 278-87, 53 S.Ct. 627, 633-36, 77 L.Ed. 1166 (1933); <em>FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp., </em>349 U.S. 358, 75 S.Ct. 855, 99 L.Ed. 1147 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AHWT\">. In upholding a regulatory statute against a void-for-vagueness attack, the Supreme Court has observed: \u201cThe strong presumptive validity that attaches to an Act of Congress has led this Court to hold many times that statutes are not automatically invalidated as vague simply because difficulty is found in determining whether certain marginal offenses fall within their language.\u201d <em>United States v. National Dairy Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 32, 83 S.Ct. 594, 597, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963) (citations omitted). In contrast, Dirks\u2019 approach stands in tension with the bedrock principle that reviewing courts should seek, if possible, a principled interpretation which sustains the constitutionality of legislation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AIM\">. No contention is made, nor could it reasonably be, that the fact of <em>Teig\u2019s </em>gloss on section 14(b) cannot properly be attributed to Dirks. Suffice it to say that the <em>Teig </em>opinion was published in the Commission\u2019s official reports and otherwise made available in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2) (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A5rW\">. We should note that we are not called upon and therefore do not address whether section 14(b) would pass constitutional muster without <em>Teig\u2019s </em>limiting gloss. We also observe that as a fallback, Dirks assails <em>Teig </em>itself, contending that the Commission erroneously construed section 14(b) to require simple negligence. In reviewing such a claim, we are mindful of the \u201c \u2018venerable principle that the construction of a statute by those charged with its execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is <em>wrong____E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Collins, </em>432 U.S. 46, 54-55, 97 S.Ct. 2229, 2234, 53 L.Ed.2d 100 (1977) (quoting <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1802, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969)). Here, Dirks does not contend that <em>Teig </em>was wrongly decided based on the statute\u2019s language or legislative history. Instead, Dirks argues that section 14(b) must be construed to require \"willfulness\" because certain subsections of section 15 of the 1934 Act .require willfulness. Congress, however, did not adopt a uniform culpability requirement in the federal securities laws. <em>See Aaron </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>446 U.S. 680, 697, 100 S.Ct. 1945, 1956, 64 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980); <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 200, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1384, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). Instead, \"Congress fashioned standards of fault in the express civil remedies in the 1933 and 1934 Acts on a particularized basis.\" <em>Hochf elder, </em>425 U.S. at 200, 96 S.Ct. at 1384. Indeed, the fact that Congress expressly requires proof of willfulness in some sections of the securities laws obviously demonstrates that when Congress wanted to require proof of willfulness, \" \u2018it knew how to do so and did so expressly.\u201d' <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 21, 100 S.Ct. 242, 248, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979) (quoting <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 572, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2487, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979)) (concerning whether private damages remedy should be implied under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-21\">Dirks also contends that because a broker-dealer may not be held derivatively liable under SIPA, actual misconduct is required for a sanction to lie under section 14(b). The principle that a broker-dealer should not be held liable for the acts of others obviously has no bearing on the principle at issue here, namely that the broker is accountable for his or her own negligent conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
