Thomas, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Alabama, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1406-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1406-10\">In this case, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over this law firm\u2019s lawsuit against the United States, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-11\">In 1970, Brad\u2019s Machine Products, Inc. (Brad\u2019s) retained Bradley, Arant, Rose &amp; White (law firm), to represent it in defending charges alleging federal tax deficiencies and also to pursue claims for federal income tax refunds for the fiscal years 1967-69. In December, 1970, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) made a jeopardy tax assessment against Brad\u2019s, which froze its assets and resulted in the closing of the business. Brad\u2019s and the law firm then executed a fee contract and security agreement which gave the law firm a lien for its fees upon any proceeds resulting from the tax refund action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-14\">At this time, Brad\u2019s was also involved in litigation with the government pursuant to the Renegotiation Act, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1211-1223, relating to its fiscal years 1968-69. On June 14, 1971, the Renegotiation Board issued orders determining that Brad\u2019s had realized excessive profits during both fiscal years from contracts and subcontracts subject to the Renegotiation Act. On June 23, 1972, the Court of Claims entered judgment against Brad\u2019s in an amount in excess of $1,650,000. Eight years later, on November 24, 1980, the Tax Court entered a judgment in the tax suit, ruling that Brad\u2019s had overpaid taxes during the fiscal years 1967-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">On October 21, 1981, the Treasury Department prepared three checks totaling approximately $880,000 in satisfaction of the tax refund judgments; each check was made payable to \u201cBrad\u2019s, c/o IRS, Birmingham, Alabama.\u201d The three checks were sent to the IRS office in Birmingham, and that office forwarded them to the Birmingham Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-16\">On October 22, 1981, the United States Attorney requested the Clerk of the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama to issue a Writ of Execution for levy on the checks. The clerk issued the writ and gave it to the United States Marshal (Marshal) for the Northern District of Alabama. The Marshal obtained the three checks from the United States Attorney, endorsed them, \u201cBrad\u2019s Machine Products, make payable to U.S. Marshal, Northern District of Alabama,\u201d and stamped immediately below the endorsement \u201cPay to the Order of Birmingham Branch Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Thomas C. Green, United States Marshal symbol 8101.\u201d The Marshal deposited the endorsed checks into the Marshal\u2019s Service Deposit Fund Account in the Treasury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>Following the entry of judgment in the Tax Court, the law firm began negotiations with the United States Attorney contending that it was entitled to a portion of the proceeds from the Tax Court judgment. The law firm based its claim on the fee lien arising from the fee contract and security agreement and upon the existence of a statutory lien arising from Alabama state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The law firm contended that its lien had priority over any government lien based on the Court of Claims judgments because the government\u2019s lien could not have arisen earlier than the docketing of the Renegotiation Act judgments. The law firm also indicated to the United States Attorney its willingness to accept a reduced amount of $350,000 in settlement of its claim to a portion of the Tax Court judgment proceeds. The United States Attorney recommended acceptance of this offer, but the Justice Department rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">Shortly thereafter, at the direction of the Justice Department, the Marshal issued a check drawn upon the Marshal\u2019s Service Deposit Fund Account, payable to the Department of the Army, in the amount of the tax refunds. The Department of Army deposited this check to the credit of a special account receivable in the United States Treasury which had been set up to receive collections on the Court of Claims judgments obtained against Brad\u2019s in 1972. The Justice Department then notified the law firm that its settlement had been rejected and that the proceeds of the tax refunds had been forwarded to the Army and set off against the outstanding 1972 Court of Claims judgments against Brad\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-10\">The law firm brought this lawsuit in state court alleging that it had a lien on the proceeds of the tax judgments superior to any government lien. The law firm based jurisdiction upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that \u201c[t]his action is to quiet title to a certain federal tax refund, to foreclose the plaintiff\u2019s lien thereon, and is further in the nature of an interpleader. The defendant claims a lien with respect to said tax refund.\u201d The government removed the action to federal district court. The district court dismissed the law firm\u2019s lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">We agree with the district court\u2019s decision that the refund checks were never delivered to Brad\u2019s, but were rather, together with the funds upon which they were drawn, continuously in the custody and under the control of the United States; consequently, no res was ever created over which the state court had subject matter jurisdiction. Because the government properly claimed a title interest and not a lien interest, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410 does not confer jurisdiction. The state court, thus, was without jurisdiction. A district court has no jurisdiction of a lawsuit removed to it from a state court which itself lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter or the parties. <em>Minnesota v. United States, </em>305 U.S. 382, 59 S.Ct. 292, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-13\">Because Brad\u2019s was never in actual possession of the checks, it acquired no title thereto or interest therein upon which execution could be effectively levied or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>which a lien could attach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00d1o valid negotiation, transfer, or delivery of an interest occurred. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 7-1-201(14), 7-1-201(20), and 7-3-202(1) (1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Brad\u2019s contends that the government\u2019s acts following issuance of the checks amounted to an admission that it considered the checks to be Brad\u2019s property, as evidenced by the levy executed upon the checks. We agree with the district court: The levy was a nullity. Because title to the checks and to the funds upon which they were drawn remained continuously in the custody of the United States, no res was created upon which the levy could properly be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">The net effect of the government\u2019s handling of the checks was to transfer the funds from an IRS account in the Treasury to the Marshal\u2019s Service Deposit Fund Account in the Treasury and on to the special Army account in the Treasury. These transfers perhaps could have been made by a simple book-entry in the Treasury accounts. We do not speculate as to the reasons for the government\u2019s circular handling of the three Treasury checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">The law firm further contends that delivery of the checks to the United States Marshal amounted to a remitter to a neutral third party who held the checks as a stakeholder until adjudication of the competing liens, thus creating a res upon which liens could attach. <em>See, </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 7-3-102(l)(a); 7-1-201(20) (1984). We also reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-11\">Because we find that the district court lacked jurisdiction, we do not address arguments on the merits of the claim regarding set-off (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3728) and other interesting issues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1406-13\">. Neither the parties nor the district court further described this account or indicated the source of funds usually deposited into this account.
