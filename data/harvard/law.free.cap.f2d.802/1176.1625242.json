We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1294. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-16\">By indictment handed down February 6, 1985, Langford was charged with armed bank robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d)). He was tried before a jury and convicted of the lesser included offense of unarmed bank robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)). On April 19, 1985, the district court granted Langford\u2019s motion for a new trial and permitted his counsel to withdraw upon the latter\u2019s representation that he had \u201cconflicts\u201d with Langford. The matter was set to be retried on May 13, 1985. On May 8, 1985, substitute counsel moved for a continuance to prepare for trial. The motion was heard and granted on May 13, 1985. The matter was reset for July 8, 1985. On June 7, 1985, Langford filed a discovery motion that was heard June 13, 1985. The time between the filing and disposition of these motions was excludable for Speedy Trial Act purposes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F). Thus, while the second trial commenced some 80 calendar days after the motion for new trial was granted, the 70-day time limit for retrial established under the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(e), was not violated. Accordingly, we do not decide whether the trial court improperly granted original trial counsel leave to withdraw, thereby prejudicing Langford\u2019s right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-17\">At trial Langford\u2019s cousin, Jerry Lankford, and his parole officer, Richard Wood, testified that the person depicted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>bank surveillance photographs taken during the robbery was Langford. Such opinion testimony by lay witnesses is admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 701 if it is \u201climited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Young Buffalo, </em>591 F.2d 506, 513 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 950, 99 S.Ct. 2178, 60 L.Ed.2d 1055 (1979); <em>United States v. Butcher, </em>557 F.2d 666, 669-70 (9th Cir.1977). Such testimony is particularly valuable where, as in the present case, the lay witnesses are able to make the challenged identifications based on their familiarity with characteristics of the defendant not immediately observable by the jury at trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Barrett, </em>703 F.2d 1076, 1086 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Young Buffalo, </em>591 F.2d at 513. We conclude that, because Wood had met with Langford approximately 50 times and Lankford had known Langford most of his life, the opinions testified to by Lankford and Wood were rationally based and helpful to the .jury in determining a fact in issue. Fed.R.Evid. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\">Langford suggests that opinion testimony on ultimate issues of fact is inadmissible. Opinion testimony on ultimate issues of fact is admissible unless the testimony concerns the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case. Fed. R.Evid. 704. Because the testimony Lang-ford objects to was neither given by an expert nor concerned with Langford\u2019s mental state or condition, Langford\u2019s objection is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Langford additionally maintains that the trial court abused its discretion in balancing the probative value of the lay opinion testimony against its potential for prejudice. Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that \u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice ...\u201d Fed.R. Evid. 403. We conclude that, given the familiarity both Lankford and Wood had with Langford, their testimony was sufficiently probative to outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice. The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">Upon Langford\u2019s ex parte application, the trial court appointed an expert in the field of eyewitness identification to assist in preparation of Langford\u2019s defense. Such an appointment requires a finding that the services of the expert \u201care neces- ' sary for an adequate defense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l). Nevertheless, at trial the court excluded the expert\u2019s testimony concerning the unreliability of eyewitness identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-9\">I rather think in all of these situations it is a balancing question. The ruling of the court (excluding the proffered testimony) is in no way predicated upon the absence of qualifications of the witness who has been identified in his professional field of psychology. The ruling, including the use of his testimony as an expert, is that it goes beyond the field of expertise to which such testimony should be directed or can be directed, and is basically argumentative and intrusive upon the jury\u2019s responsibility as triers of the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">Even if the admission of expert testimony concerning eyewitness identification is proper under certain circumstances, \u201cthere is no federal authority for the proposition that such testimony <em>must </em>be admitted.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>786 F.2d 1308, 1312-13 (5th Cir.1986). We have repeatedly upheld the exclusion of such testimony. <em>See United States v. Brewer, </em>783 F.2d 841, 842 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Amaral, </em>488 F.2d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1973). It was within the broad discretion of the trial court to conclude that, on balance, the jury would not benefit from admission of the proffered evidence. <em>See United States v. Solomon, </em>753 F.2d 1522, 1525 (9th Cir. 1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Awkard, </em>597 F.2d 667, 669 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 885, 100 S.Ct. 179, 62 L.Ed.2d 116 <em>and </em>444 U.S. 969, 100 S.Ct. 460, 62 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979) (\u201cExpert testimony is admissible if the jury may receive \u2018appreciable help\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>from it.\u201d). <em>See also Brown v. Darcy, </em>783 F.2d 1389, 1396 (9th Cir.1986) (Expert testimony is properly excluded where it \u201cinfringes on the jury\u2019s role\u201d; <em>United States v. Binder, </em>769 F.2d 595, 602 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cExpert testimony should not be permitted if it concerns a subject ... that invades the province of the jury.\u201d); <em>Amaral, </em>488 F.2d at 1153 (\u201cIt is the responsibility of counsel during cross-examination to inquire into the witness\u2019 opportunity for observation, his capacity for observation, his attention and interest and his distraction or division of attention.\u201d). As exclusion was not \u201cmanifestly erroneous,\u201d the judgment will not be disturbed. <em>See Salem v. United States Lines Co., </em>370 U.S. 31, 35, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 1122, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">At Langford\u2019s behest, the professional relationship between Langford and Parole Officer Richard Wood was not revealed to the jury when Wood identified Langford in the bank surveillance photographs. Sworn declarations submitted by Langford in connection with his post-trial motion for a new trial establish (1) that during a recess in trial proceedings Wood entered and exited the probation office in view of the jury, and (2) that post-trial interviews with an undisclosed number of jurors revealed that three had determined that Wood was Langford\u2019s probation or parole officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Langford contends that the affidavits establish that the jury was improperly exposed to \u201cextraneous and prejudicial matter\u201d and that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a second new trial. His argument is that Wood\u2019s presence in the probation office gave rise to the inference that Langford had previously been convicted of a federal offense. That information, he continues, prejudiced Lang-ford\u2019s defense, necessitating reversal and a third trial. In the alternative, Langford contends that the matter should be remanded for a hearing concerning the nature of any extraneous information that reached the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">When information not admitted into evidence reaches the jury, \u201cthe defendant is entitled to a new trial if \u2018there existed a reasonable possibility that the extrinsic material could have affected the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>641 F.2d 1235,1240 (9th Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>597 F.2d 192, 193 (9th Cir.1979)), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 480, 70 L.Ed.2d 251 (1981). While we independently review allegations of juror misconduct to determine whether a new trial is required, <em>United States v. Halbert, </em>712 F.2d 388, 389 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1005, 104 S.Ct. 997, 79 L.Ed.2d 230 (1984), we give substantial weight to the district court\u2019s conclusion about the effect of the juror misconduct. <em>Id. </em>The tenuous connection between Wood\u2019s emergence from the probation office and knowledge of Langford\u2019s prior conviction is insufficient to support a finding of a reasonable possibility that the event complained of could have affected the verdict. While we recognize that where a trial court learns of a possible incident of jury misconduct, it is preferable to hold an evidentiary hearing \u201cto determine the precise nature of the extraneous information,\u201d <em>United States v. Bagnariol, </em>665 F.2d 877, 885 (9th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 962, 102 S.Ct. 2040, 72 L.Ed.2d 487 (1982), not every allegation that extraneous information has reached the jury requires a full-dress hearing. <em>United States v. Halbert, </em>712 F.2d at 389 (hearing not required where the trial court knew the exact scope and nature of the extraneous information). The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to conduct such a hearing. <em>Cf. Halbert, </em>712 F.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">We have reviewed the additional assignments of error urged by Langford in his pro se briefs and find them to be uniformly meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1262-10\">FERGUSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACvB\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">It is time for this circuit to reexamine the importance of expert testimony concerning the reliability of eyewitness identification and to provide guidance to the district courts for exercising discretion to exclude such testimony. I therefore dissent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>the majority's unquestioning reliance on <em>United States v. Amaral, </em>488 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir.1973). We should instead adopt the guidelines emerging from cases that actually consider this issue. <em>See United States v. Downing, </em>753 F.2d 1224 (3d Cir. 1985); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>736 F.2d 1103 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 868, 105 S.Ct. 213, 83 L.Ed.2d 143 (1984). I would vote to reverse Langford\u2019s conviction because the district court abused its discretion by refusing to admit expert testimony regarding eyewitness unreliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">On January 15, 1985, a bank robbery occurred in San Francisco. Although no physical evidence was obtained from the crime scene, the bank\u2019s surveillance camera photographed the robbery. Two days after the robbery, the bank teller who was robbed, Eufrocina Clemente, identified an individual as the robber from a photo lineup. Later investigation revealed that the identified person could not have committed the crime, and he was released from custody-</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">On January 23, 1985, Clemente was shown another set of photos, and this time she identified the defendant as the robber. Police showed the same set of photos to another bank teller, Sheri Bitanga, but she could not identify anyone in the photos as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">The government charged the defendant, in an indictment, with armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. At trial, identification of the person who robbed the bank consisted entirely of the testimony of two eyewitnesses, Clemente and Bitanga, and the lay opinions of two persons that the defendant was the person in the bank surveillance photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">The court refused to allow the defendant's expert witness to testify on the unreliability of eyewitness identification, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-11\">The ruling of this court is in no way predicated upon the absence of qualifications of the witness who has been identified in his professional field of psychology. The ruling, including the use of his testimony as an expert, is that it goes beyond the field of expertise to which such testimony should be directed or can be directed, and is basically argumentative and intrusive upon the jury\u2019s responsibility as triers [sic] of the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-12\">The expert would have testified that perception, retention, recall, and cross-racial factors affect an eyewitness\u2019s ability to identify an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-14\">The facts of this case directly force us to evaluate the continuing vitality of Ninth Circuit precedent in light of thirteen years of scientific development in the field of human perception, retention, and recall, and recent Supreme Court and other circuits\u2019 case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-15\">In 1973, when scientific work with eyewitness identification was developing, we upheld a district court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony regarding eyewitness reliability. We determined whether the district court abused its discretion to exclude the expert testimony by evaluating four factors: \u201c1. qualified expert; 2. proper subject; 3. conformity to a generally accepted explanatory theory; and 4. probative value compared to prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Amaral, </em>488 F.2d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1973). Despite the multitiered framework it established, <em>Amaral </em>addressed only the second factor: whether the testimony was a \u201cproper subject\u201d at that time. We described the test for admitting expert testimony as \u201cwhether the jury can receive \u2018appreciable help from such testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1152.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>district court did not abuse its discretion only because the expert\u2019s testimony was no more \u201chelpful\u201d to a jury than effective cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 1153. In the ensuing thirteen years, however, the scientific community has produced a significant amount of information demonstrating the value of expert testimony about eyewitness unreliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">The majority in this case, as with every Ninth Circuit case since <em>Amaral, </em>affirms a district court\u2019s decision excluding such expert testimony with little or no discussion of the issues involved or the growing body of scientific and psychological information available. <em>See United States v. Poole, </em>794 F.2d 462, 468-69 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>783 F.2d 841, 843 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>563 F.2d 1361,1363 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1021, 98 S.Ct. 747, 54 L.Ed.2d 769 (1978); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>501 F.2d 146, 150-51 (9th Cir.1974), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. United States v. Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>see also United States v. Sims, </em>617 F.2d 1371, 1375 (9th Cir.1980) (reviewing refusal to appoint eyewitness expert). <em>But see Smith, </em>563 F.2d at 1364-66 (Hufstedler, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">The issue defendant raises \u2014 one the majority and these other cases have for the most part ignored \u2014 is whether the scientific field has sufficiently developed since <em>Amaral </em>to conclude that such expert testimony could provide appreciable assistance to the jury beyond that obtained through cross-examination and the jurors\u2019 collective common sense. Because the <em>Amaral </em>court examined the issue when the relevant theories were in their infant stages, <em>see Amaral, </em>488 F.2d at 1153 (noting that no other reported decision addressed issue), I believe we must open our eyes and examine the current state of knowledge, rather than blindly reaffirming <em>Amaral. </em>The evidence is overwhelming that the <em>Amaral </em>conclusion \u2014 that juries could not gain from such expert testimony \u2014 is untenable today.</p>\n<p id=\"AbG\">Expert testimony that can explain to a jury the problems inherent in eyewitness identification is extremely relevant. Given the unreliability and pervasive influence of eyewitness testimony, expert testimony is not only more probative than prejudicial, it prevents the eyewitness testimony from having an overly prejudicial effect. Courts and scholars have long recognized the untrustworthiness of eyewitness testimony. <em>E.g., Watkins v. Sowders, </em>449 U.S. 341, 350, 101 S.Ct. 654, 659-60, 66 L.Ed.2d 549 (1981) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (\u201ceyewitness identification evidence is notoriously unreliable\u201d); <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 228, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1933, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) (\u201cThe vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Fogg, </em>589 F.2d 108, 112 (2d Cir.1978) (\u201cCenturies of experience in the administration of criminal justice have shown that convictions based solely on testimony that identifies a defendant previously unknown to the witness [are] highly suspect.\u201d); E. Borchard, <em>Convicting the Innocent: Errors of Criminal Justice </em>(3d ed. 1970). The problem is compounded because juries almost unquestioningly accept eyewitness testimony. <em>See, e.g., Watkins, </em>449 U.S. at 352, 101 S.Ct. at 660-61 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (\u201c[D]espite its inherent unreliability, much eyewitness identification evidence has a powerful impact on juries.\u201d); E. Loftus, <em>Eyewitness Testimony </em>9 (1979) (eyewitness identification is \u201coverwhelmingly influential\u201d); P. Wall, <em>Eye-Witness Identification in Criminal Cases </em>19 (1965) (\u201c[J]uries are unduly receptive to identification evidence and are not sufficiently aware of its dangers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">Expert testimony on this issue is important because it reveals the reasons why a witness may truthfully, but mistakenly, believe that the defendant was the culprit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number><em>See United States v. Moore, </em>786 F.2d 1308, 1312 (5th Cir.1986); I. Horowitz &amp; T. Willing, <em>The Psychology of Law: Integrations and Applications </em>238-41 (1984). We can no longer believe that jurors come to the courtroom already equipped with such knowledge. <em>See United States v. Downing, </em>753 F.2d 1224, 1230-31 (3d Cir.1985) (factors regarding reliability are \u201cbeyond what an average juror might know as a matter of common knowledge and indeed some of them directly contradict \u2018common sense\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>736 F.2d 1103, 1106 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 868,105 S.Ct. 213, 83 L.Ed.2d 143 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">The key to the <em>Amaral </em>holding is that panel\u2019s conclusion this information may be obtained by cross-examination. However, cross-examination cannot uncover the reasons for misidentification because the witness honestly does not believe he or she has misidentified the defendant. <em>See Downing, </em>753 F.2d at 1230 n. 6 (\u201cTo the extent that a mistaken witness may retain <em>great </em>confidence in an inaccurate identification, cross-examination can hardly be seen as an effective way to reveal the weaknesses in a witness\u2019 recollection of an event.\u201d). Moreover, a witness is unqualified to testify about the theories surrounding perception, retention, and recall. Only one trained in psychology or science could testify about such theories. Finally, even with such cross-examination, juries are unduly influenced by eyewitness testimony. <em>See </em>Rahaim &amp; Brodsky, <em>Empirical Evidence versus Common Sense: Juror and Lawyer Knowledge of Eyewitness Accuracy, </em>7 Law &amp; Psychology Rev. 1, 7 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">For these reasons, I believe that we cannot uphold exclusion of expert testimony based solely on the reasons set forth in <em>Amaral. </em>The issue then becomes: Should the evidence be excluded on other grounds?</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">Although most circuit court decisions have upheld district courts\u2019 exclusion of such evidence, <em>see Downing, </em>753 F.2d at 1230 n. 4 (collecting cases), the emerging trend in both state and federal courts is to favor admissibility. <em>See id.; Smith, </em>736 F.2d at 1103; <em>People v. McDonald, </em>37 Cal.3d 351, 208 Cal.Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709 (1984); <em>State v. Chapple, </em>135 Ariz. 281, 660 P.2d 1208 (1983). Each of these recent decisions has recognized that the eyewitness expert field has developed tremendously since the 1970s. <em>See, e.g., McDonald, </em>37 Cal.3d at 365, 208 Cal.Rptr. at 245, 690 P.2d at 718 (citing the proliferation of empirical studies and scholarly work since the 1970s). The courts that favor admissibility have found that the field has produced a substantial body of highly sophisticated and generally accepted theoretical explanations for ascertaining and evaluating the reliability of eyewitness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-10\">On the other hand, decisions that continue to limit admissibility do so primarily for three reasons. First, some courts have held, as the district court did here, that the testimony is inadmissible because it usurps the jury function. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>540 F.2d 1048, 1054 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1100, 97 S.Ct. 1122, 51 L.Ed.2d 549 (1977). This rationale has been discredited and rejected by scholars, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the Supreme Court. Dean Wigmore claimed that the jury function reasoning is a \u201cmere bit of empty rhetoric.\u201d 7 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence in Trials at Common Law </em>\u00a7 1920, at 18 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1978). The Federal Rules <em>of </em>Evidence have eliminated this rationale as a permissible objection to opinion evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 704(a) (\u201c[Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Rogers, </em>769 F.2d 1418, 1425 (9th Cir.1985). The Supreme Court rejected similar arguments in <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 899, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3397-98, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983) (\u201cWe are not persuaded that [psychiatric evaluations of dangerousness are] almost entirely unreliable and that the factfinder and the adversary system will not be competent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>uncover, recognize, and take due account of its shortcomings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Second, in some early decisions courts concluded that the expert testimony lacked sufficient scientific reliability. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Watson, </em>587 F.2d 365, 369 (7th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1132, 99 S.Ct. 1055, 59 L.Ed.2d 95 (1979). This rationale can no longer be used to exclude this evidence. <em>Moore, </em>786 F.2d at 1312. As the most recent court decisions have found, the scientific study of eyewitness identification has become a respected and sophisticated one. <em>See, e.g., Smith, </em>736 F.2d at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Third, courts have held that the probative value of the expert testimony is outweighed by its prejudicial impact on the jury. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fosher, </em>590 F.2d 381, 383-84 (1st Cir.1979). However, the \u201cprejudice\u201d involved in such an inquiry refers to \u201cprejudice\u201d to the defendant. <em>See Smith, </em>736 F.2d at 1107. Moreover, the expert testimony is no more prejudicial or influential than the eyewitness testimony itself, yet no court has held that eyewitness testimony should be excluded in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">We should follow the guidelines for admitting expert testimony on eyewitness identification presented in the recent decisions favoring admissibility. Each provides extensive guidance to the trial courts in resolving this question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each examined the expert\u2019s qualifications, the reliability of the evidence, the likelihood of misleading or confusing the jury, and the link between the proffered testimony and the particular facts of the case in deciding whether such testimony is admissible. <em>See Downing, </em>753 F.2d at 1237-43; <em>Smith, </em>736 F.2d at 1105-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">Establishing such guidelines would prevent the continued application of a mechanical rule against admitting expert testimony on the reliability of eyewitness identification. Defendant contends that the district court used such a mechanical rule here. I agree. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the proffered testimony. The government relied almost entirely on eyewitness testimony to link the defendant to the crime. If expert testimony is ever appropriate, it is here. One of the eyewitnesses, Clemente, initially misidentified another person as the robber. The other, Bitanga, stated that she did not get a \u201cgood look\u201d at the robber and could not identify the defendant in the police\u2019s first photo lineup. Both viewed the robber under similarly stressful conditions. <em>See Moore, </em>786 F.2d at 1313 (\u201cWe emphasize that in a case in which the sole testimony is casual eyewitness identification, expert testimony regarding the accuracy of that identification is admissible and properly may be encouraged.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-12\">In certain cases, there may be sufficient reason to exclude the evidence, but I cannot condone the practice of a blanket rule of exclusion in every case. More important, this court has never provided any guidance in exercising that discretion. Without such guidance, the review for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d becomes a meaningless charade. If we are to abdicate our appellate responsibilities in this fashion, let us do so openly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">If these facts do not cry out for reversing for abuse of discretion, none will. I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1263-9\">. The Federal Rules of Evidence, enacted after <em>Amaral, </em>state the test for admissibility in slightly different terms. Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuX\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>cation, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">Thus, the rules permit expert testimony if it \"will be helpful to the trier of fact in understanding evidence that is simply difficult, [although] not beyond ordinary understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-14\">S. Saltzburg &amp; K. Redden, <em>Federal Rules of Evidence Manual </em>451 (3d ed. 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">. The government criticizes these approaches as being too complicated and points to the simplicity of the <em>Amaral </em>scheme. My reading of <em>Amaral </em>reveals no required procedure whatsoever. It held simply that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
