Thomas, Senior District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-4\">MERRITT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1060, limits the assignment of registered trademarks so that marks are assignable only \u201cwith the good will of the business in which the mark is used, or with that part of good will ... connected with the use of ... the mark.\u201d The issue here is whether a security interest in a trademark constitutes an impermissible \u201cassignment in gross\u201d under the Act if the security interest fails to cover machinery and equipment needed to produce the trademarked goods. We hold that it does not and affirm the decisions of the District Court and Bankruptcy Court, 43 B.R. 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The facts are not disputed. A lender, National Acceptance Company of America, the appellee, made a loan to Roman Cleanser Company in 1978 and obtained a security interest \u201cin and to all of Roman Cleanser\u2019s then owned and thereafter acquired goods, equipment, and general intangibles and the proceeds thereof as collateral for the payment of all indebtedness and liabilities then existing or thereafter arising of Roman Cleanser to NAC.\u201d NAC correctly filed a financing statement with the Michigan Secretary of State. Roman Cleanser Company was a Michigan corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling household cleaning products, including \u201cRoman Cleaner\u201d scouring powder. On February 9,1984, Roman Cleanser filed for protection under Chapter 11, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301. In August of that year, the proceeding was converted to one under Chapter 7, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112. Subject to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination of the respective interests of claimants in the trademarks, the federally registered trademarks (along with Roman Cleanser\u2019s formulas and customer lists) were sold to the Michlin Chemical Corporation for $180,000. Sometime prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, NAC released its security interest in the vehicles, machinery, and equipment. The sole issue in this case is the validity of NAC\u2019s security interest in the Roman Cleanser trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The Trustee in bankruptcy as appellant argues that a security interest in a trademark is improper unless it is held by a \u201cqualified taker,\u201d by which he means an entity that either holds a security interest in the equipment necessary to produce the product to which the trademark relates or that already possesses such equipment itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This construction of the term \u201cgoodwill of the business\u201d is necessary, he argues, in order to ensure that consumers will not be misled by a transferee who applies the trademark to products having different characteristics than were associated with the trademark prior to the transfer. Under this definition, the lender, National, is not a \u201cqualified taker\u201d since it retains a security interest in only the trademarks, formulas and customer lists associated with Roman Cleanser.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">It is certainly true that Congress did not intend to establish an open market in trademarks that are not associated with any particular goods, such as exists in some other countries, and enacted the goodwill requirement to prevent such a situation. It does not follow, however, that Congress intended to make the transfer of trademarks contingent on the transfer or possession of machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">The construction of the term \u201cgoodwill\u201d to mean \u201cgoodwill, including machinery necessary to manufacture the product in question\u201d does not serve a useful purpose. Such a requirement would not confer any real protection on consumers. There could be only two ways in which a \u201cqualified taker\u201d requirement might protect consum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ers from deception, neither of which applies here: the requirement that the assignee possess the tangible assets needed to produce the product might protect consumers (1) from trademarked goods that are different from the original because the assignee is ignorant of the methods used to produce the original product, or (2) from an unscrupulous assignee who deliberately changes the quality of the goods for the worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In this case, the formulas and customer lists of Roman Cleanser passed with the trademarks, so that there can be no question of the assignee\u2019s knowledge about how to produce the goods at quality levels identical to those enjoyed by Roman Cleanser\u2019s customers before the assignment. As for protecting consumers from unscrupulous practices, it is hard to see how a requirement that equipment be transferred along with the trademark would provide any protection at all, since the assignee would still remain free to adulterate or otherwise debase the products produced by the equipment after it was transferred. Consumers are protected against such practices by the mechanisms of the market (witness the \u201cnew Coke\u201d phenomenon) and by anti-fraud laws, with trademark law playing a distinctly subordinate role.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Grafting a \u201cmachinery and equipment\u201d rule onto the \u201cgoodwill\u201d rule of the Lanham Act comes within neither the language nor the purpose of the assignment clause. Many firms marketing consumer products have no equipment of their own, but rely exclusively on outside producers under contract. The application of the Trustee\u2019s \u201cqualified taker\u201d theory to such firms would produce needless confusion, and to no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We are of the opinion that the \u201cgoodwill\u201d spoken of in the statute does not mean machinery, and that the transfer of formulas and customer lists, both classic elements of goodwill, along with the trademarks satisfies the statutory requirement. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-14\">. The Trustee admits that the \"qualified taker\u201d requirement is of his own invention, and that no court has adopted it. His arguments are thus necessarily based on the policies underlying the Lanham Act, as is our disposition of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\">. Trademark law does provide some protection against subsequent fraud by an assignee, since such fraud can lead to a loss of trademark rights. See 1 J. Gilson, Trademark Protection and Practice \u00a7 3.07 at 3-105 (1985). This fact further vitiates any justification for a \"qualified taker\" requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">. The concurring opinion may or may not be correct in arguing that technically there has been no assignment of the Roman Cleanser trademark to NAC and that the issue is premature. The problem with that position in this case is that we cannot find that the assignment issue discussed in the concurring opinion has been raised, presented for review or briefed by the parties. The parties have joined issue on the assignment \u2018in gross\u2019 issue discussed above, not the issue discussed in the concurring opinion. In the statement of issues portion of his brief, the Trustee presents one issue for review as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">\n<em>\"STATEMENT OF ISSUE\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">\"Did the lower courts err as a matter of law in holding that creditor had a valid and enforceable security interest in debtor\u2019s trademarks, when creditor had no equipment or facilities capable of producing or marketing the trademark products and no security interest in such equipment or facilities, so that it could not have acquired or sold the trademarks without violating the Lanham Trademark Act\u2019s ban on \u2018in gross\u2019 interests?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">This is the only issue that appellee, NAC, attempts to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">The briefs of both parties assume an assignment and discuss only the issue stated above. We hesitate to decide the technical \u2018assignment\u2019 issue without further briefing and a more complete treatment of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b323-10\">WILLIAM K. THOMAS, Senior District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AT3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">I concur in the majority decision, affirming the decisions of the District Court and Bankruptcy Court. However, in joining the majority\u2019s decision I analyze the case differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">In the first part of his opinion, the Bankruptcy Judge concluded that by its Article 9 filing of its financing statement with the Michigan Secretary of State,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> National Acceptance Company of America (NAC) perfected its security interest \u201cin and to all of Roman Cleanser\u2019s then owned and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>after acquired goods, equipment and general intangibles and the proceeds thereof as collateral for the payment of all indebtedness and liabilities then existing or thereafter arising of Roman Cleanser to NAC.\u201d In reaching this conclusion the Bankruptcy Judge determined that contrary to the Trustee\u2019s contention, NAC was not required, in order to perfect its interest, to file a conditional assignment of its security interest (in the federally registered trademarks) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1060, provides that a \u201cregistered mark [trademark] ... shall be assignable with the goodwill of the business in which the mark is used.\u201d It is further provided that assignment shall be by an instrument in writing (duly executed) and that the assignment \u201cshall be void as against any subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark Office____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In holding that NAC need not file with the Patent and Trademark Office in order to perfect its interest, the Bankruptcy Court in this case observed that \u201c[trademark cases distinguish between security interests and assignments.\u201d 43 B.R. at 944. Upon an extensive review of the authorities which have addressed the subject the Bankruptcy Court further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtI\">An \u201cassignment\u201d of a trademark is an absolute transfer of the entire right, title and interest of the trademark____ The grant of a security interest is not such a transfer. It is merely what the term suggests \u2014 a device to secure an indebtedness. It is a mere agreement to assign in the event of a default by the debtor. \u201c[T]he rule is well established that a mere agreement for the future assignment of a trademark is not an assignment of either the mark itself or the goodwill attached to it.\u201d <em>LiT Red Bam </em>at 107.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The Trustee does not appeal the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe Article 9 filing perfected NAC\u2019s security interest.\u201d However, the Trustee does appeal these ultimate conclusions of the Bankruptcy Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">1) \u201cBecause NAC had a valid and perfected security interest in the formulas and customer lists\u201d NAC, therefore, had a perfected security interest in the assets sold to Michlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">2) NAC\u2019s security interest is not subject to attack by the Trustee as an assignment in gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">The Trustee first argues that \u201ccreditor had no security interest in Debtor\u2019s Trademarks after December 21, 1983.\u201d On that date, in exchange for a partial repayment of NAC\u2019s loan, creditor NAC released its security interest in debtor Roman Cleanser\u2019s vehicles, machinery, equipment and fixtures. Nevertheless, NAC retained its security interest in Roman Cleanser\u2019s trademarks, formulas and customer lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">Although NAC released its interest in Roman Cleanser\u2019s vehicles, machinery, equipment and fixtures, the debtor still controlled and used the trademarks, the formulas and the customer lists. The conditional or inchoate nature of NAC\u2019s security interest therefore could not have affected the identity or the quality of the products that Roman Cleanser continued to manufacture under its marks. Thus, there could be no violation of the Lanham Act\u2019s policy of protecting the public from the possible manufacture and sale of goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that might copy Roman Cleanser\u2019s products but were not associated with the marks\u2019 goodwill. Hence, on December 21, after NAC\u2019s release of its security interest in the tangible assets of Roman Cleanser, NAC\u2019s conditional assignment in the trademarks had not become an \u201cassignment\u201d under the Lanham Act. <em>See Adams Apple Distributing Co. v. Papeleras Reuindas, S.A., </em>773 F.2d 925, 931 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The Trustee further argues that under bankruptcy law \u201cthe validity of a creditor\u2019s claimed security interest is determined at the latest as of the date bankruptcy proceedings are initiated.\u201d Trustee argues that on the date bankruptcy proceedings were commenced, February 9, 1984, \u201ccreditor did not have the ability to manufacture or market the trademark products.\u201d While default under the NAC-Roman Cleanser \u201cLoan and Security Agreement\u201d had now occurred (bankruptcy proceedings was an event that produced default under the agreement), the occurrence of default did not automatically cause the trademarked products to be assigned to the creditor. Thus, there was still no \u201cassignment\u201d to NAC as of February 9, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It is essential, therefore, to examine pertinent events after February 9, 1984. On June 12, 1984 the Bankruptcy Court entered an order which \u201cauthorized\u201d the sale of trademarks, formulas and customer lists [to Michlin] for the sum of $180,000.\u201d On the next day, June 13, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order transferring the \u201cclaims of National Acceptance Corporation against any assets of this estate ... to the proceeds of sale of the assets of the Debtor, with the validity, priority and amount of said claims to be determined by the court at a later date.\u201d By stipulation of the parties, NAC intervened in Patterson Laboratories\u2019 adversary proceeding against Roman Cleaner and therein NAC claimed that it had \u201ca first and prior security interest in the trademarks and trade names of Roman Cleanser Company which are the subject of this Adversary Proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">It is recognized in trademark law that when the creditor, upon a debtor\u2019s default, enforces its conditional assignment in a trademark, the conditional assignment \u201cbecomes an operative assignment and goodwill must pass with the mark to the creditor-assignee.\u201d 1 J. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition, </em>\u00a7 18:1 p. 796 (2d ed. 1984). Under this general rule it must be decided whether NAC\u2019s conditional right to an assignment under its security interest was transformed into an assignment by virtue of NAC\u2019s intervention in the adversary proceedings or any succeeding event.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>NAC\u2019s motion to enforce a \u201cfirst and prior security interest in Roman Cleanser\u2019s trademarks and trade names\u201d was made within the legal framework of section 363 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363. The Trustee is authorized by section 363(b) to sell estate property outside \u201cthe ordinary course of business.\u201d Under certain conditions, section 363(f) permits such a sale to be made \u201cfree and clear of any interest in such property of an entity other than the estate.\u201d The fourth condition of section 363(f) is that such interest is in \u201cbona fide dispute.\u201d Pursuant to these provisions the Bankruptcy Court approved the Trustee\u2019s sale to Michlin of Roman Cleanser\u2019s trademarks, formulas and customer lists for $180,000 cash. Concurrently, the Bankruptcy Court transferred NAC\u2019s lien to the proceeds of sale. Since NAC sought only enforcement of its lien and accepted transfer of that lien to the money proceeds of the sale to Michlin it is evident that no title or ownership rights in the trademarks at any time were transferred to NAC. Hence, I conclude that neither NAC\u2019s motion to intervene nor the resulting transfer of its lien to the proceeds of the sale became \u201can operative assignment.\u201d J. McCarthy, <em>supra </em>p. 211, at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Such conclusion is supported by the fact that NAC did not receive and never had the use of the Roman Cleanser trademarks, trade names, formulas or customer lists. Thus, NAC at no time could have thwarted the policy behind the requirement of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1060 that the registered mark must be assigned with the goodwill of the business in which the mark is used. This policy is to protect the quality of products processed and sold under registered trademarks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">For these various reasons it is determined that neither NAC\u2019s security interest, nor its motion to intervene to claim a first and prior security interest in the trademarks and trade names of Roman Cleanser, created an assignment under section 1060 of the Lanham Act. Because there was no assignment of the Roman Cleanser trademarks to NAC, the Lanham Act\u2019s goodwill requirement is inapplicable. Therefore, I conclude that the Bankruptcy Court properly held that NAC\u2019s security interest in the debtor\u2019s collateral, which included the debtor\u2019s trademarks, formulas and customer lists, perfected under the Article 9 filing, did not violate federal trademark law and was valid and enforceable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>In summary, I have concluded that NAC\u2019s security interest in the Roman Cleanser trademarks, customer lists and formulas was not an \u201cassignment,\u201d and never became an \u201cassignment,\u201d under the Lanham Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the goodwill requirement of section 1060 is inapplicable. For this reason, I join the majority\u2019s decision affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-18\">.

In footnote 3 of the majority opinion it is stated that \"the assignment issue discussed in the concurring opinion has [not] been raised, presented for review or briefed by the parties.\u201d As I read the briefs, however, the question of whether NAC\u2019s security interest constituted an assignment is recognized as an issue by the parties. On page 10 of its brief, NAC contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAV\">The terms \"security interest\u201d and \"assignment\u201d are terms of art with distinct and different meanings. A security interest is an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures its payment or performance of an obligation____ An \"assignment\u201d of a trademark is an absolute transfer of the entire right, title and interest to the trademark____ The grant of a security interest is not such a transfer. It is merely what the term suggests \u2014 a device to secure an indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A28\">In response, the Trustee asserts on page 6 of his reply brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">Creditor relies heavily on observations ... to the effect that the initial granting of a security interest in a trademark is different from an outright assignment of the trademark because in the former case the creditor had no present right to use the mark____ This distinction is irrelevant to the issue presented in the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">The majority opinion states that \u201d[i]n this case, the formulas and customer lists of Roman Cleanser passed with the trademark,\u201d presumably to NAC. It is not clear at what point of time or by what event the majority concludes the \u201dpass[ing]\u201d to NAC occurred. In any event, the question of whether NAC\u2019s security interest amounted to an \"assignment\" is subsumed within the assignment in gross question argued by the parties. If there was no assignment, then NAC\u2019s interest could not be treated as an assignment in gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">In addition, in the Bankruptcy Court the question identified in the above quoted portions of the appellate briefs was similarly raised in the briefs filed by the parties. Thus it was that the Bankruptcy Court devoted the major portion of its opinion to the question of whether NAC\u2019s security interest constituted an assignment under the Lanham Act. Since the Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Court concluded that the security interest did not constitute an assignment, it ruled that the security interest (conditional assignment) need not be filed with the Patent and Trademark Office in order to be perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">For these reasons, I believe that the question of whether NAC\u2019s security interest was an assignment in gross first requires a decision as to whether it ever became an \u201cassignment,\" and that it is appropriate and essential for the court to make such a determination on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">. In his principal brief the Trustee heads Section IV: \"Because the question is whether creditor\u2019s claimed security interest would have been valid absent these bankruptcy proceedings, the lower courts erred ...\" To the contrary, I believe that the validity of NAC\u2019s enforcement of its security interest must be decided within the legal framework of section 363(b) and (f) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">. The present inapplicability of section 1060 is apparent in another respect. Assignments of registered marks should be recorded in the Patent and Trademark Office. However, NAC\u2019s stipulated intervention in the adversary proceeding, as analyzed above, could not have qualified and did not qualify as an assignment of registered marks that was eligible for recording.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\">. As seen, the Trustee transferred and assigned to Michlin title and ownership rights in the Roman Cleanser trademarks, formulas and customer lists. In reaching its conclusion that NAC\u2019s security interest \u201cis not subject to attack ... as an assignment in gross,\u201d the Bankruptcy Court focused on this transfer to Michlin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">The Trustee does not allege that the transfer to Michlin was invalid as an assignment in gross, conceding by implication the validity of the transfer. If the Trustee's assignment of the marks was valid, there is no basis for challenging NAC\u2019s security interest as an invalid assignment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">43 B.R. at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">I do not accept the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s reasoning. The validity of NAC\u2019s security interest and its enforcement thereof is separate from and is not affected by the validity of the Trustee\u2019s assignment of the trademarks, formulas and customer lists to Michlin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b327-15\">. If I had concluded that NAC\u2019s security interest was transformed into an assignment, then I would agree with Judge Merritt that a security interest in a trademark and goodwill consisting of formulas and customer lists is not an impermissible \"assignment in gross\u201d even though the security interest fails to cover machinery and equipment needed to produce the trademarked goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
