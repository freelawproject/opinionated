For the reasons stated below, we dismiss the appeals and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">This suit was brought by eighteen nonresident aliens who were injured or whose decedents were killed when the pickup truck in which they were riding overturned in Jim Hogg County, Texas on February 27, 1980. The accident occurred during a high speed chase by two federal Border Patrol Agents, defendants Robert Handy and David Wharton, after Handy shot the rear tires of the truck with a revolver and shotgun. The agents had responded to a call for assistance from two deputy sheriffs of the county who had observed the truck running a stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-23\">On September 26, 1984, after a bench trial, the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court concluded that Handy and Wharton were liable for an intentional tort under Texas common law. The court also found that Handy and Wharton had acted within the scope of their employment and that the United States was liable for their actions under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680. Accordingly, the court found the United States and Handy and Wharton jointly and severally liable for compensatory damages totalling $171,449.25. In addition, the court found that Handy and Wharton were not liable for a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and that none of the defendants were liable for attorney\u2019s fees. Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ly, the court awarded the plaintiffs punitive damages of $41,600 against Handy only.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">On November 2, 1984, the district court issued an order amending in part its September 26 decision. Vacating its previous finding that the plaintiffs had not proven a \u00a7 1983 violation by the individual defendants, the court instead expressly reserved ruling on the \u00a7 1983 claims. Moreover, the court partially reversed itself on the attorney\u2019s fees question, granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 against Handy and Wharton. In support of this ruling the court cited <em>Williams v. Thomas, </em>692 F.2d 1032, 1036 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1133, 103 S.Ct. 3115, 77 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1983) (attorney\u2019s fees may be granted under \u00a7 1988 to plaintiff who prevails on pendent nonconstitutional claims when court declines to reach substantial constitutional claims). The court withheld ruling on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees due, however, stating that Handy and Wharton would have until November 26, 1984 either to negotiate a settlement or to challenge the amounts requested by the plaintiffs. As before, the court did not assess attorney\u2019s fees against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The individual defendants and the United States filed appeals, and the plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal limited to the question of whether the district court erred in denying attorney\u2019s fees against the United States under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b). Shortly after the appeals were filed, the district court entered the following order: \u201cThe Court has been advised that Plaintiffs are appealing the Court\u2019s refusal to tax fees against the United States and that Defendants are appealing the liability findings against them. The matter of calculating attorney\u2019s fees is thus STAYED until any of the parties can offer a cogent argument to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Subsequently, the parties reached a partial settlement of the case. In exchange for the United States\u2019 unconditional agreement to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 compensatory damages, the plaintiffs relinquished their rights to collect the punitive damages assessed against Handy. Further, the plaintiffs agreed not to enforce the award of attorney\u2019s fees against the individual defendants unless their fee claim against the United States was finally denied on appeal. Thus, the merits of the case were settled, reserving only the attorney\u2019s fees issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Prior to oral argument, we requested the parties to address the issue of whether appellate jurisdiction was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Though they championed different theories of jurisdiction, all parties urged us to review the district court\u2019s rulings on attorney\u2019s fees. Because we conclude that the appeals are premature, we do not reach the issues addressed in the parties\u2019 briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">In a line of cases beginning with <em>Holmes v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., </em>682 F.2d 1143 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1107, 103 S.Ct. 732, 74 L.Ed.2d 956 (1983), this court consistently has held district court orders allowing fees but failing to calculate the amount to be nonappealable. At the same time, the court has recognized that, in appropriate circumstances, such orders may constitute final, appealable judgments. The determination has turned upon the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and the source of his entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In <em>Holmes, </em>the plaintiff brought an action against his employer under the Jones Act and general maritime law. The jury, finding that the employer had willfully and arbitrarily refused to pay maintenance and cure, awarded the plaintiff damages, maintenance and cure, and attorney\u2019s fees. The amount of the attorney\u2019s fees, however, was left for the court. In dismissing the appeal as premature, the court articulated the following test for finality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-13\">When attorney\u2019s fees are similar to costs ... or collateral to an action ... a lack of determination as to the amount does not preclude the issuance of a final, appeal-able judgment on the merits. When, however, the attorney\u2019s fees are an integral part of the merits of the case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the scope of relief, they cannot be characterized as costs or as collateral and their determination is a part of any final, appealable judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">682 F.2d at 1146. Finding that in an action for arbitrary and willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure attorney\u2019s fees were \u201can integral part of the merits,\u201d the court concluded that the judgment could not be appealed prior to the fixing of the amount of fees. <em>Id. </em>at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Subsequent cases applying the <em>Holmes </em>test have also found no appealable final judgment where the plaintiff is awarded fees in an indeterminate amount. In <em>Oxford Production Credit Ass\u2019n v. Duck-worth, </em>689 F.2d 587 (5th Cir.1982), the court held that in a contract action under Mississippi law attorney\u2019s fees provided for by the contract were not collateral but integral to the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 589. The court reached a similar result in <em>Alcorn County v. U.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc., </em>731 F.2d 1160 (5th Cir.1984), an action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, where the same statutory section that created the cause of action provided for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 1165. And in <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Auto Transp., </em>763 F.2d 745 (5th Cir. 1985), the court found that, in an action for breach of implied warranties of workmanlike performance, attorney\u2019s fees were akin to damages and therefore \u201can integral part of the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751. <em>Cf. Bilmar Drilling, Inc. v. IFG Leasing Co., </em>795 F.2d 1194, 1199 (5th Cir.1986) (since motion for fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2202 is collateral to action for declaratory judgment, it is not subject to tenday filing period of R. 59(e)); <em>Hooper v. FDIC, </em>785 F.2d 1228, 1232 (5th Cir.1986) (since contractual attorney\u2019s fees are integral to merits under Texas law, appeal was premature while motion for fees was still pending in district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Interestingly, the court in both <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Alcorn County </em>assumed in dicta that the result would be different if fees were sought, as here, under \u00a7 1988. <em>See Alcorn County, </em>731 F.2d at 1165; <em>Holmes, </em>682 F.2d at 1147 n. 7. The source of this assumption can be found in <em>White v. New Hampshire, </em>455 U.S. 445, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). In <em>White, </em>the Supreme Court held that a post-judgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 was not subject to the time limitations of Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court reasoned that Rule 59(e) was designed only to permit reconsideration of matters going to the merits, whereas \u201ca request for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action.\u201d 445 U.S. at 451,102 S.Ct. at 1166. The Court further observed that \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees \u201care not compensation for the injury giving rise to an action. Their award is uniquely separable from the cause of action to be proved at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452,102 S.Ct. at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Although <em>White </em>did not directly involve a question of appealability, the Court found \u201cimplicit support\u201d for its decision in the holdings of various courts of appeals that judgments on the merits may be final and appealable prior to a ruling on fees. <em>Id. </em>at 452 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. at 1167 n. 14. In turn, this and other circuits have read <em>White </em>to establish a rule that \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees questions are collateral to the merits for purposes of determining finality. <em>See generally </em>15 Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3915 (Supp. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">At this point it might appear that our jurisdiction over the present case is established. Plainly, the order <em>denying </em>fees against the United States presents no obstacle since it leaves nothing further for the district court to decide. What is problematic is the order granting fees without determining the amount, and on that question <em>White </em>and the <em>Holmes </em>line of cases speak with persuasive, if not controlling, authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">This case is distinguishable from its predecessors in one crucial particular, however: the merits, all parties concede, have been fully settled. The plaintiffs have received full payment of their compensatory damages and have waived their right to collect punitive damages. Thus, unlike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>cases previously discussed, this appeal involves nothing more than fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">When the merits of a case have been resolved and the only questions left for appeal pertain to fees, the <em>Holmes </em>test, by its own terms, is inapplicable. <em>See Holmes, </em>682 F.2d at 1146 (when fees are collateral, \u201ca lack of determination as to the amount does not preclude the issuance of a final, appealable judgment <em>on the merits.\u201d) </em>(Emphasis added). In a case such as this, there is no justification for allowing an appeal to proceed prior to the determination of the amount of fees. To do so would be tantamount to permitting an appeal on liability before calculating damages, a course that is prohibited in the vast majority of cases. <em>See Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 744, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1206, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The defendants maintain that the interests of efficiency support our jurisdiction because a ruling in their favor would obviate the necessity for further proceedings below. This argument, if accepted, would virtually abolish the limitations on appellate jurisdiction. It is true of a wide variety of district court orders that a prompt reversal would result in the termination of the case, but this does not alter their interlocutory character. On balance, and taking into account the effect of our decision on future cases, we think the interests of efficiency and wise judicial administration weigh in favor of remanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">It has also been suggested that we have \u201cpendent appellate jurisdiction\u201d over the defendant\u2019s appeal since the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, challenging the denial of fees against the United States, is properly before us. But the argument assumes too much. Under Federal Rule 54(b), the cross-appeal is <em>not </em>properly before us because the order denying fees, while final as to that particular issue, does not terminate the litigation. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Other matters \u2014 specifically, the amount of fees to be assessed against Handy and Wharton \u2014 remain unresolved. The doctrine of \u201cpendent appellate jurisdiction\u201d plainly does not apply when there is not even one issue that is properly before the court. 16 Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3937 (1977 &amp; Supp.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">We agree with our sister circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Fort v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>746 F.2d 744 (11th Cir.1984). <em>Fort </em>was an employment discrimination case in which the district court, finding the plaintiff\u2019s claim groundless, ruled for the defendants and awarded them attorney\u2019s fees. Before the amount of fees was determined, the plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the plaintiff did not challenge the district court\u2019s decision on the merits but only its determination that he was liable for attorney\u2019s fees. Distinguishing <em>McQurter v. City of Atlanta, </em>724 F.2d 881, 882 (11th Cir.1984), the case in which the Eleventh Circuit adopted the <em>Holmes </em>test, the court held that it lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">As the <em>Fort </em>court observed, the rule we adopt \u2014 that an order granting fees is not reviewable independent of the merits prior to the calculation of the amount of fees \u2014 furthers the most important objectives of the final judgment rule. First, it avoids piecemeal review by consolidating two potential appeals (one on entitlement to fees and another on amount) into one. Second, it avoids appeal of issues that might otherwise be mooted if allowed to proceed to final disposition in the district court. For if the fee award is low, the defendants may decide to forego an appeal; and if it is high, the parties may have an incentive to compromise rather than appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">The considerations discussed in <em>Fort </em>are fully operative in this case and we find them controlling. We are not troubled by a further consideration raised by the plaintiffs in a letter brief submitted after oral argument. Noting that no settlement took place until after the notices of appeal were filed, they question whether jurisdiction that is properly invoked may be defeated by subsequent events such as settlement. We need not decide this question for we find that, even assuming we have <em>power </em>to decide the case, \u201corderly judicial administration\u201d counsels a remand. <em>McKnight v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>Blanchard, </em>667 F.2d 477, 481 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>Mercury Motor Express, Inc. v. Brinke, </em>475 F.2d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
