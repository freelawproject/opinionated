Doby, Jr., a South Carolina prisoner. In an earlier habeas proceeding brought by Doby <em>( Doby I), </em>we ruled that the writ should issue unless South Carolina retried him. We concluded that Doby\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process was violated during his murder trial when the judge relied on the truth of his confession in ruling on its admissibility. On remand, the South Carolina court, prior to a scheduled new trial, held a <em>de novo </em>suppression hearing on Doby\u2019s confession and, without considering its truth, determined that it was constitutionally admissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court reinstated Doby\u2019s conviction and declined to retry him. Doby then instituted this action claiming that our mandate in <em>Doby I </em>required either a complete new trial or his release. Feeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>bound by the literal language of our mandate, the district court granted the writ, but delayed its issuance pending out preliminary review. We stayed issuance of the writ and now reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In November 1981, Doby filed his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. Doby alleged that his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination had been violated, because the state trial judge had impermissibly relied upon the truth of his confession in determining that it was voluntarily made and admissible. In August 1983, the district court denied the petition. Doby appealed, and in August 1984, this court, with two of the members of the present panel then sitting, reversed the judgment of the district court and held that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the apparent truth of the confession had violated the principles of <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961). It was clear to us that in admitting Doby\u2019s confession the trial judge had relied on his belief that Doby\u2019s confession was true.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>We remanded the matter to the district court with instructions that \u201cthe writ of habeas corpus be issued, first allowing South Carolina a reasonable time in which to commence a new trial on the charges, should it so choose.\u201d <em>Doby v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, </em>741 F.2d 76, 79 (4th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1107, 105 S.Ct. 2343, 85 L.Ed.2d 858 (1985). On remand, the district court ordered \u201cthat the state of South Carolina be granted seventy (70) days from May 13, 1985, either to retry or to release the prisoner from custody.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s second trial was then scheduled for August 12, 1985, in the South Carolina Court of General Sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">On August 9, 1985, prior to the scheduled trial, the South Carolina court addressed Doby\u2019s motion to suppress the same confession that had been admitted at the first trial. The state court considered the circumstances surrounding the taking of the confession, and, without considering the truth of the confession, found that the confession was given voluntarily and therefore was admissible. As a result of the hearing, the court reinstated Doby\u2019s sentence and did not proceed with the scheduled trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">On August 14, 1985, Doby filed a second petition for habeas corpus. He did not challenge the state trial court\u2019s determination that his confession was voluntary. Instead, he argued that because South Carolina had failed to retry him within a reasonable time, the district court should comply with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s mandate to release him. The district court, appreciative of the limitations on the scope of its powers in construing mandates, concluded that it was required to issue the writ of habeas corpus. However, the district court delayed the issuance of the writ for thirty days, until January 29, 1986, to allow the state time to appeal. The South Carolina Department of Corrections in its appeal argues that it effectively complied with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s mandate by holding a hearing to determine the voluntariness of Doby\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">It is axiomatic that the Fifth Amendment forbids the use in a criminal trial of any involuntary confession made by the defendant. <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. at 540-41, 81 S.Ct. at 739-40. A determination of voluntariness is inadequate if the trial judge considers the truth or reliability of the confession in deciding whether or not it was freely made. <em>Id. </em>at 543-44, 81 S.Ct. at 740-41. Where a state has failed to provide an adequate determination of voluntariness, a defendant\u2019s conviction cannot stand without further proceedings to resolve the voluntariness issue. <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 391-92, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 1788-89, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). Those proceedings should take place in the state courts, though, and not in the federal habeas corpus court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the state must institute further proceedings in these circumstances, such proceedings need not include a complete new trial. After an evidentiary hearing, the state trial court may, as here, determine that the confession was given voluntarily and is admissible in evidence. In that event, there is no constitutional necessity for a new trial, because the defendant has already been tried and convicted by a jury with the confession placed before it. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 84 S.Ct. at 1790; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>736 F.2d 981, 983 (4th Cir.1984); <em>see also Boles v. Stevenson, </em>379 U.S. 43, 85 S.Ct. 174, 13 L.Ed.2d 109 (1964) (modifying the Fourth Circuit\u2019s judgment to require only an evidentiary hearing rather than a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>new trial). A state defendant who has been afforded such a post-trial voluntariness determination generally is not entitled to further relief in the federal courts. <em>Swenson v. Stidham, </em>409 U.S. 224, 229-30, 93 S.Ct. 359, 362-63, 34 L.Ed.2d 431 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">We held in <em>Doby I </em>that it was clear from language used by the trial judge that he had considered the truth of Doby\u2019s confession \u2014 a consideration prohibited by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961). We instructed the district court to issue the writ of habeas corpus \u201cfirst allowing South Carolina a reasonable time in which to commence a new trial on the charges, should it so choose.\u201d After the district court ordered the state to retry or release Doby within a specific period, the state court scheduled the trial within that period \u2014 namely, for August 12, 1985. Prior to trial, however, Doby again moved that his confession be suppressed and the trial court again conducted a hearing after which it determined properly that the confession had been given voluntarily. The trial court interpreted <em>Jackson v. Den-no </em>as generally not requiring a new trial under those circumstances and reinstated Doby\u2019s sentence without conducting a new trial. We agree with this interpretation of <em>Jackson v. Denno. </em>Under the discrete circumstances of this case, the state court\u2019s suppression hearing prior to the scheduled second trial effectively complied with our mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The judgment of the district court is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-12\">. The petitioner does not contest the state court\u2019s conclusion in the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\">. Our panel opinion deciding the first appeal related the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">During the psychiatrists\u2019 testimony, the trial judge posed questions that strongly suggest he was concerned with whether Appellant had been truthful in giving his confession. For example, Judge Gentry asked Dr. Camp: \"When he [Appellant] said that he did commit the crime, is it possible that he was telling the truth?\u201d Joint Appendix at 136. Again, the trial judge asked Dr. Camp: \"Is it reasonable to assume that he [Appellant] was there and did it?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">Following this psychiatric testimony, the defense counsel argued to the trial court that it should consider this evidence on the issue of the voluntariness of Appellant\u2019s waiver of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. At this time the trial court and defense counsel engaged in the following dialogue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-8\">[Defense Counsel \u2014 Mr. Allen]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-9\">I feel like that the Court should consider the most relevant things we\u2019ve brought out, not only Floyd's testimony both direct and cross, not so much what the questions were, but what the Court saw, and how he responded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-10\">And also the doctors' background information on him, his performance level in school, his IQ, his psychological diagnosis, and all these things just go to the fact that he could not have intelligently waived his Miranda rights. That\u2019s really the only issue we\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-11\">THE COURT: How about the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-12\">MR. ALLEN: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-13\">THE COURT: How about the truth? Truth. MR. ALLEN: I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-14\">THE COURT: How about the truth? you say we\u2019re not concerned with anything except his understanding of his Miranda rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-15\">MR. ALLEN: In this hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-16\">THE COURT: Oh, yeah, yeah. Do you have any law on the middle ground between truth and legal right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-17\">MR. ALLEN: No sir, I mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-18\">THE COURT: Is there any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-20\">MR. ALLEN: Explain your question, please, I don\u2019t understand it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-21\">THE COURT: Do you have any law on the middle ground between truth and legal right? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen any, have you? MR. ALLEN: No sir, I haven\u2019t. I'm not sure exactly what the Court\u2019s asking, but I do have the law on the fact\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-22\">THE COURT: That\u2019s the dilemma that I'm in. MR. ALLEN: Well, sir, it seems certainly arguable\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-23\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a real dilemma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-24\">MR. ALLEN: \u2014and goes to the totality of the circumstances, and these officers, being officers of the Court as you and I are, should have provided that man, after they saw; and they can\u2019t deny that they saw the type of person Fooyd [sic] is, that is readily apparent, I don\u2019t think any one would deny that; even after seeing that they did not afford him counsel, because Floyd didn\u2019t know to ask for it, because he didn\u2019t understand it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-25\">Joint Appendix at 173-174.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-26\">The day after the <em>in camera </em>hearing, the trial court allowed Appellant's confession to be admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-27\">After the jury had returned its verdict, Judge Gentry addressed the jurors in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-28\">[Trial Court]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-29\">I can announce in the present [sic] of this jury now, however, that during the in-camera hearing on the admissibility of the alleged confession, after hearing the psychiatrists and after hearing the officers, and the manner in which the statement was taken, as I instructed the jury following that some two-three hour hearing Tuesday night \u2014 or was it Monday night. I\u2019ve forgotten \u2014 whatever, I concluded as a matter of law that the jury was entitled to consider that. After hearing the confession I became convinced in my own mind that some of the contents of that document could have been known only to the killer of Sally Ann Hutchinson. I won\u2019t go into enumerating them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Doby v.
