Because this question involved Georgia insurance law, we certified it for resolution by the Georgia Supreme Court, which answered it in the negative, 347 S.E.2d 565. We agree with the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s determination, and thus reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-24\">The relevant facts were set forth in our certification.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Bobby Lawson, an epileptic, claimed that he was injured on November 12, 1982, when he suffered an epileptic seizure, fell down in the middle of North Peachtree Road, in Atlanta, and was struck by an automobile driven by Susan McCahan, the daughter of a State Farm insured. Although some question exists as to whether McCahan\u2019s vehicle actually struck Lawson, State Farm decided to verify for payment the reasonable medical expenses associated with Lawson\u2019s injuries. It is undisputed that State Farm paid all claims for personal injury protection benefits submitted by Lawson at least seven months prior to his filing suit. Nevertheless, Lawson brought this action against State Farm for statutory penalties, punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to OCGA \u00a7 33-34-6(b) and (c) for State Farm\u2019s failure to pay his claims within the time period required by the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">State Farm moved for summary judgment contending that the statute did not create an action solely to recover benefits and that the payment of all of Lawson\u2019s claims for benefits before the initiation of his lawsuit extinguished any cause of action which he might have had for penalties and attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>Lawson v. State Farm, </em>784 F.2d 350, 351 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The district court agreed with State Farm, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">The operative words of subsection (b) which create a cause of action are those which state that \u2018the person entitled to the benefits may bring an action to recover them.\u2019 However, if the benefits have already been recovered, as is the case here, the statute clearly provides no cause of action. Likewise, subsection (c), which deals with the recovery of punitive damages, also grants a cause of action \u2018to recover the benefits\u2019 and Lawson in this case clearly has no cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Upon certification, however, the Georgia Supreme Court arrived at a different conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">We answer the certified question in the negative. OCGA \u00a7 33-34-6(b) provides that benefits required to be paid without regard to fault become overdue when not paid within thirty days after the insurer receives reasonable proof of loss. This subsection states that \u2018[i]n the event the insurer fails to pay each benefit when due, the person entitled to the benefits may bring an action to recover them and the insurer must show that its failure or refusal to pay was in good faith, otherwise the insurer shall be liable for a penalty not exceeding 25 percent of the amount due and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u2019 OCGA \u00a7 33-34-6(c) provides in addition to the penalties of subsection (b), \u2018in the event that an insurer fails or refuses to pay a person the benefit which the person is entitled to under this chapter within 60 days after proper proof of loss has been filed, the person may bring an action to recover the benefits; and, if the insurer fails to prove that its failure or refusal to pay the benefits was in good faith, the insurer shall be subject to punitive damages.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">The apparent purpose of the legislature in enacting the 30/60 day requirements of OCGA \u00a7 33-34-6 was to assure prompt payment of claims by imposing penalties and damages on insurers failing to meet the deadlines. If an insurer could avoid these penalties and damages by making payment after the deadline, there will be no incentive in the statute to meet the deadline. The issue of the insurer\u2019s good faith is to be determined by the events and circumstances during the 30/60 day time period. Payment thereafter to a claimant\u2019s medical suppliers, as in this case, should not prevent a suit by the claimant for the penalties and damages. To interpret the statute otherwise would make it possible for unscrupulous insurers to ignore the due date of the statute with impunity so long as payment to suppliers is made sometime before suit for benefits is brought. As we understand the statute, the words, \u2018failure or refusal to pay\u2019 refers to payment \u2018when due,\u2019 and do not authorize a late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>payment. It is not simply the total failure to pay, but the failure to make <em>timely </em>payment which gives rise to penalties and damages. In our view the conjunctive expressions relating the suit to recover benefits to the recovery of penalties and damages should not be construed so as to defeat the purpose of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">Whether the acceptance of late payment by the claimant himself should es-top him from bringing a suit for penalties and damages is a different issue, and not before us in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We hold that an action to recover benefits is not a prerequisite to maintaining an action for penalties or punitive damages under OCGA \u00a7 33-34-6. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
