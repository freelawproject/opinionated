A-l filed a disclosure statement and a plan of reorganization along with its petition, but the bankruptcy court approved neither. A-l then filed two more disclosure statements and plans of reorganization, but these also did not receive approval. It then developed that A-l had not disclosed that its sole shareholder had filed for a Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>13 bankruptcy even though the shareholder\u2019s case had many debts and debtors in common with the A-l bankruptcy. Apparently believing that these failures evidenced the bad faith of A-l, the United States trustee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in May of 1985, moved before the bankruptcy court for either the dismissal of A-l\u2019s Chapter 11 proceedings or the conversion of its Chapter 11 proceedings into Chapter 7 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Opposing this motion, A-l argued that the United States trustee was not a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and could not move for conversion or dismissal of the Chapter 11 proceedings. The bankruptcy court rejected that argument after a hearing, however, and later granted the trustee\u2019s motion by dismissing A-1\u2019s petition. <em>Cf. In re Stapleton, </em>55 B.R. 716 (D.Ga.1985). A-1 then sought relief from the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, but the district court agreed that the trustee had standing to move for a dismissal and that dismissal was proper, 57 BR 380. A-1 then appealed to this court and presented the same argument that the trustee did not have standing to move for conversion or dismissal of the Chapter 11 proceedings. As a result, we face the narrow question of whether, under the facts of this case, the United States trustee was a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1112(b) when he moved for a dismissal or conversion of the Chapter 11 proceedings. Convinced that he was a party in interest, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The legislative history of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 indicates that Congress expected for United States trustees to oversee administration of bankruptcy cases and act as \u201cwatchdogs ... preventpng] fraud, dishonesty, and overreaching in the bankruptcy arena.\u201d H.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 88, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5787, 5963, 6049. The previous bankruptcy system had relied on creditors to play a large part in administering bankruptcies through selecting a trustee and overseeing his collection of assets, but by 1978 Congress recognized that many creditors simply \u201cwrote off\u201d debts to bankrupts and ignored bankruptcy proceedings rather than incur legal fees. <em>Id. </em>at 88-99, U.S. Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad. News at 6049-61. As a result, circumstances frequently forced bankruptcy judges into the role of administering bankruptcies, and this often included actually overseeing the identification, collection, and liquidation of assets. <em>Id. </em>at 89-91, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6051-52. Of course, this administrative role was inconsistent with the judge's role as an impartial arbiter of disputes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 89-91, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6051-52. As a consequence, Congress created the office of United States trustee to \u201cfill the vacuum of lack of creditor participation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 100, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6061, and to create an \u201cenforcer[ ] of the bankruptcy laws [who would bring] proceedings in the bankruptcy courts in particular cases in which a particular action taken or proposed to be taken deviate[d] from the standards established by the ... bankruptcy code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6070. Accordingly, when Congress created the office of United States trustee, it expected the trustees to actively oversee the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>administration of bankruptcy cases and to intervene whenever particular actions threatened an abuse of the bankruptcy system or its procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Unfortunately, when Congress enacted \u00a7 1112(b), it did not make it clear that a United States trustee was a \u201cparty in interest\u201d with the ability to perform his duty by moving for a conversion or dismissal of Chapter 11 proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bankruptcy Rule X-1009, however, provides that \u201c[t]he United States trustee may raise and appear and be heard on any issue relating to his responsibilities in a case under the Code.\u201d The Advisory Committee Note following Rule X-1009, moreover, states that the United States trustee \u201cshould have the opportunity to move to convert or dismiss a chapter 11 case if the operation of the business or management of the property precludes effective administration of the case.\u201d The note limits this language somewhat by going on to say that Rule X-1009 does not expand the trustee\u2019s authority to act under \u00a7 1112(b), but by recognizing that the trustee can move under \u00a7 1112(b) when the debtor\u2019s failures interfere with administration of the case, the Advisory Committee Note implicitly accepts the notion that the United States trustee has standing to move for a dismissal or conversion under \u00a7 1112(b) whenever that would advance the trustee\u2019s interest in successful administration of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Similarly, the only courts to consider this issue have concluded that the trustee can move under \u00a7 1112(b) whenever such a motion would advance administration of the case. Relying on this rationale, the court in <em>In re Commercial Finance Corp. of Nevada, </em>16 B.R. 98, 101 (Bankr.D.D.C. 1981), ruled that a United States trustee had standing \u201cto file a motion to convert a Chapter 11 to a Chapter 7 when there [were] allegations made that the debtor [had] an inability to pay the administrative costs associated with a Chapter 11.\u201d Relatedly, although making the statement only as dicta, the court in <em>In re Gusam Restaurant Corp., </em>32 B.R. 832, 834 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>737 F.2d 274 (2d Cir.1984), stated that the \u201cUnited States Trustee [is] a recognized party-in-interest for the purposes of \u00a7 1112(b),\u201d and the Second Circuit in <em>In re Tiana Queen Motel Inc., </em>749 F.2d 146, 150 (2d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 2681, 86 L.Ed.2d 699 (1985) observed that \u201c[t]here is support for the proposition that the United States Trustee should be considered a \u2018party in interest\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1112(b).\u201d In fact, in its opinion in <em>In re Gusam Restaurant, </em>737 F.2d 274, 276-77 (2d Cir.1984), the Second Circuit convincingly demonstrated that Congress actually inserted the \u201cparty in interest\u201d language into \u00a7 1112(b) to avoid the problem of courts acting <em>sua sponte </em>to dismiss or convert Chapter 11 proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">As a consequence, under these authorities, it appears that a United States trustee can move for conversion or dismissal under \u00a7 1112(b), at least where the motion advances the trustee\u2019s interest in administration of the bankruptcy proceedings. In this case, a year after filing for bankruptcy, A-l still had not achieved approval of either a disclosure statement or a plan of reorganization despite three attempts at each. A-l, moreover, had also failed to disclose that its sole shareholder had filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>for bankruptcy even though the shareholder\u2019s case would be closely related to the A-1 reorganization. Faced with these facts, the trustee apparently concluded, and the bankruptcy court agreed, that A-l was abusing the bankruptcy process and acting in bad faith for its own benefit. The trustee responded by seeking a conversion of the case to Chapter 7, which would provide greater control over the property of the debtor, or alternatively, a dismissal of the case, which would end A-l\u2019s abuse and remove from it the protections of the Bankruptcy Code. Consequently, the trustee brought his motion to fulfill his responsibility to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy process and to facilitate administration of A-l\u2019s case. In such a situation, the trustee was certainly performing his duty of oversight as Congress directed, and as a result, was a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1112(b). In fact, even Collier on Bankruptcy, the leading bankruptcy treatise, agrees that in the case at hand the trustee could properly bring a \u00a7 1112(b) motion. After observing that the question of whether a trustee can bring this type of motion is unclear, Collier goes on to say that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-4\">Whether the United States trustee has standing should be determined by reference to the grounds upon which the application is made. Since the United States trustee has supervisory power in a chapter 11 case, a motion based on the debtor\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of the Code would be proper. An example of a case where the United States trustee would have standing would be where the motion to convert or dismiss was based upon the debtor\u2019s failure to prosecute the case to the detriment of the creditors. 5 Collier on Bankruptcy, 111112.03 at 1112-12 (15th Ed. 1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Of course, this view is consonant with the authorities discussed before, and Collier chose to illustrate the point with an example which encompasses the basic facts of our case. As a consequence, in a case such as this, where the trustee has moved to further administration of the case and to prevent an abuse of the bankruptcy process, the authorities agree that the trustee is a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1112(b). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AZp\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">.

The House report noted, as an example of the inconsistency of the roles, that in his administrative function a bankruptcy judge might suggest that the trustee pursue a cause of action on behalf of the estate and then in his judicial function sit as the judge on that cause of action.
