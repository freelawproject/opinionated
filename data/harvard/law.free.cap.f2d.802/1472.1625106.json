The principal issue before us concerns the propriety of the FBI\u2019s treatment of the FOIA request submitted by appellant, Sonia Dettmann, as it related to documents concerning investigations of events, organizations, or individuals other than Dettmann but which contained Dettmann\u2019s name. These sorts of records are designated as \u201csee\u201d references by the FBI and constitute a recurring question in the administration of FOIA as it pertains to the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-19\">In January 1977, Dettmann, through counsel, submitted a FOIA request to the FBI for \u201ccopies of all documents ... which contain my name or make reference to me or any activities I have allegedly engaged in____\u201d Complaint, Exhibit 1, Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 9. The Bureau released a number of documents, but withheld others, thereby prompting an administrative appeal by Dettmann in September 1977. That appeal led to another round of disclosures in March 1978. Importantly for the issue before us, the FBI\u2019s response to Dettmann in March 1978 specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1555-21\">Also enclosed are additional documents which you will note relate to our investigation of other events, organizations or individuals. These references are referred to as \u201csee\u201d references. Inasmuch as your client\u2019s name was mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>each of those documents, <em>only those portions containing a reference to her have been processed for release to you along with additional material to indicate the context in which her name was recorded.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1556-4\">Declaration of David H. Cook, Exhibit 2 (Letter from Allen H. McCreight, Chief, FOIA-Privacy Act Branch to Sonia Dettman (Mar. 1, 1978) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-5\">This response, setting forth the FBI\u2019s general practice with respect to \u201csee\u201d references, prompted a reply from Dettmann\u2019s counsel contesting various aspects of the FBI\u2019s action but raising no objection to the Bureau\u2019s treatment of the \u201csee\u201d reference material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Several months later, in October 1978, Dettmann wrote to the Director of the FBI clarifying her original request so as to encompass records located in any FBI Field Office. This letter specifically referred to the Bureau\u2019s \u201csee\u201d reference system, requesting that a Field Office search be made of records under Dettmann\u2019s name \u201cor any other descriptive caption under which records in the Central Records System have been located under any \u2018see reference\u2019 system.\u201d The letter further requested \u201cthat the records of any other Field Office which is the Office of Origin of any \u2018see referenced\u2019 records located in the FBI Headquarters Central Records System be searched.\u201d Complaint, Exhibit 2, J.A. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-6\">This pattern of FBI response and requester dissatisfaction continued into the following year. In February 1979, Dettmann complained in writing to the Bureau about treatment of her request for documents from the various Field Offices. She also appealed certain deletions from the Electronic Surveillance Records Systems which had previously been released. Not a word was said, however, in protest against the FBI\u2019s practice with respect to \u201csee\u201d reference materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-9\">This lawsuit was filed in April 1982. The two-page complaint chronicled the several requests to and communications with the Bureau and averred in general terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxC\">Although the FBI has released some documents to plaintiff, it continues to wrongfully withhold records, or portions thereof, which should be made available to her under the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIN\">Complaint H 9, J.A. at 7. The Bureau answered the complaint and thereafter moved for partial summary judgment as to the FBI Headquarters main file indexed to Dettmann and to those \u201csee\u201d references to her contained in the FBI Headquarters \u201cGILROB\u201d file (pertaining to a bank robbery investigation, <em>see supra </em>note 1). This motion was followed in due course by a full-blown motion for summary judgment, supported by various declarations, as to all other FBI Headquarters \u201csee\u201d references and certain FBI Field Office files indexed to Dettmann. These motions elicited not only Dettmann\u2019s opposition but a request for discovery, which in turn prompted a supplemental declaration from one of the FBI officials. Further submissions were filed by the Government in early 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-10\">Based on these various filings, the District Court granted summary judgment. The court concluded that all segregable, non-exempt portions of the main files had in fact been released. As to the principal bone of contention before us, the \u201csee\u201d reference materials, the District Court held that the Bureau had released \u201cthe appropriate segments relating to the specific FOIA requests in that they have released the pages containing [Dettmann\u2019s] name and their context.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 6. Citing three District Court decisions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>trial court concluded that it would not require the Bureau to release \u201can entire document where plaintiffs name is only mentioned a few times\u201d since the effect \u201cwould be to impose on the government a burdensome and time consuming task.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. The court specifically observed in this respect that the Government\u2019s uncontradicted affidavits \u201csufficiently demonstrated that the portions of the \u2018see\u2019 reference of the documents withheld cover different subjects, refer to people unrelated to plaintiff and her activities, or, if related to plaintiff and thus within the scope of the request, fall within one of the nine FOIA exemptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <em>7.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1557-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-6\">On appeal, Dettmann contends primarily that the District Court improperly sanctioned the Government\u2019s handling of the \u201csee\u201d reference files. Since we find Dettmann\u2019s other contentions to have been correctly analyzed and addressed by the District Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we confine ourselves to this point which Dettmann aptly describes as \u201c[t]he crux of the dispute between the parties.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-7\">We begin by acknowledging the force of Dettmann\u2019s primary argument. Her original FOIA request, carefully crafted by counsel, expressly asked for \u201call <em>documents ... </em>which contain my name or make any reference to me or any activities I have allegedly engaged in.\u201d Complaint, Exhibit 1, J.A. at 9 (emphasis added). Relying upon this broad language, Dettmann maintains that the FBI was duty bound to disclose the entire documents) in the \u201csee\u201d reference files in which Dettmann\u2019s name (or a reference to her activities) was found. Dettmann attacks the contrary federal district court decisions, <em>see supra </em>note 2, upholding the FBI\u2019s practice in this respect as ill-considered and unreasoned. All she was bound to do, she contends, was to reasonably describe the records sought; here there is no contention, nor could there reasonably be, \u201cthat Dettmann failed adequately to describe the records she requested.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 3. There is thus no quibble about her use of plain English; the dispute represents, rather, as Dettmann well describes it, the clash of a broadly worded request with the FBI\u2019s \u201cgeneral practice\u201d in processing \u201csee\u201d reference materials. <em>Id. </em>(citing Third Supplemental Declaration of Walter Scheuplein, Jr., 1f 6, J.A. at 183-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-10\">Faced with this assault, the Government contends that the Bureau was correct in treating entire documents found in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>\u201csee\u201d reference files as outside the scope of the request. Invoking Dettmann\u2019s post-request communications which describe her request as one for \u201cFBI records \u2018relating to\u2019 herself,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 8, the Government contends that \u201c[a] plain, common sense reading of appellant\u2019s requests ... indicates that she was interested in only those records that pertained to herself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But the Government arrives at this favorable interpretation only by downplaying the wording of the original request \u2014 which as we have seen was broadly crafted in lawyerlike fashion \u2014 and emphasizing the subsequent communications that, arguably, narrowed the original dragnet language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-4\">We decline to embrace the Government\u2019s parsimonious reading of Dettmann\u2019s request. But we also decline to, in effect, overturn an established, general practice of the FBI in coping with the increasing demands of FOIA requests when that practice was specifically brought to appellant\u2019s attention in writing and has since been judicially sanctioned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under these particular circumstances, we are persuaded that Dettmann\u2019s appeal must be rejected for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies. As we have previously related, appellant, through counsel, remonstrated with the FBI for various omissions and deletions, but not a word was said about the \u201csee\u201d reference methodology. Indeed, in the face of the Bureau\u2019s clear statement of its approach, Dettmann requested only the materials in the GILROB file, documents concerning her relationship with the late Stanley Bond, and semi-weekly FBI reports on her activities. <em>See supra </em>note l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In crafting this demand, Dettmann\u2019s counsel expressly mentioned the \u201csee\u201d reference system twice in the course of a three-paragraph letter, but interposed no general objection to the Bureau\u2019s processing of her request pursuant to that system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-10\">We decline under these circumstances to countenance a failure at the administrative level to take issue with a sensible, general practice developed by the Bureau and clearly articulated to the FOIA requester. Dettmann is particularly ill-situated to complain, for she was assisted by counsel in these proceedings and counsel, as evidenced by the express references to the FBI\u2019s procedures, knew full well what the FBI had done.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dettmann specifically pleaded exhaustion of administrative remedies in her complaint, Complaint II 8, J.A. at 7, and that averment was denied. Answer II 9, J.A. at 17.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-11\">It goes without saying that exhaustion of remedies is required in FOIA cases. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>this court has recently had occasion to state in the clearest of language, \u201c[e]xhaustion of such [administrative] remedies is required under the Freedom of Information Act before a party can seek judicial review.\u201d <em>Stebbins v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., </em>757 F.2d 364 (D.C. Cir.1984); <em>see also Crooker v. United States Secret Service, </em>577 F.Supp. 1218, 1219 (D.D.C.1983). It is likewise clear that a plaintiff may have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to one aspect of a FOIA request \u2014 and thus properly seek judicial review regarding that request \u2014 and yet not have exhausted her remedies with respect to another aspect of a FOIA request. <em>See, e.g., Durns v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>605 F.Supp. 1213, 1214 n. 1 (D.D.C. 1985). That, in our view, is precisely what occurred here. In the course of the years of communications back and forth between requester and agency, Dettmann made no attempt to present for administrative review any objections she may have had to the FBI\u2019s handling of \u201csee\u201d reference documents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If exhaustion of remedies is to have meaning, it surely must bar review of the claim advanced here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1556-7\">. Dettmann's counsel\u2019s letter, dated April 4,1978, objected to non-disclosure of certain documents relating to a bank robbery and filed under the code name \u201cGILROB\u201d; documents concerning the late Stanley Bond, a Massachusetts prison inmate who had been \u201cclose to\u201d Dettmann; and semiweekly reports on Dettman furnished to FBI Headquarters.

C.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1557-8\">. Regarding Dettmann\u2019s request for discovery, the District Court concluded that the requisite tests for satisfying Exemption 7 had been met by the FBI. The court expressly observed that, \"while deference is given to a law enforcement agency, the agency must show that a nexus exists between the investigated activities and federal laws, and that the investigation is based on a colorable claim.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 9. That nexus was demonstrated, the court concluded, by detailed declarations that the investigations stemmed from concern that Dettmann\u2019s activities violated a host of federal statutes, ranging from rebellion or insurrection to espionage. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. Plaintiff was also associated, the court observed, with underground organizations and had entered a guilty plea for unlawful possession of explosives, weapons, and stolen property. This combination of possible illegal activities, association with certain organizations, and her own admission of criminal conduct \"provided the FBI with a nexus and colorable claim for the investigations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 (citing <em>King v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>586 F.Supp. 286 (D.D.C.1983)). These declarations also demon-strafed that the investigations were supported by \u201clegitimate motives, rationale and purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Discovery under these circumstances, the court concluded, would not lie: \"Discovery should not be employed where there is only a slim hope of finding impropriety.\" <em>Id. </em>at 12 (citing <em>Military Audit Project v. Casey, </em>656 F.2d 724, 751-52 (D.C.Cir.1981)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1557-12\">. We therefore uphold the District Court\u2019s disposition of the discovery issue and the exemption claims for the reasons well stated in that court's comprehensive Memorandum Opinion. As for Dettmann\u2019s remaining point, we are satisfied that the Bureau acted properly in deleting the names and identifying data concerning individuals whose names appeared in the FBI\u2019s investigatory files. The District Court correctly ruled as adequate the FBI\u2019s explanation of its rationale in not disclosing the various categories of Exemption 7 material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-13\">We also observe that we have examined the records with care and have found no indication whatever of commingling non-exempt records with exempt records in these investigative files.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1558-5\">. <em>See supra </em>note 2 (citing cases); <em>see also Irons v. Levi, </em>451 F.Supp. 751, 753 (D.Mass.1978); <em>rev\u2019d. on other grounds sub nom. Irons v. Bell, </em>596 F.2d 468 (1st Cir.1979). No authority has been cited to us, nor have we found any, disapproving this practical approach to handling FOIA requests. Indeed, the FBI\u2019s general practice of processing \"see\" references in the manner employed in this case is supported by common sense \u2014 it avoids routine, potentially wasteful disclosure of enormous amounts of material that bear no relationship whatsoever to the focus of a FOIA request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1558-6\">. Indeed; Dettmann's experience with the GIL-ROB file demonstrates the wisdom of requiring exhaustion. In its initial provision of materials to Dettmann, the FBI included only those parts of the GILROB file pertaining to her. After Dettmann complained that the Bureau had made available only \"a dozen or so pages of reports\u201d from the file, Declaration of David H. Cook, Exhibit J, the FBI offered her access to the entire GILROB file if she would bear the cost of , searching and duplicating. Declaration of David H. Cook, Exhibit K. Dettmann declined to take advantage of this opportunity, and the District Court properly concluded that the issue of these GILROB file \"see\" references was moot. Memorandum Opinion at 5 n. 1. This indicates, contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion that contesting the \"see\u201d reference policy would have been futile, Dissent at 1478, that if Dettmann had simply asked the FBI for the entire documents containing \u201csee\u201d references to her, the Bureau would have made the documents available. Thus, had her current objections to the \"see\" reference system been presented during the administrative process, this portion of the dispute may never have reached the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1558-13\">. We observe that Dettmann\u2019s able counsel in this litigation was not representing her in the administrative proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1558-14\">. Although the \"see\u201d reference issue was fully litigated in the District Court, we are not precluded from deciding the case on appeal on grounds of non-exhaustion. To the contrary, non-exhaustion may be raised <em>sua sponte </em>by a reviewing court, <em>see Weinberger </em>v. <em>Salfi, </em>422 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>U.S. 749, 786, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2477, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975) (Brennan, J., dissenting), even when it has no bearing on jurisdiction, <em>see Power Plant Division v. OSHRC, </em>673 F.2d 111, 112 (5th Cir.1982). We recognize that such a course means the parties did not consider exhaustion, and we are thus without the benefit of their briefs on this issue. But we find nothing novel in our decision today. Exhaustion has long been required in FOIA cases. In addition, we are convinced that the policies underlying the exhaustion requirement would be served by applying the principle here. In particular, it would be both contrary to \"orderly procedure and good administration\u201d and unfair \"to those who are engaged in the tasks of administration\u201d to decide an issue which the FBI never had a fair opportunity to resolve prior to being ushered into litigation. <em>United States v. Tucker Truck Lines, </em>344 U.S. 33, 36-37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 68-69, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1559-13\">. The dissent characterizes our ruling as imposing a \"second appeal\u201d requirement. Dissent at 1478. Not so. All we require is that Dettmann first utilize the administrative process to present her objections. This well-established exhaustion principle applies with particular force by virtue of the facts of this case. As we have noted, <em>see supra </em>Part I, Dettman's FOIA request went through several rounds of request, disclosure, complaint, and disclosure. During this process, the \"see\u201d reference policy was specifically called to her attention. She filed at least two administrative appeals, <em>see </em>Declaration of David H. Cook, Exhibits F &amp; O, one of which involved, in part, a \"see\" reference document. <em>See supra </em>note 6. But Dettmann at no point took issue with the FBI\u2019s \"see\u201d reference policy. Far from requiring a second appeal, our ruling requires only that she file a first appeal, or at least interpose some objection during the administrative process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1559-6\">GESELL, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AKN\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-7\">I respectfully dissent: The majority has treated this routine FOIA case in a manner that misconceives the special nature of this type of litigation. The holding that Dettmann should have pursued administrative remedy twice frustrates the purpose of the Act and is impractical and unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-10\">FOIA is a disclosure statute. Its effectiveness often depends on prompt response. In many instances the purposes of the Act are already being thwarted by delay. To require a requester to appeal a second time if he is not satisfied with a partial success on his first appeal further encumbers the already overloaded, underfinanced FOIA staffs of many agencies. FOIA appeals presently cannot be perfected in numerous cases because of the 20-day limitation that permits suit if an appeal is not completed in that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-11\">Nothing in the Act or regulations suggests that intraagency appeals have particular significance other than to assure uniformity of agency interpretation and certainly there is nothing to suggest the double appeal approach sponsored by the majority here. There is, in any event, no FOIA <em>stare decisis. </em>Dettmann will get the documents eventually in another case brought under her name or by someone else on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-12\">There are many practical considerations that should have been weighed. The parties have been given no opportunity to brief them or advise this Court or the District Court. A few considerations will be mentioned merely to illustrate. The bulk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>requesters proceed without counsel, as did Dettmann in the later stages of her case. Many are incarcerated. They do not appear, but look to the Court to protect their interests. To add a further legalistic complexity may necessitate providing lawyers, at government expense, to protect procedural rights which the Court cannot monitor in advance. The ruling is also inexact and does not define the types of cases requiring a second appeal. Moreover, the second appeal would have been wholly futile. The \u201csee\u201d policy developed by the Department of Justice has been in effect for some time and is being followed in cases now before the courts. Numerous pending \u201csee\u201d cases will only be confused. The delaying effect of this ruling has not been measured or apparently considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-4\">The majority candidly admits that Dettmann clearly sought the full text of certain documents and after appeal got only part, without the remaining part being withheld under any claim of exemption. I would remand with direction that the remaining portions of the \u201csee\u201d documents be processed in regular course. To require Dettmann to file a new suit and start all over again to get what she seeks is a waste that places form over substance, delays relief and unnecessarily conflicts with the purposes of the statute, and is against the best interests of the agencies affected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
