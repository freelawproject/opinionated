The defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal, (2) in failing to charge as requested, and (3) in enhancing the sentence imposed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c). We find error in the court\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On May 20, 1988, at approximately 11:30 p.m., the defendant was operating a new black pickup truck northbound on Main Street in Danbury when he collided with another vehicle. The defendant, who con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>cedes that he was operating a motor vehicle at that time and that he was on a public highway, produced a license, a registration and an insurance card for the investigating officer. The address listed on those documents was 20 Grandview Avenue, Danbury. A motor vehicle department check disclosed that the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended. He was issued a summons for operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension and for improper passing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in not granting his three motions for judgment of acquittal, each claiming that the state had produced insufficient evidence. The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case, at the close of his own case, and finally when the jury returned its verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">It is the defendant\u2019s claim (1) that notice of suspension is required pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-111 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) that the state did not and could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>prove that \u201cnotice [was] forwarded by bulk certified mail,\u201d (3) that the state must prove at least constructive delivery by certified mail, and (4) that no admissible evidence was offered on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this issue. The defendant knew that a notice of suspension was due to arrive in the mail because of an earlier conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Torma, an immigrant who had lived in the United States for three years, testified that he did not know that he was obligated by law to notify the motor vehicle department of his change of address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The state introduced a copy of the suspension notice that had been forwarded to the defendant, and an alleged receipt for \u201ccertified bulk mail\u201d into evidence through Sergeant John MacSweeney, an employee of the motor vehicle department. MacSweeney, who had been employed at the motor vehicle department for over eighteen years, was familiar with the system of suspending an operator\u2019s license. He explained that, upon being notified that someone\u2019s license has been suspended, his department sends a letter to that person\u2019s last known address, two weeks prior to the date of suspension, so as to allow that individual an opportunity to request a hearing to stay the suspension. These notices are mailed in bulk, and the motor vehicle depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ment retains a list that corresponds to the notices sent. The motor vehicle department calls this process \u201cbulk certified mail.\u201d The United States Postal Service, however, does not recognize a form of mail specifically termed \u201cbulk certified mail.\u201d The department\u2019s list of notices mailed is called a receipt. It is not a postal receipt for a piece of certified mail, but it is a certificate of mailing prepared by the motor vehicle department showing that the mail was put into the United States Postal Service, and that the letters were received by the postal service. In spite of the confusion in terms, MacSweeney\u2019s testimony sufficiently established that the notice of suspension was mailed to the defendant and that it was never returned to the motor vehicle department as unclaimed mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The defendant testified that he never received a suspension notice. He explained to the court that he had moved from 20 Grandview Avenue to another address during the period in question, and had not notified the motor vehicle department of his change of address. Although Torma failed to notify the motor vehicle department of his change of address, he did notify the postal service on November 23,1987. The postal notification remained in effect until June 3, 1988. The defendant\u2019s suspension was effective as of April 30, 1988, and the operation under suspension occurred on May 20, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The defendant was charged with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which requires proof of three elements: (1) that the defendant operated a motor vehicle; (2) that it was operated upon a public highway; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>(3) that the operation occurred while his license was under suspension by the commissioner of motor vehicle. The first and second elements of the violation have been conceded by the defendant. The third element, supsension by the commissioner, requires proof of compliance with General Statutes \u00a7 14-111 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-111 (a) does not require personal service of a notice of suspension but provides that \u201ca notice forwarded by bulk certified mail to the address of the person registered as owner or operator of any motor vehicle as shown by the records of the commissioner shall be sufficient notice to such person . . . .\u201d The statute does not require that a defendant actually receive notice, or that a motor vehicle department receive a return receipt. Constructive notice by the motor vehicle department is all that is required. <em>State </em>v. <em>Verdirome, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 586, 421 A.2d 563 (1980). The requirements of \u00a7 14-111 (a) were satisfied by a showing of competent evidence that notice of the suspension was mailed to the defendant at his last known address as indicated by the records of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Regardless of the defendant\u2019s ignorance of the law, he remained obligated under General Statutes \u00a7 14-45 to notify the commissioner of his change of address. Further, the defendant knew that a suspension notice was being sent because of his earlier conviction. He should not have relied on the change of address form filed with the postal service to insure his receipt of that notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The defendant argues that the state could not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 14-111 (a) because there is no such thing as \u201cbulk certified mail.\u201d His argument is unpersuasive because, as we have previously discussed, the requirements of \u00a7 14-111 (a) are satisfied by mailing the notice of suspension to the defendant\u2019s last known address, and the department\u2019s certificate of mailing is sufficient to establish that the defendant received statutory notice of suspension.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The defendant next argues that even if \u00a7 14-111 (a) is construed to mean that notice by a certificate of bulk mailing is all the notice required, then as a matter of law the state offered no admissible evidence on that issue, We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The state offered two documents as the sole proof of mailing, namely, a copy of the suspension notice, and the certificate of mailing. These were admitted pursuant to the business records exception to the hearsay rule, General Statutes \u00a7 52-180.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The defendant argues that MacSweeney was not a competent witness particularly as to the third foundation requirement of \u00a7 52-180, and that the documents were computer generated. There are three criteria for admission of documents under the business records exception as set forth by General Statutes \u00a7 52-180: (1) the record must be made in the regular course of business; (2) it must be the regular course of business to make such a record; and (3) the record must be made at the time of the act, transaction or event, or within a reasonable time thereafter. <em>Emhart Industries, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, U.A.W., </em>190 Conn. 371, 383-84, 461 A.2d 422 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The state established all of the criteria set forth in \u00a7 52-180 through MacSweeney\u2019s testimony. It established that such notices are maintained and sent in the regular course of motor vehicle department business and are a function of that department. Further, Mac-Sweeney testified that it is the usual course of business for the white copy to go to the driver and the pink copy to be retained in the department\u2019s file. He also identified the certificate of mailing as a document that is kept in the usual course of business. This testimony was based on either MacSweeney\u2019s observations or on the observations of another who, in the course of business, transmitted the information to MacSweeney. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 663, 491 A.2d 345 (1985). Further, MacSweeney need not have had personal knowledge of the event, because circumstances such as those that surround the mailing or production of a document affect the weight rather than the admissibility of that writing. General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Since the defendant failed to raise the issue of computer generated documents regarding these two items at trial, we decline to review this claim now. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pettersen, </em>17 Conn. App. 174, 185, 551 A.2d 763 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in failing to charge in accordance with his request to charge. The defendant concedes that the court charged in substantial accordance with his request; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>199 Conn. 255, 269-70, 506 A.2d 1041 (1986); except as to the rebuttable nature of the notice required for proof of conviction. The pertinent part of the defendant\u2019s request was as follows: \u201cIf you find that the state had notified the defendant by bulk certified mail at his last listed address as is the case here, and the defendant testifies that he did not receive notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>then the state must prove by some other evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant received actual notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The defendant argues that since notice is an essential element to be proven, constructive notice creates a type of irrebuttable presumption that shifts the burden of proof as to an essential element of the crime in violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights. This argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">As we have discussed previously, actual notice is not required to convict a defendant under General Statutes \u00a7 14-215. It, therefore, was not error for the trial court to refuse to charge in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The defendant\u2019s-final claim of error alleges that the trial court erred in enhancing his sentence under General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c) in spite of the fact that the state did not charge him in a two-part information pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 619.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, he was sentenced to nine months suspended after sixty days with probation for eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The state concedes and we agree that a two-part information is required under our rules of practice whenever the state seeks an enhanced penalty. The purpose of this rule is to assure that the defendant is given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>adequate notice of the charge against him so that he may properly prepare his defense. Although a prosecution involving a two-part information requires two separate procedures, it remains a prosecution under one information. The second part of the information must be proven, however, before the enhanced penalty can be imposed. <em>State </em>v. <em>LaSelva, </em>163 Conn. 229, 233-34, 303 A.2d 721 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">There is error in part, the judgment is set aside only as to the sentence imposed and the case is remanded with direction to sentence the defendant under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> The defendant was found not guilty of improper passing, General Statutes \u00a7 14-232 (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-111 (a) provides: \u201cNo provision of this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the commissioner from suspending or revoking any registration or any operator\u2019s license issued under the provisions of any statute relating to motor vehicles, or from suspending the right of any person to operate a motor vehicle in this state, or from suspending or revoking the right of any nonresident to operate, or the right to any operation of, any motor vehicle within this state, for any cause that he deems sufficient, with or without a hearing. Whenever any certificate of registration or any operator\u2019s license or both are suspended or revoked, all evidence of the same shall be delivered forthwith to the commissioner or to any person authorized by him to receive the same, and the commissioner or any person authorized by him may seize such certificate of registration or operator\u2019s license and all evidence of the same. Except as otherwise provided by law, the commissioner may cancel any such suspension or revocation and may return such certificate of registration or the operator\u2019s license either with or without an additional fee, provided no certificate of registration or operator\u2019s license which has been suspended for any definite term, except as provided in subsection (k) of this section, shall be returned until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the term of suspension has been completed. Any appeal taken from the action of the commissioner shall not act as a stay of suspension or revocation except with his consent. No service of process shall be necessary in connection with any of the prescribed activities of the commissioner, but a notice forwarded by bulk certified mail to the address of the person registered as owner or operator of any motor vehicle as shown by the records of the commissioner shall be sufficient notice to such person that the certificate of registration or operator\u2019s license is revoked or under suspension.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-45 provides that failure to notify the commissioner by a person holding a license to operate a motor vehicle of his change of address within forty-eight hours of a change constitutes an infraction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 14-215. operation while registration or LICENSE IS REFUSED, SUSPENDED OR REVOKED, (a) No person to whom an operator\u2019s license has been refused, or whose operator\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in this state has been suspended or revoked, shall operate any motor vehicle during the period of such refusal, suspension or revocation.
