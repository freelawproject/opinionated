The motion was based upon the plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure properly to serve process as provided in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-57 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Process was served on an employee of Class Publications, Inc., an entity with offices in Hartford, who was in Poster America\u2019s Bridgeport office that day to perform an audit at the direction of the president of both entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Section 52-57 (c) provides that, in an action against a private corporation, \u201cservice of process <em>shall </em>be made either upon\u201d a person in any of certain named capacities or upon the \u201cperson in charge of the business of the corporation or upon any person who is at the time of service in charge of the office of the corporation in the town in which its principal office or place of business is located.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The trial court, in an articulation of its decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, found that the plaintiff made no claim of service upon the corporation\u2019s statutory agent for service as permitted by General Statutes \u00a7 33-297, and that the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 52-57 (c), the only other statute applicable to service here, had not been satisfied. The court noted that the individual on whom service was made was not employed by Poster America, and found, on the basis of the facts before it, that she was not, at the time of service, in charge of the office of the corporation, for the purposes of \u00a7 52-57 (c). On the basis of <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>145 Conn. 24, 138 A.2d 527 (1958), cited by the trial court, and our review of the record, we agree. We, therefore, conclude that the dismissal of the action for lack of jurisdiction resulting from improper service was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\"> The named defendant is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
