App. 24, 28, 492 A.2d 210 (1985). In order to rebut that presumption, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the assessment is invalid because it exceeds the dollar benefit accruing to his property. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>supra. Benefit to the plaintiffs property is measured by the difference between the market value of the property before and after the improvement. Id., 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\">Our review of the record in the present case discloses that the plaintiff produced no evidence to rebut the presumption of the assessment\u2019s validity. The trial referee properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
