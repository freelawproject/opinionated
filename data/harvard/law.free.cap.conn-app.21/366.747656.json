The defendants have appealed from the judgment of the trial court which added interest to the judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The promissory note was dated April 28,1982, in the original principal amount of $82,559. The note provided for annual interest in the amount of 12 percent and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in the event the promissor defaulted on the note. At the time of trial the principal balance due was $48,909 together with unpaid interest from June 1, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On February 5, 1985, the plaintiff filed an \u201coffer of judgment\u201d in the amount of $48,000. The offer, which was filed within eighteen months of the filing of the complaint, was not accepted by the defendants. On February 8,1989, a judgment in the amount of $92,583.94 was rendered in favor of the plaintiff based on a jury verdict received and accepted on January 20,1989. The defendants did not request that interrogatories be submitted to the jury for the purpose of determining how the jury arrived at this amount. The defendants did not move to set aside the verdict and have not appealed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>After judgment was rendered, the court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for interest on its offer of judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a and awarded interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from February 14, 1984, the date the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed, to February 8,1989, the date that judgment was rendered. The court\u2019s interest award was in the amount of $55,364.65, bringing the total amount awarded to the plaintiff to $147,948.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The defendants have appealed from that order and claim that the trial court erred in its award of interest because the total damages awarded by the jury do not specifically distinguish a separate amount for principal due on the note, interest accrued on the note, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. It is the defendants\u2019 assertion that the court cannot add interest on a promissory note that already provides interest. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The court, by modification of judgment, awarded additional interest pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (b). This award is punitive in nature and authorized by legislation enacted to promote fair and reasonable compromise of litigation without trial. <em>Crowther </em>v. <em>Gerber Garment Technology, Inc., </em>8 Conn. App. 254, 267, 513 A.2d 144 (1986). Interest awarded pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (b) may apply to a judgment that includes attorney\u2019s fees and interest.

ACCEPTANCE BY DEFENDANT. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST, (a) After commencement of any civil action based upon contract or for the recovery of money only, the plaintiff may before trial file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 signed by him or his attorney, directed to the defendant or his attorney, offering to settle the claim underlying the action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain. The plaintiff shall give notice of the offer of settlement to the defendant\u2019s attorney, or if the defendant is not represented by an attorney, to the defendant himself. Within thirty days after being notified of the filing of the \u2018offer of judgment,\u2019 the defendant or his attorney may file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018acceptance of offer of judgment\u2019 agreeing to a stipulation for judgment as contained in plaintiff\u2019s \u2018offer of judgment.\u2019 Upon such filing, the clerk shall enter judgment immediately on the stipulation. If the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 is not accepted within thirty days, the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled. Any such \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 and any \u2018acceptance of offer of judgment\u2019 shall be included by the clerk in the record of the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201c(b) After trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain stated in his \u2018offer of judgment,\u2019 the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount, computed from the date such offer was filed in actions commenced before October 1, 1981. In those actions commenced on or after October 1,1981, the interest shall be computed from the date the complaint in the civil action was filed with the court if the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 was filed not later than eighteen months from the filing of such complaint. If such offer was filed later than eighteen months from the date of filing of the complaint, the interest shall be computed from the date the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 was filed. The court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars, and shall render judgment accordingly. This section shall not be interpreted to abrogate the contractual rights of any party concerning the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the provisions of any written contract between the parties to the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
