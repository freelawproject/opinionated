The defendant claims that the trial court erred in not sua sponte either declaring a mistrial or giving a curative instruction following an improper closing argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On March 14, 1987, four undercover narcotics officers with the Waterbury police department were assigned to the South Main Street area of Waterbury. While there, one of the officers met John Ruge, a local resident. After the officer told Ruge that he wished to purchase drugs, Ruge took him to Bishop Street where they met Nettra Brown, who was known as Foncie. They told Brown that they were looking for heroin, or dope, and she accompanied them to the corner of Cherry Street and Albert Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">When the officer parked on Cherry Street, Brown went to an address on Albert Place and returned with the defendant, to whom she referred as Redd. The officer and Ruge each gave the defendant $20 and in return the defendant gave Ruge two glassine packets containing heroin. Ruge immediately gave the officer one of the packets of heroin. The officer held the glassine packet up as if to examine it. This was a prearranged signal that was intended to alert the other three officers that a sale had been completed. One of those officers viewed the entire transaction and, immediately after the glassine bag was raised, contacted the two remaining officers, who made a positive identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The defendant claims that he was deprived of his fundamental right to a fair trial by prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments to the jury. In particular he contends that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper in that it (1) distorted the state\u2019s burden of proof, (2) appealed to the jury\u2019s passions and prejudices concerning illegal drugs and thus injected irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>considerations into the case, and (3) vouched for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses and the strength of the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The defendant failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s conduct during the course of the trial, and neglected to request either curative instructions or a mistrial. Because the defendant raises this claim on appeal for the first time, we must decide, as a preliminary matter, whether this claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Our Supreme Court has held \u201cthat a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of only one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In the present case, we will review the defendant\u2019s claim to determine whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and whether it deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 435, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cprosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument, thereby implicating the fundamental fairness of the trial itself; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 539, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>196 Conn. 32, 33-34, 490 A.2d 515 (1985); [but] <em>Evans </em>review of such a claim is unavailable where the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>207 Conn. 646, 654, 542 A.2d 1136 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 537; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>199 Conn. 102, 107-108, 505 A.2d 712 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyler-Barcomb, </em>197 Conn. 666, 672-74, 500 A.2d 1324 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1109, 106 S. Ct. 1518, 89 L. Ed. 2d 916 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>214 Conn. 378, 393, 572 A.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The defendant asserts that the first of three incidents of misconduct occurred when the prosecutor allegedly shifted the state\u2019s burden of proof by commenting on alleged perjury by the defendant\u2019s witnesses. The defendant argues that his closing argument stressed mistaken identity and did not invite the prosecutor\u2019s mention of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The record indicates that during a lengthy summation, the prosecutor told the jurors that they should take the law as given by the court, that they were the ultimate finders of fact, and that it was their recollection of the facts that mattered. In arguing she discussed her recollection of the facts and stated that the defendant had presented a defense of mistaken identity. She then cautioned the jurors that although police officers\u2019 testimony should not be given additional credit simply because of their status, their training and experience should nonetheless be fully assessed by jurors when deliberating. She then commented that one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, namely \u201cMr. Ruge would have us believe four policemen sat there and absolutely perjured themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The second of the three alleged incidents of misconduct, the defendant claims inflamed the prejudices of the jury, occurred when the prosecutor twice referred to the heroin as \u201cpoison\u201d and stated that the bag of heroin was in the courtroom because of the efforts of the undercover officer, otherwise \u201cit would have been doing its damage in the arms of . . . a junkie . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The last of the alleged incidents of misconduct is the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of state witnesses. This supposedly occurred during closing arguments when the prosecutor said that she did not believe \u201cany of those officers would do such a thing,\u201d that is, take the stand and perjure himself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was in response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the officers were locked into their testimony and may have manufactured some of that testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim does not support the clear existence of a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights or his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">These unpreserved claims of prosecutorial misconduct do not fall within the category of being either blatantly egregious or part of a pattern of misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>repeated throughout the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>20 Conn. App. 586, 598-99, 569 A.2d 551 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>19 Conn. App. 111, 128, 562 A.2d 43 (1989). Accordingly, we decline to review these claims of error further.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-13\"> The defendant raises for the first time in his reply brief and at oral arguments a \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d by the prosecutor and seeks to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>other pending appeals to demonstrate a formula for argument to the jury constituting prepared remarks that buttress his claims of misconduct in final summation. We will not review a claim that has not been properly raised. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>209 Conn. 622, 633, 553 A.2d 589 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> The relevant portion of the state\u2019s argument is as follows: \u201cHowever, I think it\u2019s fair you look at the defense in this case because the people of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>this state are not interested in having an innocent man found guilty. I think we should look to the defense. We had Mr. Ruge. Mr. Ruge would have us believe four policemen sat there and absolutely perjured themselves. That\u2019s the only thing we can get from Mr. Ruge\u2019s testimony. Mr. Ruge says he never got into a car on South Main Street. In fact, I think he said he never was down there. He never went up to Bishop Street. He doesn\u2019t know Nettra Brown. He never bought heroin. So we are not now just talking about mistaken identity. He didn\u2019t get on the stand and say, \u2018Yeah, I bought heroin, not from this guy.\u2019 He said none of this ever happened. The cops made the whole thing up, as if he would have us believe the police made this up. I leave to you what you believe of Mr. Ruge\u2019s testimony and how credible you feel it is.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cWhen Mr. Ruge testified, I brought to your attention that he had prior criminal convictions. And I did this because I believe the law\u2014and I believe we all believe people who commit burglaries are sometimes considered people who are not honest. By its very nature, it\u2019s that kind of crime. It\u2019s not a crime of passion. It\u2019s a crime really of dishonesty. We also think that people who commit felonies\u2014and he had a prior felony conviction as well as his two prior burglary convictions\u2014people commit felonies, they are sometimes considered maybe less reliable. And I submit to you because\u2014and it is how reliable you felt any part of his testimony was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cAnd you may recall Detective W. says he\u2019s known Ruge. Even Ruge admitted he knew Detective W. for a long time. [Officers] P. and D. said they knew Ruge. In fact, D. gave a perfect description, as I recall, of Ruge. Of course, they knew Ruge. Of course, they knew Nettra Brown. I don\u2019t know why Ruge would like us to believe that this was all some kind of giant lie\u2014I think I know why he would like us to believe, but I don\u2019t know how he can expect us to. You have not one shred of evidence that the Waterbury police were out to get this man for any particular reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> The relevant portion of the state\u2019s argument is as follows: \u201cThe defendant said there is a good probability that he wasn\u2019t working that day. And I suggest to you he was working. He was on the street that day selling to Nettra Brown this bag of poison. And, ladies and gentlemen, make no doubt about it. This bag contains poison.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to finish very quickly. I do have another chance to speak to you when Miss Moore gets through. I just wanted to say one thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>because you\u2019re good people and you have sometimes compassion or sympathy for a person who\u2019s on trial. And I understand that. But I suggest to you that if you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant is guilty, there is no need to have any sympathy for this situation. The only reason that this bag of heroin is here today in this courtroom is because Officer D. was a member of the Waterbury Police Department. Otherwise, it would have been doing its damage in the arms of what he thought was probably a junkie, namely, Officer D. Officer D. was out there as just a junkie about to buy this little bag for $20, which is nothing but poison.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> The relevant portion of the state\u2019s argument is as follows: \u201cBut I must instantly take umbrage with something [defense counsel] said because I really find\u2014as I said, I think you\u2019ll be told by Judge Lavery that you cannot believe a police officer simply because he\u2019s a police officer\u2014but she has asked you just now to disbelieve a police officer simply because they are police officers. I believe she said they are going to take the stand and they are going to say things just because they\u2014an arrest must be made to stick, or whatever her words were. And I do take umbrage with that. It is very difficult for me to believe that a man of twenty-seven years experience went on that witness stand and with absolute certainty identified this man, not by name\u2014he didn\u2019t identify a name or anything else. He said that\u2019s the man I saw as Redd. That\u2019s the man who, one week before the transaction, was pointed out to him as Redd. This is a man whom he arrested. He had the warrant on this case. He arrested him on Cherry Street, not on Albert Street, but on Cherry Street because he recognized him. And now she\u2019s saying Detective Wallace took this stand and perjured himself to us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201cI take umbrage with that. I do not believe any of those police officers would do such a thing. There is no evidence in this case at all for some reason, the Waterbury Police Department has fabricated this case against this man by their own testimony. And that day they did not even know who he was.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\"> The relevant portion of the defense argument is as follows: \u201cI have to say also that, in fact, I\u2019ve known Mr. Whitfield now over a year and in the time that I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s had one very distinct characteristic. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>it the day I met him. He has it today. He's had it for every day in between and that is he has a beard. It\u2019s very small, close cropped, but it\u2019s a beard. That beard is such a general characteristic that if, in fact, it had been my client that day, that would have been easily enough\u2014there is no mention of facial hair whatsoever. The only evidence is clean shaven. If they said clean shaven, that would have been even a more particular description, then you would know you\u2019re not looking for anybody with facial hair. All they say is five ten, black male, heavy set, dark clothing. I want you to think of how many people in the world that could fit into. He has some other characteristics, but I\u2019m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe they couldn\u2019t get those because they haven\u2019t observed him the way I\u2019ve observed him. They haven\u2019t worked with him the way I\u2019ve worked with him, but the facial hair is a dead giveaway, but I\u2019m suggesting to you in the amount of time that they had, they couldn\u2019t give you any more identification than what they have because that\u2019s all they have, five ten, heavy set, black male. Not enough. And the only reason they connect Mr. Whitfield is by that phone call, I suggest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cNow, you say to yourselves, Okay, they came in here. They only had a few seconds to identify the party, but they all sat in that box and they all pointed to this man and said he\u2019s the one I saw. Why would they do that if he wasn\u2019t the one? There are many reasons. I suggest one. These gentlemen are police officers. They have a very difficult job. I don\u2019t discredit that. They put themselves out there on the street every day on the line. God knows what may face them. But their jobs include making arrests. And once they have made that arrest, once they have viewed the person, they have to say we believe that this is the person. We have got the correct person. They have to come in and say that\u2019s the person because to say that\u2019s not the person would invalidate this whole system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cHow would it be if they came into the courtrooms, take that stand and say, \u2018Gee, we made a mistake?\u2019 That would waste the court\u2019s time. The prosecutor is only doing her job. She\u2019s got four people who are saying to her that\u2019s the guy. Fine, that\u2019s the guy, let\u2019s go with it. Let\u2019s bring the case to the court. Let\u2019s bring it to the jury. Let\u2019s work on it. But those police officers made that identification, made that connection based on a few seconds identification. Once they have made the connection, they have to live with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
