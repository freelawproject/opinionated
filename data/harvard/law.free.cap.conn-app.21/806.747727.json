As we have often stated, we will not retry the case. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Coles, </em>17 Conn. App. 881, 832, 553 A.2d 1169 (1989). Our review of the record fails to disclose that the factual findings of the court were clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings, or that the decision was otherwise erroneous in law; Practice Book \u00a7 4061; or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Della Pietra </em>v. <em>American Factors, Inc., </em>18 Conn. App. 812, 556 A.2d 1064 (1989). Rulings involving the court\u2019s discretion will be disturbed on appeal only upon a showing of a clear abuse of that discretion. <em>Leech </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>17 Conn. App. 352, 353, 552 A.2d 451 (1989). Our review of the record also indicates that the court\u2019s actions were clearly within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\">As the appellant, the defendant has the burden of showing that there was error in the judgment from which the appeal was taken. <em>Messenger </em>v. <em>Messenger, </em>18 Conn. App. 825, 559 A.2d 1193 (1989); 1 B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 60. After affording the claims of error the appropriate scope of review, we conclude that the defendant has not met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
