He claims that the habeas court erred in failing to conclude that his pleas were not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary (1) because of a misunderstanding by the trial court, the prosecutor and his defense counsel concerning the procedure whereby convicted sex offenders are committed to Whiting Forensic Institute (Whiting), and (2) because he was under the influence of medication at the time of the pleas. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The following facts are relevant. On March 31,1981, the petitioner was arrested and charged with various sex offenses, kidnapping in the first degree and robbery in the first degree. His maximum exposure for the eight felonies was 120 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">On April 13,1982, the petitioner pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to five counts of first degree sexual assault, two counts of first degree kidnapping, and one count of first degree robbery. Before accepting the petitioner\u2019s guilty pleas, the trial court questioned him closely, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 711. During the plea canvass, the court made a commitment to recommend to the commissioner of correction that the petitioner be housed, \u201cfor whatever period of time he thought was reasonable, at the Whiting Forensic Institute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The trial court later sentenced the petitioner to thirty-years incarceration. At the petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court made its promised recommendation to the commissioner of correction, but denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for an examination by the Whiting staff to determine his eligibility for treatment at Whiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Since his sentencing, the petitioner has been confined in the state prison at Somers. He has not spent any time at Whiting Forensic Institute.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Before addressing the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims, we must consider the respondent\u2019s contention that this court should dismiss the present petition under either the \u201csuccessive petitions\u201d or \u201cabuse of writ\u201d doctrines. The following procedural background is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">In January, 1983, the petitioner filed four pro se habeas petitions. The first petition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; the second,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> breach of plea agreement; the third,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> failure to inform of maximum sentence. The fourth<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleged that the pleas were invalid due to the petitioner\u2019s mental condition. On January 24, 1984, the habeas court denied the first two petitions, and the court denied the petitioner\u2019s request for certification to appeal. The third petition was withdrawn, and the fourth is the petition presently before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Because the four petitions were filed contemporaneously, the fourth cannot be considered, in the simplest sense, \u201csuccessive\u201d to the others. Our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>case file, however, reveals that the fourth was amended on February 7,1986, two years after the first and second petitions were decided. The grounds for relief stated in the amended petition are broader and better articulated than in the original petition. We must determine, therefore, whether the fourth petition, as amended, constitutes a successive petition or an abuse of writ so as to require the dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201cDecisions concerning abuse of the writ are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. \u2018Theirs is the major responsibility for the just and sound administration of . . . collateral remedies, and theirs must be the judgment as to whether a second or successive application shall be denied without consideration of the merits.\u2019 <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 18, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1963).\u201d <em>Iasiello </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>12 Conn. App. 268, 271, 530 A.2d 1075, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 811, 532 A.2d 586 (1987). We note that the habeas court decided the present petition on the merits, and in its memorandum of decision referred to its prior decision on the other two petitions. Thus, the habeas court implicitly rejected the state\u2019s successive petition theory. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in deciding the petition on the merits. Moreover, our conclusion is reinforced by the consideration that, to this point, none of the petitioner\u2019s claims has received appellate review. We therefore turn to the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Four grounds for relief are presented in the petition, all of which are variations on a theme, namely, that the petitioner\u2019s pleas were not knowing, intelligent or voluntary. Three of the grounds are derived from the same set of facts, which we now relate.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>At the petitioner\u2019s plea canvass, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201cMr. Lyons [state\u2019s attorney]: May I add one other thing? May it be indicated that this is an agreed sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Thank you. Is that true, Mr. Lickson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201cMr. Lickson [defense counsel]: I was going to interject that Your Honor has indicated in our discussions that the court would recommend, at the time of sentencing, that the sentence be carried out at the Whiting Forensic Center in Middletown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\u201cThe Court: You understand that the commissioner of correction, by statute, is in charge of housing of persons who are incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cMr. Sherbo: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">\u201cThe Court: The court can, however, recommend to the commissioner, and the commissioner will do as he sees fit. But I have told your attorney, and the record should indicate that your attorney, Mr. Lyons . . . and myself, have had extensive discussions about these cases, and during those discussions, I have indicated to them that if I were, in fact, to accept the recommendation of the state, as joined in by your attorney, I would recommend and suggest to the commissioner that he house you, for whatever period of time he thought was reasonable, at the Whiting Forensic Institute. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">\u201cMr. Sherbo: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have any questions for me so far?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-13\">\u201cMr. Sherbo: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>At his sentencing, the petitioner, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-244,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> moved the court to order the Whiting staff to examine the petitioner in order to determine whether he would be a suitable candidate for treatment there. The court, in an exercise of its discretion and after determining that the petitioner was not mentally ill or dangerous to himself or others; see General Statutes \u00a7 17-244; denied the motion. The petitioner excepted. The court then sentenced the petitioner to thirty years to life. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u201cMr. Lickson [defense counsel]: Were you going to make a recommendation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Yes. I think these offenses were, obviously, committed by an individual who needs intensive rehabilitation prior to his being released from those offenses and I would urge the commissioner of correction make a serious effort to house this individual in an area or location where he can be given intensive rehabilitation as it, obviously, will be needed prior to any release.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The three grounds discussed in this section are closely related. They are (1) that the petitioner was not aware of the actual value of the commitments made to him by the prosecutor and the trial court, (2) that he was misled by misrepresentations concerning the Whiting Institute commitment procedure, and (3) that he did not properly understand the applicable law because it was stated to him incorrectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">A guilty plea, which is itself tantamount to conviction, may be accepted by the court only when it is made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(1969). A guilty plea otherwise obtained is in violation of due process and voidable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 119, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>16 Conn. App. 601, 602, 548 A.2d 16 (1988). To make a valid guilty plea, a defendant must have a full understanding of what his plea means; <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra; and be fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, the prosecutor, or his own counsel. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748 n.6, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The petitioner claims that, unbeknownst to him, the trial court\u2019s commitment to recommend to the commissioner of correction that he should serve his sentence at Whiting was virtually worthless. As the defendant notes, under the proper procedure by which a trial court may commit a convicted person to Whiting, as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 17-244, the trial court makes no recommendation to the commissioner concerning Whiting because the commissioner of correction is not involved in the decision. The defendant\u2019s reliance on that worthless promise in pleading guilty, he argues, rendered those pleas unknowing and involuntary. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">A defendant must be aware of the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor or his own counsel; id., 78; because a realistic assessment of such promises is essential in making an intelligent decision to plead guilty. This is not to say, however, that promises made by the court or the prosecutor must in every instance accurately reflect the applicable law. If any legal flaw in a promise does not mask the actual value of the promise, the legal flaw is harmless. For instance, a promise that is legally inaccurate, and thus unenforceable, will not present a ground for habeas relief if it was manifest and obvious at the time of the plea canvass that the promise was of little value in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>event. Thus, the critical question is whether the value of the court\u2019s promise, as reasonably perceived at the plea canvass, significantly exceeded the actual value of the promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The parties hotly contest the actual value of the court\u2019s promise to recommend to the commissioner of correction that he house the petitioner, \u201cfor whatever period of time he thought was reasonable,\u201d at Whiting. We need not decide this issue. Even if we assume, without deciding, that the actual value of the court\u2019s promise was severely limited,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the petitioner\u2019s claim still fails because the record clearly reveals that the value of the court\u2019s promise, <em>on its face, </em>was also severely limited. At the plea canvass, the court plainly stated that it did not have the authority to sentence the petitioner to serve all or part of his term in Whiting. We agree with the habeas court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s statements were not words of guarantee. That the petitioner mistook the court\u2019s promise to <em>recommend </em>that he be housed at Whiting for a guarantee is not, under these circumstances, a ground for habeas relief. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In order to prevail in a habeas corpus challenge, \u201cthe petitioner \u2018must demonstrate a miscarriage of justice or other prejudice and not merely an error which might entitle him to relief on appeal. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S. Ct. 468, 7 L. Ed. 2d 417, reh. denied, 369 U.S. 808, 82 S. Ct. 640, 7 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1962).\u2019 <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 156-57, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>476 A.2d 543 (1984).\u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>19 Conn. App. 440, 441, 562 A.2d 588, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 817, 565 A.2d 534 (1989). The petitioner has failed to make such a showing in this instance, and this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The petitioner\u2019s next two claims, namely, that he was misled by misrepresentations concerning the Whiting commitment procedure and that he did not understand the applicable law because it was stated to him incorrectly, are so closely related that we address them together. The key assumption underlying both claims is that the petitioner had a right to be informed, at his plea canvass, as to the proper procedure by which the trial court may commit sex offenders to confinement and treatment at Whiting. It is open to question, however, whether the law affords the petitioner such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Before he can make a valid guilty plea, a defendant must be fully aware of the direct consequences of his plea. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 748. To ensure compliance with this constitutional mandate, Practice Book \u00a7 711 requires the trial court to advise the defendant of (1) the mandatory minimum and maximum possible sentences, (2) the maximum possible consecutive sentence, (3) the possibility of additional punishment imposed because of previous convictions, and (4) the fact that the particular offense does not permit a sentence to be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In Connecticut, as elsewhere, \u201cthe scope of \u2018direct consequences\u2019 is very narrow; J. Bond, Plea Bargaining and the Guilty Plea (2d Ed.) \u00a7 3.38\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 383 n.17, 521 A.2d 547 (1987); and is limited to those consequences enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 711. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra. Except for those inquiries mandated by the constitution and court rule, the court is not obliged to assume the role of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>defendant\u2019s counselor; id., citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 45, 470 A.2d 688 (1984); or to advise the defendant of every possible consequence of his guilty plea. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra; see also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Risk, </em>17 Conn. App. 447, 456, 553 A.2d 1145, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 802, 559 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, U.S. , 110 S. Ct. 72, 107 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1989). In light of these considerations, the possibility that the petitioner would be committed to Whiting unmistakably appears to be a collateral consequence of his pleas.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petitioner was not entitled, therefore, to be advised by the trial court as to the existence of, or the possible result of, this procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Our analysis cannot end here because the petitioner does not allege merely that the trial court failed to advise him of the existence of the Whiting commitment procedure. Rather, he claims that the trial court, his trial defense counsel, and the prosecutor misrepresented the nature of the Whiting commitment procedure and thus rendered his guilty pleas invalid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">A guilty plea induced by misrepresentations, including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises, is constitutionally unsound; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 755; because such misrepresentations interfere with the defendant\u2019s ability to weigh realistically the state\u2019s case and the likelihood of securing leniency through a plea bargain. Here, however, the petitioner has failed to show that the misinformation he received concerning incarceration at Whiting amounted to misrepresentations on the part of the trial court. The record reveals that no promises were made to the petitioner that he would serve his sentence at Whiting, and the trial court pointedly informed him that it was not within the court\u2019s discretion to sentence him to incarceration at Whiting. As discussed above, we are not convinced that the trial court\u2019s inaccurate portrayal of the Whiting procedure made it any more or less likely that the petitioner would plead guilty than would have been the case with an accurate portrayal of that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We reject the petitioner\u2019s argument that the mere fact that he was misinformed as to the Whiting procedure vitiated his guilty pleas. The petitioner, facing a maximum exposure of 120 years to life, chose to plead guilty in return for an effective sentence of thirty years. Given the available alternatives, he made a wise choice. Under the facts of this case, the trial court\u2019s misinfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>mation concerning a collateral consequence of the petitioner\u2019s guilty pleas does not constitute a violation of due process or a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Perini, </em>718 F.2d 784, 788-89 (6th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The petitioner\u2019s last claim is that his pleas were not knowing, intelligent and voluntary because, at the time of his pleas, he was under the influence of prescription medication. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The habeas court found that for some time prior to his pleas, the petitioner had received 150 mg. of Mellaril and 100 mg. of Asendin daily. That court also noted that both psychiatrists who testified at trial agreed that the petitioner\u2019s dosage of Asendin was too low to have any effect on his ability to understand the plea canvass proceedings, and that his dosage of Mellaril probably improved his judgment by reducing impulsiveness and allowing him to listen more receptively and to reason better. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>847 F.2d 991, 1000 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1015, 109 S. Ct. 808, 102 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1989) (use of lithium by manic-depressive defendant actually made him more rational and better able to plead). Further, the petitioner testified at his plea canvass that he, himself, noticed no effects of the medication.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The petitioner has failed to show that the administration of these medications clouded his judgment so as to cause a miscarriage of justice. See id., 1000; <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 441; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>20 Conn. App. 630, 633, 569 A.2d 1140 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\"> Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, docket number 279364, dated January 4, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\"> Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, docket number 279606, dated January 8, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-12\"> Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, docket number 279607, dated January 8, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b196-13\"> Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, docket number 279608, dated January 8, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-244 and 17-245 govern the trial court\u2019s sentencing of convicted sex offenders, inter alia, to confinement and treatment at Whiting Forensic Institute. The procedure outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 17-244 and 17-245 differs significantly from the process that the parties appear from the transcript to have envisioned at the plea canvass. Indeed, the central mystery of this case is why the parties and the trial court apparently overlooked these statutes at the plea canvass, yet properly applied them at the petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 17-244 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in section 17-255 any court prior to sentencing a person convicted of ... a sex offense involving (1) physical force or violence . . . may if it appears to the court that such person is mentally ill and dangerous to himself or others . . . upon request of any of the persons enumerated in subsection (b) of this section and a subsequent finding that such request is justified, order the commissioner to conduct an examination of the convicted defendant by qualified personnel of the institute.

Even if the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, agrees to initiate the \u00a7 17-244 procedure it is by no means guaranteed that the convicted offender will ultimately spend any time at Whiting.

Ed. 2d 21 (1973)\u201d; <em>George </em>v. <em>Black, </em>732 F.2d 108, 110 (8th Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lambros, </em>544 F.2d 962, 966 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 930, 97 S. Ct. 1550, 51 L. Ed. 2d 774 (1977). From the vantage point of the plea canvass, the result of a contemplated \u00a7 17-244 procedure cannot be considered definite or largely automatic. Thus, under either the <em>Gilnite </em>or <em>Cuthrell </em>test, the Whiting commitment procedure must be viewed as a collateral consequence of the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\"> This conclusion is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was invalid because he did not understand the applicable law correctly. Although a defendant must understand the law in relation to the facts of the case before he can make a valid guilty plea; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); this requirement extends only to the defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charge; see id.; see also <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 96 U.S. 2253, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>(1976); and his understanding that at trial the state would have to prove all the elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. See W LaFave and J. Israel, Criminal Procedure (1985) \u00a7 20.4 (c). Thus, the trial court was not required to advise the defendant of the law pertaining to the collateral aspects of his sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"ABu\"> The following colloquy took place at the plea canvass:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\u201cThe Court: Are you under the influence of drugs or alcohol today in any way that would affect your ability to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">\u201cMr. Sherbo: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
