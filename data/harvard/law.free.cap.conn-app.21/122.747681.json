The commission claims error in that portion of the Superior Court\u2019s judgment that overruled its denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application for the western crossing. The plaintiff has cross appealed from that portion of the judgment that upheld the commission\u2019s denial of its application for the eastern crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The commission claims that the trial court erred (1) in substituting its judgment for that of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>(2) in failing to remand the matter for further proceedings, and (3) in concluding as it did on the evidence before it. The plaintiff, in its cross appeal, alleges that the trial court erred (1) in determining that General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (b) applies to municipal inland wetlands agencies, and (2) in determining that General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (b) was legally applicable to the plaintiffs application. We find error in the trial court\u2019s failure to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">On March 1, 1987, the plaintiff filed an application with the commission to construct a roadway that would cross an inland wetland at two separate locations some distance apart. The plaintiff asserts that this roadway would provide the only access to ten residential building lots on a piece of property containing approximately thirty-seven acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On July 1,1987, while the plaintiff\u2019s application was pending, Public Acts 1987, No. 87-533, came into effect, making changes to the Wetlands and Watercourses Act including the addition of subsection (b) to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission, acting as an inland wetlands agency, held a public hearing on July 6,1987. In its decision dated September 8,1987, following the guidelines of \u00a7 22a-41 (b), the commission held that it was unable to find that feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed roadway did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The trial court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the commission\u2019s decision. Thereafter, however, the same court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open or set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the judgment, and sustained the plaintiffs appeal as to the western crossing, but maintained its dismissal of the appeal as to the eastern crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The Defendant\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"Aol\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The commission first claims that the court erred in substituting its judgment for that of the commission. The commission asserts that the court usurped its function in finding that it had acted illegally, arbitrarily or so unreasonably as to have abused its discretion in not having divided the application itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The record indicates that the commission and the soil conservation service made site inspections. After these inspections, the public hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s application was held open for three weeks to allow written comments to be submitted by the commission\u2019s engineers, Christman Associates, Inc, On August 5,1987, the plaintiff agreed to an extension of the commission\u2019s thirty day deadline. On September 8,1987, Christman submitted a report based on a review of the applicant\u2019s plans. The report briefly described four alternative routes over the eastern portion of the land with varying degrees of impact on the inland wetlands that were located within the subdivision. The route proposed by the plaintiff in his application was listed as the first alternative. The report indicated, however, that the fourth alternative would be the preferred route for the eastern crossing if the primary objective was to conserve inland wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s application clearly sought two inland wetland crossings, however. It was not until the court reviewed the entire record a second time that it determined that the commission had considered only the alternate routes to the eastern crossing, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>western crossing had received no separate consideration in spite of the apparent approval of this crossing by the commission\u2019s own engineer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Clearly, the application was never severed by the trial court as claimed by the commission. Rather, the court correctly found that the plaintiff sought permission for a single road that would make two separate crossings across an inland wetland. It further recognized that the commission\u2019s own engineer had come to different conclusions as to each of the proposed crossings and, consequently, that the engineer\u2019s report was, \u201cin fact, evidence that no other prudent and feasible alternative existed with regard to this second or westerly most crossing of the wetlands.\u201d The court finally determined that there are, in fact, two separate crossings, that the commission should have made a separate decision as to each of the wetland crossings and that, because the commission did not do so, its action was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">It is our conclusion that the trial court properly based its holding on the record before it, and that, because the commission had never considered the feasibility of the western crossing, the court did not err when it sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal as to the western wetland crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The commission next claims that the trial court erred when it failed to remand the matter to the commission for further proceedings. We agree. After finding that the commission had failed to consider the western crossing, the trial court should have remanded the mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ter to the commission with direction to consider and decide that wetland crossing separately, or, in other words, to remand for the commission to take action consistent with the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">It is the function of the commission, first, to find facts as to whether evidence of the unavailability of possible and prudent alternatives was sufficiently persuasive to satisfy General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (b), second, in light of the criteria enumerated under \u00a7 22a-41 (a), to decide whether to grant or deny the application for the western wetland crossing, and, if granted, to determine whether that permit should contain special terms, conditions, limitations or modifications of the regulated activity, as provided for in \u00a7 22a-42a (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The commission\u2019s final claim of error is that the trial court exceeded its authority by substituting its judgment for that of the commission. Specifically, the commission claims that the court erred when it concluded that the evidence supported a finding that no prudent and feasible alternative existed with respect to the western crossing. We cannot agree. The trial court\u2019s decision does not \u201cfind as a fact\u201d that no feasible and prudent alternative existed. Rather, the court merely concluded that the commission failed to consider <em>separately </em>specific evidence, i.e., its own engineer\u2019s report as to the western wetland crossing, and, consequently, that it failed to decide <em>separately </em>that it could not find, on the basis of \u00a7 22a-41 (b), \u201cthat feasible and prudent alternatives do not exist\u201d to that crossing before it denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The trial court properly discharged its duty to both parties by its review of the actions of the commission with respect to <em>each </em>crossing requested in the plaintiff\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The Plaintiff\u2019s Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in determining that the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (b) are applicable to municipal inland wetlands agencies, such as the commission. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that \u00a7 22a-41 (b) applies only to the commissioner of environmental protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Although the plaintiff agrees that Public Acts 1987, No. 87-533, which added subsection (b) to \u00a7 22a-41, is comprehensive in nature, it claims that because the legislature did not add corresponding changes to the provisions of \u00a7 22a-42a (d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the power vested in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>environmental protection commissioner by this act does not apply to local inland wetlands agencies. To support its claim, the plaintiff points out that the legislature did not specifically add the identical language to \u00a7 22a-42a (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">While it is true that \u00a7 22a-41 is entitled \u201cFactors for consideration of commissioner\u201d and that both subsections (a) and (b) speak in terms of what \u201cthe commissioner\u201d is required to do, \u00a7 22a-42a (d) makes it clear that \u00a7 22a-41 applies to the commissioner as well as to municipal inland wetlands agencies. Further, the express language of Public Acts 1987, No. 87-533, \u00a7 6 (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> makes it obvious that by using the phrase \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>amended by section 4 of this Act/\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the legislature intended that \u00a7 22a-41 would apply both to the commissioner and to municipal inland wetlands agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the court erred in determining that \u00a7 22a-41 (b) applied to its permit application. On February 1,1988, while the plaintiffs appeal of the commission\u2019s opinion was pending in the Superior Court, the commission adopted a regulation identical to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (b). In weighing the commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application, the court held the commission to the standard of review encompassed in its newly adopted regulation. The court held that the regulations in effect at the time of the Superior Court\u2019s decision controlled under the rule of <em>McCallum </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>196 Conn. 218, 492 A.2d 508 (1985). We agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In its appeal to this court, the plaintiff has attempted to distinguish <em>McCallum </em>from the present case by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>asserting that, unlike the plaintiff in <em>McCallum, </em>it is being subjected to a more stringent standard of review on appeal. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">It was well within the province of the commission in this case to adopt a regulation that provides for \u201ccriteria and procedures for the review of applications . . . .\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (a) (4). Further, the regulation in question neither extended nor expanded the jurisdiction of the commission over the plaintiff. Where the original regulations are no longer of any force, determination of their effect and validity would be futile because no actual relief could follow. <em>McCallum </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>supra, 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">There is error in part on the appeal and no error on the cross appeal, that portion of the judgment dealing with the western crossing is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to remand the case to the commission for further consideration of the plaintiffs application as to the western crossing not inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">A second defendant, the commissioner of the department of environmental protection, did not file an appearance at trial and is not a party to this appeal. We will refer in this opinion to the Chester Conservation Commission as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(b) In the case of an application which received a public hearing, a permit shall not be issued unless the commissioner finds that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist.
