J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiP\">The defendant E. E. McCalla and the E. E. McCalla Company, a California corporation, were convicted of a violation of the Corporate Securities Act (Stats. 1917, p. 673). They appeal from the judgments against them and from the orders denying their respective motions for a now trial. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There also is an attempted appeal from the order denying a motion in arrest of judgment, but as that is not an appealable order the appeal therefrom must be dismissed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>138 Cal. 462 [71 Pac. 566].)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">The information contains three counts. The E. E. McCalla Company is not named in the title to the information, nor does that pleading specifically designate the corporation as one of the accused. But the facts alleged in count one are sufficient to show that the corporation, as well as the four natural persons who were expressly made defendants, committed a public offense by violating certain provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>of the Corporate Securities Act. It is expressly alleged in the body of the first count that the B'. E. McCalla Company, having no permit from the corporation commissioner to issue or dispose of its securities, willfully and knowingly, and for a valuable consideration, to wit, $200 in lawful money of the United States, sold and issued to one Lillian M. Lake an instrument in writing which represented a right to participate and share in the profits and earnings and distribution of assets of the corporation. Count two charges that the persons specifically accused by the district attorney\u2014 E. E. McCalla, C. R. Greenlee, C. S. Dye, and P. H. Farone \u2022\u2014acting as agents and brokers of the E. E. McCalla Company, to whom no permit had been issued by the corporation commissioner, issued and sold to Lillian M. Lake an instrument in writing representing the right of the purchaser to participate and share in the profits, earnings, and distribution of assets of the corporation. In count three McCalla, Greenlee, Dye, and Farone are charged with selling securities without having a broker\u2019s certificate authorizing them to act as brokers or agents. The corporation was convicted on the first count and E. E: McCalla was convicted on the second count. The three other defendants were acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">It was conceded at the trial that the E. E. McCalla Company is a California corporation; that E. B. McCalla was and is its president; that no permit was ever issued by the corporation commissioner authorizing the corporation to issue or dispose of any securities, and that these facts were known to the defendant E. E. McCalla.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">One of the contested issues was whether or not the instrument which appellants caused to be delivered to Mrs. Lake was a \u201csecurity,\u201d within the meaning of the act. The material evidence bearing upon this issue was, in substance, as follows: On June 19, 1922, the E. E. McCalla Company, as grantor, by its president, E. E. McCalla, and its secretary, D. G. Ruker, executed to Mrs. Lake a grant deed whereby the corporation conveyed to the grantee a small parcel of land, 20 by 21.2 feet, which was a 1/4000 part of a larger tract of about 41.7 acres, all of which was originally owned by the grantor. The deed declares that the grant to Mrs. Lake is subject: (1) to a lease held by the Chancellor-Can-field-Midway Oil Company for the development and production of oil; (2) to an agreement by A. H. and W. M. Brad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>ford to care for an orange grove on the land in consideration of their right to receive certain profits from the crops; and (3) \u201cto an agreement by the E. E. MeCalla Company, a corporation, to receive and disburse all income received from said lands to the proper parties and to make any new agreements necessary for increasing or protecting the income from said land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Contemporaneously with the execution of this deed the E. E. MeCalla Company, by its secretary and by E. E. MeCalla, its president, issued to Mrs. Lake a document denominated a \u201ccertificate,\u201d in which is incorporated as a component part thereof a declaration and acceptance of trust. The whole document, so far as pertinent to this case, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">\u201cCertificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">\u201cNo. 371.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACC\">Parcel No.-.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">\u201cNet Income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">\u201cThis is to certify that Mrs. L.

The second coupon reads as follows: \u201cCoupon No. 2. Certificate No. 371 Good for 1/4000 net income accruing under Trust No. 12, E. E. McCalla Co., Los Angeles, Calif., from July 1, 1922, to January 1, 1923, payable January 1, 1923.\u201d The remaining coupons, <em>mutatis mutandis, </em>are similar to coupon No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">In construing this certificate the trial court held, as a matter of law, that the instrument is a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the act, and, so holding, instructed the jury that it is a \u201csecurity,\u201d refusing to allow the defendant E. E. McCalla to show that he had been advised by reputable counsel that it was not a \u201csecurity\u201d within the definition of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In making these rulings the court committed no error. Section 6 of the act reads, in part, as follows: \u201cThe word \u2018security\u2019 includes: ... (c) any instrument issued or offered to the public by any company, evidencing or representing any right to participate or share in the profits or earnings or the distribution of assets of any business carried on for profit.\u201d The certificate issued to Mrs. Lake falls within this definition of a \u201csecurity.\u201d The \u201ccertificate,\u201d so called, is an instrument in writing. It is an instrument which was issued or offered to the public. The evidence fully justifies the inference that it was one of a series of similar certificates every one of which was offered to the public. It was issued by the \u201ccompany\u201d through its president, the appellant E. E. McCalla. It evidences the right of its holder, Mrs. Lake, to participate and share in the profits or earnings of a business carried on for profit, i. e., a business carried on for profit by the E. E. McCalla Company. The document, therefore, and the act of issuing\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>it contain all the essential elements of a \u201csecurity,\u201d as that word is defined in subdivision c of section 6 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Because Mrs. Lake held the legal title to the unit of land which the corporation had conveyed to her\u2014the parcel 20 feet by 21.2 feet\u2014appellants contend that the certificate gave to her no more than a right to share in profits accruing from her own land, and that therefore it gave her no right to share in the profits of the corporation. The definition of the term \u201csecurity,\u201d as given by the act, does not expressly declare that the profits or earnings, the right to share in which is evidenced by the \u201csecurity,\u201d shall be the profits or earnings of the \u201ccompany.\u201d The language is: \u201cThe word \u2018security\u2019 includes . . . any instrument . . . evidencing . . . any right to . . . share ... in the profits or earnings ... of <em>any </em>business carried on for profit.\u201d But though this particular part of the act does not expressly provide that, to constitute the instrument a security, the profits or earnings must be profits or earnings of the \u201ccompany,\u201d it is quite possible that when all the provisions of the act are read and construed together it should be held that there is a necessary implication that the profits or earnings must be such as are made or earned by the \u201ccompany.\u201d But, however this may be, it is not necessary for us to decide the question now, and we refrain from doing so, for in the present case it clearly appears that the profits and earnings ,, in which Mrs. Lake was entitled to share by reason of the t certificate issued to her were profits and earnings of the '\u00a1corporation. The certificate gave her the right to a 1/4000 part of the \u201cnet\u201d income to be received from the 41.7 acre tract, i. e., the income on hand after deducting from the gross income the expense incurred in the care of the land (including taxes) and the five per cent which the corporation was entitled to retain as a \u201ctrust collection and disbursement fee. \u2019 \u2019 The net income which was thus to be distributed to the certificate holders was to be derived from the profits or earnings of a business carried on by the corporation for profit, namely, the business of managing, caring for, renting, and leasing the 41.7 acres and receiving the income accruing therefrom. In its declaration of trust, incorporated into and made a part of each \u201ccertificate,\u201d the corporation obligated itself \u201cto manage, care for, rent, lease, and receive all income accruing from\u201d the 41.7 acre tract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>and, after deducting all necessary and proper expenses, including a collection and disbursement fee amounting to five per cent of the gross income, to pay the balance to the owners of the several land units\u2014the owner of each unit being entitled to a 1/4000 part of the total net income. And in the deed which the corporation executed to Mrs. Lake contemporaneously with the issuance of its certificate to her there is, as we have seen, a provision to the effect that the conveyance of the unit of land, 20 feet by 21.2 feet, shall be subject to an agreement by the corporation not only to receive and disburse to the proper parties all the net income received from the 41.7 acre tract, but \u201cto make any <em>neiv </em>agreements necessary for increasing or protecting the income from said land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The sum and substance of the whole arrangement was simply this: Though the tract of 41.7 acres, or some portion thereof, was nominally owned by the respective grantees of the several land units\u2014small holdings of 20 by 21.2 feet\u2014 and not by the corporation, still the latter was to have the sole right to manage, rent, and lease the entire tract, including the right to make any and all agreements for increasing and protecting the income therefrom. We have, therefore, this situation: The corporation, upon or with the lands of others, was to carry on a business for profit, it being agreed that a part of the income\u2014five per cent\u2014should be retained by the corporation and that the balance, after deducting all necessary and proper expenses, should be distributed to the land owners. Though the case differs in its outward form from that of a corporation engaged in extracting wealth from its own land, selling the produce and dividing the net profits among its stockholders in the shape of dividends, still, in the essentials, there is no material difference between this case and that of a corporation so engaged in exploiting its own land. The difference is in the bark, not in the pith.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Appellants say that the contract between the corporation and Mrs. Lake was nothing but a contract of agency to look after the land and collect the profits. The rights and powers of the corporation were much greater than those of a mere agent to look after land and collect profits. Evidently the corporation and not the certificate holder was to furnish whatever capital might be necessary to carry on the venture, for Mrs. Lake did not obligate herself to furnish any capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>to be used in managing or leasing the land or in extracting wealth therefrom. It doubtless was expected by Mrs. Lake and by any other grantees of the land units that the sums which they paid to their grantor upon receiving their respective deeds would be used by the corporation in leasing or \u201cmanaging\u201d the land or in exploiting it. But aside from those moneys\u2014moneys which, when paid to it, belonged to the corporation\u2014there is nothing to indicate that Mrs. Lake or any of the land owners had agreed ever to advance any money or to make any payment other than the initial payments made at the time of the execution of the deeds and the issuance of the certificates. The corporation, and not the certificate holders, was to make all contracts, manage, care for, rent, and lease the land and receive all the income. The certificate holders were to have no say in the matter. There was expressly reserved to the corporation the exclusive right to make all agreements for increasing and protecting the income from the land. Until the <em>net </em>profits were distributed to the certificate holders the title to the gross income was not in the owners of the land units, but in the corporation, which was to furnish whatever capital might be necessary to carry on the business of managing or leasing the land. Prom all this it is manifest that in all of the <em>essentials </em>Mrs. Lake\u2019s relation to the E. E. MeCalla Company was similar to that of a stockholder to a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The case falls within the letter and the spirit of the act, and it would be a reproach to the administration of the law if the perpetrators of such a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the manifest purpose of this salutary legislation should go unwhipped of justice. Appellants seem to place some reliance upon the decision of this court in <em>Ex parte Lamb, </em>61 Cal. App. 321 [215 Pac. 109]. Between. that case and this there is no resemblance whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The trial court, as we have stated, charged the jury ' that the certificate which appellants caused to be issued to Mrs. Lake is a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Act, and refused to give an abstract definition ' of the word \u201csecurity\u201d in the language of the statute. This was the proper course to pursue. Whether the certificate constituted a \u201csecurity\u201d under the conceded facts of the case was a question of law for the court and did not involve any question of fact whatever. The requested instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>would have'left it to the jury to determine as a question of fact what the court rightfully disposed of as a question of laAV for its sole determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> As has been pointed out, an offer was made by the appellant E. E. McCalla to sIioav that when he issued the certificate to Mrs. Lake he was acting in good faith, relying upon the advice of counsel that the instrument was not a \u201csecurity\u201d Avithin the meaning of the act; but he was refused permission to present such evidence to the jury. The section of the act under which McCalla was prosecuted, section 14, declares that every person who \u201cknoAvingly\u201d issues or sells or aids in the issue or sale of any security without a permit from the corporation commissioner is guilty of the offense denounced by the statute. Because the statute uses the Avord \u201cknoAvingly,\u201d it is claimed that if there be no specific evil intent to violate the act the issue or sale of the security is not within the penal clause of the statute. Wherefore it is argued that good faith, based on advice received from counsel, should be considered as a factor in the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt. There is no force in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> The term \u201cknowingly\u201d means \u201cwith knowledge,\u201d and when used in a prohibitory statute is usually^/ held to refer to a knowledge of the essential <em>facts; </em>and from such lcnoAvledgo of the facts the law presumes a knowledge of the legal consequences arising from the performance of the prohibited act. According to the express definition of the Avord, as given by our Penal Code,. ^knowingly\"\u201d' imports \u2018 only a knowledge that the facts exist which bring the act or omission Avithin the provisions of this code. It does not require any knowledge of the unlawfulness of such act or omission.\u201d (Pen. Code, sec. 7, subd. 5.) Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, 75 </em>Cal. 627 [17 Pac. 646], it Avas held that the defendant, charged Avith having refused, as election inspec-' tor, to administer the oath to an elector whose right to vote AA'as challenged, Avas presumed, at his peril, to ltnoAV what the laAV was. Mor does the word \u2018Willfully,\u201d as defined by the code, import any intent to violate the lavv. When applied to the intent Avith AA'hich an act is done or omitted, \u2018Willfully,\u201d according to the code definition, \u201cimplies simply a purpose or Avillingness to commit the act, or make the omission referred to. It does not require any intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u201d (Pen. Code, sec. 7, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">It has been held that one who marries a second time under an honest but erroneous belief that a decree of divorce which had been granted was valid is afforded no protection by the invalid decree, and that evidence of his good faith will be excluded. The same principle is applied to many cases, such as selling intoxicating liquors to minors, abductitig girls under a certain age, usurping an office under the belief that the usurper was truly elected, illegal voting under the belief that the voter is a qualified elector, publishing a libel in ignorance of its contents, storing gunpowder, and the like. <em>(People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>96 Cal. 178 [31 Pac. 45]. See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, supra, </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>130 Cal. 487 [62 Pac. 823].)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> When the intent is not made an affirmative element of the crime the law imputes that the act done knowingly was done with criminal intent. Or, to state the same proposition in a different form, when the statute plainly forbids an act, and the forbidden act is done by the accused, the law implies conclusively the guilty intent, although the offender was honestly mistaken as to the meaning of the law he violates. Here the penal clause under which McCalla was convicted does not make an unlawful or evil intent a specific element of the crime. The statute clearly forbids the acts denounced by it, and its language is plain and positive. Innocence of any intent to violate the terms of the statute is, therefore, no excuse for its violation where the defendant does the prohibited act with a knowledge of the <em>facts </em>which bring his act within the provisions of the statute. For the effective protection of the public, the burden is placed upon the individual to ascertain at his peril whether his act is prohibited by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">v In <em>People v. O\u2019Brien, supra, </em>the defendant altered a public record, apparently to make it speak the truth. In any event, . it was admitted by the attorney-general that the evidence failed to show any fraudulent intent on the part of the defendant. The court held that inasmuch as the section defining the crime there in question did not make the intent with, which \"the act was done an essential element of the crime, it was not necessary to show that the defendant had acted with such intent. In that case the question is elaborately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>discussed, and a number of cases are cited. The conclusion of the court on this point, as stated in the syllabus, is: \u201cIt is not necessary, in making out the offense of altering a public record, to prove any fraudulent intention upon the part of the defendant; nor is ignorance of the law and innocence of any intent to violate its terms any excuse for a violation thereof. When an act in general terms is made indictable, a criminal intent need not be shown, unless from the language or effects of the law a purpose to require the existence of such intent can be discovered.\u201d The court also quotes with approval the following language from <em>State </em>v. <em>McBrayer, </em>98 N. C. 623 [2 S. E. 756]: \u201cIt is a mistaken notion that positive, willful intent to violate the criminal law is an essential ingredient in every criminal offense, and that where there is an absence of such intent there is no offense; this is especially so as to statutory offenses. When the statute plainly forbids an act to be done, and it is done by son^g person, the law implies conclusively the guilty intent, although the offender was honestly mistaken as to the meaning of the law he violates. When the language is plain and positive, and the offense is not made to depend upon the positive, willful intent and purpose, nothing is left to interpretation. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Tested by the foregoing it must be held that the court\u2019s refusal to permit MeCalla to show that he acted on the advice of counsel was right and proper. He possessed knowledge of all the <em>facts </em>which brought his act\u2014the issuance of the certificate to Mrs. Lake\u2014within the penal provisions of the statute. As we have pointed out, it was admitted at the trial that the E. E. MeCalla Company is a California corporation, that it never received any permit from the corporation commissioner and that E. E. MeCalla, who was its president, knew that no permit to sell or issue securities had been granted to his corporation, but that nevertheless he, as president of the company, issued the certificate to Mrs.'. Lake. These facts being admitted, there was left but one question in the ease, and that a question of law, pure and simple, namely: Is the certificate issued to Mrs. Lake a \u201c security,\u201d as that term is defined by the act?</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">If the advice of counsel could afford immunity to one accused of the violation of a penal statute it would result in the advice of an attorney being paramount to the law. \u201cIgnorance of the law,\u201d says the Rhode Island supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>22 R. I. 163 [50 L. R. A. 339, 46 Atl. 833], \"will not excuse its violation, even when one endeavors to ascertain the law and is misled by the advice of counsel.\u201d In that case it was held that a violation of a statute against engaging without a license in the temporary or transient sale of goods is not excused by advice of a state official to the effect that the law did not apply to the person who is charged with its violation, and who was not misled as to the facts but only as to the law. See, also, 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, 11th ed., sec. 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The instruction to the effect that both the corporation and McCalla are <em>conclusively </em>presumed to know whether a permit had been issued or not could not possibly have injured appellants. The conceded facts established beyond peradveniure that the corporation and its president did know that the corporation commissioner had issued no permit to sell ^r otherwise dispose of any of the company\u2019s securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Finally, it is contended that the E. E. McCalla Company was not given a preliminary hearing before the committing magistrate and that therefore the order holding it to answer was void and afforded no foundation for the filing of an information against the corporation. To say that the proceedings in this case bristle with anomalies is putting it mildly. Not only was the corporation not given a preliminary hearing before the committing magistrate, but it was not even named as a defendant in the complaint lodged with that officer. No summons was issued by the magistrate requiring the corporation to appear before him\u2014a procedure provided for by sections 1390 et seq. of the Penal Code. No appearance, voluntary or involuntary, was made by the corporation before the committing magistrate. It was not until the trial was commenced in the superior court that the corporation made any appearance in the case. At the commencement of the trial in the latter court the corporation, for the first time, appeared and by its attorney moved that as to it the first count in the information be set aside on the ground that it had not had a preliminary examination before a committing magistrate as required by law. The motion was denied and thereupon the trial proceeded before the jury without even the entry of a plea by or on behalf of the corporation, though all parties evidently assumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d had been formally entered and the ease seems to have been tried with that understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">That these gross irregularities and unpardonably loose methods of procedure would unquestionably have necessitated a reversal as to the corporation had this appeal come before this court prior to the adoption of section 4% of article VI of the constitution is a proposition fully borne out by such authorities as <em>Western Meat Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>9 Cal. App. 538 [99 Pac. 976], <em>People </em>v. <em>Western Meat Co., </em>13 Cal. App. 539 [110 Pac. 338], <em>People </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>28 Cal. 328, <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>52 Cal. 479, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Monaghan, </em>102 Cal. 229 [36 Pac. 511]. But since section 4% was added to article VI, the organic law of this state has declared, in terms not to be mistaken, that no judgment shall be set aside or new trial granted, in any case, for error as to <em>any </em>matter of procedure, unless after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The scope of this provision is very broad and sweeping. It does not pretend to describe specifically the character of the errors coming within its pui-view. Nor does it purport to limit the right of the court to determine and say that any error, whatever its nature, has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Since its adoption not every invasion of even a constitutional right will necessarily require a reversal. The mere fact that the assignment of error is based upon a provision of the constitution is not conclusive. <em>(People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bryan, </em>165 Cal. 66 [130 Pac. 1042].) The appellate court is not to determine, as an original inquiry, the question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. <bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> But when he has been found guilty that court, upon a review of the entire record, must determine whether in its judgment an error committed in the trial court has led to the verdict. If it appear, to the satisfaction of the court reviewing the judgment, that the result is just and that it would have been reached if the error had not been committed, a new trial is not to be ordered. <em>(People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bryan, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Here the district attorney filed an information based upon what purports to be a commitment holding the corporation to answer. The information alleges facts which show that the E. E. McCalla Company committed one of the offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>denounced by the Corporate Securities Act. The company appeared by counsel in the superior court and was there ably, if unsuccessfully, defended. The trial went on without any objection from the corporation other than that'it had not had a preliminary examination before a committing magistrate prior to the filing of the information in the superior court. In the latter court the corporation secured all the benefit of a formal plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d and had every advantage that it would have had if it had been given a preliminary hearing prior to the order holding it to answer. Indeed, no fair-minded person could read the record before us without reaching the conclusion that the evidence shows beyond all shadow of doubt that the corporation was guilty of the offense described in count one of the information\u2014\u25a0 the count upon which it was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> The verdict was just, and we fail to see how a different result could have been reached had the commitment upon which the information was based been made only after the corporation had been given a preliminary hearing before a magistrate and a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d had been formally made by it in the superior court. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomsky, </em>20 Cal. App. 672 [130 Pac. 184], where it was held that section 4% is applicable, even though no plea to the information be made by or on behalf of the defendant. Our conclusion, after a careful examination of the entire record, is that the irregularities complained of have not resulted in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d and that section 4% could not be applied with more propriety than in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The appeal from the order denying the motion in arrest of judgment is dismissed.
