EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Two employees in the Montgomery County merit system filed grievances against the County. The Montgomery County Merit System Protection Board (the Board) dismissed the grievances, but they were reinstated on judicial review. The question presented by this appeal is whether the Board, on remand after judicial review of its prior decision, has legislative authority to award attorney\u2019s fees to employees with respect to services rendered during judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Gregory Jamsa and Wayne D. Fisher, appellees, are firefighters employed by Montgomery County, appellant. Appellees are members of a union and subject to a collective bargaining agreement between the union and appellant: In 1997, appellees were directed by a supervisor to cut grass and perform other lawn maintenance activities. Appellees filed grievances pursuant to the merit system grievance procedure on the ground that the assigned activities were \"not within their duties and responsibilities. Appellant, through its Office of Human Resources, determined that the complaints were not grievable. Appellees noted an appeal to the Board. The Board held that the complaints were grievable, but on motion for reconsideration by appellant, reversed itself and held that they were not grievable.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Appellees filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, and appellees noted an appeal to this Court. In an unreported opinion, this Court reversed the circuit court and the Board, held that the complaints were grievable, and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings. <em>Jamsa v. Montgomery County, </em>No. 1547, Sept. Term 1998, 129 Md.App. 710 (filed November 16, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The Board, in turn, remanded the case to appellant\u2019s Office of Human Resources. After appellant denied appellee\u2019s grievances, appellees again appealed to the Board. By decision and order dated May 29, 2002, the Board dismissed the appeal on the ground that the assignment of lawn maintenance activities was not unlawful or otherwise improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Appellees requested the Board to (1) reconsider its decision on the merits and (2) award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees with respect to their successful appeal of the Board\u2019s first decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">By decision and order dated June 17, 2002, the Board denied appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration with respect to the merits but granted the motion with respect to fees and requested appellees to submit a detailed statement. The decision further stated that the Board would consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>request for fees in accordance with the factors contained in Montgomery County Code, section 33\u201414(c)(9).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On June 27, 2002, appellees submitted a request for fees in the amount of $20,740.00 and expenses in the amount of $297.39. The amount of the fee was based on 103.7 hours at an hourly rate of $200. The request was for services rendered in the filing of the complaints, the activities in circuit court and this Court, and in preparing the motion for reconsideration before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">By decision and order dated July 31, 2002, the Board awarded $3225.00 in fees and $70.86 in expenses. The fee award was based on 16.5 hours relating to filing the grievance and pursuing the appeal to the Board and 5.25 hours relating to the motion for reconsideration. The Board allowed an hourly rate of $150.00. The Board denied appellees\u2019 request for fees with respect to activities in circuit court and this Court on the ground that it lacked authority to award fees relating to services rendered on judicial review, relying on section 33\u201415(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Appellees filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. By order dated February 27, 2003, the circuit court reversed the Board, held that the Board did have legislative authority to award fees for services relating to judicial review and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The sole question before us is whether the Board has legislative authority, pursuant to the provisions of the Montgomery County Code, to award attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered in connection with judicial review of Board decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In reviewing an agency decision, we apply separate standards for questions of law and questions of fact. <em>See Hikmat v. Howard County, </em>148 Md.App. 502, 521, 813 A.2d 306 (2002) (quoting <em>Stover v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>132 Md.App. 373, 380-81, 752 A.2d 686 (2000) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 783 A.2d 169 (2001), the Court stated the appellate court\u2019s role in reviewing the decision of an administrative agency interpreting law. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 783 A.2d 169. Quoting Judge Eldridge in <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376 (1999), the <em>Marzullo </em>decision reiterated the narrow role of the appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow and is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\"><em>Marzullo, </em>366 Md. at 171, 783 A.2d 169 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 172, 783 A.2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Pure questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>See Lucas v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>147 Md.App. 209, 225, 807 A.2d 1176 (2002) (citations omitted); <em>see also Eastern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>128 Md.App. 494, 516, 789 A.2d 854 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In reviewing questions of fact, the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test applies. <em>Baltimore Lutheran High School Ass\u2019n. v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701 (citing <em>State Ins. Comm\u2019r v. National Bureau of Casualty Underwtrs., </em>248 Md. 292, 309-310, 236 A.2d 282 (1967)). This test asks whether reasoning minds could reach the same conclusion based on the facts presented to the agency. <em>Montgomery County Dept. Health &amp; Human Servs. v. P.F., </em>137 Md.App. 243, 264-65, 768 A.2d 112 (2001) (citing <em>Mayberry v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>131 Md.App. 686, 700-701, 750 A.2d 677 (2000)). If the agency\u2019s decision is reasonably supported by the facts, the reviewing courts must uphold the decision even if it might have drawn different inferences based on those facts or reached a different conclusion. <em>Mayberry, </em>131 Md.App. at 701, 750 A.2d 677 (citing <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 515-516, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The Montgomery County Charter states that the County Council shall prescribe by law a merit system for County employees. Section 401. The Charter also established the Board, section 403, and set forth the duties of the Board. Section 404. The County Council implemented the Charter provisions in chapter 33 of the County Code. The County\u2019s chief administrative officer is responsible for administering and enforcing the merit system. Section 83-8. The Board is given remedial and enforcement powers to protect the merit system and employee rights under the system. Section 33-7(a). The Code provisions in question are section 33-14, entitled \u201cHearing authority of board,\u201d and section 33-15, entitled \u201cJudicial review and enforcement.\u201d Section 33-14(c) provides that the Board \u201cshall have authority to order appropriate relief to accomplish the remedial objectives of this article, including but not limited to the following: .... (9) order the county to reimburse or pay all or part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>employee\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Subsection (9) also contains factors to consider in determining the reasonableness of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Section 33-15(a) provides that an aggrieved party may seek judicial review in circuit court. Subsection (b) provides that judicial review is pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code, article 41, section 255, and includes \u201cappellate review by the special courts of appeals of Maryland.\u201d Subsection (c) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">When the chief administrative officer is the party seeking judicial review of a board order or decision in favor of a merit system employee, the county shall be responsible for the employee\u2019s legal expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees which result from the judicial review and are determined by the county to be reasonable under the criteria set forth in subsection (c)(9) of section 33-14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Employing rules of statutory construction and legislative history, appellant contends that section 33-14 only applies to administrative proceedings and does not authorize the award of fees in connection with judicial review. According to appellant, section 33-15 governs judicial review, and it provides for attorney\u2019s fees only if the County, not the employee, seeks judicial review. Consequently, the Board did not have legislative authority to award attorney\u2019s fees incurred when appellees pursued judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Also employing rules of statutory construction, appellees assert that section 33-14(c)(9) controls and gives the Board broad authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We shall begin our analysis by summarizing the rules of statutory construction, recognizing that they are aids to assist us in determining legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">When seeking to ascertain the meaning of a statute, the Court of Appeals has stated that \u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 175, 783 A.2d 169 (2001) (citations omitted). The actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>language of the statute itself is the starting point for interpreting a statute. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cWhere the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts normally do not look beyond the words of the statute to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cBut where the statutory language is ambiguous, we will look to other sources, such as relevant case law and legislative history, to aid us in determining the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In such instances where a court seeks to ascertain the legislative intent, the statutory language \u201cis not read in isolation, but \u2018in light of the full context in which [it] appears, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175-76, 788 A.2d 169 (citations omitted). \u201cTo this end, when we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 783 A.2d 169 (citations omitted). Often a court may consider external evidence, in addition to the relevant statutory provisions, such as the legislative history surrounding the statute, the context of the statute and \u201cother material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of [the] legislative purpose or goal\u201d of the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The language of the relevant statutory provisions, their context, and their purpose lead us to the conclusion that the Board does have legislative authority to award attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on judicial review of Board decisions, in appropriate circumstances. Section 33-14(c)(9) authorizes the Board to order the County to pay \u201call or part\u201d of the employee\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The authority granted to the Board is not limited to the initial hearing before the Board. It applies to all hearings, which would include hearings on remand after judicial review. The County Council did not mandate that the Board award attorney\u2019s fees; it authorized the Board to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Section 33-15(c), on the other hand, is not directed to the Board but directs the County to pay attorney\u2019s fees (\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>county shall be responsible\u201d), determined by the County to be reasonable, when the County is the party seeking judicial review. Section 33-15 is not a limitation on the Board\u2019s authority. The net effect is that the Board has discretion, generally, to award attorney\u2019s fees, including when an employee seeks judicial review, but when the County seeks judicial review, the County must pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Appellant argues that the legislative history of the' merit system law supports its interpretation. We disagree. The Code sections in question were enacted through Council Bill 36-78, introduced July 18, 1978. First, appellant relies on a memorandum dated September 21, 1978 from the Montgomery County Government Employees Organization (\u201cOrganization\u201d) to the County Council. Appellant advises that the Organization suggested the inclusion of section 33-15(c). Appellant relies on the following quote from the document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7H\">An employee who \u201cwins\u201d a case before the County Government\u2019s Personnel Board only to have this decision be appealed by the County government to the courts must be prepared to spend two years\u2019 average gross County salary to defend him/her self, even when he/she may be without a job and unable to get one. This is the equivalent of no redress and no employee rights at all. The Personnel Board itself rightly asks: \u201cWhy have a Personnel Board at all to consider grievances?\u201d The County Government, under a recent court ruling, cannot appeal the findings of its own instrumentality under the present County Charter and County Code. The Bill will change all that, and will also abolish the Merit System unless an amendment similar to the one we offered is included.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We fail to see the support for appellant\u2019s position. The general thrust of the memorandum is the asserted failure of the Board in the past and the need to strengthen it. The Organization\u2019s support of a provision requiring the County to pay an employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees when challenging a decision of the Board was perceived as providing some protection for employee\u2019s rights and strengthening the Board to protect those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Appellant also refers to a memorandum dated November 14, 1978 from legislative counsel to the County Council enclosing the revised Council Bill 36-78 for final action. Appellant quotes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">Judicial review provision provides that all parties before the Board may obtain judicial review on the record, subject to the standards of administrative law with a proviso that the County must provide for employee legal expenses if the CAO [chief administrative officer] seeks judicial review of a Board decision in favor of the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Appellant does not refer to the paragraph immediately preceding the one quoted. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">The hearing requirements of the Board require compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and to provide for Board counsel and the Board has been authorized to award attorneys\u2019 fees in addition to its other remedial powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A__\">These paragraphs are entirely consistent with our reading of the statutory language, as explained above.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">As did the circuit court, we perceive the issue in question as a pure question of law. For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">. The Montgomery County Charter directs the County Council to create a merit system for County employees. Montgomery County Code, chapter 33 implements that directive. Section 33-14 deals with the authority of the Board and will be discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\">.
