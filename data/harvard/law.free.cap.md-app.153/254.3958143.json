BLOOM, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Adu\">Retired, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">This appeal is from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Washington County that affirmed a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the Commission) denying appellant, Charles N. Jones, temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On 29 May 1979 and on 3 April 1984, appellant sustained compensable accidental injuries while in the employ of Potomac Edison Company, appellee. As a result of those injuries, he received a sixty-percent permanent partial disability award by the Commission on 27 July 1989. The last payment under that award was made on 28 June 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">On 6 October 1997, appellant underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. Appellee authorized and paid the medical expenses associated with appellant\u2019s rotator cuff surgery. As a result of the surgery, appellant was absent from his employment from the 6th to the 31st of October 1997. Appellee paid appellant sick leave for that time period, but no workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid in connection with that operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On 21 October 2001, appellant filed issues with the Commission, seeking temporary total disability for the October 1997 absence from work. The Commission denied those benefits as being time barred by \u00a7 9-736 of the Labor and Employment Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Appellant filed an appeal to the Circuit Court for Washington County. By order dated 15 July 2002, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The sole issue presented by appellant is whether the circuit court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s petition to re-open the 27 July 1989 award of compensation was barred by the five year statute of limitations provided by \u00a7 9-736 of the Labor and Employment Article. Finding no error, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Section 9-736 of the Labor and Employment Article provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">(a) <em>Readjustment of rate of </em>compensation.\u2014If aggravation, diminution, or termination of disability takes place or is discovered after the rate of compensation is set or compensation is terminated, the Commission, on the application of any party in interest or on its own motion, may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">(1) readjust for future application the rate of compensation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(2) if appropriate, terminate the payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">(b) <em>Continuing powers and jurisdiction; </em>modification.\u2014(1) The Commission has continuing powers and jurisdiction over each claim under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">(2) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Commission may modify any finding or order as the Commission considers justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">(3) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission may not modify an award unless the modification is applied for within 5 years after the last compensation payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Appellant contends that the sick leave benefits he received should be considered as \u201ccompensation\u201d that tolled the five year statute of limitations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\u201cCompensation\u201d is defined in \u00a7 9-101(e) of the Labor and Employment Article as \u201cthe money payable under this title to a covered employee or the dependents of a covered employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wages paid as sick leave benefits are not \u201cmoney payable under this title.\u201d Sick leave payments result from employment contracts, express or implied, and are based on past service. Sick leave benefits have little, if anything, to do with whether there has been an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201caccidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment,\u201d a claimant\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage,\u201d the percentage or permanency of the disability suffered, or other concepts associated with workers\u2019 compensation. <em>See generally, </em>Md.Code (1991,1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-501, 9-602, and 9-614 to 637 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">As the parties recognize, this is not the first time the issue of sick leave payments has been before us.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, there has never been a reported opinion resolving this issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Appellant correctly points out in his brief that, under Maryland Rule 8-114, our unreported opinion in <em>McCormick &amp; Company v. Paolino, </em>No. 833, September Term, 1987, 74 Md.App. 733 (filed February 18, 1988) \u201cis neither precedent within the rule of stare decisis nor persuasive authority.\u201d Accordingly, we decline appellee\u2019s invitation to \u201caffirm\u201d our holding in <em>Paolino.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We do, however, reach a similar conclusion in the instant case. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that \u201che had no reason to request the payment of temporary total benefits\u201d because the sick leave benefits he received were for the surgery that was necessitated by his prior compensable injuries. The payment of sick leave benefits to appellant does not qualify as \u201ccompensation\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and, therefore, did not toll the running of the five year limitations period set forth in \u00a7 9-736.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-13\">. Both parties concede, as they must, that medical benefits are not payment of compensation under the Labor and Employment Article. See <em>Holy Cross Hospital of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Nichols, </em>290 Md. 149, 428 A.2d 447 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">. In 1988, we addressed this issue in an unreported opinion in <em>McCormick &amp; Company v. Paolino, </em>No. 833, Sept. Term 1987, 74 Md.App. 733 (filed February 18, 1988). In that case, Paolino injured her back while working for McCormick &amp; Company. She was awarded permanent partial disability payments for 125 weeks, and her last payment of that compensation was made on or about December 1, 1978. Thereafter, the Commission entered an order as to payment of subsequent medical expenses and with respect to vocational rehabilitation, but made no further awards of monetary compensation. Although Paolino remained in McCormick\u2019s employ for some time, she was unable to work every day. McCormick continued to pay her regular wages pursuant to a company policy Under which it continued tire pay of an employee who, for any reason, was unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In February 1985, Paolino had an operation that she claimed was required due to the worsening of her back problem. She sought temporary total disability for that period of hospitalization. Although the Commission found that limitations was not a bar, it rejected Paolino\u2019s claim. It also held open any further claim as to permanent partial disability. Paolino appealed from the denial of the temporary total disability award and McCormick purported to cross appeal from the ruling on limitations. The circuit court granted partial summary judgment for Paolino on the limitations question, but affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision to deny temporary total disability. The circuit court entered judgment for McCormick.</p>\n<p id=\"AEu\">McCormick then appealed to this Court on the sole issue of limitations. McCormick argued that the passage of five years since Paolino\u2019s last compensation' payment barred her attempt to reopen her case. In our unreported opinion, we held that McCormick\u2019s voluntary payment of full salary to Paolino was not compensation. We held, therefore, that the passage of five years since the last payment of true compensation barred Paolino\u2019s claim for temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The Court of Appeals granted Paolino\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, but was unable to address the compensation issue because it found that McCormick lacked the ability to appeal the circuit court decision to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Paolino v. McCormick &amp; Company, </em>314 Md. 575, 552 A.2d 868 (1989).' As a result, the issue of whether McCor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>mick's payment to Paolino was compensation was never addressed in a reported opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
