Rehn broke his hip when he slipped on spilled soda near the service counter of the Chick-fil-A located in the Annapolis Mall food court. Westfield was responsible for maintaining the area where Rehn fell, and contracted with ICC for those maintenance services.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Rehn presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">I. Did the circuit court err in determining that Chick-filA did not have a duty to clean up or warn Rehn about the spill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">II. Did the circuit court err in determining that none of the defendants breached their duties of care to Rehn?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">We agree that there was no material factual dispute on the second question of whether these defendants breached their duties to Rehn. Consequently, we shall affirm the judgments without addressing the first duty issue with respect to Chickfil-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">All three defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of undisputed facts that came out during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">On May 8, 1999, Henry Rehn and a friend went to the Annapolis Mall. At approximately 10:30 a.m., they decided to get something to eat at Chick-fil-A. They walked through the food court to Chick-fil-A, where Rehn purchased a sandwich and a drink at the counter. Rehn then \u201ctook a small step and slipped\u201d on soda and ice that a Chick-fil-A customer had just spilled. The wet floor was not marked and Rehn did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>see the spill before he fell. Rehn\u2019s right hip fractured, requiring surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Chick-f\u00edl-A employee Theresa DeChamps, who had been employed for seven and a half years at this location, was working the counter that morning. At her deposition, she testified that when there was a spill on the floor outside the counter area, the Chick-fil-A employees routinely called customer service at Westfield, and \u201cthey would in turn call [ICC] maintenance\u201d on their beepers. It was her understanding that spills \u201con the other side of the counter, that was not our responsibility.\u201d ICC maintenance workers were the ones who \u201cusually\u201d put up yellow warning signs \u201cwhen there\u2019s a spill.\u201d DeChamps also related what happened before Rehn\u2019s fall. She had just waited on a customer who had carried her takeout order, including three or four Cokes in a cup carrier, away from the counter. The customer headed for the food court exit, and DeChamps began to do something else. Shortly after leaving the counter, the customer apparently spilled her drinks. DeChamps did not see the spill occur. But the customer came back to the counter and told DeChamps, \u201c T spilled my drinks[.]\u2019 \u201d DeChamps looked out and saw a large brown spill not far from the service count\u00e9r.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">DeChamps explained that she immediately told another employee to notify Westfield of the spill.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">DeChamps: So I, in the process, turned around. My station is right there by where the swinging door is, and I believe there was one other person out in, [sic] behind the registers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">And, our rule is not to leave anyone out there by themselves, so I opened the door, hollered back there, \u201cSomeone call for a spill,\u201d and just as I said that, I said, \u201cAlso call security,\u201d and they said, \u201cWhy?\u201d I said, \u201cCause someone has fallen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Q: Did you see the gentleman fall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">A: No, I did not....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Q: So you didn\u2019t see the spill and you didn\u2019t see the fall, but you saw everything before and after each event, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">DeChamps was questioned also about a statement she gave to an investigator. The statement said: \u201cAccording to Ms. DeChamps, she did not have an opportunity to call maintenance and the spill was on the floor surface for less than four minutes.\u201d When asked whether she \u201cagreefd] that the spill was on the floor surface for less than four minutesL,]\u201d DeChamps replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The lease between Chick-fil-A provided that Westfield would maintain the area of the food park where Rehn fell. Westfield hired ICC to perform its maintenance duties. When Chick-fil-A received information about a spill, it contacted Westfield, who in turn radioed ICC employees stationed in the food park area to clean it up and place \u201cwet floor\u201d warning stanchions over the wet floor. ICC employees also patrolled the food court and cleaned up spills that they found or were notified about. Although an ICC worker was on duty in the food court area when the spill and fall occurred, there was no evidence that he saw the wet floor on which Rehn fell. An ICC employee testified in deposition that yellow \u201cwet floor\u201d stanchions are placed around the food park trash cans for anyone to put out when needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">All three defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of this evidence. Westfield and ICC asserted <em>inter alia </em>that they did not breach their respective duties to Rehn because neither had actual notice of the spill and the spill had not been on the floor long enough that they reasonably could have been expected to discover it in the course of patrolling the food court area. Chick-fil-A argued that even though it had notice of the spill, it had no duty to clean it up and, in any event, it did not have enough time to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In a written opinion and order, the circuit court noted DeChamps\u2019 undisputed testimony that as soon as the customer reported the spill, she \u201cturned around to face a door behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>her in the back of the business, calling to another employee to notify the mall customer service about the spill with the understanding that they would alert the cleaning crew assigned to that area.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cChick-fil-A did not have a duty to maintain the food court area and owed no duty to [Rehn] under these circumstances.\u201d In addition, the court held that none of the defendants had breached their duties to Rehn. Rehn noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we evaluate \u2018the same material from the record and decide[ ] the same legal issues as the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berringer v. Steele, </em>133 Md.App. 442, 470, 758 A.2d 574 (2000) (citations omitted). A party opposing summary judgment must offer admissible evidence to show that there is a dispute of material fact justifying denial of the motion. <em>See Tennant v. Shoppers Food Warehouse Md. Corp., </em>115 Md.App. 381, 386, 693 A.2d 370 (1997). \u201cA party cannot establish the existence of a dispute merely by making formal denials or general allegations of disputed facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 693 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Here, we ask whether the circuit court correctly concluded that the summary judgment record established that none of these three defendants breached their respective duties of care to Rehn.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">In Maryland, it is well-established premises liability law that the duty of care that is owed by the owner of property to one who enters on the property depends upon the entrant\u2019s legal status. Ordinarily, one entering onto the property of another will occupy the status of invitee, licensee by invitation, bare licensee, or trespasser. \u201cAn invitee is a person \u2018on the property for a purpose related to the possessor\u2019s business.\u2019 \u201d He is owed a duty of ordinary care to keep the property safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>Rivas v. Oxon Hill Joint Venture, </em>130 Md.App. 101, 109, 744 A.2d 1076, <em>cert. denied, </em>358 Md. 610, 751 A.2d 471 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Nevertheless, \u201c[storekeepers are not insurers of their customers\u2019 safety, and no presumption of negligence arises merely because an injury was sustained on a storekeeper\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>334 Md. 633, 636, 640 A.2d 1134 (1994). \u201cThe burden is upon the customer to show that the proprietor ... had actual or constructive knowledge\u201d that the dangerous condition existed. <em>Moulden v. Greenbelt Consumer Servs., Inc., </em>239 Md. 229, 232, 210 A.2d 724 (1965); <em>see Tennant, </em>115 Md.App. at 389, 693 A.2d 370. When another patron creates the danger, the proprietor may be liable if it has actual notice and sufficient opportunity to either correct the problem or warn its other customers about it. <em>See Rawls v. Hochschild, Kohn &amp; Co., </em>207 Md. 113, 117-18, 113 A.2d 405 (1955); <em>Tennant, </em>115 Md.App. at 389, 693 A.2d 370. The evidence must show not only that a dangerous condition existed, but also that the proprietor \u201chad actual or constructive knowledge of it, and that that knowledge was gained in sufficient time to give the owner the opportunity to remove it or to warn the invitee.\u201d <em>Keene v. Arlan\u2019s Dep\u2019t Store of Baltimore, Inc., </em>35 Md.App. 250, 256, 370 A.2d 124 (1977). Whether there has been sufficient time for a business proprietor to discover, cure, or clean up a dangerous condition depends on the circumstances surrounding the fall. <em>See Deering Woods Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Spoon, </em>377 Md. 250, 833 A.2d 17, 2003 Md. LEXIS 691, *18 (filed Oct. 6, 2003). \u201c \u2018What will amount to sufficient time depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and involves consideration of the nature of the danger, the number of persons likely to be affected by it, the diligence required to discover or prevent it, opportunities and means of knowledge, the foresight which a person of ordinary care and prudence would be expected to exercise under the circumstances, and the foreseeable consequences of the conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Moore v. Am. Stores Co., </em>169 Md. 541, 551, 182 A. 436 (1936)).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Chick-fil-A</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The court concluded that Chick-fil-A did not breach any duty that it may have had to keep the area outside its service counter safe for its customers, or to warn them of dangerous conditions there, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">the length of time that elapsed between the creation of the condition (the spilled soda) and the discovery of that condition by those owing a duty to [Rehn] was a matter of moments. The exact time is unknown, but it appears from the testimony of Theresa DeChamps (and from the proximity of the spill to the restaurant counter) that the spill occurred just after the soda\u2019s purchase, and the customer causing the spill was able to alert Ms. DeChamps soon after. [Rehn\u2019s] encounter with the spill immediately followed. During her deposition, Ms. DeChamps affirmed that the spill was on the floor for \u201cless than four minutes.\u201d How much less? By Ms. DeChamps\u2019 description, it may be inferred that the time elapsed even could be better measured in seconds....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">In this case, the soda was not on the floor long enough for Chick-fll-A\u2019s employees to find it and take action to prevent it fl\u2019om causing an accident; it was there only momentarily. When Chick-fll-A\u2019s employees discovered the spill, steps were taken promptly to correct the problem; [Rehn] encountered it almost simultaneously with those efforts. Therefore, this court finds that no reasonable fact finder could determine, on these undisputed material facts, that Defendant Chick-fll-A\u2019s agents were not exercising reasonable care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In its brief, Rehn argues that \u201c[s]ince Ms. DeChamps was aware of the spill prior to Mr. Rehn\u2019s fall, a jury would find that Chick-fil-A had actual notice of the dangerous condition prior to the accident.\u201d We agree that Chick-fil-A had actual notice. But such notice, by itself, did not preclude summary judgment, because the dispositive issue here was not whether Chick-fil-A\u2019s employee knew about the spill, but rather, how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>long she knew about it before she did something about it; In practical terms, did DeChamps have enough time after she learned about the spill to do something that ultimately might have prevented Rehn\u2019s fall?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We agree with the circuit court that there is no evidence in the summary judgment record from which a jury reasonably could infer that she had enough time to do so. DeChamps\u2019 testimony was undisputed that as soon as the customer pointed out the spill, she looked out and saw it for the first time, then \u201copened the door\u201d next to her station and \u201chollered back there, \u2018Someone call for a spillf.]\u2019 \u201d It was while she was \u201cin the act\u201d of notifying her co-worker that Rehiii fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Rehn argues that DeChamps or any other Chick-fil-A employee could and should have taken other steps to prevent the accident, including putting out a \u201cwet floor\u201d stanchion or guarding the spill until someone cleaned it up. The argument does not address the central reason underlying the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment\u2014that there was not enough time to do those things. Rehn\u2019s silence on this critical factual question does not distract us from this dispositive issue. We see nothing in the summary judgment record from which a juror reasonably could infer that Chick-fil-A acted unreasonably when it learned about the spill.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">First, we do not read DeChamps\u2019 affirmation that the spill was on the floor for \u201cless than four minutes\u201d as evidence generating a material dispute as to whether there was enough time to clean up or warn Rehn about the spill. This time frame originated from an investigator\u2019s summary of DeChamps\u2019 statement long after the accident. In her deposition testimony, DeChamps confirmed only that the spill occurred \u201cless than four minutes\u201d before the fall, but, as the circuit court observed, she did not say \u201chow much less\u201d time had elapsed. Notably, DeChamps was not asked to estimate the interval between when the customer told her about the spill and when Rehn fell. The only evidence on that point, as the court pointed out, was DeChamp\u2019s testimony that the interval between the customer telling her about the spill and Rehn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>falling was just long enough for DeChamps to begin the process of notifying Westfield and ICC about it. We agree with the circuit court that a finding that this interval was long enough for DeChamps or another Chick-fil-A employee to either clean up the spill or warn food park patrons about it would be premised solely upon impermissible speculation and conjecture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We recognize that there is no reported Maryland precedent affirming summary judgment for a business proprietor on the ground that, although the proprietor did have actual knowledge of the hazard, it did not have enough time to warn patrons. The cases cited in appellees\u2019 briefs are distinguishable from this case because there was no evidence in those cases that the business proprietor actually knew about the dangerous condition. <em>See Moulden, </em>239 Md. at 233, 210 A.2d 724 (summary judgment was appropriate because there was no evidence that grocery had notice of string bean that caused plaintiff to slip and fall); <em>Lexington Mkt. Auth. v. Zappala, </em>233 Md. 444, 446, 197 A.2d 147 (1964)(JNOV was appropriate because there was no evidence that parking garage had notice of oil or grease from patron\u2019s vehicle that caused plaintiff to slip and fall); <em>Carter v. Shoppers Food Warehouse MD Corp., </em>126 Md.App. 147, 164, 727 A.2d 958 (1999) (summary judgment was appropriate because there was nothing but plaintiffs conjecture that she may have fallen on upturned carpet and no evidence that grocery had notice of -that condition); <em>cf. also Lusby v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>195 Md. 118, 122, 72 A.2d 754 (1950)(judgment was appropriate because there was no evidence that bus driver had notice of wet foreign substance that caused plaintiff to slip and fall on bus); <em>Burwell v. Easton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>88 Md.App. 684, 687-89, 577 A.2d 394 (1990)(summary judgment was appropriate because there was no evidence that hospital had notice of lettuce leaf that caused plaintiff to slip and fall on stairs). Other cases involve conditions in which the proprietor had actual or constructive notice because it created the hazard. <em>See, e.g., Mondawmin Corp. v. Kres, </em>258 Md. 307, 318, 266 A.2d 8 (1970)(evidence that mall\u2019s fountain sprayed water on stairwell supported verdict for shopper who slipped and fell on wet stairs); <em>Tennant, </em>115 Md.App. at 394-95, 693 A.2d 370 (evidence that cabbage leaves were swept into a neat circular pile and that produce box protruded from beneath display bin raised inference that store created the hazards that caused plaintiff to slip, trip, and fall).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In cases discussing whether there was sufficient time for business proprietor to clean up the hazard or warn customers, the proprietors have not had actual knowledge of the hazard; that focus on \u201ctime frame\u201d in these cases, therefore, has been on whether there was enough time to both discover and redress the danger. <em>See, e.g., Rawls, </em>207 Md. at 123, 113 A.2d 405 (rainy day customer who slipped and fell on wet stairs as she entered at beginning of shopping day was not entitled to judgment because she offered no evidence to show how the water got on steps or how long it had been there); <em>see generally </em>Sonja A. Soehnel, <em>Liability of Operator of Grocery Store to Invitee Slipping on Spilled Liquid or SemiLiquid Substance, </em>24 A.L.R.4th 646 (1983 &amp; 2003 update)(collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Because the business proprietor in this case undisputedly had actual knowledge of the danger to its patrons, we focus solely on whether there was enough time, after DeChamps learned about the spill, for Chick-fil-A to clean it up or warn its customers. The only reported Maryland case addressing whether a proprietor had sufficient time to cure a known hazard or to warn its patron \u201cgoes the other way,\u201d but provides what we think is an instructive contrast.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>Keene v. Arlan\u2019s Dep\u2019t Store of Baltimore, Inc., </em>35 Md.App. 250, 251-52, 370 A.2d 124 (1977), a department store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>customer slipped and fell on a \u201cclear, sleek solution\u201d as she approached the checkout line in which her husband had been waiting for approximately 15 minutes. A cashier who had been stationed in sight of the husband the entire time he had been waiting in line \u201cblurt[ed] out, \u2018I told them if this wasn\u2019t cleaned up, someone\u2019s going to fall.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 370 A.2d 124. We held that the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the store because a jury reasonably could conclude from this evidence that the store had actual notice of the dangerous condition and sufficient time to either clean it up or warn customers about it. <em>See id. </em>at 258-59, 370 A.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In Rehn\u2019s case, however, there was no comparable evidence that there was enough time to clean up or warn about the spilled drink. The \u201c15 minutes or more\u201d time frame during which the proprietor in <em>Keene </em>had notice of a clear wet liquid on a floor within its store, but did nothing, stands in marked contrast to the \u201cless than four minutes\u201d during which Chick-fil-A\u2019s employee learned about the dark brown soda on the floor outside its store and began the process of having it cleaned up. Both the length and the certainty of the time frame in <em>Keene </em>created a jury question. In contrast, the period during which Chick-fil-A had notice of the spilled drinks was brief but uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">To conclude that Chick-fil-A breached a duty to Rehn, the jury would have to speculate regarding how long Chick-fil-A actually knew about the spilled drinks and how long it reasonably would take to respond. Such conjecture is not a permissible evidentiary basis to infer that such a temporary, nonrecurring hazard created by a third party just outside Chickfil-A\u2019s business premises existed for a sufficient length of time to give Chick-fil-A a reasonable opportunity to respond. <em>See generally Moulden, </em>239 Md. at 232, 210 A.2d 724 (\u201cA mere surmise that there may have been negligence will not justify the court in permitting the case to go to the jury\u201d); <em>cf. Harrington v. Kroger Co., </em>279 So.2d 814, 815 (La.Ct.App. 1973) (no reasonable opportunity to clean up spill when grocery employee \u201cheard [a] bottle drop, called on the intercom for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>porter to clean it up, and saw [the victim] fall\u2014all within a matter of seconds\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Westfield And Interstate</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The circuit court concluded that, because neither Westfield nor Interstate \u201creceive[d] actual notice of the spill until after [Rehn] fell[,]\u201d and there was no evidence that any of the janitorial staff assigned to monitor the food court were absent from their assigned posts or otherwise \u201cnot acting with reasonable diligence[,]\u201d both defendants were entitled to summary judgment. \u201cIt would be unreasonable to expect the custodial staff to keep the food court area continuously clean and absolutely free from obstacles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Rehn concedes in his brief that \u201c[t]here is ... no evidence to indicate that the Defendants Westfield or [ICC] had actual notice of the dangerous condition.\u201d He \u00a1advances only a \u201cconstructive notice\u201d argument against these defendants. Rehn argues that the circuit court \u201cerred when it found, as a matter of law, that \u2018less than four minutes\u2019 was insufficient time to give Westfield, through [ICC\u2019s] janitorial staff, an opportunity to discover the spill and either warn Rehn of its existence or clean it up.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">In <em>Zappala, </em>233 Md. at 446, 197 A.2d 147, the Court of Appeals rejected the notion that a commercial business has a duty to correct or warn against a slippery condition created by a customer \u201cas soon as it occurs[.]\u201d A patron of a self-service parking service garage slipped on oil or grease. The Court reversed a jury verdict in favor of the patron. \u201c[E]ven if we assume that periodic inspections are necessary,\u201d business proprietors do not breach their duty of care by failing to instantaneously detect and correct those conditions. <em>See id. </em>at 445, 197 A.2d 147. \u201c[I]t would be unreasonable to hold that it is [their] duty to continuously inspect and sand down any and all leakage as soon as it occurs[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Here, the only evidence regarding the amount of time the spill was on the floor was DeChamps\u2019 testimony confirming that it was \u201cless than four minutes.\u201d Rehn argues that \u201c[a] reasonable jury could find that Defendants Westfield and [ICC], in the course of carrying out their assigned duties to monitor the area and watch for hazards, and by the exercise of due diligence, should have discovered such a large spill prior to the Plaintiff falling in it.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree that such equivocal testimony could form the basis for a jury verdict against Westfield and ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Even assuming that the interval between the spill and the fall was \u201cless than four minutes,\u201d as the circuit court pointed out, DeChamps did not know or estimate precisely how much less time elapsed. She testified that she did not see the spill, and, in doing so, left to pure speculation whether that interval could be measured at a full three minutes and fifty-nine seconds or only \u201ca matter of seconds[J\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We cannot say that any reasonable juror could rely on such equivocal testimony to find that Rehn had met his burden of proving that these defendants had enough time to discover and either clean up or warn about the spill. We agree with the circuit court that such conjecture cannot serve as grounds for holding Westfield and ICC liable. <em>See Moulden, </em>239 Md. at 233, 210 A.2d 724 (because string bean on which grocery patron slipped \u201cmay have fallen from a grocery cart a few moments before she walked up the aisle[,]\u201d there was no evidence of constructive notice); <em>Zappala, </em>233 Md. at 446, 197 A.2d 147 (because oil or grease on which garage patron slipped \u201cmay have leaked from a car occupying the space beside her car, only a few moments before she returned[,]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>evidence was insufficient to establish constructive notice); <em>Carter, </em>126 Md.App. at 164, 727 A.2d 958 (because only evidence as to why grocery patron fell was her conjecture that she tripped on upturned carpet, and there was no evidence regarding \u201cthe length of time it was turned up[,]\u201d evidence was insufficient to establish constructive notice or to preclude summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. We are not persuaded otherwise by Rehn\u2019s proffered evidence that Chik-fil-A employees occasionally served food samples in the food court area. We recognize that such a presence might be evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer that Chik-fil-A had notice of the spill prior to the time that its customer told DeChamps that she had spilled her drinks, and therefore, that Chik-fil-A had more time to respond than the brief moment described by DeChamps. But there was no evidence whatsoever that any of Chik-fil-A\u2019s \"food sample\u201d employees were in the food court at the time Rehn fell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">. In support, Rehn cites only a decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>See Konka v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>133 F.3d 915 (4th Cir.1998)(reported in full text at 1998 U.S.App. LEXIS 1093)(customer slipped on wet tile floor at open doors to garden center entrance on rainy day; evidence was sufficient to show store either caused the slippery condition or knew about it). Even if we were to give persuasive value to that decision, it would not help Rehn given the distinguishing factual circumstances in that case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
