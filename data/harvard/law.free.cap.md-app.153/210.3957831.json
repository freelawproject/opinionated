THIEME, JR., Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A72\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Appellants Gail Carter and her spouse appeal from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City\u2019s grant of summary judgment in this multi-count tort action in favor of both corporate and individual defendants, the appellees, and dismissing all of the counts in the Third Amended Complaint. The Carters sued Aramark Sports and Entertainment, Inc. (Aramark), and two individuals, Sabrina Knouse and David Milburn, bringing in their Third Amended Complaint allegations of malicious prosecution, interference with economic relations, abuse of process, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, aiding and abetting as to Ms. Knouse, as well as related counts for punitive damages and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">Appellants raise myriad issues in their appeal but, at bottom, they contest the circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, which dismissed their complaint in its entirety. For the following reasons, we affirm the circuit court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Summary Background and Course of Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">This litigation has as its genesis certain events which took place on July 27, 1999. Appellant, Gail Carter, was employed as an usher by the Baltimore Orioles at the Oriole Park at Camden Yards Stadium for the 1999 baseball season, and was at work that day. Appellee Aramark supplies concession services to the stadium. Both Ms. Rnouse, Aramark\u2019s human resources director, and Mr. Milburn, an Aramark security officer, also were working that day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On that date, prior to the first pitch of the Oriole\u2019s game, Ms. Carter was accused of participating with an Aramark vender, Ruth Brunson, in a \u201cscheme\u201d to reuse discarded Styrofoam yogurt cups for the sale of frozen yogurt. According to the allegations, Ms. Carter would collect discarded Styrofoam and plastic \u201chelmet\u201d cups, take them home to wash them, and then return the items to Camden Yards for resale by Brunson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">When certain Aramark managers became aware of rumors of this activity, they investigated. Ms. Brunson\u2019s yogurt stand was audited on the spot, an employee dispatched to a nearby women\u2019s restroom to look for a supposed cache of Styrofoam cups, and Ms. Carter was told to report to an Aramark office at the stadium where she was confronted by these allegations. She was immediately suspended by the Orioles pending an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The allegations of the scheme ripened into criminal charges, when a complaint, accusing Ms. Carter of theft, was filed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>David Milburn, a Baltimore City Police Officer moonlighting with Aramark as a security officer. The criminal case went to trial in the district court after Ms. Carter refused an offer to have her case placed on the Stet docket. She was acquitted by the court on a motion for judgment of acquittal after the close of the State\u2019s case. In entering the acquittal, the district judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">Okay. I\u2019ve taken a look at the State\u2019s Exhibit, these 50-or-so cups that Ms. Knouse introduced. Of course, I read the statement of charges and the application for the statement of charges, and I\u2019m very curious about the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">The Court finds that these cups are actually new.... But these cups are not used cups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">The statement of charges says, \u201cdid steal frozen yogurt of Aramark, Incorporated.\u201d The application for the statement of charges is filled' with a great deal of speculation not proven in court today, indicates that the defendant, Ms. Ruth Brunson, would receive Styrofoam cups collected after a baseball event. Those cups were then taken home, presumably by Ms. Carter, washed out and the same\u2014\u201cwashed out same and give cups to defendant to resell. As customers would approach Defendant Brunson, Defendant Brunson would fill the cups with frozen yogurt, property of Aramark, Incorporated, keep $3.25 for each cup of yogurt sold that way. After the event, defendant and codefendant would divide the profits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">Well, let\u2019s go it in reverse. We\u2019ve never heard anything about commingling of monies between either of the defendants. That\u2019s an allegation that\u2019s not been proved. We\u2019ve never [heard] anything about any cups being filled with any frozen yogurt, another allegation also not shown today. We haven\u2019t heard anything about Ms. Carter having taken these cups home and/or washed those out, another allegation, again speculative, not shown by any testimony today. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>We do have testimony, according to one witness, and that\u2019s Mr. Sachs, that he saw Ms. Carter with a sleeve of cups in a duffel bag. Those cups were given to Ms. Brunson, but they\u2019re not the theft of the cups, and I do believe that they are ARA cups, and I have a sneaking suspicion that something was under foot with these cups, but the defendant, both of them, are charged with having stolen frozen yogurt. I haven\u2019t heard anything whatsoever about frozen yogurt having been stolen. I do believe that that may have been the plan involved, and I think it\u2019s a legitimate suspicion or speculation on the part of the state, but there\u2019s not been one scoop of yogurt discussed in this case whatsoever, and the defendants have only been charged with having stolen yogurt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">It may very well have been their intention. Their intention also could equally have been to make some type of mobile out of the Styrofoam cups, although that\u2019s stretching it and certainly not my belief or speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">But suffice it to say, there\u2019s been no yogurt stolen in this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">For that reason, I find both of you ladies not guilty of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In the wake of this acquittal, Ms. Carter filed the first of three complaints against these defendants in connection with the above events. After the usual pre-trial skirmishes, she lodged a \u201cThird Amended Complaint\u201d alleging all the above-referenced counts. Following a hearing on the defense\u2019s dis-positive motion for summary judgment, the circuit court ruled in favor of Aramark on all counts. The court denied appellants\u2019 motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Although appellants have framed a variety of issues, which will be addressed below, all their contentions on appeal implicate the propriety of the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to all counts of their Third Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">We will recite additional facts and procedural landmarks of this case as will be necessary for the resolution of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The logical starting point for our analysis, therefore, lies with the language from the Maryland Rule governing this manner of summary disposition. That Rule dictates that \u201c[t]he court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(e). <em>See Rite Aid Corp. v. Hagley, </em>374 Md. 665, 683, 824 A.2d 107 (2003); <em>Sterling v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>145 Md.App. 161, 167, 802 A.2d 440, <em>cert. denied, </em>371 Md. 264, 808 A.2d 808 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Our review over a circuit court\u2019s decision on summary judgment is plenary. <em>Hemmings v. Pelham Wood Ltd. Liab. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>375 Md. 522, 533, 826 A.2d 443 (2003); <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Utica Mutual Ins. Co., </em>145 Md.App. 256, 282 n. 30, 802 A.2d 1070, <em>cert. granted, </em>371 Md. 613, 810 A.2d 961 (2002), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>374 Md. 81, 821 A.2d 369 (2003); <em>Sterling, </em>145 Md.App. at 168, 802 A.2d 440. Pursuant to this <em>de novo </em>inquiry, we must discern whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists and will review the circuit court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Hagley, </em>374 Md. at 683, 824 A.2d 107. \u201cWhen ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court must view the facts, including all inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Sterling, </em>145 Md.App. at 167, 802 A.2d 440 (quoting <em>Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 676, 766 A.2d 617 (2001)). <em>Accord, Hemmings, </em>375 Md. at 535, 826 A.2d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u201c \u2018A material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sterling, </em>145 Md.App. at 168, 802 A.2d 440 (quoting <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206 (2001) (quoting <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608, 614 (1985))). The moving party bears the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)). And, as Chief Judge Bell recently observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">The party opposing a motion for summary judgment must produce admissible evidence to show that a genuine dispute of material fact, i.e., one \u201cthe resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case,\u201d ... does exist.... This requires more than \u201cgeneral allegations which do not show facts in detail and with precision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Hagley, </em>374 Md. at 684, 824 A.2d 107 (citations omitted). Indeed, \u201c \u2018conclusory statements, conjecture, or speculation by the party resisting the motion will not defeat summary judgments \u201d and an \u201c \u2018opposing party\u2019s facts must be material and of a substantial nature, not fanciful, frivolous, gauzy, spurious, irrelevant, gossamer inferences, conjectural, speculative, nor merely suspicions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Opals On Ice Lingerie v. Bodylines Inc., </em>320 F.3d 362, 370 n. 3 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Contemporary Mission, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, </em>648 F.2d 97, 107 n. 14 (2d Cir.1981) (quoting 6 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 56.15(3) at 56-486 to 56-487 (2d ed.1976))).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u201cThe summary judgment procedure is not a substitute for trial.\u201d <em>Hagley, </em>374 Md. at 683, 824 A.2d 107. \u201c[I]f [the] facts are susceptible of more than one permissible inference, the choice between those inferences should not be made as a matter of law[.]\u201d <em>Porter v. General Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 413, 396 A.2d 1090 (1979) (quoting <em>Fenwick Motor Co. v. Fenwick, </em>258 Md. 134, 138, 265 A.2d 256 (1970)). Thus, a reasonable dispute over a material fact will preclude summary judgment, because its resolution lies with the jury. Again, where no material fact presented is in dispute, summary judgment is appropriate to resolve purely legal questions. <em>Sterling, </em>145 Md.App. at 168, 802 A.2d 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We are mindful that summary judgment is generally inappropriate in cases involving abuse of process, defamation, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution. <em>Hagley, </em>374 Md. at 684, 824 A.2d 107 (citing <em>Laws v. Thompson, 78 </em>Md.App. 665, 669-687, 554 A.2d 1264 (1989)). <em>See Hemmings, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>375 Md. at 535, 826 A.2d 443 (quoting <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 355-56, 744 A.2d 47 (2000)). Nevertheless, this disposition may properly obtain if the prerequisites for summary judgment are satisfied, to wit: the absence of a disputed issue of material fact and the presence of a legal basis for the entry of judgment. <em>See Hagley, </em>374 Md. at 685, 824 A.2d 107 (citing <em>Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 257, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993); <em>Driver v. PEPCO, </em>247 Md. 75, 79, 230 A.2d 321 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In contesting the entry of summary judgment on the malicious prosecution count, appellants contend that the criminal prosecution was initiated without probable cause. Under this' general argument, appellants raise, explicitly or by implication, a host of assertions, which we shall address seriatim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\n<em>Malicious Prosecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Appellants\u2019 initial argument broadly contests the circuit court\u2019s determination of probable cause as a basis for malicious prosecution. This contention effectively relates to whether that court erred in granting summary judgment as to the count alleging malicious prosecution, Count I of the Third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Amended Complaint, and whether the court properly disposed of that primary count\u2019s derivative charges, <em>viz. </em>Count II, punitive damages, and Counts XIII and XIV, those aiding and abetting allegations against Ms. Knouse with respect to malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In a case of malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must establish \u201c1) a criminal proceeding instituted or continued by the defendant against the plaintiff; 2) without probable cause; 3) with malice, or with a motive other than to bring the offender to justice; and 4) termination of the proceedings in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Heron v. Strader, </em>361 Md. 258, 264, 761 A.2d 56 (2000). <em>See Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 183, 757 A.2d 118 (2000); <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 54, 729 A.2d 354 (1999); <em>Exxon v. Kelly, </em>281 Md. 689, 693, 381 A.2d 1146 (1978); <em>Green v. Brooks, </em>125 Md.App. 349, 367, 725 A.2d 596 (1999). The first and final elements have been established in appellants\u2019 favor. The issue of probable cause has drawn the most attention in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>The Acquittal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">First, appellants maintain that the acquittal of the criminal prosecution undermines the determination of probable cause. We do not agree. An acquittal is not, by itself, evidence of a lack of probable cause. <em>Palmer Ford v. Wood, </em>298 Md. 484, 492 n. 4, 471 A.2d 297 (1984). As the Court of Appeals has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">[T]he fact of acquittal after trial on the merits is not evidence of a want of probable cause. <em>Prosser, </em>Torts (2d ed.), p. 656, \u00a7\u00a7 98; <em>Restatement, </em>Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 667, comment (c); <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Thomasson, </em>251 F. 833, 837 (C.C.A.4th.). This is said to be for the reason that the finding may be based on a mere lack of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and throws no light on the sufficiency of the evidence on which the instigator acted at the time the proceedings were instituted, because the verdict may have been based on other evidence produced by the defense that was unknown to the instigator. We find nothing in the Maryland cases at variance with this view. In <em>Stansbury v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Luttrell, </em>152 Md. 553, 137 A. 339, a judgment for the plaintiff was reversed because of a failure to establish a want of probable cause, despite the fact that he had been acquitted of larceny after a jury trial. In <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Barrack, supra, </em>[210 Md. 168, 122 A.2d 457] we held that the case was properly submitted to the jury because of the conflict in the evidence as to what occurred prior to the arrest. We referred to the fact that in <em>Nance v. Gall, </em>187 Md. 656, [50 A.2d 120 (1946), 51 A.2d 535 (1947)], and in <em>Straus v. Young, </em>36 Md. 246, it was said that acquittal before a magistrate would permit an inference of a want of probable cause. In both those cases, however, there was not an acquittal on the merits.... [Discharge by a magistrate on preliminary hearing may furnish some evidence of a want of probable cause, whereas acquittal after trial does not.... In the instant case we hold that the acquittal by the jury is not evidence of a want of probable cause[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><em>Norvell v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>212 Md. 14, 20-21, 128 A.2d 591 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">As was stated in another fashion by the Fourth Circuit in applying Maryland law, \u201c[p]robable cause does not require evidence sufficient to convict a person but only \u2018a reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in believing that the accused is guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alvarez v. Montgomery County, </em>147 F.3d 354, 360 (4th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Palmer Ford, </em>298 Md. at 493, 471 A.2d 297). In <em>Porterfield v. Lott, </em>156 F.3d 563, 569 (4th Cir.1998), the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">Probable cause requires more than \u201cbare suspicion\u201d but requires less than evidence necessary to convict.... \u201cIt is an objective standard-of probability that reasonable and prudent persons apply in everyday life____\u201d And when it is considered in the light of all of the surrounding circumstances, even \u201cseemingly innocent activity\u201d may provide a basis for finding probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">To conclude on this point, we find instructive the observation by Judge Hill, writing for the Eleventh Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>There is a substantial difference between the quantum of proof necessary to constitute sufficient evidence to support a conviction and that necessary to establish probable cause. Although we characterized [on direct appeal of the plaintiffs criminal conviction] the evidence against Kelly at trial as supporting little more than <em>\u201cspeculation and conjecture,\u201d </em>this assessment does not mean that there was not probable cause to bring the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Kelly v. Serna, </em>87 F.3d 1235, 1241 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\n<em>Hearsay Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Of particular focus in appellants\u2019 appeal is their charge that the circuit court relied on \u201cinadmissible hearsay\u201d in rendering the determination that probable cause existed in this case. They essentially complain that the \u201ccumulation of information,\u201d <em>viz. </em>the statements, remarks, innuendo, and rumors from other ushers and stadium employees should not have formed the basis of the court\u2019s ruling, because \u201c[there are] no witnesses claiming to have personal knowledge of a scheme[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Aramark responds, first, that appellants failed to raise this issue before the circuit court, and, second, that such statements as were presented to Ms. Knouse were adequate to form the basis for probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">\n<em>Preservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">As a preliminary matter, we address whether appellants preserved their hearsay theory for our consideration. Prompted by Aramark\u2019s preservation argument, appellants in their reply brief assure us that their objection to the \u201cfacts\u201d which came to Ms. Knouse\u2019s attention was indeed brought before the circuit court. They cite the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, where the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">THE COURT: Can I ask you this, [counsel]? Is your position here that these facts as just enunciated for the record and for everyone\u2019s understanding so we\u2019ll have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>common road map here, is your argument today that those facts are belied by other facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">[COUNSEL]: These facts, we believe, are uncorroborated, unreliable, unverified, quote/unquote \u201cfacts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Appellants further respond to the preservation argument that in their motion to reconsider the entry of summary judgment, the \u201cissues concerning hearsay were raised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Maryland Rule 8-131(a), repeatedly quoted by this Court, provides in part that \u201c[o]rdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other [than a jurisdictional] issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">This issue is before us, but just barely. In our view, appellants\u2019 complaint, that the evidence in question was \u201cuncorroborated\u201d and \u201cunreliable,\u201d provides a sufficient basis for us to consider their complaint on appeal that it is inadmissible hearsay. The following passage from the Seventh Circuit is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASq\">.;.. Spiller\u2019s argument on appeal relates to the government\u2019s use of the ledgers to show that he produced 28,000 grams of crack cocaine. In other words, he objects to their use to prove the truth of the information they contained, a hearsay objection. The government maintains that since the initial admission of the records was appropriate under Rule 404(b), and since Spiller did not make a continuing hearsay objection, Spiller forfeited his right to object to the use of the ledgers. Generally, to preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must make a proper objection at trial that alerts the court and opposing party to the specific grounds for the objection. Thus, not just any objection will save an issue for review\u2014neither <em>\u00e1 </em>general objection to the evidence nor a specific objection on a ground other than the one advanced on appeal is enough. Rather, this Court null consider an argument only if the party asserting it made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>proper, timely and specific objection on the same ground at trial, that is, unless plain error is manifest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">Thus, we must decide whether Spiller\u2019s objections that the ledgers were \u201cirrelevant, immaterial and uncorroborated\u201d is sufficient to preserve the issue that they constitute inadmissible hearsay. Spiller\u2019s objection regarding relevance and materiality is not sufficient to preserve a hearsay objection for appellate review. In fact, much hearsay, even inadmissible hearsay, is relevant and material. However, Spiller\u2019s objection based on lack of corroboration is probably sufficient. Lack of reliability and corroboration go to the heart of the hearsay objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\"><em>United States v. Spiller, </em>261 F.3d 683, 689-90 (7th Cir.2001). Thus, while we disagree with appellants\u2019 assertion that they effectively presented a hearsay objection in their motion for reconsideration, we do conclude that counsel\u2019s above-referenced objection at the hearing to the lack of corroboration is sufficient to preserve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\n<em>Nature and Use of Hearsay Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. This is the traditional definition of hearsay as articulated in Md. Rule 5-801 (c). \u201cGenerally, statements made out-of-court that are pffered for their truth are inadmissible as hearsay, absent circumstances bringing the statements within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Su v. Weaver, </em>313 Md. 370, 376, 545 A.2d 692 (1988) (citing <em>Kapiloff v. Locke, </em>276 Md. 466, 471, 348 A.2d 697 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The Hearsay Rule is therefore a rule of exclusion, and thus the proponent of the disputed evidence bears the burden of showing that the Rule does not apply. <em>See Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 1, 7-8, 536 A.2d 666, <em>cert. denied, </em>312 Md. 602, 541 A.2d 965 (1988). But as was pointed out by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Moylan, sitting by designation in the Court of Appeals, \u201c[t]he acceptability of hearsay, even ... compounded, in the accumulation of probable cause is fundamental.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437, 450 n. 12, 298 A.2d 156 (1972) (citing cases).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We need venture no farther in our consideration of appellants\u2019 hearsay argument. The proper consideration of the various statements that are implicated in Aramark\u2019s actions is whether they formed a reasonably objective basis at the time upon which Aramark could have relied to go forward with those actions which were adverse to Ms. Carter. The statements were the proper subject of the circuit court\u2019s analysis on summary judgment, even though they were not admissible in Ms. Carter\u2019s trial in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\n<em>Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We now consider the issue of whether there was probable cause, the presence of which will bar the malicious prosecution and related counts. <em>See Kennedy v. Crouch, </em>191 Md. 580, 587, 62 A.2d 582 (1948). \u201cProbable cause, as the term implies, is a concept based on probability.\u201d <em>Okwa, </em>360 Md. at 183, 757 A.2d 118. The Court of Appeals continued in <em>Okwa:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">It does not have a technical definition. Rather, the question of whether a law enforcement officer had probable cause to make a particular arrest is determined on \u201cfactual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent [people] ... act.\u201d ... We have defined probable cause as \u201c \u2018facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiPino, </em>354 Md. at 32, 729 A.2d at 361 (citations omitted) (alterations in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\"><em>Okwa, </em>360 Md. at 183-84, 757 A.2d 118 (citations omitted). Judge Hollander, writing for this Court in <em>Green, </em>refers us to the following instructive statement by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7j\">\u201cProbable cause is a reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious [person] in believing that the accused is guilty.\u201d ... It is equally clear that if the facts, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, relied on to constitute probable cause are clear and undisputed, the question is one of law for the court; where the facts are contested, however, whether they are proved is a question for the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A64\"><em>Green, </em>125 Md.App. at 368, 725 A.2d 596 (quoting <em>Exxon Corp. v. Kelly, </em>281 Md. at 697-98, 381 A.2d 1146). Malice may be inferred from the lack of probable cause. <em>Okwa, </em>360 Md. at 189, 757 A.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">We recognize that probable cause cannot rest on rumor. The record, nevertheless, contains evidence of \u201ccircumstances sufficiently strong in themselves\u201d to justify a reasonable belief that Ms. Carter was guilty of an offense. On July 27, 1999,</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Ms. Knouse had been informed that Ms. Carter had collected. Styrofoam cups and miniature plastic baseball helmets after the games. She was told that one Sean Clark, an Aramark employee, reported that a Steve Sachs, a bartender for Ara-mark, had seen Ms. Carter pass a number of Styrofoam cups to Ms. Brunson, an Aramark yogurt vender, and that the latter had been seen entering the ladies room with a bag during an audit of her stand. Ms. Knouse was informed by an Orioles usher, Mary Ellen Myers, of rumors that Ms. Carter and Ms. Brunson were involved in selling yogurt. In a deposition, Ms. Myers testified that she had heard rumors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that Ms. Carter \u201cwas collecting the caps<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and taking them home and bringing them back to the yogurt stand ... to give it [the caps] to Ms. Ruthie [who] would use that as inventory. That\u2019s how they made their money.\u201d At her deposition, Ms. Myers continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">Other than collect [the helmets in which yogurt was served] after the games, [Ms. Carter] would put them in her bag and she would, you know, just go up and down the aisle, and seating area and collect the helmets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">It seemed like it was basically every game, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">... At times, I mean that was the summer it was very hot and Gail would be constantly at the Yogurt Tree.... It came to a time that, you know, she was actually helping Ms. Ruthie serve the yogurt[J ... And then, you know, we were all told as a group no more being at the yogurt place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Ms. Myers said that she had not raised this as an issue before July 27, 1999. On that date, however, she had stopped by the bar where an Aramark bartender, Steve Sachs, was working, for some ice. Ms. Brunson\u2019s yogurt stand was nearby, but Sachs was apparently unaware of the rumors about Ms. Carter. Ms. Myers recalled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">And all of a sudden [Sachs] just started yelling and went\u2014 calling [yelling for] his supervisor, I don\u2019t remember the name, and I went back to my section. So I didn\u2019t find out until after the fact what had happened....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">That Gail ... was taking Styrofoam cups home too ... and Ms. Ruthie got caught putting the cups in the ladies bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">[Ms. Myers did not actually see anything.] I just saw Gail there with her bag on the yogurt place, which it was always, you know, whenever she went there, she had her bag there, but I didn\u2019t see anything transpire, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Ms. Myers never saw Ms. Carter and Ms. Brunson exchange money. Nor did she see the latter sell yogurt in cups allegedly given to her by Ms. Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Diane Taylor, an employee, signed a statement reporting that on July 26,1999, she had seen Ms. Carter \u201cpicking up the baseball cups [presumably plastic helmets] left behind by the fans[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Subsequent to July 27, 1999, Aramark obtained a statement from one \u201cAntionette R.\u201d who wrote that Ms. Brunson would come to the writer\u2019s stand and ask Antionette \u201cto washout cups[.]\u201d Steve Berry, the Aramark supervisor contacted by bartender Sachs, recalled in a written statement that, while conducting an audit of Ms. Brunson\u2019s yogurt stand on July 27, Ms. Brunson left for the ladies\u2019 room with her bag. A subsequent search of that restroom yielded a bag containing Styrofoam cups underneath the \u201ctrash bag\u201d in the refuse can.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The circuit court was entitled, on the extant record, to conclude that appellants failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the above recitations. Cautiously avoiding reliance on rumors and reports from unidentified ushers who actually saw Ms. Carter rinse cups, we ourselves conclude that undisputed facts give rise to those facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant Aramark management and Ms. Knouse in believing that Ms. carter had committed or was committing an offense. Moreover, appellants have failed to point to any dispute of material facts that would militate against an affirmance of the circuit court\u2019s decision below. <em>Compare, Exxon Corp., </em>281 Md. at 697-98, 381 A.2d 1146 (court points to conflict in evidence which had formed basis for decision to prosecute).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Aramark\u2019s case is further strengthened by the fact that Officer Milburn consulted an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, Marshall Shure, before submitting the amended police report that gave rise to the prosecution. Officer Milburn had initially prepared a lengthy police report outlining the facts presented to him by Ms. Knouse and Aramark, and stating that the charge was \u201cflim-flam larceny.\u201d Milburn testified at his deposition that he changed this to \u201ctheft\u201d after consulting with Mr. Shure.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Non-lawyers, such as Aramark, who rely on the advice of counsel, may in some circumstances raise this as a defense to an allegation of malicious prosecution. In <em>Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437, 453-54, 298 A.2d 156 (1972), the Court ruled that a deputy sheriff who brought criminal charges was \u201cfully protected by having sought and received the advice of counsel, specifically the State\u2019s attorney, provided only that he shall have made a full and fair disclosure of everything within his knowledge and information and that he subsequently shall have followed the advice given.\u201d We believe that <em>Brewer v. Mele </em>applies here, because Officer Milburn consulted with Mr. Shure about the appropriate charge. Although appellants accuse Ms. Knouse of making falsehoods in her report, which informed Officer Milburn in his actions, we perceive no inaccu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>racies that would render inapplicable the rule insulating malicious prosecution defendants from liability because they consulted with counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Because Aramark\u2019s, and Ms. Knouse\u2019s, actions were supported by probable cause, we shall therefore affirm the circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment as to Counts I and II and their related punitive damages claims, and the relevant (as to malicious prosecution) counts against Ms. Knouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>Defamation and Intentional Interference</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Appellants assail the circuit court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on the related counts of defamation and intentional interference of economic relations, <em>viz. </em>Ms. Carter\u2019s employment with the Orioles.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Ms. Carter alleged the torts of \u201cintentional interference with economic relations\u201d and \u201cdefamation\u201d respectively in Counts III and VII of the Third Amended Complaint. These theories of action were treated similarly by the circuit court, which entered summary judgment for Aramark on the basis of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\n<em>Defamation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">This Court has outlined the elements of the tort of defamation in cases involving a plaintiff who is not a public figure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">In [such a case] a prima facia case of defamation requires proof of the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">(1) that the defendant made a defamatory communication\u2014i.e., that he communicated a statement tending to expose the plaintiff to public scorn, hatred, contempt, or ridicule to a third person who reasonably recognized the statement as being defamatory; (2) that the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>was false; (3) that the defendant was at fault in communicating the statement; and (4) that the plaintiff suffered harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><em>Peroutka v.

Darvish, </em>363 Md. 42, 54, 767 A.2d 321 (2001). \u201cA defamatory statement is one which tends to expose a person to public scorn, hatred, contempt or ridicule, thereby discouraging others in the community from having a good opinion of, or from associating or dealing with, that person.\u201d <em>Batson v.

In this instance, the allegation that a person is a thief constitutes defamation <em>per se. See </em>R.J. Gilbert and P.T. Gilbert, Maryland Tort Law Handbook, \u00a7 6.4 (3d ed. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">A defendant in a defamation action may interpose the defense of a qualified, or conditional, privilege. <em>Gohari, </em>363 Md. at 55, 767 A.2d 321. The Court there observed that a defendant would not face liability for an otherwise defamatory statement \u201cwhere, in good faith, he publishes a statement in furtherance of his own legitimate interests, or those shared in common with the recipient or third parties, or where his declaration would be of interest to the public in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 767 A.2d 321 (quoting <em>Marchesi v. Franchino, </em>283 Md. 131, 135-36, 387 A.2d 1129 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The alleged defamatory communications made by Aramark to the Orioles, and to employees of each organization, are defended on the basis of the \u201cshared interest\u201d or \u201ccommon interest\u201d conditional privilege. The Court of Appeals explained this privilege in a passage that merits extensive quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">An occasion is conditionally privileged when the circumstances are such as to lead any one of several persons having a common interest in a particular subject matter correctly or reasonably to believe that facts exist which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>another sharing such common interest is entitled to know....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">In determining what qualifies as a common interest, we have stated that a common interest may include \u201cinterests in property, business and professional dealings,\u201d <em>id., </em>and can \u201cinhere in business dealings between the publisher and the recipient.\u201d ... Dobbs has elaborated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">Common interests are usually found among members of identifiable groups in which members share similar goals or values or cooperate in a single endeavor.... The idea is to promote free exchange of relevant information among those engaged in a common enterprise or activity and to permit them to make appropriate internal communications and share consultations without fear of suit.... The privilege does not arise in the first place unless the communication relates in some degree to the common interest, and once the privilege arises it is lost if it is abused by malice or excessive publication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">[Dan B.

For example, the purported sale of a dairy product in previously used Styrofoam or plastic helmet cups would indeed implicate health as well as economic concerns. In the final analysis, there is no question that because one of the employees in the alleged \u201cscheme\u201d was an employee of the Baltimore Orioles, and the supposed events took place at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, \u201cthe circumstances are such as to lead to the reasonable belief that the third person\u2019s interest is in danger.\u201d <em>Gohari, </em>363 Md. at 59, 767 A.2d 321 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 595, at 270).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Appellants\u2019 theory on this question is that Aramark abused any conditional privilege because the communications were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>made in bad faith.

In their response to Aramark\u2019s summary judgment motion, appellants asserted that Aramark\u2019s own investigation proved \u201cthat their accusation of [Ms.] Carter on July 27, 1999 was false.

In view of the above, we conclude that the court correctly entered summary judgment against appellants on the defamation and tortious interference counts. We note, as to the latter count, that appellants have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to deposition testimony that Ms. Carter was terminated by the Orioles for reasons unrelated to the events of July 27, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the defamation and tortious interference counts, as well as the derivative punitive damages charges, and the related aiding and abetting counts with respect to Ms. Knouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>Abuse of Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u201c \u2018The tort of abuse of process occurs when a party has wilfully misused criminal or civil process after it has issued in order to obtain a result not contemplated by- law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Palmer Ford, </em>298 Md. at 511, 471 A.2d 297 (quoting <em>Krashes v.

Judge William Adkins elaborated on the elements of the tort:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cThe essential elements of the abuse of process as the tort has developed, have been stated to be: first, an ulterior purpose, and second, a wilful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding.\u201d Put otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u201cTo sustain an action of abuse of process the plaintiff must show that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">1. the defendant wilfully used process for an illegal purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">2. to satisfy the defendant\u2019s ulterior motive; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">3. the plaintiff was damaged by the defendant\u2019s perverted use of process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-13\"><em>Berman v.

Gilbert, Maryland Tort Law Handbook, \u00a7 5.0 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">We conclude that the record, even viewed indulgently in favor of appellants, does not raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether Aramark and Ms. Knouse wilfully used the criminal prosecution for any ulterior purpose. Citing deposition testimony from Ms. Carter and Ms. Knouse, appellants maintain, first, that Aramark sought \u201cto cause Mrs. Carter to lose her job and secure a conviction at any cost[,]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>and that Ms. Knouse \u201cwas motivated by something other than bringing an offender to justice\u201d because she \u201cwanted someone to know what was going on when he decided to initiate prosecution[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Yet they raise no genuine issue with respect to whether Ms. Knouse and Aramark sought to use the prosecution for ulteri- or motives. There is no showing whatsoever that the goal was to bring about Ms. Carter\u2019s termination for its own sake. Certainly, Aramark would strive to end employee theft and alleged acts that would pose a health risk. In the final analysis, the facts do not bear the weight of appellants\u2019 abuse of process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The circuit court thus correctly granted summary judgment on the abuse of process, and derivative punitive damages and aiding and abetting counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\n<em>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">In order to establish the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the tort plaintiff must establish: \u201c \u2018(1) The conduct must be intentional or reckless; (2) [t]he conduct must be extreme and outrageous; (3) [t]here must be a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress; (4) [t]he emotional distress must be severe.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manikhi v.

The allegations contained in the specific count alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, and generally in the Third Amended Complaint as a whole, fail to go beyond conclusory allegations of the conduct that is claimed to be extreme and outrageous.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">There is also a glaring lack of specificity in the pleadings as to the severity of the distress suffered by Ms. Carter. We believe that the circuit court\u2019s first rationale in granting summary judgment, a lack of factual detail in the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>does embrace the failure adequately to plead not only \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d conduct, but also the \u201cemotional distress\u201d element for intentional infliction of emotional distress. We therefore will affirm the entry of summary judgment as to the count alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress on that basis as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In the final analysis, even viewing the complaint, and, on summary judgment, the record in the light most indulgent to appellants, we nonetheless must conclude that the facts, as alleged and taken as true in Ms. Carter\u2019s favor, do not make out an adequate case for intentional infliction of emotional distress. .Simply put, the Third Amended Complaint fails to allege with the requisite specificity either the outrageous conduct or the \u201cemotional distress\u201d elements of Ms. Carter\u2019s theory of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>See Manikhi, </em>360 Md. at 368-70, 758 A.2d 95 (citing cases). We recognize that the \u201ccharacter of a defendant\u2019s conduct is in itself important evidence\u201d of the existence of severe emotional distress. <em>Id. </em>at 368, 758 A.2d 95 (quoting <em>Harris, </em>281 Md. at 571, 380 A.2d 611).

The standard for actionable conduct under this tort is exacting and stringent. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acknowledged so before the circuit court.

We conclude, as did Judge Karwacki in <em>Batson, </em>that an acceptance of appellants\u2019 view, that the conduct in this case should make appellees liable under this theory of action, would \u201cdramatically expand the boundaries of the tort [the Court of Appeals] first recognized in <em>Harris[.]\u201d Batson, </em>325 Md. at 735, 602 A.2d 1191.

There is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to a threat of force, or to the exercise of force in this case. We agree with the analysis of the Illinois Appellate Court in <em>Hanna v.

It is undisputed that no physical force was applied to detain plaintiff during his interview on the evening of March 6. Not only was there no physical force used, but plaintiff could have walked out of the room and off the premises, without having to pass through any locked door or other physical barrier. Moreover, he does not allege any verbal threat of force or any conduct on the part of defendant\u2019s agents that restricted his means of escape, other than a statement leading plaintiff to fear that he might lose his job should he leave. The restraint that resulted simply from plaintiffs fear of losing his job is insufficient as a matter of law to make out a claim of false imprisonment. See, e.g., <em>Mason v. Wrightson, </em>205 Md. 481, 487, 109 A.2d 128, 131 (1954). Even if statements of defendant\u2019s agents led plaintiff to believe that he would be fired immediately should he leave the room, this is an insufficient threat for supporting a claim for false imprisonment. <em>See, e.g., </em>Restatement (2d) of Torts \u00a7 40A, comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>a, illustrations 1 and 2 (1965) (A threat by defendant, with gun in hand, to shoot plaintiffs child should plaintiff leave the room is sufficient, as is a threat to destroy plaintiffs valuable personal prop\u00e9rty on the spot.). <em>See also Lopez v.

They contend that Aramark is not insulated from liability for malicious prosecution solely because the police and the commissioner acted on the charges initiated by Aramark, because of the lack of probable cause. They complain of the circuit court's reliance on hearsay information in granting summary judgment, challenge the court's \u201dmiscons[truction]\u201d of certain facts and inferences, as well as the court\u2019s determination of matters of credibility on summary judgment, and state that the circuit court \"should have drawn inferences, favorable to Appellants,\u201d from the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\">. Certainly, the Maryland summary judgment rule requires that supporting affidavits contain such facts \"as would be admissible in evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(c)'. This evidentiary quandary was succinctly addressed by a federal district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\"On a summary judgment motion, the district court properly considers only evidence that would be admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Nora Beverages, Inc. v.

Nonetheless, when the dispute concerns whether officers had probable cause to obtain a search or arrest warrant, the district court properly considers hearsay evidence that was used to obtain the warrant in question. <em>See United States v. [One Parcel of Property at] 15 Black Ledge Drive, </em>897 F.2d 97, 101 (2d Cir.1990); <em>United States v. [Premises and Real Property at] 4492 S.

State, </em>147 Md.App. 1, 75, 807 A.2d 732 (quoting <em>Ali </em>v. <em>State </em>314 Md. 295, 304, 550 A.2d 925 (1988)), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 Md. 430, 813 A.2d 257 (2002). <em>See also Daniel v.

We may not, ordinarily, affirm a summary judgment on a basis not relied upon by the circuit court, <em>Hemmings v. Pelham Wood Ltd. Liability Ltd. P'ship, </em>375 Md. 522, 534, 826 A.2d 443 (2003), and will not do so here. Although not squarely addressed by the circuit court, we note in passing that appellants did not present legally sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the severity of Ms. Carter's emotional distress. We are mindful that a plaintiff need not be totally disabled by her emotional distress. <em>See Figueiredo-Torres v. Nickel, </em>321 Md. 642, 656, 584 A.2d 69 (1991) (quoting <em>B.N. </em>v. <em>K.K., </em>312 Md. 135, 148, 538 A.2d 1175 (1988)). We also note that Dr. Mayer Liebman, in an April 19, 2001 report, diagnosed \"Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate,\u201d \"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Chronic, Provisional,\u201d and \"Anxiety and Depression Causing Headaches[,j\" and opined that Ms. Carter\u2019s \"prognosis is fairly good over time.\u201d We would conclude, were the issue squarely before us, that appellants have not adduced legally sufficient evidence of severe emotional distress so as to satisfy the stringent requirements for this tort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">.
