Holding that the bank\u2019s liability began the moment the writ was served, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted the motion for judgment of the garnishor, appellee Hanlon Park Condominium Association, Inc. (\u201cHanlon Park\u201d), and entered judgment against the g\u00e1mishee, The Harbor Bank of Maryland (\u201cHarbor Bank\u201d). But in doing so, it erred. The court should have considered, before ruling, whether Harbor Bank had a reasonable opportunity to act on the writ of attachment before releasing the funds in question. If it did not, then it was not liable for those funds. Hence, we shall remand this case for trial on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Hanlon Park obtained a judgment against its managing agent, Canfield Property Management, Inc. and Canfield Property\u2019s president, Torrie Johnson. To collect that judgment, Hanlon Park served Ms. Johnson\u2019s employer, the Sickle Cell Association of Maryland, Inc. (\u201cSickle Cell\u201d) with a writ of garnishment of wages. When Sickle Cell failed to respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the writ, the circuit court entered a default judgment against it in the amount of $51,063.97.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">To collect the \u201cSickle Cell\u201d judgment, Hanlon Park served Harbor Bank, where Sickle Cell maintained two checking accounts, with a writ of garnishment of property at 11:41 am on June 25, 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But, at 2:14 pm that day, the Bank was presented with a Sickle Cell check in the amount of $15,000, made payable to \u201cPetty Cash Cashier\u201d and signed by Torrie Johnson in her capacity as an officer of Sickle Cell. In accordance with that check, Harbor Bank released $15,000 from Sickle Cell\u2019s account and those funds were then converted into a cashier\u2019s check made payable to \u201cTorrie Johnson\u201d and endorsed by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Sometime later, Harbor Bank answered the writ of garnishment, stating that it was \u201cin possession of $5,600.58 in assets\u201d of the judgment debtor, Sickle Cell. When Hanlon Park challenged Harbor Bank\u2019s confession of assets, it was disclosed that the Bank had released $15,000 from Sickle Cell\u2019s accounts approximately two and a half hours after it had been served with Hanlon Park\u2019s writ of garnishment. That caused Hanlon Park to move for judgment against Harbor Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">At the hearing on that motion, Harbor Bank argued that it was not liable to Hanlon Park for disbursing those funds because it was not given a reasonable amount of time to place a \u201chold\u201d on Sickle Cell\u2019s accounts before the funds were withdrawn. According to Harbor Bank, \u201c[i]t takes at least two or three days before a writ of garnishment can be effectuated throughout the bank.\u201d Declaring \u201cI do not see that the law permits the bank any time\u201d the circuit court held Harbor Bank liable for releasing the debtor\u2019s assets \u201cfrom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>moment that the writ of garnishment [was] served.\u201d It then granted Hanlon Park\u2019s motion and entered a judgment for $15,000 plus pre-judgment interest in favor of Hanlon Park.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Harbor Bank contends that the circuit court erred in granting Hanlon Park\u2019s motion for judgment because two and a half hours was not a reasonable amount of time for it to process the writ of garnishment and place a \u201chold\u201d on Sickle Cell\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Initially, we note that \u201cgarnishment is a form of attachment.\u201d <em>Simpson v. Consol. Constr. Servs., Inc., </em>143 Md.App. 606, 619, 795 A.2d 754 (2002), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>372 Md. 434, 813 A.2d 260 (2002); <em>Catholic Univ. of Am. v. Bragunier Masonry Contractors, </em>139 Md.App. 277, 293, 775 A.2d 458 (2001), <em>aff'd, </em>368 Md. 608, 796 A.2d 744 (2002). \u201cIt is \u2018a means of enforcing a judgment,\u2019 which \u2018allows a judgment creditor to recover property owned by the debtor but held by a third- party, the garnishee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simpson, </em>143 Md.App. at 619, 795 A.2d 754 (quoting <em>Parkville Fed. Sav. Bank v. Md. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>343 Md. 412, 418, 681 A.2d 521 (1996)). A writ of garnishment \u201cpreserve[s] the assets of the judgment debtor by creating an \u2018inchoate lien\u2019 th\u00e1t is binding and prevents the garnishee from disposing of those of the assets in his possession until such time as a judgment is entered in the garnishment proceeding.\u201d <em>Catholic Univ., </em>139 Md.App. at 294, 775 A.2d 458. The general rule is that \u201c[o]nce the writ of garnishment is issued and laid in the hands of the garnishee, he is bound to safely keep the assets of the debtor in his possession, together with any additional assets that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>come into his possession up to the time of trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 775 A.2d 458. \u201cHence, if the garnishee surrenders the property after service of the writ but prior to judgment, the garnishee is liable to the judgment creditor for the value of the debtor\u2019s property released.\u201d <em>Parkville Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>343 Md. at 419, 681 A.2d 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">But there is at least one exception to this rule.and that exception is set forth in Md.Code (1975, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 4-303(a) of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), which is almost a word-for-word adoption of \u00a7 4-303(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code. <em>See </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 4-303(a) (1990). CL \u00a7 4-303(a), redacted to exclude extraneous verbiage, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">[A]ny ... legal process served upon, ... a payor bank, comes too late to terminate, suspend, or modify the bank\u2019s right or duty to pay an item or to charge its customer\u2019s account for the item, if the ... legal process is received or served <em>and a reasonable time for the bank to act thereon expires ... </em>after the earliest of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">(1) The bank accepts ... the item</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">(2) The bank pays the item in cash;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">In interpreting statutory language, \u201cwe look first to the words of the statute,\u201d giving them their \u201cnatural and ordinary signification, bearing in mind the statutory aim and objective.\u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 262, 604 A.2d 483 (1992). \u201cIf the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">The words of CL \u00a7 4-303(a) plainly require a bank to secure funds it holds within a \u201creasonable time\u201d after being served with legal process\u2014in this case a writ of garnishment\u2014to prevent the payment of an item. The \u201citem\u201d in this instance was the Sickle Cell check presented by Ms. Johnson, ordering Harbor Bank to disburse $15,000 of Sickle Cell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The unexpressed but implied corollary of this rule is that if the bank is presented with an \u201citem\u201d before it has had a reasonable amount of time to respond to a writ of garnishment, it may properly pay that item. And, under well-established Maryland law, if the payment was proper, the bank, as the garnishee, cannot be liable to the judgment creditor for funds it no longer possesses. <em>Walsh v. Lewis Swimming Pool Constr. Co., </em>256 Md. 608, 610, 261 A.2d 475 (1970) (\u201cIn an attachment action the test of the liability of the garnishee is whether he has funds, property or credits in his hands, the property of the debtor, for which the debtor would have the right to sue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Although our appellate courts have not previously interpreted this section of the Maryland Code, the Supreme Court of Connecticut has <em>in W &amp; D Acquisition, LLC v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>262 Conn. 704, 817 A.2d 91 (2003), having also adopted \u00a7 4-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code and reached the same conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 95. Indeed, in that case, the Connecticut court faced a set of facts similar to those now before us. There, a customer withdrew funds from its account three hours after the bank was served with a pre-judgment garnishment directing it to hold the customer\u2019s funds to secure a potential judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 94. The issue before the Connecticut court was whether the bank was liable for having failed to secure those funds within a \u201creasonable time\u201d after being served with garnishment process. <em>See id. </em>The trial court held that it was not. <em>Id. </em>Applying a \u201cmidnight deadline\u201d provision from another section of the Connecticut Code to the \u201creasonable time\u201d provision, the trial court held that the bank had until midnight on the next banking day to secure the garnished funds. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The Connecticut Supreme Court reversed but only on the ground that the midnight deadline did not apply and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>issue of what was a reasonable amount of time was \u201ca fact-specific inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97. In rejecting the notion that the midnight deadline creates a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d of what is \u201creasonable time,\u201d the Connecticut appellate court pointed to Official Comment 6 to \u00a7 4-803 of Uniform Commercial Code, which also accompanies our state version of that provision. <em>Id. </em>Comment 6 provides: \u201cIn the case of ... legal process the effective time for determining whether [it was] received too late to affect the payment of an item and a charge to the customer\u2019s account by reason of such payment, is receipt plus a reasonable time for the bank to act on [the service of process].... \u201d CL \u00a7 4-303 cmt. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Offering some general guidance as to what is \u201creasonable time,\u201d the comment observes: \u201cUsually a relatively short time is required to communicate to the accounting department advice of one of these events but certainly some time is necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That observation should be kept in mind by the circuit court when this issue is considered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Before concluding our review of this matter, we note that Hanlon Park cites several cases holding that a bank, once served with legal process, must hold the property until the entry of the judgment. <em>Parkville Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>343 Md. at 419, 681 A.2d 521 (\u201cOnce obtained and properly served on the garnishee, a writ of garnishment requires the garnishee to take positive action by holding the property until the entry of judgment in the garnishment action.\u201d); <em>Int\u2019l Bedding Co. v. Terminal Warehouse Co., </em>146 Md. 479, 492, 126 A. 902 (1924) (\u201c[F]rom the time of the garnishment, the goods in the possession of the garnishee ... are considered as <em>in custodia legis, </em>and the garnishee is bound to keep them safely....\u201d); <em>Catholic Univ., </em>139 Md.App. at 293, 775 A.2d 458 (\u201cOnce the writ of garnishment is issued and laid in the hands of the garnishee, he is bound to safely keep the assets of the debtor in his possession....\u201d); <em>Flat Iron Mac Assocs. v. Foley, </em>90 Md.App. 281, 292, 600 A.2d 1156 (1992) (\u201cThe effect of laying the attachment in the hands of the garnishee is to warn and notify her that all property of the debtor ... is subject to the inchoate lien of the attachment by garnishment,\u201d and \u201c[o]nce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>served with a writ of garnishment \u2018it is the garnishee\u2019s duty to hold the attached assets until the entry of a judgment in the garnishment action.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also </em>Paul V. Niemeyer &amp; Linda M. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary 520 (2d ed.1992), (\u201c[T]he garnishee must take immediate precautions to protect the assets.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Although these cases support the general rule that a gar- \u25a0 nishee is bound to secure the judgment debtor\u2019s property from the time it is served with a writ of garnishment until judgment is entered, none of them involved the service of a writ of garnishment upon a bank and CL \u00a7 4-303, which applies in such instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">And finally, we do note the circuit court did appear on several occasions to sympathize with Harbor Bank\u2019s representations that it had exercised reasonable diligence in processing the writ of garnishment. But we also note that no evidence was ever presented by Harbor Bank as to why it takes at least two or three days .to place a hold on an account and no actual finding was ever made by the circuit court that that was a reasonable amount of time to do so. For these reasons, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand this matter to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Harbor Bank raises one other issue. It contends that the circuit court \u201cerred in granting [Hanlon Park\u2019s] motion for judgment because any lien of garnishment of [Hanlon Park] as against [Sickle Cell] is \u2018voided\u2019 by said customer\u2019s bankruptcy filing and related order of the [circuit [c]ourt.\u201d This contention, as stated, is misleading. It was not Sickle Cell, but Torrie Johnson, who filed for bankruptcy. And it was her, not Sickle Cell, against whom the circuit court stayed proceedings. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">JUDGMENT VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">. Sickle Cell subsequently moved to vacate the default judgment. That motion was granted, and the default judgment was vacated. But, later, upon Hanlon Park\u2019s motion the default judgment against Harbor Bank was reinstated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">. Hanlon Park also served a writ of garnishment proceedings on Chevy Chase Bank directed at any Sickle Cell assets held there. That writ is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\">. Harbor Bank also released an additional $5,600 from Sickle Cell's account after the def\u00e1ult judgment against Sickle Cell had been vacated, but before the court struck that order vacating the judgment. The court did not award Hanlon Park this $5,600, and it is not an issue before this Court. !</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">. \"Item\u201d is defined under CL \u00a7 4-104(a)(9) as \u201can instrument or a promise or order to pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment.\u201d An \"order\" is defined under CL \u00a7 3\u2014103(a)(6) as \"a written instruction to pay money signed by the person giving the instruction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
