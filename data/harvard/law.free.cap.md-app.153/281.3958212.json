Both judgments were issued by the Superior Court of California, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>County of Stanislaus, Family Support Division O/B/O Joeann Jones, appellant, against Scott Ricketts, appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The 1998 Child Support Judgment required Ricketts to pay monthly child support of $370 plus arrearages of over $10,000 for Scott Ricketts, Jr., who was bom to Ms. Jones in California on July 24, 1991.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, in February 1999, pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (\u201cUIFSA\u201d), Maryland Code (1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-301 et. seq. of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d), and the Full Faith and Credit Clause, embodied in Art. IV, \u00a7 1 of the United States Constitution, appellant initiated proceedings in the Circuit Court for Carroll County to register and enforce the 1998 Child Support Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In the court below, Ricketts challenged the registration of the Child Support Judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, on February 1, 2002, the circuit court vacated the registration of the Child Support Judgment, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellee was not afforded an opportunity to be heard in California.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">This appeal followed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which appellant poses one question: Did the circuit court violate the United States Constitution and federal and Maryland law by refusing to accord full faith and credit to a properly certified California child support judgment when the record contained no evidence to satisfy the contesting party\u2019s burden of overcoming the strong presumption that an out-of-state child support judgment is valid and enforceable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">For the reasons stated below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In 1990, appellee lived in Maryland with his girlfriend, Joeann Ortiz, now known as Joeann Jones. In August of that year, the couple moved to California. On November 14, 1990, appellee returned to Maryland. The next day, Ms. Jones told appellee that she was pregnant with his child. On July 24, 1991, Scott Ricketts, Jr. was born to Ms. Jones in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On May 6, 1991, during Ms. Jones\u2019s pregnancy, the County of Stanislaus, \u201con behalf of UNBORN CHILD,\u201d filed suit against appellee in the California Superior Court, seeking to establish paternity of the unborn child; to obtain reimbursement for public assistance provided to Ms. Jones; and to obtain child support. The complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe natural mother, Joeann Alice Ortiz, and the defendant, Scott Al[a]n Ricketts, had sexual relations with each other which resulted in the conception.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">. The paternity suit was served on appellee in Maryland on May 11,1991. The suit included a document titled \u201cNotice To Defendant,\u201d which contained the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">You have <em>30 CALENDAR DAYS </em>after this summons is served on you to file a typewritten response at this court. A letter or phone call will not protect you; your typewritten response must be in proper legal form if you want the court to hear your case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">If you do not file your response on time, you may lose the case, and your wages, money and property may be taken without further warning from the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">There are other legal requirements. You may want to call an attorney right away. If you do not know an attorney, you may call an attorney referral service or a legal aid office (listed in'the phone book).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The Notice also included the address of the Superior Court in Modesto as well as the name, address, and. telephone of Donald N. Stahl, District Attorney, County of Stanislaus.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">On May 29, 1991, eighteen days after service of the paternity suit, Ricketts, <em>pro se, </em>signed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss For Lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Of Jurisdiction,\u201d contending that he and Ms. Jones \u201care residents of the State of Maryland and not of the State of California.\u201d In addition, Ricketts attached a \u201cCertificate of Mailing\u201d to his motion, indicating that he mailed a copy to Stahl. Further, Jack D. Leonard, II, Esquire, a Maryland lawyer, signed a cover letter, dated May 29, 1991, and sent the Motion to the Clerk of the Superior Court of California \u201cfor filing.\u201d According to the cover letter, the motion was mailed to the exact address in Modesto that was provided by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">On or about June 10, 1991, the Clerk of the Superior Court apparently returned the motion to dismiss to Ricketts, in care of Leonard. The Clerk included a handwritten note, stating: \u201cNotice must be served on DA; [unreadable] must be signed before a Notary; Motion must be set for hearing or perhaps DA will sign a Stipulation for dismissal.\u201d However, there is no evidence in the record contradicting Ricketts\u2019s certificate of mailing, in which he said he mailed a copy of his motion to the District Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In any event, on June 19, 1991, appellee, <em>pro se, </em>re-submitted his motion to dismiss. Again, Leonard prepared a cover letter, also dated June 19, 1991, indicating that the motion to dismiss was sent by certified mail to Stahl, the District Attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In mailing the motion to Stahl, Leonard followed the Clerk\u2019s directions. Appellee heard nothing further, despite the Clerk\u2019s earlier indication that a hearing \u201cmust\u201d be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Appellant concedes in its brief that the first motion to dismiss \u201cwas timely [filed] and properly addressed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Clerk of the Court, Superior Court of California in Modesto.\u201d However, appellant claims \u201cit was not verified as required.\u201d With regard to the second motion, appellant concedes that it was \u201cverified,\u201d as required, but maintains that it \u201cwas not timely\u201d filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We pause to observe that, by the time the Clerk contacted appellee on June 10, 1991, thirty days had elapsed from the time that appellee was served with the paternity suit. Therefore, it was impossible for appellee to timely file the revised motion. And, it is significant that the Notice did not advise appellee that, if he filed a motion, it had to be verified. Nor has appellant referred us to any legal authority demonstrating that appellee was, indeed, required to file a verified motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">On September 12,1991, a Stanislaus County Superior Court judge signed a default \u201cPaternity Default Judgment And Order,\u201d purportedly based on appellee\u2019s \u201cfailure to appear or answer the complaint filed herein, or take any other proceedings within the time allowed by law....\u201d Filed on September 16, 1991, the Paternity Judgment found that \u201cthe allegations set forth in the complaint are true and correct,\u201d and declared appellee \u201cthe natural father\u201d of an \u201cunborn child, due to be bom August 8,1991.\u201d Further, it stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">Default in the above entitled action having been entered ... and evidence submitted by the plaintiff in their Request and Declaration for Default Judgment, and it appearing to the court that the default of the defendant for failure to appear or answer the complaint filed herein, or take any other proceedings within the time allowed by law has been duly and regularly entered, and the declaration of nonmilitary status having been filed, as provided by law, and evidence, having been introduced in support of the allegations contained in said plaintiffs complaint, and the defendant having been advised of his right to a court appointed attorney if he is indigent, and no request for appointment having been made, the court having duly considered the law and evidence, and it appearing to the court from the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>dence that all of the allegations contained in the complaint are true....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The record does not contain any evidence relied upon by the California court \u201cin support of the allegations\u201d regarding paternity. Appellee did not seek to vacate or challenge the Default Judgment under Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7. 473.5 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In the meantime, on or about May 30, 1991, appellee received a \u201cVoluntary Child Support/Contribution Form\u201d from the South Carolina Department of Social Services. Appellee was asked if he had made any contributions to Ms. Ortiz for the months of February, March, and April 1991, and the inquiry indicated that Ms. Ortiz lived in Conway, South Carolina. In response, Leonard wrote to the Horry County Department of Social Services in Conway on June 11, 1991, stating: \u201cIt amazes me how this woman is qualified to receive benefits from you when she has been living in three different states in the past six months and has filed claims in California and with you for support against my client.\u201d Appellee never heard anything further from South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">On December 19, 1997, James Brazelton, then the District Attorney for the County of Stanislaus, filed in the Superior Court of California a \u201cComplaint Regarding Parental Obligations,\u201d seeking child support for Scott Ricketts, Jr., in the amount of $3700, dating from January 1996, when \u201cpublic assistance [was] first paid.\u201d According to appellant, Ricketts \u201cwas served in Maryland,\u201d although the date of service is unclear. A blank Answer form (Form 1299.04) was included with the Complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The front of the Complaint stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">... This lawsuit says you are the parent of each child named in this complaint and that you must pay child support. The attached proposed Judgment Regarding Parental Obligations (Form 1299.12) names you as a parent of each child listed below and if there is an amount stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>paragraph 6, orders you to pay support for these children. <em>If you disagree with the proposed judgment, you must file the attached Answer form until the Court Clerk u\u00f1thin 30 days </em>of the date that you were served with this complaint. If you do not file an Answ\u00e9r, the proposed judgment will become final and payments may be taken from your pay or other property without further notice. See the attached statement of your rights and responsibilities for more information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Page three of the Complaint is titled \u201cSTATEMENT OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.\u201d Among other things, it informed appellee of his right to a hearing, his right to contest paternity, and his right to a paternity blood test. Further, the Complaint stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>NOTICE TO THE PARENT ASKED TO PAY SUPPORT (OBLIGOR)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\"><em>The district attorney has sued you to determine whether you are the parent and must pay child </em>support.... Carefully read this statement and other papers which you received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\"><em>If you dispute paternity </em>you may ask the Stanislaus County Superior Court Clerk for \u201cSworn Statement by Defendant Requesting appointment of Counsel, Civil Paternity and Order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\"><em>You may contact the district attorney to try to work out an agreement. However, you must still file an answer unthin 30 </em>days----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">* * ' *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\"><em>If you file your Answer, you have the right to a court hearing, </em>to ask questions of any witness \u00bfgainst you, to subpoena witnesses, and to present evidence on your behalf. ... <em>If you deny that you are the parent of the children, you may be scheduled for parentage blood tests. </em>If you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>refuse to submit to the testing the court may determine that you are the parent anyway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">A box outlined on page three of the Complaint contains the following text:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">The proposed judgment will be entered against you unless you file a written answer (Form 1299.04) with the court clerk within 30 days of the date you were served with the complaint. The proposed judgment will be entered whether or not you have a lawyer. If you were served with a form telling you the date of a court hearing, you should go to court on that date. An order may be entered without your input if you do not show up for the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">As we observed, the Notice advised that appellee could contact the District Attorney \u201cto try to work out an agreement.\u201d Through counsel, that is what appellee attempted to do. On January 8, 1998, Leonard wrote to Brazelton, referencing Case No. 168022, captioned <em>\u201cCounty of Stanislaus v. Scott A. Ricketts,\u201d </em>stating that \u201chis client\u201d did \u201cnot admit\u201d paternity and wanted a DNA test. Further, Leonard wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">I am in receipt of documents that were forwarded to my client, Scott A. Ricketts, regarding a child that is alleged to be his, namely, Scott Ricketts, Jr., date of birth 07/24/91.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">My client does not admit or agree that this child is his and would demand a DNA test to determine the issue of paternity. Please advise me as to the procedure you would follow in order to conduct this test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">I would appreciate a response so we can have this matter resolved as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">As appellant acknowledges, the District Attorney never responded to Leonard\u2019s letter. Shortly thereafter, on January 31, 1998, appellee wrote to Brazelton, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">I have received your documents claiming me as the father of the named child born on 7/24/91. I do not admit or agree that this child is mine and demand a DNA test to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>parentage. Please advise me as to the procedure you would follow to conduct this test. I would appreciate a response so we can have this issue resolved as soon as possible. I would also like to request a waiver of the $182.00 for the court cost due to the financial hardship it would cause me at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">According to appellant, no enclosures or other documents were sent with appellee\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The Answer form included a page titled \u201cInformation Sheet For Answer To Complaint,\u201d labeled \u201cpage three of three.\u201d It contained a page of instructions, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">Please follow these instructions to complete the <em>Answer to Complaint or Supplemental Complaint Regarding Parental Obligations </em>(form 1299.04) if you do not have an attorney to represent you. Your attorney, if you have one, should complete this form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">You must file the completed answer and attachments with the court clerk within 30 days of the date you received the <em>Summons and Complaint </em>(form 1299.01).... INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE ANSWER FORM....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">2. You must request a genetic test to determine if you are the parent if you have checked a \u201cno\u201d box in answer to number 1 above....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">H: Hi \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">You must' date the answer form, print your name and sign the form under a penalty of perjury. When you sign the answer form, you are stating that the information you have provided is true and correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">It is undisputed that appellee attempted to complete the Answer form enclosed with the Complaint, although he did not request a hearing. Appellee did not include the names of the parties or the case number on the form, which is undated, but he wrote the child\u2019s name and date of birth on \u201cpage one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>three.\u201d Item one of the form, \u201cParentage,\u201d states: \u201cI am the parent of the following children.\u201d In response to that item, appellee checked the \u201cNo\u201d box. Next to that line, appellee wrote the child\u2019s name and added: \u201cI would like proof of parentage of this child before I send additional personal information.\u201d Box 4 states: \u201cI disagree with the proposed judgment for the following reasons (specify):\u201d Next to that box, appellee wrote: \u201cI am willing to send more income information if parentage can be proven. I am requesting <em>no </em>information on my address, income etc. be given to the child\u2019s mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Appellee also signed an \u201cIncome And Expense Declaration\u201d on January 31, 1998. In it, Ricketts stated that he is an \u201cElectronic Tech\u201d with gross monthly earnings of $1360 and net disposable monthly income of $875.50. Although the record is not clear as to when appellee returned the documents, the record includes a copy of a Return Receipt addressed to the Stanislaus County Court, which indicates that something was delivered to that court by certified mail on February 9, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">On April 30, 1998, appellant filed a First Amended Complaint Regarding Parental Obligations, which merely revised the amount of arrearages. Appellant sought $10,360, dating from 1996, as well as $370 in continuing monthly child support. On page three of the four-page document, the following text is highlighted by insertion in a box: \u201cThe proposed judgment will be entered against you unless you file a written answer (Form 1299.04) with the court clerk within 30 days of the date you were served with the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Ricketts did not file another Answer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, on June 7, 1998, Ricketts signed an Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs. It contained, <em>inter alia, </em>his name and address, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>telephone number, and Case No. 0168022. In addition, appellant completed the financial information form for the waiver. An unspecified item, mailed by appellee to the Stanislaus County court, was received on June 12,1998. The record does not contain any information as to a ruling on appellee\u2019s waiver application.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Thereafter, on September 1, 1998, the California Superior Court, County of Stanislaus, entered a \u201cJudgment Regarding Parental Obligations\u201d against appellee. The record does not reflect that any court proceeding was scheduled or held in regard to the 1998 Child Support Judgment. The 1998 Child Support Judgment ordered appellee to pay $370 a month in child support, beginning May 1, 1998, based on \u201cpresumed income,\u201d and $10,360 in arrears for \u201cthe past periods\u201d of January 1996 through April 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The 1998 Child Support Judgment is a pre-printed form. The first page states: \u201cNOTICE\u2014THIS IS A FINAL JUDGMENT: It is now legally binding.\u201d The form further states: \u201cThis Matter Proceeded As Follows:\u201d It also includes various boxes with accompanying text. The box was checked for the line indicating that the judgment was entered \u201cpursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7 11355.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two other boxes are also checked. The text for one states: \u201cThis order is based on presumed income for the obligor....\u201d The text for the other states: \u201cThis order is based on the attached documents (specify).\u201d The word \u201cworksheet\u201d is inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As noted, on February 26, 1999, appellant filed in the Circuit Court for Carroll County a Request for Registration of Foreign Support Order, seeking to enforce the 1998 Child Support Judgment. According to appellant, certified\u2019 copies of the 1998 Child Support Judgment and the 1991 Paternity Judgment were appended to the Request.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Appellee was personally served on April 20, 1999. On May 5, 1999, he completed, <em>pro se, </em>a pre-printed form titled \u201cRequest for Hearing On Registered Order.\u201d In it, appellee wrote: \u201cPaternity has not yet been established\u201d and \u201cDNA tests need to be performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">After several postponements, the master held a hearing on January 12, 2000,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at which both parties were represented by counsel. At the outset, counsel for appellant referred to the matter as the \u201cUIFSA Petition to Enforce California Orders.\u201d He explained that there were \u201ctwo operative Orders that we are concerned with.... \u201d One was the \u201cPaternity Default Judgment\u201d (Case No. 267113), \u201csigned by the California Court on September 12, 1991____\u201d The other, according to appellant\u2019s lawyer, was the \u201cCalifornia Child Support Order dated August 27th, 1998,\u201d which was filed September 1, 1998, in case 168022.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Appellee\u2019s attorney stated that he had initially advised his client to challenge the Paternity and Child Support judgments in California, \u201cbased on the failure of the [California] Court to properly pursue that case, and his Motions and pleadings that were filed in the case back in 1991 and in 1998 in California.\u201d However, because appellee was unable to raise the necessary funds to contest the matter in California, his lawyer decided to \u201cchallenge this case in Carroll County based upon [F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 ] 10-344, 345, and 346.\u201d By agreement with appellant, appellee\u2019s attorney asked the court to register the Order and stay its enforcement pending a hearing to contest its validity. Appellee\u2019s counsel said: \u201c[W]e intend to ask California to agree to a blood test to challenge this.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Moreover, pursuant F.L. \u00a7 10-346, appellee posited \u201cseveral defenses.\u201d He claimed, \u201cfirst and foremost,\u201d that the California court \u201clacked personal jurisdiction when they entered the Paternity Judgment.\u201d He also asserted that \u201cthis was possibly done under fraud,\u201d because appellee \u201cfiled all the appropriate things that he had to file ... and that they just went ahead and did it anyway.\u201d Further, claiming that Ms. Jones \u201cadmitted she had been seeing other people,\u201d appellee claimed that, under the law of Maryland, he was entitled to a blood test to determine paternity. Appellee\u2019s counsel added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">What we\u2019re believing is that once, and hopefully this case is stayed, or the enforcement is stayed, with a recommendation of blood tests being done, that California will then agree to the blood test.... [W]e cannot make California do anything in this case because they have original exclusive jurisdiction. But it is our hope that they will go along with this, given the problems, especially if Maryland, specifically Carroll County, will refuse to enforce this Order based upon what\u2019s being presented to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The following colloquy is illuminating: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019d like to ask if\u2014 we can do this better informally\u2014if [appellee\u2019s attorney] can tell us at what point Mr. Ricketts ever received a copy of the 1990\u2014September 12th, 1991 Default judgment of Paternity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: He would\u2019ve received that in that time. He\u2019s not denying that he ever received any of the paperwork. He\u2014he would state that after receiving it, he went to see Mr. Leonard, and that Mr. Leonard said: Look, we contested this, you know, it should\u2019ve been done.

But, Your Honor, just so I\u2019m on the record, in response to the Court\u2019s question.

[Appellee\u2019s counsel], from our discussion in the hall, seems to want to get this Court involved in a blood test, and I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re in a position, at all, to rule on Paternity now, or ... in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">I think the most that this Court can choose ultimately to do to Mr. Ricketts best hope [sic] is to say that we are not going to enforce that Order because it doesn\u2019t meet the standards in [F.L. \u00a7 ]10-346.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">I\u2014I think that this Court is in a position where it can\u2019t, obviously, to me, order blood tests, but I think this Court can pass an Order recommending that the California Court order blood tests or DNA tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">But I don\u2019t want us to be in a position\u2014or this Court to be in a position of saying that Mr. Ricketts is not the father. I don\u2019t think we can do that. I think the most this Court can do is say we\u2019re not going to enforce that Order. Whether Mr. Ricketts is the father or not the father is not within the bailiwick of this Court at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Thereafter, in late January 2000, appellee filed a \u201cMotion To Contest The Validity And Enforcement Of Registered Order and Motion to Vacate Registration,\u201d pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 10-344 and 10-346. Numerous exhibits were appended to the motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In the master\u2019s repdrt and recommendation, dated April 18, 2000, she noted that appellee\u2019s counsel had \u201cproffered\u201d the chronology of events beginning with appellee\u2019s return to Maryland in November 1999. The master found: \u201cAt all times [appellee] has questioned personal jurisdiction, contested the paternity of the minor child, and asked for DNA testing.... Your Master finds that [appellee] \u2018... exercised ordinary care to act diligently ... in moving to set aside the paternity judgment.\u2019 <em>Tyrone W. [v. Danielle R., </em>129 Md.App. 260,] 299, 741 A.2d 553 [(1999)]. Therefore, there was no waiver of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>right to seek and obtain blood or genetic testing.\u201d Further, relying on F.L. \u00a7 5-1029, the master found it \u201cappropriate to order genetic testing\u201d for the parties, in order to \u201cdetermine.if the Court may exercise its revisory power\u201d under F.L. \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2)(I)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">On May 17, 2000, the circuit court entered an Order registering in Maryland the 1998 California \u201cJudgment Regarding Parental Obligations.\u201d At the same time, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 10\u2014346(b), the court ordered a stay of enforcement of the Registered Order. In addition, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-1029, the court ordered both parents and the child to submit to genetic testing, to be arranged by the Carroll County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. The court also ordered a hearing on the motion to vacate upon receipt of the genetic testing results. Almost a year later, on May 14, 2001, appellant asked the court to schedule a hearing in regard to the Order of May 17, 2000. Among other things, the attorney said: \u201cThat the initiating tribunal [i.e., California] refuses to cooperate with genetic testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The master held a hearing on August 8, 2001, in regard to appellee\u2019s motion to vacate. Appellee\u2019s counsel represented to the court that appellee had submitted to the blood test, but that Ms. Jones and the child had refused to do so. In addition, appellee\u2019s counsel reiterated the defenses previously presented at the hearing in January 2000. Recounting appellee\u2019s efforts from the outset to challenge paternity, appellee\u2019s lawyer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">It\u2019s our position that when this original pleading came to my client from California, he did everything in his power at that time to contest, oppose, and attempt to obtain proof of paternity. He was served here in Maryland. We believe that he did not have\u2014they did not have personal jurisdiction to put forth the Order. As the Court knows, the paternity\u2014the petition was filed before the child was even bom, that was about May 6th, 1991, and it\u2019s attached as Exhibit One in the Memorandum. On May 11th the Defendant was served\u2014on May\u2014of 1991. On May 29th, 1991, the Defendant, pro se, at that time, filed a Motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Dismiss the Complaint, which is filed as Exhibit Two of the Memorandum. He was represented, locally at that time, by Jack Leonard. And Mr. Leonard received a note from the Court indicating some filing instructions on or about June 4th -which is Exhibit Three of the Memorandum. The Defendant then re-filed his Motion to Dismiss on June 19th, 1991, and that\u2019s Exhibit Four. Without the benefit of a hearing or-\u2014or anything, a ruling on the Motion to Dismiss did not occur, and the Court entered a Default Order on July 19th, declaring the Defendant the father of the minor child, who still had not been born. On May 30th, 1991, the Defendant received information indicating that Miss Jones had filed for support in the ... State of South Carolina. So, at the same time, she was having two cases going on in two different states against my client, and that was Exhibit Five. My client responded to that on about June 11th, 1991, and Mr. Leonard did that on his behalf, that\u2019s Exhibit Six. We allege that there was fraud in obtaining the jurisdiction on my client in\u2014in pursuing the matter in California, and then turning around and then also pursuing the matter in South Carolina at the same time. My client heard nothing for the next six years, when in December of 1997, a Complaint was filed for Child Support in California, Stanislaus County, again, and that\u2019s Exhibit Seven, and they were asking for back support to 1996. The Complaint gave my client instructions on how to contest paternity. Therefore, California, at that point in time, in my opinion, Your Honor, and what we would proffer and argue, is that, when they give him a second chance, or give him a new chance to contest paternity, everything prior to that is null and void, or should be null and void. On January 8th of 1998, Mr. Leonard sent a letter contesting the paternity, and demanding a DNA test. And, on January 31st of 1998, the Defendant filed a response demanding the paternity test and denying paternity\u2014the\u2014and that\u2019s Exhibit Nine. Subsequently, the District Attorney for Stanislaus County amended the Complaint ... but all they did was add arrears back to 1996, and that\u2019s Exhibit Ten. On June 7th of 1998, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Defendant filed for a Waiver of Costs, and then without a hearing, a final Judgment was entered on September 1st, 1998, again, without the benefit of a hearing, or any blood test, paternity.test, even though California had given him that opportunity. Again, I argue, Your Honor, that the State of California lacked personal jurisdiction to enroll that Order at that time because he had contested and did not have\u2014was not given the opportunity for a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Appellee\u2019s lawyer continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">I further raise, Your Honor, that Maryland law provides my client the opportunity to raise any defenses that he would have as the father of the minor child, or the alleged father of the minor child. Under Family Law 5-1038, he\u2019s entitled \u25a0 to a blood test and the case of Tyrone W. versus Danielle R. ____ That case, and all the progeny of that case, clearly indicates that my client\u2019s entitled to a blood test at any time that he requests it basically. Especially in a situation where we have been able to provide, to this Court and wTas also provided to the California Court, the desire to have the blood test, at that time, or DNA testing. He has maintained that he is not the father since 1991, and California has had evidence of that before them, and has elected to ignore my client\u2019s defense of non-paternity. Your Honor, based upon this, we believe that we are clearly entitled to have the registration vacated. They have ignored the personal jurisdiction\u2014or have ignored the claims of my client that he\u2019s not the father. They have failed, now, to abide by Maryland\u2019s ... order to get the blood test which we\u2019ve offered to pay for, which we furthermore offered to drop this matter if, in fact, the child ends up being his, and to work out a payment on all the arrears. And it\u2019s our position, Your Honor, that the Court cannot and should not enforce California\u2019s Order for child support.... Therefore, Your Honor, we\u2019d ask that the registration be vacated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avb\">Counsel for appellant responded that \u201cthe paternity issue has nothing to do with the UIFSA proceeding\u201d pending before the court, and the paternity decree is \u201ccompletely irrelevant\u201d to the UIFSA proceeding. He added: \u201cYour Honor, let\u2019s not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>lose sight of the fact that this is a UIFSA proceeding .... the paternity issue is completely separate and distinct from the UIFSA proceeding.\u201d In the view of appellant\u2019s counsel, both the California paternity decree, and the California child support order are valid, because \u201cnothing that [appellee] claims that he filed with the [California] Court was actually filed with the Court.\u201d Because appellee \u201cnever filed anything with the Court,\u201d appellant insisted that \u201cMaryland is obliged to abide by\u201d the child support order, and give it full faith and credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Further, appellant\u2019s attorney claimed that, despite the language in the Complaint for child support pertaining to the right to challenge paternity, it was not applicable, given the age of the paternity decree. He also explained that \u201cthe California court doesn\u2019t have to have Miss Jones submit to blood testing in California,\u201d in light of \u201cthe valid paternity decree.\u201d Moreover, appellant maintained that if appellee wants to pursue his challenge to the paternity decree \u201che needs to do it in California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The following colloquy is illuminating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">[MASTER]: How do you get around [appellee\u2019s] Exhibit number Nine when, yes, Mr. Ricketts sends this letter addressed to Mr. Brazelton [the District Attorney in California], but clearly fills out the form that says, Answer to Complaint of Supplemental Complaint [sic] Regarding Parental Obligation? It\u2019s dated, he fills it out, he still, at that point, wants proof of parentage which he was never afforded the opportunity to have, never given his due process in California for. How do we get around that? ... [H]ow do we get around that when, um, we afford every opportunity, um, for due process when it comes to something so serious as the parent of a child who may not be the parent of the child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, let me just start by saying that the letter addressed to Mr. Brazelton, as unfair as it may\u2014may seem, they have no affirmative duty to go file that with the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>[MASTER]: So it\u2019s your\u2014it\u2019s your contention, it went\u2014 even this form went to Mr. Brazelton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Went to Mr. Brazelton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APq\">[MASTER]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And as far as the due process rights of Mr.\u2014Mr. Ricketts, the paternity decree was some seven years earlier. In this ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">[MASTER]: When he challenged it seven years earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Right. But, again, it is, um, the opinion of Stanislaus County that that was never\u2014 none of those documents were ever filed with the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">[MASTER]: He files a Motion to Dismiss for lack of Personal Jurisdiction with the Clerk of the Circuit Court on May 29th, 1991, and that\u2019s not sufficient for them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: If you look at the documents that [appellee] has provided, the Clerk of the Court sent something back to [appellee] saying you didn\u2019t do it right, you didn\u2019t follow our rules of procedure, and after that he refiled it. When they said that they\u2014that he didn\u2019t follow their rules of procedure, they listed specific things that he had failed to do. They said that it wasn\u2019t under affidavit, they said that it wasn\u2019t served on the D.A., um, he re-files, with it being under affidavit, and sends it directly to the District Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">[MASTER]: Because on the notice it says, what I have written on here, notice was to be signed, served on the D.A., which I can\u2019t read, declaration, I guess, must be signed before a notary, motion must be set for hearing or perhaps D.A. will sign a stipulation for dismissal. So we\u2014we have a pro se person, yes, he has benefit [sic] of someone here telling him what to send, but he sends it to the D.A., because that\u2019s what he\u2019s told, has to be served on the D.A., sends the exact same motion, and it says, motion must be set for hearing or perhaps the D.A. will sign a stipulation, and they\u2014they don\u2019t think that\u2019s misleading then? And they\u2019re not willing, then, at all, to accept that as his contest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>of the original finding of paternity when this child hadn\u2019t even been bom yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, there are two things I\u2019d like to address about that. One, ... I still maintain that the paternity decree cannot be challenged through this UIFSA process. If he wants to challenge the paternity decree it needs to be done in California. The other thing I would like to add about that is Section 10-346 of the Family Law Article which lists ... the different issues that a Defendant can raise in challenging the registration of an order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">As to the issue of fraud, the following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: [Appellee] has basically raised two issues: lack of personal jurisdiction and fraud. I fail to see how a\u2014what essentially amounts to a procedural screw up amounts to fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">[MASTER]: It\u2019s fraud because [Ms. Jones] also went to [the] South Carolina Department of Social Services and filed for child support there ... when she had already pursued it in California at the same time. Both places she\u2019s asking for it, and at the time, if you carefully read, at that time, they were both living in the State of Maryland, [appellee] testified to that. They were both living in the State of Maryland ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well I would submit to Your Honor that, uh, even if the process in South Carolina is fraudulent, it does not make the procedure in California fraudulent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">[MASTER]: It does if she represented to the State of California she was living there and she wasn\u2019t living there, and she was living in the State of Maryland at the time that she filed. We already know she filed in South Carolina when she was living in the State of Maryland. There\u2019s no\u2014 there\u2019s no indication that she was ... living in the State of California when she filed the original petition when he\u2014 when the child was unborn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, again, I would submit to Your Honor that the Statute clearly makes the burden of proving fraud on the [appellee]. If he is alleging fraud, then he would need to prove that Ms. Jones wasn\u2019t living in California at the time she filed for child support services or filed for the ... paternity decree, and I haven\u2019t heard anything today about that----You had asked me a question about Tyrone W. and the rights that we afford putative fathers in this State ... I want to reiterate that that is completely irrelevant in this proceeding ... California is not Maryland, and they have their own laws and rules about establishing paternity. They have, what is in their minds, a valid paternity decree, and that cannot be challenged in a UIFSA process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Appellee responded: \u201c[T]hey haven\u2019t presented anything but hearsay.\u201d Moreover, appellee\u2019s attorney pointed out that no affidavits, docket sheets, or other evidence was offered to show what was filed with the California court. Appellant\u2019s attorney countered: \u201c[Appellee\u2019s counsel] seeks to shift the burden on me. I don\u2019t have to prove anything. He is the one that has the burden. The statute clearly says that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The master said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALvj\">[M]y concern from the beginning of this was, first of all, there is no equity in the way that Mr. Ricketts was treated by the State of California. But setting that aside for the minute, it\u2019s now a UIFSA case, they\u2019re asking me to enforce an Order that was\u2014um\u2014was obtained in California. There are certain defenses under the UIFSA statute in the State of Maryland that are allowed to be raised when registration or enforcement is requested, and one of those is [this:] is there ... a defense under the law of this State to the remedy sought. There is a defense to Mr. Ricketts in the State of Maryland. He is permitted ... to challenge paternity and challenge the fact that there was not personal jurisdiction over him from the get-go. He has ... challenged it from the beginning, <em>it\u2019s clear that he challenged it from the beginning in all the documents that have been submitted to this Court, </em>and ... there\u2019s some question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>about who he sent it back to, but ... when I see the notes [from the California court] that I\u2019m looking at, it appears to me that, if you\u2019re looking at someone who is pro se and they\u2019re following instructions given by someone, <em>he did what he ivas told to do. </em>He served it on the D.A., it had to [be] signed before a notary, and ... then it says, motion must be set for hearing or perhaps the D.A. will sign a stipulation for dismissal.... <em>[T]hat leaves the door open to the [view that the] contact person was the District Attorney, they got the information, ... they went forward knowing filly that he contested their personal jurisdiction. </em>Then we have the whole other indication from South Carolina. What I find interesting is that South Carolina received a letter advising them of the situation regarding the Plaintiff, Joeann Jones, she was Joeann Ortiz at that time, and we have no further comment from South Carolina. No ... further orders, no further anything. It\u2019s pretty evident to me that she, then, was moving around.... [A]nd there\u2019s never been anything ... presented to indicate that she wasn\u2019t, at one point, living in the State of Maryland. And we have, after Mr. Ricketts sends the response back to Mr. Brazelton in January of 1998, with all the information requested, indicating he will send more information once the paternity has been challenged, he gets a new complaint, again, indicating monthly payments that he had no part in\u2014in developing. He has\u2014he\u2019s been in contact with the State of California and ... <em>the District Attorney\u2019s Office there the entire time, and still no one, no one, contacts him other than by sending him petitions, and then we have a Default Order with, once again, with him raising the issue of, I want a paternity test. </em>And in the State of Maryland he can ask for a paternity test under both the cases. It\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a defense he has in this State and not to mention that equity would afford him that opportunity. It <em>is\u2014it is inequitable that he would have been determined to be a father of a child in 1991, when he originally challenged it, before the child was even bom, and we would wait six years to, then, come forward, again, to try to pursue him for this judgment. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>And the only reason that California has an order, at this point, is after\u2014even after full knowledge of everyone that he was challenging this, each and every time, an order was entered by default.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The master concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">[Biased on the UIFSA' statute in the State of Maryland, under Section 10-346, I\u2019ll vacate the registration because he has a defense that is afforded him under the State of Maryland, and I offered that opportunity to the State of California, and they refused to comply with this Court\u2019s Order which would have at least brought the parties to an equal balance. So I\u2019ll vacate the registration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Thereafter, on August 8, 2001, the master issued the \u201cReport and Recommendations of Master,\u201d in which she recounted the chronology of events. Among other things, the master specifically found that appellee \u201cfollowed the instructions given to him\u201d in the note of June 4, 1991, sent by the Stanislaus County Court. Moreover, the master found that appellee repeatedly sought to contest the paternity and child support proceedings in California and requested DNA testing. Nevertheless, \u201cwithout the benefit of a hearing on any of the objections [appellee] had previously raised,\u201d the California court entered a judgment against appellee on September 1, 1998, for child support. Therefore, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 10-346(a)(1) and (5), the master concluded that appellee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB4\">has appropriately raised the following defenses available to him: \u201c... (1) the issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party ...\u201d and <em>\u201c... </em>(5) there is a defense under the law of this State to the remedy sought.\u201d 8. Your Master finds that at all times, the defendant has questioned personal jurisdiction, contested the paternity of the minor child, and asked for DNA testing.... [A]nd Your Master finds that the Defendant, \u201c... exercised ordinary care to act diligently ... in moving to set aside the paternity judgment.\u201d ... Therefore, there was no waiver of his right to seek and obtain blood or genetic testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Accordingly, the master recommended that the court grant the motion to vacate the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Appellant tiled exceptions on August 15, 2001, claiming that the master\u2019s recommendation was \u201ccontrary to both the law and the evidence.\u201d Again, appellant argued that paternity could not be challenged in a UIFSA registration proceeding, and that appellee failed to establish any of the defenses under F.L. \u00a7 10-346. Appellee timely responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The circuit court held a hearing on the exceptions on October 3, 2001. At the hearing, counsel for appellant reiterated that \u201cthe burden of proving any of these [defenses] ... [is] on the party seeking to vacate the registration.\u201d Further, appellant asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">Now, when the parties were before [the master], [appellee] makes a bald allegation that California had no personal jurisdiction over him and ... provided no evidence to support that allegation. The same is true of the allegation that the Order was obtained by fraud. Again [appellee] has the burden of proving these items ... there was no evidence presented to [the] Master on which to base that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">The Master in her Report and Recommendation does, however, state that based on the case of <em>Tyrone W. </em>... a father has the right to ask for genetic testing at any time. And, I really don\u2019t disagree that that\u2019s what that case says. What I disagree, however, with is that I don\u2019t believe that that is a defense [to a UIFSA proceeding] under the laws of this [S]tate as contemplated by [F.L.] Section 10-346(a)(5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">Now, the reason I say that is because I believe that Maryland has a Constitutional duty to give full faith and credit to the California paternity adjudication. If [appellee] has a problem with the paternity finding, if he feels that somehow his due process rights were violated, in that Default Order\u2014that the Order of Paternity was by default, then I believe he needs to challenge that in California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">If the Master is correct, that a person can raise paternity in a [UIFSA] registration proceeding, then, it makes com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>pletely meaningless a paternity finding of any other jurisdiction that happens to not do D.N.A. testing, and it places the Bureau of Support Enforcement in this State in the precarious position of having to coordinate D.N.A. testing between Maryland and a foreign jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Appellee responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The one thing he failed to address, and this is very important in terms of the personal jurisdiction and the fraudulent aspect of the defenses, is that in May of 1991, Mr. Ricketts received correspondence from the State of South Carolina attempting to pursue paternity and a judgment against him, which was prior to' the involvement of the State of California, which, at that point, then, would eliminate the jurisdiction\u2014or potentially limit the jurisdiction of the State of California that they would have over, not only Mr. Ricketts, but also their own client, Ms. Joanne Jones....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">You also have the issues that he contested all along. <em>He did everything the State of California ... asked him to do with regard to contesting the Paternity and the Child Support Orders that were eventually entered by default.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">Interestingly, the 1996\u2014or the <em>1998 Petition gave him the opportunity to raise paternity again. They actually told him how to do it. He did it and they ignored him again and entered a Default Order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">Therefore, our arguments as to jurisdiction and fraud\u2014 they\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re kind of together. It\u2019s almost a symbiotic relationship in that we have South Carolina coming after him, then we have California coming after him and saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t care what you do, we\u2019re going to enter a default anyway.\u201d <em>He did everything he was supposed to do.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">That, eventually, leads us to the defenses in Maryland under 346 Section 5, which Maryland has now allowed fathers to contest paternity. That is a defense to child support and paternity in the State of Maryland. The statute is clear, it says, \u201cany defenses in the State of Maryland to the remedy sought.\u201d And, that\u2019s one of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Now, California has made themself available of the Maryland statute by pursuing it this way; therefore, they\u2019re also subject to Maryland\u2019s defenses that can be raised. And, ... one of those that we can raise is the defense of paternity. We\u2019ve raised it, Mr. Ricketts has submitted to the paternity test because there was a previous Order to do it. California has refused to go along with Maryland\u2019s Order, which I believe you signed. Your Honor, saying, \u201cDo the D.N.A. testing.\u201d We\u2014we appeared, we did it, they\u2019ve refused. We\u2019ve done everything, Your Honor, that we can to contest this paternity and go forward....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated January 24, 2002, the circuit court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Defendant has maintained since 1991 that he is not the father of the minor child in question. The basis for Defendant\u2019s belief that he may not be the father of the child is that while the parties were dating Ms. Jones told him that she was seeing other men and had been sleeping with them. Defendant alleges that he and Ms. Jones reconciled and moved to California. Defendant further alleges that while in California he suspected Ms. Jones was seeing someone else and confronted her. Soon after that confrontation he returned to Maryland. He was later notified by Ms. Jones that she was pregnant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The court concluded that the evidence presented to the master established that California did not have personal jurisdiction and that the California paternity order was obtained by fraud. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">Defendant alleges that the issuing tribunal, the Superior Court of California, County of Stanislaus, Family Support Division, did not have personal jurisdiction over [appellee] and that the Order was obtained by fraud. Specifically, [appellee] alleges that he is not the father of the minor child and that under Maryland law he is entitled to a blood test to determine paternity....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The Full Faith and Credit Clause requires that each state accord a judgment of another state as much respect and credit as it would receive in the rendering state. However, a court need not grant full faith and credit to a judgment that was procured by fraud, i.e., a fraud that deprived [appellee] of his opportunity to appear and defend. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICT OF LAWS \u00a7 106(1969).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">The State argues that the paternity issue is separate and distinct from the UIFSSA proceeding and that [appellee\u2019s] allegations regarding fraud are irrelevant in this proceeding. However, <em>the evidence indicates that [appellee] repeatedly attempted to contest this matter and was ignored.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Accordingly, the court found that, upon review of the transcript of August 8, 2001, \u201cthe defenses asserted by [appellee] were established by the evidence heard by the Master.\u201d Relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on F.L. \u00a7 10-846 and <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000), the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s Exceptions and granted appellee\u2019s Motion to Vacate. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (\u201cFFCCSOA\u201d), and the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (\u201cUIFSA\u201d), because \u201cit vacated the registration of a properly certified California child support order and underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ing paternity judgment without requiring appellee, Scott Ricketts, to present any evidence to sustain his burden of proving the order [and judgment] invalid.\u201d Appellant asserts that UIFSA \u201crequired the circuit court to accord the California judgment a presumption of validity,\u201d and that FFCCSOA required the circuit court to enforce the California order according to its terms, so long as \u201cCalifornia had subject matter and personal jurisdiction and provided the contestants reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d According to appellant, because \u201cparentage is not a defense under UIF-SA,\u201d the circuit court \u201cerred by relying on [appellee\u2019s] unconfirmed belief that he might not be the father.\u201d Moreover, appellant maintains that appellee had the burden of proving any defenses, and was thus obligated to present affirmative evidence that California \u201clacked personal jurisdiction, or that the judgment was obtained by fraud that denied him an opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We begin with a review of the two statutes that are at the center of this case. One is a federal law known as the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (\u201cFFCCSOA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B (1994 &amp; Supp.1998). The other is known as the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act or \u201cUIFSA,\u201d which is codified in Maryland in the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code, at F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 10-301 to 10-359.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">FFCCSOA was first enacted by Congress in 1994. It seeks to ensure that child support orders receive full faith and credit in sister states. <em>See State ex rel. George v. Bray, </em>130 N.C.App. 552, 503 S.E.2d 686, 689 (1998); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B. Moreover, the provisions of the FFCCSOA are \u201cbinding on all states and supersede any inconsistent provisions of state law.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Otte, </em>123 N.C.App. 585, 474 S.E.2d 131, 134 (1996), <em>review denied, </em>345 N.C. 180, 479 S.E.2d 204 (N.C.1996); <em>see Wilkie v. Silva, </em>141 N.H. 461, 685 A.2d 1239, 1241 (1996)(same); <em>State v. Fleet, </em>679 So.2d 326, 329 (Fla.Ct.App.1996); <em>Bobbs v. Cline, </em>116 Ohio App.3d 46, 686 N.E.2d 556, 559 (1997). Thus, any inconsistencies between FFCCSOA and state law \u201cmust be resolved in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>FFCCSOA.\u201d <em>Tepper v. Hoch, </em>140 N.C.App. 354, 536 S.E.2d 654, 659 (2000). <em>Accord Bednarsh v. Bednarsh, </em>282 N.J.Super. 482, 660 A.2d 575 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As one court has explained, FFCCSOA \u201cis similar to UIFSA both in terms of structure and intent. FFCCSOA similarly obligates states to enforce, according to its terms, a child support order issued by another state which is made consistent with the Act\u2019s jurisdiction and due process standards.\u201d <em>Gentzel v. Williams, </em>25 Kan.App.2d 552, 965 P.2d 855, 860 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">UIFSA works together with FFCCSOA \u201cto facilitate the enforcement of child support orders among the states.\u201d <em>Harbison v. Johnston, </em>130 N.M. 595, 28 P.3d 1136, 1143 (2001).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Bray, </em>503 S.E.2d at 689 (\u201cUIFSA is state law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>designed to facilitate the collection of child support in interstate cases.\u201d). <em>See also </em>Patricia W.

It was intended to address the problem of multiple support orders issued by multiple states as to the same child. <em>See </em>Patricia W. Hatamyar, <em>Critical Applications and Proposals for Improvement of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, </em>71 St. John\u2019s L.Rev. 1 (1997); Levy and Hynes, <em>Highlights of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, </em>83 Ill. B.J. 647 (1995). Congress required all states to adopt UIFSA in its entirety by January 1, 1998, to remain eligible for federal funding for child support services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(f)(1996 Supp.). Therefore, UIFSA has been adopted by every state and the District of Columbia. <em>See </em>Hatamyar, 25 Okla. City U.L.Rev. at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">UIFSA provides procedural and jurisdictional rules for interstate child support proceedings, including the enforcement of foreign child support orders. Among other things, UIFSA \u201cimplements the \u2018one-order system.\u2019 This means that only one state\u2019s order governs, at any given time.... This necessarily requires all other states to recognize that order and to refrain from modifying it unless the first state has lost jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Hatamyar, </em>25 Okla. City U.L.Rev. at 515-516. \u201cUnder this proposition, only one state controls the support obligation, and once that state obtains jurisdiction, it then has continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the parties.\u201d <em>United States of America v. Kramer, </em>225 F.3d 847, 855 (7th Cir.2000)(citing <em>Supporting Our Children: A Blueprint for Reform, U.S. Commission on Interstate Child Support\u2019s Report to Congress </em>232 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Under UIFSA, \u201cA support order ... issued by a tribunal of another state may be registered in this State for enforcement.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 10-340. \u201cA registered order issued in another state is enforceable in the same manner and is subject to the same procedures as an order issued by a tribunal of this State.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 10-342(b). <em>See also, e.g., Goens v.

Thus, \u201cFFCCSOA ... is intended to work in tandem with the UIFSA and essentially mirrors its jurisdictional concepts.\u201d <em>Harbison, </em>28 P.3d at 1142.

It provides, in part: \u201cFull faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State.\u201d <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 (2003) (\u201c[J]udici\u00e1l proceedings ... shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States .... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State ... from which they are taken.\u201d). To comply with this constitutional directive, \u201c \u2018the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Underwriters Nat\u2019l.

Sherrer, </em>334 U.S. 343, 355, 68 S.Ct. 1087, 92 L.Ed. 1429 (1948), the Supreme Court elucidated the concept, stating: \u201cThe full faith and credit clause is one of the provisions incorporated into the Constitution by its framers for the purpose of transforming an aggregation of independent, sovereign States into a nation.\u201d And, as the Supreme Court said in <em>Milwaukee County v. M.E. White Co., </em>296 U.S. 268, 277, 56 S.Ct. 229, 80 L.Ed. 220 (1935), the clause served to alter</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and ... make[s] them integral parts of a single nation throughout which a remedy upon a just obligation might be demanded as of right, irrespective of the state of its origin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Similarly, in <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, </em>320 U.S. 430, 439-40, 64 S.Ct. 208, 88 L.Ed. 149 (1943), the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">[T]he clear purpose of the full faith and credit clause [is] to establish throughout the federal system the salutary principle of the common law that a litigation once pursued to judgment shall be as conclusive of the rights of the parties in every other court as in that where the judgment was rendered, so that a cause of action merged in a judgment in one state is likewise merged in every other ... Because there is full faith and credit clause a defendant may not a second time challenge the validity of the plaintiffs right which has ripened into a judgment and a plaintiff may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>not for his single cause of action secure a second or a \u25a0greater recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Nevertheless, there are limitations on the principles of full faith and credit, consistent with \u201cthe basic structure of our Nation as a union of States....\u201d <em>Imperial Hotel, Inc. v. Bell Atlantic Tri-Con Leasing Corp., </em>91 Md.App. 266, 270, 603 A.2d 1371 (1992). \u201cChief among these limitations is the caveat ... that a \u2018judgment of a court in one State is conclusive upon the merits in a court in another State only if the court in the first State had power to pass on the merits\u2014had jurisdiction, that is, to render the judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Underwriters, </em>455 U.S. at 704, 102 S.Ct. 1357 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Of significance here, in order to obtain full faith and credit, the proceedings of another state must satisfy \u201cthe minimum procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 481, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982); see <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v.

Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 111, 84 S.Ct. 242, 11 L.Ed.2d 186 (1963), the Supreme Court addressed the limits on one state\u2019s power to enforce a judgment' obtained in another state, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">[W]hile it is established that a court in one State, when asked to give effect to the judgment of a court in another State, may constitutionally inquire into the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction to render that judgment, the modem decisions of this Court have carefully delineated the permissible scope of such inquiry. From these decisions there emerges the general rule that a judgment is entitled to full faith and credit\u2014even as to questions of jurisdiction\u2014when the second court\u2019s inquiry discloses that those questions have been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the court which rendered the original judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Maryland has long recognized that valid judgments of another state concerning domestic matters are generally entitled to full faith and credit in this State. <em>See, e.g., Rethorst v. Rethorst, </em>214 Md. 1, 13, 133 A.2d 101 (1957) (\u201c \u2018An award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>custody, like any other judgment or decree of a competent court, is entitled to recognition and enforcement in other states.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>McKay v. Paulson, </em>211 Md. 90, 95, 126 A.2d 296 (1956) (stating that a foreign divorce decree \u201c \u2018must be presumed to be valid and given full faith and credit\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018until it is declared to be invalid by a competent court.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Miles, </em>132 Md.App. at 78, 750 A.2d 729 (\u201cA sister state\u2019s judicial findings of fact, as well as conclusions of law, must be afforded full faith and credit in Maryland, unless and until judicially impeached.\u201d); <em>Sami v.

Stinson, </em>983 P.2d 736, 741 (Alaska 1999)(\u201cA valid final judgment in one state is ordinarily entitled to full faith and credit in its sister states. The FFCCSOA expressly requires that a child support order be enforced if it complies with the FFCCSOA\u2019s requirements.\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of Yuro, </em>192 Ariz. 568, 968 P.2d 1053, 1057 (1998) (noting that, under FFCCSOA, \u201cwhen two or more child support orders have been issued with respect to an obligor and child, a court must recognize the order from the court with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of Comer, </em>14 Cal.4th 504, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 155, 927 P.2d 265, 282 (1996)(recognizing that the purpose of the FFCCSOA is to create uniformity among states in enforcing child support orders); <em>Linn v.

Writing for this Court in <em>Imperial Hotel, </em>91 Md.App. at 270, 603 A.2d 1371, Judge Harrell said: \u201cIn a suit to enforce the judgment of another state the jurisdiction of the foreign court [which rendered it] is opeh to judicial inquiry.\u201d <em>See Adam v. Saenger, </em>303 U.S. 59, 62, 58 S.Ct. 454, 82 L.Ed. 649 (1938) (same); <em>Renwick v. Renwick, </em>24 Md.App. 277, 287, 330 A.2d 488 (1975)(\u201c[I]n a suit to enforce a foreign judgment, the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it is open to judicial inquiry ... If the rendering court acted without jurisdiction, the full faith and credit clause does not operate and the foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>judgment is of no force or effect.\u201d). <em>Cf. </em>Maryland Code (2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-801 et. seq. of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (the \u201cUniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act\u201d) (defining in C.J. \u00a7 11-801 that a \u201cforeign judgment\u201d is \u201ca judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or any other court that is entitled to full faith and credit in this State\u201d); Rule 2-623 (pertaining, <em>inter alia, </em>to the recording of foreign judgments that are \u201centitled to full faith and credit in this State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">This Court recognized in <em>Imperial Hotel </em>that, \u201cbefore one state court is bound by a judgment rendered by a court in another state, it may inquire into the propriety of a foreign court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction. If the foreign court did not have jurisdiction, full faith and credit need not be given.\u201d 91 Md.App. at 270-71, 603 A.2d 1371. <em>See also Dixon v. Keeneland Associates, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 308, 313, 604 A.2d 502, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 625, 612 A.2d 256 (1992). Therefore, \u201c[t]he courts of this State are not bound ... by determinations of jurisdiction made by the courts of other states. Rather, they may make their own independent examination.\u201d <em>Imperial Hotel, </em>91 Md.App. at 272, 603 A.2d 1371. As the Court underscored in <em>Imperial Hotel, </em>\u201c[t]he power of the state of Maryland to examine into whether, under [foreign] law, the court of that state which rendered the judgment had authority to do so, is beyond question.\u201d 91 Md.App. at 270-71, 603 A.2d 1371. <em>See also Staley v. Staley, </em>251 Md. 701, 705, 248 A.2d 655 (1968) (\u201cThe courts of Maryland are not bound by an unfounded recital of a jurisdictional fact ... found in the record of a court of another state and may make their own independent examination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">On the other hand, \u201cthe full faith and credit clause of the Constitution precludes a party from attacking a decree on jurisdictional grounds in the courts of a sister state where the party participated in the original proceedings, was accorded full opportunity to context the jurisdictional issues, and where the decree was not susceptible to a jurisdictional attack in the courts of the rendering state.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>91 Md.App. at 313, 604 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>A.2d 502. We pointed out in <em>Dixon, id. </em>at 314, 604 A.2d 502, that, \u201c[a]s the Supreme Court' has previously held, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>must be applied to questions of jurisdiction in cases arising in state courts involving the application of the full faith and credit clause where, under the law of the state in which the original judgment was rendered, such adjudications are not susceptible to collateral attack.\u201d <em>See also Sherrer, </em>334 U.S. at 351-52, 68 S.Ct. 1087; <em>Jessica G. v. Hector M., </em>337 Md. 388, 404, 653 A.2d 922 (1995) (\u201cunder the Maryland law of conflict of laws, the <em>res judicata </em>effect to be given to the judgment of a court of a foreign state is the <em>res judicata </em>effect that that judgment has in the state where the judgment was rendered.\u201d); <em>Rourke v. Amchem Products, Inc., </em>153 Md.App. 91, 835 A.2d 193 (2003) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In this case, appellee never litigated in California the issue of whether the California courts had jurisdiction or otherwise properly entered default judgments against appellee in 1991 and 1998. Therefore, there is no <em>res judicata </em>issue here. <em>See Imperial Hotel, </em>91 Md.App. at 272 n. 1, 603 A.2d 1371. Accordingly, the circuit court was clearly entitled to determine whether California properly exercised its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">As the Court explained in <em>Imperial Hotel, </em>there is a \u201ctwo-step process\u201d involved in determining whether the foreign court properly exercised jurisdiction. 91 Md.App. at 273, 603 A.2d 1371. First, \u201cthe trial court must determine whether the [foreign state] purports to authorize the assertion of personal jurisdiction ... to the full limits allowed by constitutional due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the Maryland court must determine \u201cwhether the exercise of jurisdiction permitted by the [foreign] statute, violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 603 A.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Relying upon California\u2019s long arm statute, appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Having engaged in conduct in California that may have resulted in the conception of a child, Mr. Ricketts had sufficient contacts with that state to be within reach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>California\u2019s long arm jurisdiction. Having been served in Maryland, he had sufficient notice of the action against him. Those facts, coupled with the presumptively valid judgment filed in the circuit court, proved conclusively that California had jurisdiction. The circuit court erred by concluding otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We are satisfied that the first prong of the two-step process was satisfied here; California acquired <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over appellee pursuant to its long arm statute. Appellee allegedly had sufficient minimal contacts with California so that the exercise of jurisdiction under its long arm statute would not offend \u201c \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>See International Shoe Co. v.

Minnich, </em>483 U.S. 574, 580, 107 S.Ct. 3001, 97 L.Ed.2d 473 (1987).

The procedure that is due to a putative father ought to ensure that those interests are adequately protected by measures that minimize an erroneous declaration of paternity, with all of its emotional consequences, and the corresponding burden of financial support for the child until the age of majority. That did not happen in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We need not repeat the factual summary that we previously set forth. Indeed, appellant\u2019s attorney conceded below that appellee\u2019s \u201crecitation\u201d of the facts \u201cis pretty accurate. This is really just a question of statutory construction. We really don\u2019t disagree too much about the underlying facts.\u201d Therefore, we shall only highlight a few of the facts that undergird our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Both the District Attorney and the California court were aware of appellee\u2019s position as early as 1991. On May 29, 1991, some eighteen days after appellee was initially served with the California paternity complaint, appellee made his first attempt to contest the proceedings, by filing a motion to dismiss. It is undisputed that appellee\u2019s response to the 1991 paternity suit was timely. Nevertheless, the Clerk of the court returned appellant\u2019s motion because it was not verified. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>However, the instructions that appellee received from the court with the complaint did not direct him to file a verified response. Nor has appellant shown that appellee was actually required under California law to file a verified motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">At the same time, the Clerk advised appellee that the District Attorney may enter a \u201cStipulation for dismissal\u201d and that the \u201cMotion <em>must </em>be set for hearing....\u201d (Emphasis added). In our view, those comments would have suggested to a reasonable person that a hearing would be scheduled, without further action required by appellee. Yet, the record does not reflect that any such hearing was either scheduled or held.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">When the Clerk returned the, original motion to dismiss, the Clerk also wrote: \u201cNotice must be <em>served </em>on DA.\u201d (Emphasis added). In our view, a reasonable person could have understood that comment as a directive to re-file the motion with the District Attorney. Indeed, that is exactly how appellee\u2019s lawyer <em>at that time </em>interpreted the instruction; he sent the verified motion to the District Attorney. As appellee\u2019s new lawyer observed at the exceptions hearing on October 3, 2001,-appellee\u2019s prior lawyer merely followed the instructions of the Clerk\u2019s Office when, in 1991, he sent the motion to the District Attorney. Appellee\u2019s lawyer explained that the Clerk\u2019s letter told appellee to \u201ccertify it to the District Attorney\u2019s Office, and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Subsequently, without the benefit of a hearing or a ruling on appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the paternity case, the California court entered a Paternity Judgment in 1991, by default, declaring appellee the father of an unborn child. The master and the circuit court agreed with appellee that California consistently failed to provide appellee with an \u201copportunity to appear and defend.\u201d As we see it, those findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">With respect to appellant\u2019s claim that the second motion was untimely filed, it is hard to fault appellee for that circumstance. Appellee was served with the suit on May 11, 1991. However, the the Clerk did not return appellee\u2019s original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>motion until on or about June 10, 1991. By that point, thirty days had elapsed. Thus, by the time the first motion was returned, it was already too late for appellee to re-file it within thirty days of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Thereafter, the California court entered a Paternity Judgment against appellee, by default. Six years elapsed before appellee heard again from California. On December 19, 1997, the California court served appellee with the child support suit. The California court informed appellee that he had the right to a hearing, to contest the paternity of the child, and the right to a blood test. The notice stated: \u201cIf you file an Answer, you have a right to a court hearing, to ask questions of any witness against you, to subpoena witnesses, and to present evidence on your behalf.\u201d Appellee was also informed: \u201cIf you deny that you are the parent of the children, you may be scheduled for parentage blood tests.\u201d The California court also warned appellee: \u201cYou may contact the district attorney to try and work out an agreement. However, you must still file an answer within 30 days.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Through a letter sent by appellant\u2019s attorney to the Stanislaus County District Attorney on January 8, 1998, appellee requested a DNA test to determine paternity. When he did not receive a response, appellee personally wrote to the District Attorney. Moreover, appellee subsequently completed at least part of the three page Answer form, indicating that the he was not the father of the child. He wrote:- \u201cI would like proof of parentage of this child before I send additional personal information.\u201d In addition, appellee said: \u201cI am willing to send more income information if parentage can be proven. I am requesting <em>no </em>information on my address, income etc. be given to the child\u2019s mother.\u201d Appellee also submitted the requested financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On April 30, 1998, the District Attorney filed an amended complaint, revising the amount of arrearages. Appellee did not submit a new answer, apparently because only the amount of arrearages had changed. However, in June 1998 appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>submitted an application for a waiver of court fees. He did not receive a response. Yet, a default judgment regarding parental support obligations was entered against appellee on September 1, 1998, for more than $10,000 in child support arrears. It is that judgment which California now seeks to enforce in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Appellant insists that the 1991 Paternity Judgment has nothing to do with the \u00cd998 Child Support Judgment, and contends that it would be erroneous for us to consider the Paternity Judgment in any analysis as to the validity of the Child Support Judgment. Appellant relies on F.L. \u00a7 10-327 to support its claim that paternity is not a defense to a UIFSA action. As we noted, F.L. \u00a7 10-327 provides that a \u201cparty whose parentage ... has been previously determined by or <em>pursuant to law </em>may not plead nonparentage as a defense .... \u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See Reid v. Dixon, </em>136 N.C.App. 438, 524 S.E.2d 576 (2000) (\u201cUnder North Carolina\u2019s enactment of [UIFSA], a party whose parentage of a child has been previously determined under law may not plead parentage as a defense in a proceeding to enforce the payment of child support.\u201d). Appellant also points out that the Legislature \u201cdid not revise\u201d F.L. \u00a7 10-346, \u201csetting out the allowable defenses to registration and enforcement of another state\u2019s child support order under UIFSA.\u201d Therefore, appellant contends that, based on the application of F.L. \u00a7 10-327 and F.L. \u00a7 10-346, \u201c[p]arentage is not a permissible basis for refusing to register and enforce a foreign child support order,\u201d and the circuit court had no authority in this UIFSA case to order paternity testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We see it differently. In the context of this case, the 1991 and 1998 judgments are inextricably intertwined. Without question, the 1991 Paternity Judgment spawned the 1998 Child Support Judgment. Moreover, F.L. \u00a7 10-327 does not preclude appellee\u2019s challenge. Indeed, appellant overlooks a. key phrase in the text of that provision: parentage must have been previously determined \u201cpursuant to law.\u201d Appellee has consistently maintained that the 1991 Paternity Judgment was not valid, because he repeatedly sought to challenge paternity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>but the California court ignored his efforts; therefore, appellee was not afforded the opportunity to be heard. If appellee was, indeed, denied an opportunity to be heard, as due process requires, it follows that paternity was not established \u201cpursuant to law,\u201d and appellant cannot then rely on F.L. \u00a7 10-327.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In the UIFSA proceeding to enforce the 1998 Judgment, appellee had the statutory right to contest the validity or enforcement of a registered order under F.L. \u00a7 10-345(a)(\u201cThe nonregistering party may seek to vacate the registration, to assert any defense to an allegation of noncompliance with the registered order, or to contest the remedies being sought or the amount of any alleged arrearages pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 10-346 of this subtitle ...\u201d). The statute allows appellee, the party contesting enforcement of the registered order, to assert one or more of seven enumerated defenses. F.L. \u00a7 10-346. Appellee was entitled to contest the foreign judgment on the basis of a lack of personal jurisdiction, fraud, and \u201ca defense under the law of this State to the remedy sought.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 10-346(a). As this Court said in <em>Osteoimplant Technology, Inc. v. Rathe Productions, Inc., </em>107 Md.App. 114, 666 A.2d 1310 (1995), \u201c \u2018After a foreign judgment has been duly filed, the grounds for reopening or vacating it are limited to lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction of the rendering court, fraud in procurement (extrinsic), satisfaction, <em>lack of due process, </em>or other grounds that make the judgment invalid or unenforceable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119-20, 666 A.2d 1310 (citing <em>Matson v. Matson, </em>333 N.W.2d 862, 867 (Minn.1983))(emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 648, 672 A.2d 623 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Before full faith and credit can be given to a judgment of the California court under UIFSA, the circuit court must be satisfied that appellee was accorded due process. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B(c)(2)(\u201cA child support order made by a court of a State is made consistently with this section if ... reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard is given to the contestants.\u201d). We perceive no error in the circuit court\u2019s finding that appellee was \u201cdeprived\u201d of \u201chis opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>appear and defend.\u201d Because appellee was not afforded due process in connection with either the 1991 Paternity Judgment or the 1998 Child Support Judgment, the court below properly declined to accord full faith and credit to either judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In light of our conclusion, we need not resolve appellant\u2019s claim that \u201cthe circuit court\u2019s reliance on <em>Tyrone W. </em>and <em>Langston </em>is misplaced.\u201d <em>See Tyrone W. v. Danielle R., </em>129 Md.App. 260, 278-79, 741 A.2d 553 (1999), <em>aff'd. sub nom, Langston, v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 412-13, 754 A.2d 389 (2000); <em>see also Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 788 A.2d 609 (2002). F.L. \u00a7 5-1038 and F.L. \u00a7 5-1029 (generally permitting a declaration of paternity entered by a Maryland court to be set aside \u201c \u2018... if a blood or genetic test ... establishes the exclusion of the individual\u2019 \u201d as the father). Our decision, however, does not preclude further litigation in the appropriate forum to establish paternity and child support pursuant to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Williams, supra, 25 </em>Kan.App.2d 552, 965 P.2d 855, the Kansas court considered whether Kansas had jurisdiction to modify and reduce an Arizona child support order under UIFSA or FFCCSOA. In its discussion, the court elucidated the differences between UIFSA and URESA, noting that UIFSA was intended to \"further national uniformity regarding the enforcement of child support orders.... \u201d <em>Id.. </em>at 858. The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">Both URESA and UIFSA were promulgated and intended to be used as procedural mechanisms for the establishment, modification, and enforcement of child and spousal support obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u2022 \"How does the new Act differ from URESA? ... Probably the most significant improvement offered by UIFSA is the elimination of the multiple-order system existing under URESA. Orders entered under URESA have been defined as additional to, and not replacements of, prior support orders. Thus at any particular time, two or more orders covering the same child might exist with different levels of support set by each one. When combined with the general family law rule permitting modification of existing child support orders on the basis of changed circumstances, the resultant chaos and confusion is certainly understandable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">By contrast, UIFSA adopts the concept of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to establish and modify the levels of child support due a particular child. Thus, once a court or administrative agency enters a support decree with jurisdiction, it is the only body entitled to modify if so long as it retains continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the Act.
