And those payments were paid, according to the Division, at the exorbitant annual interest rate of 730%.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In due course, the Division brought charges against the appellants, alleging that they had made unlicensed and usurious \u201cloans\u201d in violation of Maryland\u2019s Consumer Loan Law, Md.Code (2000 Repl.VoL, 2003 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-301 to-317 of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), and had, by misrepresenting these \u201cloans\u201d as \u201csale-leasebacks\u201d, engaged in \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practices\u201d in violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, CL \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 to 501. This matter was then referred to an administrative law judge for a hearing (\u201cALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">At the conclusion of that hearing, the ALJ found that the \u201csale-leaseback\u201d was not a \u201cloan,\u201d that appellants, individual and corporate, had in any event engaged in unfair and deceptive sales practices in violation of the Consumer Protection Act, and that Seo and Brown were personally liable for those practices. She therefore recommended that all charges pertaining to the Consumer Loan Law be dismissed but that appellants be ordered to cease and desist from violating the Consumer Protection Act and to pay restitution to \u201cconsumers for renewal and repurchase transactions, during the period of February 1994 through February 1996.\u201d Her recommendation stopped short, however, of requesting the imposition of civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Although it adopted most of the ALJ\u2019s recommendations and all of her factual findings that were based upon her determination of witness credibility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Division reached a different conclusion as to whether the \u201csale-leaseback\u201d was a loan and as to whether civil penalties should be imposed. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>its Final Decision, the Division declared that appellant had \u201centerfed] into loans in the form of a pretended sale-leaseback ... without complying with the Consumer Loan Law.\u201d The Division\u2019s ensuing Final Order required that appellants make certain disclosures, \u201ccease and desist from violation of the Consumer Protection Act, take affirmative action in the form of restitution, and pay civil monetary penalties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Challenging the conclusions reached by the Division, appellants filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. That was followed by the Division\u2019s issuance of an Amended Final Order. In that order, the Division, as it did in its original order, required appellants to \u201ccease and desist from the violation of the Consumer Protection Act,\u201d \u201ctake affirmation action in the form of restitution,\u201d and pay \u201ccivil monetary penalties\u201d as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Affirming the Division\u2019s decision, the circuit court remanded-\u201cthe case to the agency to issue an order that makes explicit that simply changing forms will not make the pretend leaseback valid.\u201d From that order, appellants noted this appeal, presenting the following issues for our review:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">I. Did the Division apply the correct legal standard to appellant\u2019s sale-leaseback transactions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">II.

When a consumer responded to one of these ads by telephoning appellants, he was told that he could obtain up to $200 if he brought with him to one of appellants\u2019 two stores his checkbook, bank statement, photo identification, pay stub, phone bill, and serial numbers for two household items to qualify- for the \u201csale-leaseback\u201d program. Upon arrival, the consumer submitted these documents, filled out an application, and \u201csold\u201d one or two appliances to appellants for $100 each. Appellants then leased the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>appliances back to the consumer for fifteen day terms at $30 per appliance. Typically, the lease ended when all rent was paid up-to-date and the appliances were repurchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Appellants paid the same price for each appliance, $100, regardless of the nature, condition, or actual value of the item. At no time did appellants see, appraise, inspect, or even verify the existence or ownership of an appliance, beyond requesting its serial number from the consumer. Many items purchased by appellants had a market value that was far less than the $100 purchase price. In short, the amount of the purchase price was not related to the fair market value of the specific item being purchased. The sales portion of this two-part transaction was oral until June 1995, when appellants added a \u201cBill of Sale\u201d form, containing a description of the property, serial numbers, and sometimes model numbers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">After the sale of the appliance to appellants, the consumer signed a \u201cLease Agreement for Personal Property,\u201d requiring the customer to pay appellants as rent the sum of $30 per item at 15 day intervals. Just as the purchase price was unrelated to the fair market value of the item being purchased by appellants, the amount of the rent was not related to the actual fair market rental value of the item being rented.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The lease agreement further provided for the repurchase of the rental property \u201cat the end of the initial lease term or at the end of any renewal for a cash price equal to the fair market value of the rental property,\u201d provided that all other fees were paid. Although the lease granted the consumer the right to terminate the agreement \u201cat any time following the expiration of the initial lease term or any renewal\u201d by returning the property and paying all accrued charges, the green option sheet given to customers at the time they signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>. the lease, which was in larger print than the lease agreement, set forth only three termination options. None of the options stated that the lease agreement could be terminated by surrendering the rental property.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The options sheet was used by appellants from February 1994 through at least March 1996. It presented the options in the following words and format:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">Options For The Sales-Leaseback Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">Options For The Sales-Leaseback Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">AT THE END OF YOUR FIRST 15 DAY CYCLE YOU HAVE 3 OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU.

ALL THAT OPTION # 3 DOES IS GRANT YOU AN ADDITIONAL 15 DAYS TIME IN WHICH TO PURCHASE YOUR ITEMS BACK.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-25\">$ 60.00 RENT</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-26\">As noted, no mention was made in the green options sheet of the right of the customer to terminate the lease by surren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>deling the property. Nor was that option discussed with potential customers. In fact, employees of appellants were instructed by appellants\u2019 training manual to stress that the customer was obligated to repurchase the rental property to terminate the transaction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">In March 1996, however, appellants replaced the green options sheet with a \u201cyellow multi-part options sheet,\u201d adding the missing fourth option. That option read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">OPTION #4\u2014RETURN OF MERCHANDISE\u2014WHEN USING OPTION #4 YOU PAY THE $60.00 RENTAL AND RETURN THE RENTAL MERCHANDISE. ONCE YOU HAVE MADE THE RENTAL PAYMENT AND RETURNED THE RENTAL MERCHANDISE YOU HAVE NO FURTHER OBLIGATION TO US.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">But \u201crepeat\u201d customers were never told of this revision, and they comprised 80% of appellants\u2019 monthly business.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">When a customer fell behind on his or her payments, appellants began collection activities by telephoning the customer. During such calls, appellants demanded payment, but, not surrender of the property. Collection calls were followed by a demand letter in which appellants advised the customer: \u201cFailure to contact us will leave us no choice but to use all means necessary to collect this amount.\u201d Like the collection calls, such letters never mentioned that the property could be returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">If that produced no results, appellants deposited the security deposit check of the delinquent customer, deeming that check to be a \u201crepurchase\u201d of that customer\u2019s property. If a check was dishonored, appellants sent the customer a \u201cNotice of Returned Check.\u201d That notice, among other things, advised the customer that passing a bad check was a crime and specified the criminal penalty for that crime, by setting out at length the relevant criminal statute. It concluded by inform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ing the customer in large capitalized letters: \u201cIF YOU FAIL TO HONOR YOUR CHECK WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING THIS NOTICE, WE WILL BE FORCED TO CONSIDER APPROPRIATE LEGAL ACTION.\u201d What appellants did not attempt to do, however, was repossess the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The Division concluded that \u201c[m]any customers found it difficult to come up with the $270 (purchase price for two items plus rent for two items plus tax for two items) needed to pay off their obligation to the [appellants]\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch customers continued paying the \u2018rent\u2019 until they could come up with the full \u2018repurchase\u2019 price.\u201d Those customers, the Division observed, \u201coften paid rent that was many times the value of the property that they were \u2018renting.\u2019 \u201c The Division cited as examples a customer who paid $1,153 in rent for one item, and others who paid $682, $600, and $503, respectively, in rent for two items. \u201cThe annual interest rate on such a loan,\u201d the Division noted, was \u201c730%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Despite the lease agreement\u2019s property surrender provision, the Division found that \u201c[t]he vast majority of customers\u2014 approximately 99.5%\u2014eventually paid back the money which they had received from [appellants].\u201d Indeed, the Division found that appellants \u201cdesigned their transaction to ensure that consumers ultimately repaid the cash advanced by the [appellants] rather than surrender the property listed in the transactional documents.\u201d When defaulting customers did surrender the property to appellants, appellants \u201crefused to do business with them in the future\u201d and the surrendered items \u201cwere treated as being of zero or negligible residual value and abandoned,\u201d the Division stated. In fact, so inconsequential was this property considered by appellants that they did not list the thousands of items of rental property they purchased in the course of conducting their business on the Maryland personal property return forms they filed with the Department of Assessments and Taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">From the inception of their business in 1994 through 1996, appellants, the Division found, had entered into sale-leaseback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>agreements with more than 11,000 customers. Many of those transactions were personally handled by Brown and Seo. By the date of the administrative hearing, appellants had entered into a total of 56,208 sale-leaseback transactions, but the \u201cleased\u201d property had been surrendered in only 84 instances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On August 8, 1996, the Division filed a Statement of Charges and Petition for Hearing with the Chief of the Consumer Protection Division. That statement named as respondents, B&amp;S Marketing Enterprises, Inc., doing business as Kash-2-U Leasing, and later S&amp;B Marketing Enterprises, Inc., doing business as Cash-2-U Leasing, and its two officers and stockholders, Louis R. Seo, Jr., and Frank A. Brown, Jr. In that statement, Division claimed that appellants, among other things, \u201cprovide small loans to consumers in the principal amount of $200, for which they charge an interest rate of 780% per annum,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that \u201c[i]n order to avoid Maryland\u2019s usury and consumer finance laws, which would require the maker of such loans to be licensed and to charge no more than 33% interest per annum, [appellants] have created a sham \u2018sale-leaseback\u2019 transaction.\u201d The statement further averred that consumers \u201cwho have cash emergencies are induced to enter into these sham transactions in order to obtain short tern credit at usurious interest rates\u201d and that appellants misrepresented and concealed \u201cthe true nature, terms and legality of these transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Division recommended that appellants be ordered \u201cto cease and desist from violation of the Consumer Protection Act and of the Consumer Loan Law,\u201d to pay restitution \u201cof money received from consumers in connection with a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>of the Consumer Protection Act,\u201d to \u201cpay $1000 civil penalties per violation,\u201d \u00e1nd \u201cto pay for the costs of the investigation and th[e] proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The Chief of the Consumer Protection Division granted the Division\u2019s petition for a hearing and referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings for a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Following a public hearing, the presiding ALJ, in a written decision, found that appellants\u2019 transaction was a sale-leaseback transaction, not a loan, but nonetheless concluded that appellants, in presenting the sale-leaseback program, engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Consumer Protection Act. In reaching that conclusion, the ALJ noted, among other things, that, from February 4, 1994 through March 1996, appellants \u201cused several option sheets which explained three options for repurchasing goods, but did not include an option for returning the goods.\u201d The option sheet, the ALJ explained, though \u201cnot a transactional document,\u201d misrepresented \u201cthe terms of the lease with respect to how a customer could close the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The ALJ further found that, based on the very low number of items returned by consumers, \u201cmany, if not most, consumers believed that they were obligated to purchase the leased goods.\u201d She pointed out that, from July 1994 through September 1996, appellants \u201chad 56,208 transactions of property, yet only 44<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> items were returned by their customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The ALJ recommended that the Consumer Protection Division issue an order requiring that appellants: \u201ccease and desist from violation of the Consumer Protection Act,\u201d pay \u201crestitution of money received from consumers for renewal and repurchase transactions, during the period of February 1994 through February 1996, which violated the Consumer Protection Act,\u201d and \u201cpay for the costs of the investigation and this proceeding.\u201d She did not, however, order appellants \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>pay civil penalties for the above violations.\u201d She further recommended that the \u201cConsumer Protection Division dismiss the charges ... alleging violations of the Consumer Loan Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">On November 19, 1997, the parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision with the Division. After hearing argument on those exceptions, the Division issued a \u201cFinal Decision\u201d on November 2, 2001.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In that decision, the Division found that appellants had \u201cengaged in small loan transactions in the form of sale-leaseback and resale transactions\u201d and were not licensed to do so under the Consumer Loan Law. It further found that the \u201ceffective annual rate of interest in a typical transaction-in which the customer paid \u2018rent\u2019 equaling 30% of the principal every 15 days-was approximately 730%.\u201d That rate, it stated, exceeded the limits set forth in Consumer Loan Law. It also found that appellants had not provided the consumer disclosures required by that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">With respect to \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practices,\u201d the Division found that appellants had \u201cpresented [their] transaction as a sale-leaseback in form, but in practice [had] engaged in loan transactions,\u201d and that they had \u201cled consumers to believe that [appellants] could lawfully enter into a species of loan transactions with a rate of interest far in excess of that permitted by law.\u201d \u201cEven if the transaction were construed as a sale-leaseback,\u201d the Division opined, appellants \u201cmisled consumers by omission at critical junctures as to whether the transaction could be terminated other than by repayment of the funds advanced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">With respect to the green option sheet\u2019s omission of the option to surrender the property, the Division concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARu\">[t]he omission of the option to surrender property in the versions of the options sheet used during most of the period at issue and [appellants] emphasis on \u201crepurchase\u201d options <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>in that document and in other practices demonstrates their intent to mislead consumers as to the formal terms of the lease form. This was apparently done so that consumers would repay the money received rather than present [appellants] with property that [appellants] would otherwise abandon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Division further stated that because \u201cSeo and Brown individually participated in the unfair and deceptive practices, they are personally liable for any penalties assessed or restitution which may be ordered.\u201d It assessed a civil penalty \u201cin the amount of $100 per transaction\u2014or a total $591,400.\u201d That penalty was based on 5,914 transactions that occurred during the period from September 1995 to February 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On November 2, 2001, the Division issued a \u201cFinal Order.\u201d That order required appellants to \u201ccease and desist from violation of the Consumer Protection Act, take affirmative action in the form of restitution, and pay civil monetary penalties, as well as the costs of this proceeding.\u201d It further ordered appellants to \u201ccease and desist from lending money to consumers until\u201d they obtained a \u201clicense from the Commissioner of Financial Regulation under the Maryland Consumer Loan Law,\u201d revised their \u201ccommunications with consumers to explicitly represent the transaction as a loan,\u201d and ceased \u201ccharging a higher rate of interest than allowed by the Maryland Consumer Loan Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Paragraph '3 of the Final Order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">3. <em>Relief Relating to Sale-Leaseback Program. </em>Alternatively, if Respondents wish to continue their operations as a sale-leaseback program involving consumer property, Respondents shall cease and desist offering a sale-leaseback program unless and until they are in compliance with the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Those \u25a0 \u201cfollowing provisions\u201d required in part that appellants make \u201cclear and conspicuous\u201d disclosures, as well as provide customers with a disclosure statement, a new options sheet, and a disclosure form of \u201cComparative Cost of Sale-Lease<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>back.\u201d The \u201cclear and conspicuous\u201d disclosure requirement provided that appellants \u201cshall truthfully and affirmatively disclose to consumers all material facts about the nature of the sale-leaseback transaction and the consumer\u2019s options and obligations under the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The disclosure statement that was to be placed in appellants\u2019 advertisements was to read \u201csubstantially as follows\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\"><em>We will pay you $ [insert range of prices offered] to buy </em>_ <em>items of your personal property. You keep that property and pay us rent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">\n<em>You will owe us $ [insert rental amount and term] for the time that you keep that property.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">\n<em>You have two options to get out of the sale-leaseback: (1) turn the property over to us and owe us nothing more or (2) buy back the property from us.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">And finally, the disclosure statement was required to compare the cost of a sale-leaseback to a loan. It was to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">\n<em>The Cost of a Sale Leaseback Compared to a Loan</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\"><em>In this sale-leaseback, you, will receive $ </em>_ <em>to sell _items of property, and then pay $_rent every 15 days.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-16\">\n<em>The cost to you of renting this property for a year is 730% of the money you will receive.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-17\">\n<em>By comparison, if you got the same $_as a loan from a bank or finance company or credit card, the interest you would pay is limited by law to no more than 33% per year.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">After the Final Order was issued, the Division filed a motion to modify it. In that motion, the Division expressed concern that appellants could \u201cargue that compliance with paragraph 3 constitutes full compliance with applicable law, including the Consumer Loan Law.\u201d The Division suggested that paragraph 3 be revised to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-20\">3. Relief Relating to Sale Leaseback Program. [Alternatively-] If Respondents wish to continue operations as a sale-leaseback program involving consumer property, in addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to complying with all laws that may be applicable, including but not limited to the Consumer Loan Law, Respondents shall cease and desist from offering a sale-lease back program unless and until they are in compliance with the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">(Strikeout and underlining in original). The Division further proposed deletion of \u201c730\u201d as the percentage in the disclosure form, which compared the cost of a sale-leaseback to a loan, because the \u201cpercentage rate would depend upon the amounts in the first paragraph of the disclosure, which are to be filled in by [appellants] based on the actual amounts charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">On November 29, 2001, prior to a ruling on the motion, appellants filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. A day later, on November 30, 2001, an \u201cAmended Final Order\u201d was issued, rejecting the Division\u2019s proposed change of paragraph 3 and accepting its proposed change of the disclosure form, by removing \u201c730\u201d as the percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Following a hearing on appellants\u2019 petition, the circuit court, in a written opinion, stated that the \u201ctransactions are loans and not sales arid leasebacks,\u201d that \u201cthe [Division] did not err .in ordering restitution to all those who entered into the unlawful transaction with [appellants],\u201d and that \u201cfinding Seo and Brown personally liable [was] not erroneous.\u201d The circuit court also found that the amended final order was \u201cnot as clear as it should be\u201d and consequently remanded \u201cthe ease to the agency to issue an order that makes explicit that simply changing forms will not make the pretend leasebacks valid.\u201d Later, the circuit court issued an order affirming the final decision of the Division and remanding the case for an order consistent with the court\u2019s written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\"> In reviewing a decision of an administrative agency, our role \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t Of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

Thus, if the agency\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018is not predicated solely on an error of law, we will not overturn it if a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Billhimer, </em>314 Md. at 59, 548 A.2d 819).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Appellants contend that the Division applied the wrong law and the wrong legal standard in concluding that their sale-leaseback transactions were really \u201cloans,\u201d not leases. It should have applied, according to appellants, the more \u201cexplicit\u201d standards of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code, Md.Code (1975, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 1-101 to 10-112 of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cUCC\u201d), rather than the \u201cpretended purchase\u201d provision of the Consumer Loan Law, which appellants insist \u201clack[s] any explicit criteria for a \u2018pretended purchase.\u2019 \u201d Had it done so, appellants maintain, the Division would not have considered appellants\u2019 intent or purpose, but only the legal terms of the lease agreements and that would have inexorably led to the conclusion that appellants were offering sale-leasebacks and not loans to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">But the issue before us is not which law\u2014the UCC or the Consumer Loan Law\u2014offers the most \u201cexplicit standards\u201d for determining what is or is not a loan but rather which law prevails when the two conflict. To answer that question, we need look no further than the provisions of the UCC, which categorically declare that, in such instances, the Consumer Loan Law prevails. <em>See </em>UCC \u00a7\u00a7 2A-104(2), 9\u2014201(c)(1) (providing that in case of a conflict between a consumer protection statute and either Title 2A, dealing with leases or Title 9, dealing with secured transactions, the consumer protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>statute controls). And that law unquestionably permits the Division to look beneath the formal terms of an agreement and to consider the substance of that agreement in determining whether it constitutes a \u201cloan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Moreover, unlike appellants, we do not find the Consumer Loan Law is too vague to apply. Maryland\u2019s Consumer Loan Law applies to loans having \u201can original amount or value which does not exceed $6,000.\u201d CL \u00a7 12-303(a). Thus the \u201cloans\u201d made by appellants, which never exceeded $100 per appliance, were covered by this law. The law further provides that \u201c[a] person may not engage in the business of making loans under this subtitle unless the person is licensed under or is exempt from the licensing requirements of Title 11, Subtitle 2 of the Financial Institutions Article, the Maryland Consumer Loan Law-Licensing Provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-302. There is no dispute that appellants did not have lending licenses. And finally, the law defines \u201clender\u201d as \u201ca person who makes a loan under this subtitle,\u201d \u00a7 12-301(c), and \u201cloan\u201d as \u201cany loan or advance of money or credit made under this subtitle,\u201d \u00a7 12-301(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We turn now to the provision that appellants maintain is too vague for application\u2014the \u201cpretended purchase provision.\u201d That provision, CL \u00a7 12-308(3)(c), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">(c) <em>Pretended purchase of 'property or of services considered </em>loan.\u2014This subtitle applies but is not limited to a lender who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">(1) As security for a loan, use, or forebearance of money, goods, or things in action or for any loan, use, or sale of credit, whether or not the transaction is or purports to be made under this subtitle, makes a pretended purchase of property from any person and permits the owner or pledgor to retain possession of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">(2) By any device or pretense of charging for his services or otherwise, seeks to obtain any interest, charges, discount, or like consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The language of CL 12-303(3)(c) is neither new nor novel. It first appeared in Maryland\u2019s former Uniform Small Loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Law.1918 Md. Laws, Chap. 88.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The preamble to that law is worth re-stating here. It declared that there had \u201clong been conducted in this State an extensive business, in the making of small loans ... to persons in need of funds to meet immediate necessities,\u201d that the \u201cconduct of such business has long been a cause of general complaint, and of much hardship and injustice to borrowers,\u201d and that there was no effective provision \u201cfor the protection of such borrowers and for the punishment of usurious lenders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Nor did the Division err in looking beneath the form of the transaction at issue, into its \u201ctrue nature,\u201d in determining whether it was a \u201cloan\u201d. <em>See Andrews v. Poe, </em>30 Md. 485, 487 (1869). In <em>Andrews, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">It matters not in what part of the transaction it may lurk, or what form it may take\u2014whether it reads six per cent[,] upon its face, with an understanding to pay <em>an extra four per cent., </em>or whether it be a pretended sale and lease, or under whatever guise the lender\u2014always fruitful in expedients\u2014may attempt to evade the law[.] [C]ourts of justice, disregarding the shadow and looking to the substance, will ascertain what in truth was the contract between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 487-88. The propriety- of this approach has been repeatedly reaffirmed. <em>See, e.g., Hoffman v. Key Fed. Sav. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>286 Md. 28, 34, 416 A.2d 1265 (1979); <em>Brenner v. Plitt, </em>182 Md. 348, 356-57, 34 A.2d 853 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In looking beneath the form of the transaction, to determine whether the sale-leaseback was in substance a disguised loan, the Division considered \u201call the circumstances of the transaction.\u201d It analyzed appellants\u2019 advertising, their oral and written presentation of the transaction to consumers, their customers\u2019 understanding of the program, their \"valuation and treatment of the property\u201d they purportedly purchased, and their collection practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">With respect to appellants\u2019 advertising, the Division found that appellants \u201ctargeted consumers who were in need of cash and who wished to avoid a credit check, presumably because they would have difficulty obtaining a loan.\u201d Although those advertisements did not use the word \u201cloan\u201d and, on occasion, referred to a \u201csale leaseback plan,\u201d they provided, the Division observed, \u201cno details and emphasized that the customer would obtain $200 cash immediately without a credit check.\u201d Indeed, Seo testified that the advertisements targeted those who were employed, between the ages of 25 and 39, and had a \u201ctake home\u201d income of $1,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">With respect to appellants\u2019 training materials, the Division found that \u201c[u]p to the time of the hearing[,] the materials used to train [appellants\u2019] employees stressed only the option for a customer to repay the money received by \u2018repurchasing\u2019 the items of property.\u201d The Division pointed out that, until the time of the hearing, \u201cthe training manual did not address the possibility that the customer would actually turn the property over to\u201d appellants. In fact, one of appellants\u2019 early presentation scripts, written by Seo and Brown, emphasized to the customer: \u201cAt the end of the lease term, you have the option to repurchase these items from us.\u201d Later, after January 1996, appellants developed a training manual, stating that customers could terminate the transaction by returning the property, but emphasizing the repurchase options. That was done by listing the repurchase and rental payment options before the return property option. Subsequently, in 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>during the ALJ hearing, appellants instituted an \u201coffice manu- . al,\u201d which, unlike the training manual, contained, among other things, a section on handling property returned by the customers. And like the training manual, the office manual deemphasized the return property option by listing it last.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The Division further found that, in explaining the transaction to customers, appellants\u2019 \u201coral representations and options sheet ... did not match the written transactional documents.\u201d The Division noted that most of appellants\u2019 customers were \u201cnot sophisticated in financial transactions,\u201d and therefore \u201clooked to [appellants\u2019] employees\u2019 to explain the transaction.\u201d Comparing the language of the original green options sheet\u2014used from February 1994 to March 1996\u2014with that of the lease agreement, the Division stated: \u201cWhile the lease form contained two legal-sized pages of small print legalese, [the green options sheet] ... was easier to read and in larger print.\u201d As the green options sheet only addressed repurchase options, the Division stated, appellants \u201cled customers to believe that they were required ultimately to repay the $200 by \u2018repurchasing\u2019 the items ... listed in the transactional documents.\u201d And as we noted earlier, appellants did not include the option to terminate the transaction by returning the property until March 1996, in the \u201cmulti-yellow part options sheet.\u201d Moreover, repeat customers, comprising 80% of appellants business, testified that they were not told about the revisions to the options sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u201cMost customers ...,\u201d the Division stated, \u201cconsidered the \u2018rental merchandise\u2019 ... to be collateral that secured their payment obligation,\u201d and \u201cunderstood that, if they defaulted on that obligation, they would be sued or the property would be seized as collateral.\u201d For instance, when asked what she understood her agreement with appellants to mean, customer Ruth Lampkin responded: \u201cI gave my Magnavox TV and my Sony CD player like for collateral if I reneged on the repayment of the $270.\u201d Customer Pomra Powell gave similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>testimony, stating that she saw her television as collateral for her loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The Division further noted that appellants \u201cevinced little interest in th[e] property\u201d they had purportedly purchased and that \u201c[ajpart from obtaining a generic description of an item and a serial or model number, they obtained no information about the age, condition, or even location of the item.\u201d In fact, as the Division noted, appellants \u201cdid not list any of that property in personal property returns that they filed with the State.\u201d The Division concluded: \u201c[Appellants\u2019] disinterest in obtaining more information about the items \u2018purchased\u2019 illustrates the actual role played by the items of personal property listed in the transactional documents and demonstrates that the \u2018purchase\u2019 was in fact a pretense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">With respect to the \u201cpurchase\u201d price, the Division stated: \u201cAccording to [appellants\u2019] forms, they always \u2018purchased\u2019 the items of property listed by consumers for $100 per item, regardless of the nature, condition, or actual value of the particular item.\u201d What is more, the Division found, appellants \u201cnever inspected the property before assigning that price\u201d and \u201cdid not even <em>ask </em>consumers about the age, condition, or value of the items listed.\u201d The Division further stated that the fair market value of the property \u201cranged from $5 <em>(e.g., </em>toasters and telephones) to as high as $500\u201d and that appellants, \u201cin many transactions, ... \u2018purchased\u2019 for $100 items that were worth far less.\u201d And appellants, the Division pointed out, \u201calways assigned $100 as the price for \u2018repurchase\u2019 of an item by the consumer regardless of depreciation or how many times the item had been listed in the transactions.\u201d Thus, \u201cas with a loan,\u201d the Division concluded, appellants \u201cwere always to be repaid the same amount they had originally advanced to the consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">While there was no evidence before the Division that appellants relied on a property appraisal in setting their $100 purchase price, to justify that price, appellants presented appraisals of \u201capproximately 1,727 items shown on approximately 896\u201d lease agreement forms. After categorizing those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>items, the appraiser found that the fair market value<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the different items ranged from a toaster at $5 to a 32\u201d Color T.V. at $340, and concluded that $90.07 represented the average fair market value. As- a result, the Division stated: \u201cIt appears that [appellants] routinely paid an average of 11 percent more than the average fair market value of the items identified in their transactional documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The Division also noted that \u201cconsumer testimony at the hearing confirmed that few of the items listed in the transaction documents ... could be worth $100.\u201d For example, customer Sharon Martin testified that the property appellants purportedly from purchased from her, included a ten-year-old Uniden car phone, for which she paid $190, and a five to ten-year-old radio, for which she paid less than $50. Customer Cynthia Peacock stated that she sold to appellants a small black and white television and a 19 inch color television, wjith a remote, which she valued at $50 each. Joanne Anthony stated that appellants purchased from her for $100 each: a two-year-old microwave, for which she paid $80, and a two-year-old telephone and answering machine. And customer Ruth Lampkin stated that appellants purchased from her a three-year-old 13 inch color TV, for which she paid $299; a twelve-year-old, 20 inch color TV, for which she paid $349; and a twelve-year-old VCR, for which she paid $200. \u201cGiven the likely depreciation of the value of some of these items,\u201d the Division concluded, \u201cthe fair market value of most individual items was less than $100 at the time of the transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The Division further noted that, \u201c[i]f items were substantially less in value than the purchase price stated in the bill of sale, [appellants] conceivably could have suffered a loss if the customer were to terminate the lease by delivering the items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>rather than repaying the \u2018purchase\u2019 price.\u201d Based on the \u201cformal terms of [appellants\u2019] lease form,\u201d the Division asserted, \u201ctheir practice of \u2018purchasing\u2019 an item without any consideration of the item\u2019s value appears to be a foolish practice.\u201d It therefore concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">[Appellants\u2019] apparent willingness to assign an item a price sometimes far in excess of its appraised value makes sense only if there is an understanding that the sales transaction is to be reversed on the same terms in the future. That is, one cannot consider the \u2018sale\u2019 transaction in isolation for a rational person in [appellants\u2019] position would only enter into such a transaction if a resale were contemplated at the same or a better price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">And it further observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">[I]f customers had truly understood that there was an option to turn in the listed property in lieu of repaying the $200 advanced, a rational consumer would have listed items of negligible value, collected $200 from [appellants], paid the $60 \u2018rental\u2019 fee, and simply surrendered the items to [appellants] at the end of the rental period at a tidy profit. Of course, not all consumers behave as a rational economist might expect. However, the testimony at the hearing confirmed that consumers would have turned in those goods that were worth less than $200 if they had understood that they would be relieved of the obligation to pay back the money advanced by [appellants]. The fact that consumers did not take advantage of [appellants\u2019] apparent generosity confirms the consumer testimony that [appellants] led consumers to believe that they were obligated to repay the $200 by \u2018repurchasing\u2019 the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">(Citation omitted). The Division also found that \u201cthe \u2018sale\u2019 and obligatory \u2018resale\u2019 at the same price without any transfer in possession of the property meant that the only thing that changed hands were funds advanced to, and repaid by, the customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">With respect to the \u201crental\u201d payments customers made to appellants, the Division determined that, \u201c[l]ike the \u2018purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>price,\u2019 the interv\u00e9ning \u2018rent\u2019 payments were unrelated to the actual value of the property listed in the transactional documents.\u201d As noted earlier, the lease agreement required that customers pay appellants $30 per item as \u201crent\u201d\u2014which the Division characterized, as \u201c$30 per $100 principal\u201d\u2014at 15 day intervals.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">With respect to repayment of the funds advanced to customers, the Division pointed out that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">[i]f a customer did not have sufficient funds to pay the money advanced on the due date, he or she could continue to pay $30 \u201crent\u201d with respect to every $100 adyanced for successive 15-day terms. Many customers found it difficult to come up with the $270 ordinarily required at the end of the first 15-day period and often paid \u201crent\u201d many times the value of the property they were \u201crenting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">As one customer testified, \u201cI really got stressed out ... paying $60 and never getting anywhere.\u201d Another explained: \u201cIt was hard for me to get $270. I was behind already with my bills. And ... the interest part I could pay but I just couldn\u2019t pay the $270.\u201d The Division concluded that if customers \u201chad known of an option to surrender property rather than repay the funds advanced, they would have done so.... [Customers whose goods were worth less than $100 also would have surrendered the property, if they understood it was an option.\u201d That conclusion was further bolstered by the testimony of customers Sharon Martin, Cynthia Peacock, and Joanne Anthony. Martin was asked, \u201cIf anybody had told you you could turn in your car phone and radio and not have to pay the $200 back, would you have?\u201d She responded, \u201cYes, I would have turned it in.\u201d Peacock gave similar testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">Q. Did the person at Cash-2-U tell you anything about your being able to bring the TVs in and their forgiving the $200?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">A. No, that was never mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">Q. If someone had offered to take the -TVs off your hands for $200, what would your response have been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>A. Being honest, I would have to tell them that the TVs\u2014 if I could have gotten $50 for both of them, it would have been good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">And Joanne Anthony testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">Q. Did anyone at Kash-2-U say, \u201cMs. Anthony, if you don\u2019t want that microwave, you just bring it-bring it in and we\u2019ll forgive $100\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">A. No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">Q. What was your understanding of what you were supposed to do when you left Kash 2 U?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">A. Come back with the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">Q. Did they tell you why they wanted these serial numbers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">Q. If they said, \u201cMs. Anthony, we would like that microwave for $100. We\u2019d like to pay you $100 for that,\u201d would you have sold it to them for $100?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">A. Yes, uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">Because \u201c[virtually no customers exercised the \u2018option\u2019 to \u2018return\u2019 the property,\u201d the Division found, \u201ccustomers clearly acted as though the transaction involved the loan and repayment of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Appellants \u201cbehaved more like a lender than a lessor\u201d in handling delinquent customers, the Division observed. It was undisputed that, as the Division put it, if customers \u201cfailed to make intervening payments, [appellants] called the customer to demand payment\u201d and that \u201cif phone calls proved unsuccessful in securing payment, [appellants] followed up with dunning letters [advising] the customer that they would \u2018use all means necessary to collect this amount.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">Moreover, the calls appellants made to delinquent customers demanded payment, not return of the goods. The \u201cdunning\u201d letters, which followed these calls, did not mention return of the goods. In fact, appellants made no effort to repossess the property that they had purportedly purchased. That appellants did not demand return of the property, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>otherwise seek to repossess it, was \u201cevidence,\u201d according to the Division, \u201cof their own understanding that the true nature of the transaction did not involve the listed property, but rather the advance and repayment of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We therefore hold that the Division did not err in looking beneath the forms, into the substance of the transaction, to determine that appellants \u201cengaged in small loan transactions in the form of sale-leaseback transactions.\u201d And that is precisely the approach that other jurisdictions have taken. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Fox v. Peck Iron &amp; Metal Co., 25 </em>B.R. 674, 688-92 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.l982)(looking to the substance of a sale and lease-back transaction to hold that it was really a usurious loan); <em>SAL Leasing Inc. v. State, </em>198 Ariz. 434, 10 P.3d 1221, 1227-28 (Ct.App.2000)(holding that sale and lease-back of vehicles were disguised usurious loans violating Consumer Lenders Act); <em>Burr v. Capital Reserve Corp., </em>71 Cal.2d 983, 80 Cal.Rptr. 345, 458 P.2d 185, 192 (1969)(upholding trial court finding that the substance a sale-leaseback transaction was really a usurious loan); <em>Halco Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Foster, </em>770 S.W.2d 554, 555-56 (Tenn.Ct.App.1989)(looking to the substance of a sale and lease-back transaction to hold that it was really a usurious loan).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">What is more, the evidence is so compelling that the transaction was a loan and not a lease, that even if we apply the UCC, as appellants urge us to do, we reach the same result: appellants\u2019 sale-leaseback was nothing more than a loan. UCC \u00a7 2A-103(l)(j) defines a \u201clease\u201d as \u201ca transfer of the right to possession and use of goods for a term in return for consideration, but a sale, including a sale on approval or a sale or return, or retention or creation of a security interest is not a lease.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[i]f a transaction creates a lease and not a security interest, the lessee\u2019s interest in the goods is limited to its leasehold estate; the residual interest belongs to the lessor.\u201d Official Comment UCC \u00a7 1-201(37). In other words, as one commentator has observed, \u201c[t]he central figure of a true lease is the reservation of an economically meaningful interest to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\u201d Edwin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>E. Huddleston, III, <em>Old Wine in New Bottles: UCC Article 2A-Leases, </em>39 Ala. L.Rev. 615, 625 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">After concluding that, under the Consumer Loan Law, the sale-leaseback was a loan, the Division turned to the UCC. And there it found additional support for that proposition. According to the UCC, a key element of a true lease was the reversionary interest of the lessor. (And that element, as the Division observed, \u201cwas absent from [appellants\u2019] business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In reaching that conclusion, the Division recounted the actions of appellants that demonstrated that the property was \u201cof little or no value\u201d to them. Appellants, it noted, did not appraise or inspect the property, but only obtained \u201ca general description of the item and a serial or model number.\u201d The option sheets, it observed, did not reflect the option of returning the property to terminate the program until March 1996\u2014approximately two years after appellants opened their first Maryland store in January 1994. And, as noted earlier, neither appellants\u2019 collection calls nor dunning letters demanded the return of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The Division also pointed out that appellants never sought to repossess the property when a delinquent customer\u2019s deposit check was dishonored. Instead, the Division observed, appellants \u201cwould credit the customer with \u2018free time\u2019 and close the customer\u2019s account.\u201d The Division also noted that appellants kept no record of returned property during their first two years of operation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And on the few occasions where customers surrendered property, the Division continued, appellants \u201ctreated the goods as having negligible value and abandoned them\u201d; they sought neither to re-lease the property nor to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In fact, when asked what appellants do with returned property, Brown testified that \u201c[w]e use it in our offices,\u201d He explained that all of the microwave ovens used in the stores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>were \u201creturn rentals,\u201d that the returned televisions were used to monitor advertisements, and that, to sell items, they \u201cput a price tag on them,\u201d \u201cdisplay[ed] them in [their] offices,\u201d and attempted to sell them at flea markets. But Seo testified that he had never seen a bill of sale \u201creflecting a sale of a returned good.\u201d \u25a0 And, as the Division observed, in their 1995 and 1996 \u201cPersonal Property Return\u201d forms, appellants described the nature of their business as \u201cinvestment activities\u201d and did not claim as personal property any of the items \u201cpurchased\u201d in their transactions. The \u201cfilings demonstrate,\u201d the Division opined, \u201can understanding that [appellants] were in the business of lending money and had no genuine interest in the property listed in the transactional documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">As a last effort to convince this Court that their sale-leaseback transaction satisfies the definition of a lease under UCC \u00a7 2A-103(l)(j) and not of a \u201csecurity interest\u201d under UCC \u00a7 1-201(37), appellants argue that, because UCC \u00a7 1-201(37), as amended, deleted all reference to the parties\u2019 intent,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Division erred by looking beyond the terms of an agreement, in determining that the sale-leaseback transaction created a security interest. But that argument we need not reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Even if we assume that the sale-leaseback created a lease under the UCC, that conflicts with the Division\u2019s determination that the transaction was a loan under the Consumer Loan Law. And, as noted earlier, in the event of such a conflict, the latter law prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Appellants also contend that the record does not support the Division\u2019s conclusion that customers testified \u201cthat if they had been made aware of an option to surrender property to be relieved of their repayment obligation, they would have done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>so.\u201d We disagree. Indeed, appellants concede that at least one witness, Sharon Martin, said, \u201cYes,\u201d when asked, \u201cIf anybody had told you you could turn in your car phone and radio and not have to pay the $200 back, would you have?\u201d Other customers gave similar testimony. When queried, \u201cIf someone had offered to take the TVs off your hands for $200, what would your response have been?\u201d Cynthia Peacock replied, \u201c[I]f I could have gotten $50 for both of them, it would have been good.\u201d Customer Joanne Anthony agreed. She was asked: \u201cIf they said, \u2018Ms. Anthony, we would like that microwave for $100. We\u2019d like to pay you $100 for that,\u2019 would you have sold it to them for $100?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">And finally, appellants argue that the Division abused its discretion in denying their motion to reopen the record to show that, after appellants began including the option to return property in their options sheet, the number of property returns \u201cdid not increase significantly.\u201d That abuse of discretion continued, appellants contend, in the Division\u2019s relying on the small number of returns-84 instances, from July 1994 through September 1996-to support its finding that customers did not understand that returning the property was an option. \u201cThe number of property returns,\u201d appellants claim, \u201cis meaningless as any indication of the level of consumer awareness\u201d without a showing of \u201chow many customers would choose the option if they had perfect information.\u201d A \u201clack of consumer action does not necessarily reflect any lack of consumer understanding,\u201d appellants state. In support of that assertion, appellants rely on the testimony of Mayo Simpson, a customer who testified that he understood that he could \u201creturn the merchandise\u201d and \u201cbe out of their program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cThe discretion of an administrative agency to admit evidence after the hearing is arguably broader than the discretion that is generally accorded to trial judges.... \u201d <em>Md. State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 557, 625 A.2d 914 (1993). And when the exercise of that discretion \u201cdoes not violate regulations, statutes, common law principles, due process and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>other constitutional requirements, it is ordinarily unreviewable by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201ccourts are authorized to intervene\u201d only when \u201can agency\u2019s exercise of discretion, in an adjudicatory proceeding, is \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018capricious\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 625 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Division\u2019s refusal to reopen the record was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The Division\u2019s finding that the sale-leaseback transaction was really a usurious loan was not premised solely on the small number of transactions that were terminated by customers surrendering their property. As noted above, the Division considered \u201call the circumstances of the transaction.\u201d Moreover, as the Division observed, the evidence that \u201cvirtually all consumers continued to repay the money,\u201d instead of returning their property, \u201cis entirely consistent with the [Division\u2019s] finding that [appellants were] providing consumers with short-term cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">And we understand why the Division was not swayed by Mayo Simpson\u2019s testimony. The Division points out that, while Simpson testified that he understood that he could terminate the program by surrendering the property, it \u201cbecame apparent that his knowledge was acquired at some point after the transaction.\u201d In fact, he testified that he signed a bill of sale on January 20, 1995, even though appellants had not begun using a bill of sale until June of that year; and that, in January of 1995, he signed a \u201cfour item option sheet\u201d even though appellants had not added\u2019 the fourth option to their options sheet until March 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Appellants contend that the Division\u2019s finding that it \u201cmisrepresented the terms of their lease transactions through oral misrepresentations and a written \u2018options sheet\u2019 is not based on substantial evidence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The Division found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Through oral representations and use of the green options sheet, [appellants] represented to customers that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>were required to \u2018purchase\u2019 the goods \u2018sold\u2019 to [appellants] using one of the three purchase options as recited on the options sheet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">That finding, as we have previously discussed at length, is supported by substantial evidence. Customer Sharon Martin was asked: \u201cWhat did you think you had to do to get out of the program then?\u201d She responded, \u201cPay back the money in full.\u201d She was then asked: \u201cDid they say anything about bringing the goods back?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, that was never mentioned.\u201d Customer Cynthia Peacock was queried, \u201cApart from explaining your payment options, did they give you any other options for concluding the transaction?\u201d She replied, \u201cNo, ... just the payment plan.\u201d And customer Sheila Chambers was asked: \u201cAfter reviewing the sheet with him, what was your understanding of what you had to do in this program?\u201d She responded, \u201cI had to follow ... either Option 1 or Option 2 or Option 3.\u201d Similar testimony was given by other customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Even after the options sheet was revised to include the fourth option that permitted customers to surrender the property, the Division observed that that option was de-emphasized or \u2022 ignored by appellants. The Division specifically found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">Following the adoption of the revised yellow multi-part options sheet, [appellants\u2019] presentation of the sale-leaseback program still did not emphasize the fourth option to customers. When customers were signing the packet of documents presented to them, Respondents did not point out the addition of the fourth option. Nor did Respondents advise repeat customers that the forms had changed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">For example, Sharon Martin, a repeat customer, stated that when she entered into a second sale-leaseback transaction with appellants she was not told about any changes in the options sheet. Joanne Anthony testified that, although she received and signed the revised options sheet, she was not told that there was anything different about the program. And when customer Ruth Lampkin was asked, \u201cDid they tell you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>... if you want to fulfill your obligation just bring those items back in and you don\u2019t have to pay us the $200,\u201d she replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Since repeat customers comprised 80% of appellants\u2019 monthly business, the failure to inform them of changes in the options sheet was a serious, substantial, and misleading omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Appellants contend that the circuit court exceeded its authority by remanding the Division\u2019s Amended Final Order to the Division for clarification as to whether appellants could proceed with their sale-leaseback program, after providing certain consumer disclosures. According to appellants, the Division\u2019s prosecutors may not appeal a decision of the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 claim, the Division was \u201centitled to judicial review of a decision ... if the agency was a party before the agency or the Office [of Administrative Hearings].\u201d Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(a)(2) of the State Government Article. Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in remanding the case to the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Appellants contend that the Division \u201cerred as a matter of law in ordering appellants to pay automatic restitution to all consumers who engaged in the transactions during a three-year period, with no showing that such customers relied on appellants\u2019 allegedly deceptive practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Section 13-403(b)(l) of the Consumer Protection Act requires that the Division, having found a violation of the Consumer Protection Act, \u201cshall state its findings and issue an order requiring the violator to cease and desist from the violation and to take affirmative action, including restitution of money or property.\u201d And section 12-314(b)(2) of the Consumer Loan Law specifically provides that a person who makes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>usurious loan \u201cmay not receive or retain any principal, interest, or other compensation with respect to [that] loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Given those two provisions, the Division did not have to show customer reliance to order restitution, only that appellants had made unlicensed usurious loans.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Adopting what it called a \u201cmiddle course,\u201d the Division only required appellants to pay as restitution to former customers the \u201cnet monetary gain\u201d appellants received from violating the Consumer Protection Act; namely, the \u201crent\u201d payments received. Although that approach was less drastic than other alternatives, it had the desirable and lawful effect of preventing appellants from being unjustly enriched by their wrongful conduct. <em>See Consumer Prot. Div. v. Consumer Publ\u2019g Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 776, 501 A.2d 48 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Appellants contend that the Division erred in imposing civil penalties on Seo and Brown instead of deferring to the ALJ\u2019s finding that they had acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>In determining that Seo and Brown should not be subject to civil penalties under CL \u00a7 13-410,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the ALJ found that Seo and Brown, prior to starting their sale-leaseback business in Maryland, had sought legal advice \u201cin order to conform to existing law\u201d and that, after they had been investigated by the Maryland Office of Consumer Credit, they had added a Bill of Sale to the transaction, and, after that, an option to return the goods to the options sheet. She also noted that they had sought advice from a UCC expert about the legality of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The Division, on the other hand, found this purported evidence of good faith unconvincing. Although Seo and Brown did seek legal advice, they did not, the Division pointed out, \u201cintroduce into evidence the substance of the advice ... other than that the attorney reviewed the forms.\u201d As for their consultation with the UCC expert, the Division noted that \u201cgiven the timing and circumstances, [that] consultation ... reveals little about whether they acted in good faith when they committed violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In fact, as the Division observed, the expert testified that Brown and Seo had showed the UCC expert the options sheet, containing the fourth option to return the goods, but did not show her the prior sheets, which excluded that option, because, in the expert\u2019s words, \u201cthey did not want to taint my opinion as to the documents that they were currently drafting.\u201d And, as we have previously stated, Seo and Brown devised the policies and practices of appellants and personally participated in thousands of transactions. Hence, there was substantial evidence presented that Seo and Brown were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>acting in good faith when they devised and implemented their \u201cloan\u201d scheme, whose true nature they tried to conceal by calling it a \u201csale-leaseback\u201d program.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

To facilitate our review of the issues raised by appellants, we have reworded and consolidated them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. In May of 1995, appellants were informed by the Commissioner of Consumer Credit that their transaction was a \u201cloan\u201d because they did not bear the risk of loss, repairs, or maintenance of the rental property and they had not taken possession of it. As a result, appellants, as the ALJ observed, \"added a written Bill of Sale to the transaction process and revised the lease agreement to the effect that the lessor bore the risk for repairs or replacement upon notice by the lessee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b164-27\">5. ] A later version of the green options sheet changed \"cash out\u201d to \u201crepurchase\u201d and made minor changes in the calculations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. The training manual was revised in 1997 to require employees to explain to customers that they had the option ol returning the rental property to terminate the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">.

The decision was the work of Robert N. McDonald, Chief Counsel of Opinions &amp; Advice, for the Office of the Attorney General, who had been delegated final decision-making authority by the the Chief of the Consumer Protection Division.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">. Section 18 stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Sec. 18. No person, co-partnership, or corporation, except as authorized by this Act shall, directly or indirectly, charge, contract for, or receive interest or consideration greater than six (6) per centum per annum upon the loan, use or forbearance of money, goods or things in action, or upon the loan, use or sale of credit, of the amount or value of three hundred dollars ($300) or less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">(a) The foregoing prohibition shall apply to any person who, as security for any such loan, use or forbearance of money, goods or things in action or for any such loan, use or sale of credit, makes a pretended purchase of property from any person and permits the owner or pledgor to retain the possession thereof, of who, by any device or pretense of charging for his services, or otherwise, seek to obtain a greater compensation than is authorized by this Act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">. The appraisal report defined \"fair market value\" as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">[T]he highest price estimated, in terms of money, which the property would bring if exposed for sale on the open market by a Seller who is willing but not obliged to sell, allowing a reasonable time to find a Buyer who is willing but not obliged to buy, both parties having full knowledge of all the purposes to which the property is best adapted and capable of being used.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">. The Division however found in March 1996, after Seo was deposed, that appellants \u201ccreated a form entitled \u2018Rental Return Receipt,\" given to customers who terminated the transaction by surrendering the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">. The Official Comment to CL \u00a7 1-201 states that amended CL \u00a7 1-201(37) deleted \"all reference to the parties\u2019 intent\u201d because \u201d[r]eference to the intent of the parties to create a lease or security interest has led to unfortunate results.\u201d It further states: \"Whether a transaction creates a lease or security interest continues to be determined by the facts of each case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. When the Division shows any violation of the Consumer Protection Act, it can \u201corder ... the violator to cease and desist from the violation and to take affirmative action, including [to make] restitution of money or property.\u201d CL \u00a7 13\u2014403(b)(1). The Division can also impose fines for any violation of the Consumer Protection Act. The Attorney General can ask the court for \"any order of judgment necessary to ... restore to a person any money ... acquired from him by means of any prohibited practice.\u201d \u00a7 13-406(c)(2). In this case, the dispute centered around whether the transaction was an illegal loan. That issue was decided against appellants, so that there is no dispute that every person who entered such transaction paid money as a result of the \u201cprohibited practice.\u201d This situation differs from one in which the consumer protection violation involves only a false or misleading representation or omission. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 13-301. In such transactions, we cannot be so certain that the money paid by each consumer was \"acquired from him by means of [the] prohibited practice\u201d without proof that the consumer entered into the transaction as a result of deceptive representations or omissions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-408(a)(\"[A]ny person may bring an action to recover for injury for loss sustained by him as the result of a practice prohibited by this title\u201d); <em>see also Citaramanis v. Hallowell, </em>328 Md. 142, 151-53, 613 A.2d 964 (1992)(observing that the General Assembly intended that private recovery under Consumer Protection Act be given only for actual injury or loss sustained as a result of the conduct that violates the Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">. CL \u00a7 13-410(d) requires the Division to consider the following factors in imposing a civil penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">(1) The severity of the violation for which the penalty is assessed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">(2) The good faith of the violator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">(3) Any history of prior violations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">(4) Whether the amount of the penalty will achieve the desired deterrent purpose; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">(5) Whether the issuance of a cease and desist order, including restitution, is insufficient for the protection of consumers.
