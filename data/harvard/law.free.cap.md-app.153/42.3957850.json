Appellant, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (\u201cWMATA\u201d), noted an appeal from an order entered by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) awarding a penalty, as a sanction for the late payment of attorney\u2019s fees, to counsel for Kenneth D. Hewitt, appellee. The entitlement to fees arose from an order of the Commission of May 25, 2001, ordering benefits to be paid to appellee as a result of a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Because neither party sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order, the provisions of the Commission\u2019s rules, as promulgated in the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCO-MAR\u201d) 14.09.01.24A(4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> came into play. Appellant issued a check for attorney\u2019s fees sixteen days after the time for appeal expired, which appellee deemed to be late and in violation of the Commission rule. As a result, appellee\u2019s counsel requested that the Commission assess late payment penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Following a hearing before the Commission on September 24, 2001, WMATA was assessed a fine in the amount of 20% of the fee awarded by the Commission. WMATA sought judicial review of that order in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Appellee responded by filing a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>judgment. A motions hearing was held on August 23, 2002, at the conclusion of which the court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee and remanded the matter to the Commission for issuance of an Order affirming its September 24, 2001 Order. WMATA noted a timely appeal to this court on-September 23, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">WMATA presents two questions for review, as recast:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">I. Whether as a matter of law WMATA is entitled to fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the appeal period of a Maryland workers\u2019 compensation award of benefits to make timely payment of attorneys fees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">II. Whether the Commission erred in awarding sanctions where the employer established good cause for the delay in payment and the claimant suffered no prejudice by reason of the payments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">We answer both questions in the negative, and shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">On August 13, 1998, appellee sustained an injury arising out of, and in the course of, his employment with WMATA. Appellee filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim and a hearing was held on May 18, 2001, before the Commission. The' Commission issued its Order on May 25, 2001, awarding appellee both temporary total disability and permanent partial disability. Additionally, the Commission awarded appellee\u2019s counsel attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $3,365, plus $96.92 in advanced costs, to be paid out of the final weeks of appellee\u2019s compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">When the time in which to seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order expired on June 25, 2001, neither party had filed a notice of judicial review. The checks satisfying the Commission\u2019s order for attorney\u2019s fees were issued and mailed on July 10, 2001, and received by appellee\u2019s counsel on July 11, 2001. As a result of the delay, appellee filed issues with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Commission requesting a hearing on whether a penalty for late payments of attorney\u2019s fees should be assessed against WMATA.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On September 20, 2001, the Commission held a hearing on the issue of late payment of attorney\u2019s fees. Appellee argued that attorney\u2019s fees should have been paid immediately after the expiration of the appeal period, as required by COMAR 14.09.01.24A(4). At the hearing, the Commissioner inquired into the exact date the check for fees was paid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">THE COMMISSION: When was the check paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">\u2756 \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: It got sent about sixteen days after the date of the appeal period expiring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">THE COMMISSION: What was the date of the mailing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ade\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: July 10th. We received it on July 11th. The checks were cut and mailed July 10th, which is forty-six days after the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No dispute about that, Your Honor. Sixteen days after it became due as under the regs. [sic ], and that\u2019s when we issued the check. We think that\u2019s reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">The Commission issued an Order on September 24, 2001, finding that WMATA had failed to pay the Order of May 25, 2001, in a timely manner pursuant to COMAR 14.09.01.24A(4). A f\u00edne of 20% of the legal fee awarded was assessed as a penalty, in accordance with \u00a7 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>WMATA originally appealed the decision of the Commission to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on October 23, 2001. That court granted appellee\u2019s motion to transfer, based on improper venue, on November 26, 2001, and the appeal was transferred to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Appellant\u2019s appeal of the Commission\u2019s decision was heard on August 23, 2002. The fact that the checks were mailed sixteen days after the expiration of appellee\u2019s appeal was undisputed. In support of its argument of timely payment, appellant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">THE COURT: Didn\u2019t you tell\u2014I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you. Didn\u2019t you tell the commission it was 16 days afterwards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Sixteen days after\u2014doing it mathematically, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">THE COURT: I mean, you basically conceded to the\u2014that it was a day late?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No, I said it was 16 days. I never said it was late. I said I thought that was still timely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">In granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajh\">All right. I\u2019m going to grant the motion for summary judgment in this case and for this reason: It always is interesting to see how other judges look at things. To me the phrase \u201cThe parties shall remit the approved fee to the attorney immediately\u201d is not a legal issue that a judge or a commissioner would have equal standing under a statutory scheme.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>To me \u201cShall remit the fee immediately\u201d is a factual matter. We all know what the word immediately means. Immediately means right away, you do it right now, you do it as soon as you can, you do it as soon as the predicate that requires you to do it do it[sic]. It\u2019s\u2014to me that is a factual matter, and therefore I believe that the Workers Compensation Committee [sic] is presumed to be correct in that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">I also find\u2014well, I will also grant the motion for summary judgment totally. I don\u2019t think whether or not there was an abuse of discretion has been properly raised, and even if it had been properly raised, I mean, I have not seen that pleaded anywhere. Even if it had been properly raised that is not a matter for a circuit court jury, so I\u2019m going to sign the order in the file granting the motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">A decision of the Commission is prima facie correct and the burden of proof is upon the party attacking the decision. <em>Blake Construction Co. v. Wells, </em>245 Md. 282, 286, 225 A.2d <em>857 </em>(1967). \u201c[I]f the mind of the trier of facts is in equal balance on the evidence in the record, the finding of the Commission should be affirmed.\u201d <em>Blake Construction Co., supra, </em>245 Md. at 286-87, 225 A.2d 857 (citing <em>Greenwalt v. Brauns Bldg. Specialties Corp., </em>203 Md. 313, 318, 100 A.2d 804 (1953)). The standard of review for workers\u2019 compensation cases requires the examination of three factors: \u201c(1) did the Commission justly consider all the facts \u2018concerning the injury\u2019; (2) did it exceed the powers granted to it by art. 101;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) did it misconstrue the law and facts \u2018applicable in the case decided\u2019?\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Bowen, </em>54 Md.App. 375, 385, 458 A.2d 1242 (1983). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2018\u201cshould be construed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes\u2019 and ... any uncertainty \u2018should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holy Cross Hospital v. Nichols, </em>290 Md. 149, 162, 428 A.2d 447 (1981) (quoting <em>Howard County Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">When reviewing an award of attorney\u2019s fees by the Commission, the standard of review utilized by both the circuit and appellate courts is \u201climited to determining whether the Commission exceeded the powers granted to it by [former] Md.Code Ann., art. 101, and whether it misconstrued the law and facts applicable to the case decided.\u201d <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Comm\u2019n v. May, </em>88 Md.App. 408, 416, 594 A.2d 1232 (1991) (citing former Md.Code Ann., art. 101, \u00a7 56). <em>See also Mitchell v. Goodyear Serv. Store, </em>63 Md.App. 426, 433-34, 492 A.2d 984 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>306 Md. 27, 506 A.2d 1178 (1986). The amount of such fees awarded is a decision within the sound discretion of the Commission, and \u201cit is not the province of the courts to constrain the legitimate exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>May, supra, </em>88 Md.App. at 416, 594 A.2d 1232 (quoting <em>Bowen, supra, </em>54 Md.App. at 386, 458 A.2d 1242).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\n<em>I. Is WMATA entitled, as a matter of law, to fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the appeal period of a Maryland workers compensation award of benefits to make timely payment of attorneys fees?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Appellant argues that its payment of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Commission orders is governed by both \u00a7 9-727 of the Labor and Employment Article and COMAR 14.09.01.24A(4). From that premise, WMATA draws the conclusion that the provisions of COMAR 14.09.01.24A(4), requiring the payment of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cimmediately\u201d after the expiration of a claimant\u2019s thirty day appeal period, and \u00a7 9-727 of the Labor and Employment Article, giving an employer fifteen days to pay any award of compensation, should be read together. Essentially, they ask us to graft the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00a7 9-727 onto the provisions of COMAR 14.09.01.24A(4), thereby allowing forty-five days from the entry of the Commission\u2019s order of compensation for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. We decline the invitation, for to do so would subvert the immediacy of the Commission\u2019s rule. Appellee properly argues that the fifteen day provision regarding the payment of compensation to the claimant is not applicable to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, and therefore WMATA does not receive the benefit of an additional fifteen days to pay the fees ordered by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">This case is, in essence, one of statutory construction. The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to determine and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Bowen v. Smith, </em>342 Md. 449, 454, 677 A.2d 81 (1996) (citing <em>Shah v. Howard County, </em>337 Md. 248, 254, 653 A.2d 425 (1995)). The principal source for determination of legislative intent is the language of the statute itself. <em>Lovellette v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983). If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the language to determine legislative intent. <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997)(citing <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">If a statute is ambiguous, or susceptible to more than one meaning, \u201ccourts must consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words but also the meaning of the words in light of the statute as a whole and within the context of the objectives and purposes of the enactment.\u201d <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union, supra, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d 455 (citing <em>Romm v. Flax, </em>340 Md. 690, 693, 668 A.2d 1 (1995)). When interpreting statutes, courts \u201cseek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994)). We find no ambiguity in Lab. &amp; Empl. \u00a7 9-727.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>When considering the validity of a regulation promulgated by an administrative agency, the prevailing standard of review is whether the regulation is \u201c \u2018consistent, with the letter and spirit of the law under which the agency acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 687, 684 A.2d 804 (1996) (quoting <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Res., </em>335 Md. 427, 437, 644 A.2d 34 (1994) (citations omitted)). The Court of Appeals has consistently held \u201cwhere the Legislature has delegated such broad authority to a state administrative agency to promulgate regulations in an area, the agency\u2019s regulations are valid under the statute if they do not contradict the statutory language or purpose.\u201d <em>Lussier, supra, </em>343 Md. at 688, 684 A.2d 804. We find nothing in the Commission\u2019s rule that would contradict the statutory language or purpose of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Having determined that the fifteen day requirement for the payment of claimant\u2019s benefits has no implication on the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, we must construe whether a payment made sixteen days after the expiration of the appeal period has been made \u201cimmediately.\u201d In lay terms, \u201cimmediately\u201d is defined as \u201cinstantly; without delay.\u201d The new oxford American dictionary, 849 (Oxford Univ. Press 2001). In the legal context, \u201cimmediately\u201d has been construed to mean \u201cwithout interval of time, without delay, straightaway, without any delay or lapse of time.\u201d <em>Drumbar v. Jeddo-Highland Coal Co., </em>155 Pa.Super. 57, 37 A.2d 25, 27 n.4 (Pa.Super.Ct.1944) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The words \u201cimmediately\u201d and \u201cforthwith\u201d have generally the same meaning and are stronger than the expression \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d and imply prompt, vigorous action without any delay. <em>Alsam Holding Co. v. Consolidated Taxpayers\u2019 Mut. Ins. Co., </em>167 Misc. 732, 4 N.Y.S.2d 498, 505 (N.Y.Mun.Ct.1938); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 751 (7th ed.1999). The Court of Appeals has defined \u201cforthwith\u201d in the context of the notice requirement of an insurance policy, to mean \u201c \u2018with due diligence, or without unnecessary procrastination or delay, under all the circumstances of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Argyrou v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>349 Md. 587, 603, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998) (quoting <em>Edwards v. Baltimore, Fire Ins. Co., </em>3 Gill 176, 188 (1845)). <em>See Ervin v. Beland, </em>251 Md. 612, 617, 248 A.2d 336 (1968) (various definitions of \u201cforthwith\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We conclude that the trial court was correct in saying that \u201c[w]e all know what the word immediately means. Immediately means right away, you do it right now, you do it as soon as you can, you do it as soon as the predicate that requires you to do it [is met].\u201d We agree with the trial court that \u201cimmediately\u201d is subject to no other reasonable interpretation than \u201cdo it now,\u201d and that sixteen days does not satisfy the imperative action required by the use of the word \u201cimmediately\u201d in the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>II. Did the Commission err in awarding sanctions where the employer established good cause for the delay in payment and where the claimant suffered no prejudice by reason of the payments?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Appellant asserts that the sixteen day delay was reasonable in the circumstances. However, we find no evidence in the record to support a reasonable basis for the delay. There is no explanation for the fact that the checks were not mailed until July 10 when, in fact, the appeal period expired on June 25. Appellant explains to us now that it is its \u201cstandard procedure,\u201d but the record does not support reasonableness of the \u201cstandard procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No evidence was offered to the trial court that might have explained or justified the sixteen day delay. Because the trial court determined that \u201cimmediately\u201d did not mean sixteen days, and because it was offered no explanation for the delay, we cannot fault the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">As we have noted, it is appellant\u2019s posture that, even if it is not entitled to the additional fifteen days, as claimed, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>were circumstances that excused the delayed payment. Rather than offer evidence, however, appellant supported its position before the motions judge by reliance upon a decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County finding that employers and insurers were, in fact, entitled to the additional fifteen days after the expiration of the appeal period. The court in the case <em>sub judice </em>allowed that, while the Montgomery County decision was interesting, it was not precedent. Appellant might have escaped the entry of summary judgment by presenting probative evidence to explain the delay. As we have seen, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Therefore, we hold that Lab. <em>&amp; </em>Empl. \u00a7 9-727 does not automatically entitle an employer or insurer to withhold payment of ordered attorney\u2019s fees for an additional fifteen days after the expiration of the time for seeking judicial review of an order of the Commission. We hold further that, under the facts of this case, there was no justification for appellant not to remit the attorney\u2019s fees \u201cimmediately\u201d after the expiration of the 80 day appeal period, as required by COMAR 14.09.01.24A(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\">.
