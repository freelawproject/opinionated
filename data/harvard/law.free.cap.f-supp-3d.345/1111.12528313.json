Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56(a), a court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Under Rule 56, the moving party bears the initial burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Once the moving party meets its burden, then the non-moving party must cite \"particular\n   parts of materials in the record\" showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Fed. R. Civ.

Ginger extractive, which is a syrupy liquid obtained from the ginger root;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   3.

In Dr. Befurt's survey, only 40.59% of respondents chose \"ginger root,\" while 21.34% of respondents choice \"ginger extractive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Dr. Befurt also ran the survey using hyper-technical language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. In that survey, the results favored a \"don't know\" response.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although Dr. Befurt's survey sheds much doubt on the validity of Dr. Dennis's survey results, it is not so overwhelming as to require summary judgment. Dr. Befurt's own survey suggests that anywhere from 11.54% to 40.59% of consumers may believe that \"Made from Real Ginger\" implies that Canada Dry is made using ginger root. Dr. Pepper insists that Dr. Befurt's survey results simply shows that the survey methodology used by Dr. Dennis is too unreliable to sustain Plaintiffs' claim. However, as explained by the Court in is previous Order on class certification, this is a credibility and weight determination that must go before the trier of fact at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 199 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants rely on several federal district court cases to support their argument that summary judgment is appropriate because the \"Made from Real Ginger\" claim is not misleading. All of those cases, however, are distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ries v. Arizona Beverages USA LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-01139-RS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201287416\">\n    2013 WL 1287416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 28, 2013) plaintiffs challenged an iced tea company's \"All Natural\" labeling on their beverages because the drinks contained high fructose corn syrup and citric acid. There, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the iced tea company because the plaintiffs provided \"neither intrinsic evidence that the labels are false (because HFCS and citric acid are not natural)\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   extrinsic evidence that a significant portion of the consuming public would be confused by them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. In contrast, Plaintiffs in this case\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   provided extrinsic evidence in the form of consumer surveys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Townsend v.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether Dr. Pepper Implies Canada Dry Has More Than a Trace Amount of Ginger Oleoresin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label implies that Canada Dry contains more than a \"trace amount\" of ginger compounds. In support of their allegation, Plaintiffs rely on Dr. Manoj Hastak's opinion, where he discussed the concepts of \"inter-attribute misleadingness\" and concludes that consumers would believe that Canada Dry contains \"an appreciable amount\" of ginger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 227-4 (\"Hastak Report\") \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25. Plaintiffs also rely on Dr. Dana Krueger's expert report, where he found that Canada Dry contained between 0.19 mg/L and 1.44 mg/L of various ginger compounds (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 227-3 (\"Krueger Report\") at 4-5) and Ms. Annette Hottenstein's expert opinion, where she concluded that the ginger content of Canada Dry is too low to be tasted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 228-6 (\"Hottenstein Report\") at 21-22. Dr. Pepper only discusses this theory in the context of Plaintiffs' health benefits claim and counters that Canada Dry's labeling contains no language regarding the quantity of ginger in the beverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As a stand-alone claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' have not raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label is misleading as to the amount of ginger in Canada Dry. The label makes no claims as to the amount of ginger in Canada Dry. And Plaintiffs presented no admissible evidence showing how much ginger reasonable consumers would expect Canada Dry to contain or even if reasonable consumers are even likely to expect a certain amount of ginger in the beverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chuang v. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. cv-17-01875-MWF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204286577\">\n    2017 WL 4286577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 20, 2017) (dismissing claim that a fruit snack did not contain sufficient fruit when the \"made with Real Fruit\" label and packaging makes no claims as to the amount of fruit in the snack). Indeed, it is not even clear how much ginger Canada Dry must contain to pass muster under Plaintiffs' theory. Plaintiffs' opposition suggests that consumers expect Canada Dry to contain more than a \"trace amount\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 237 at 25-26), while Ms. Hottenstein's opinion suggests it must contain enough ginger such that consumers can taste the ginger (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hottenstein Report at 21-22), and Dr. Hastak's opinion argues for \"an appreciable amount.\" However, nowhere did Plaintiffs point to any evidence that\n   <em>\n    consumers\n   </em>\n   would expect a certain amount of ginger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The only evidence Plaintiffs provide to support their allegation that consumers would likely expect a certain amount of ginger is Dr. Hastak's opinion. However, Dr. Hastak's opinion does not engage with the facts of this case. He simply concludes that consumers \"do not believe that a marketer would make such a claim that a product is 'made from' or 'contains' and ingredient ... if the product contained only trace amounts of the promoted ingredient\" without any evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hastak\n   Report \u00b6 24. This high-level theory of consumer behavior is nothing more than\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   . Without Dr. Hastak's opinion, Plaintiffs offer no evidence to link Dr. Pepper's label to consumer expectation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The evidence that is available refutes Plaintiffs' stand-alone theory. For example, in Dr. Pepper's internal studies regarding the label, respondents expressed skepticism about the amount of ginger in Canada Dry after being exposed to Dr. Pepper's advertising.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 237-12 at 12, 16. This suggests that reasonable consumers are not misled about the amount of ginger in the beverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment on this stand-alone claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Whether Dr. Pepper Implies Canada Dry Has Health Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label implies that Canada Dry has health benefits or is \"better for you\" than other sodas. The parties do not dispute that Canada Dry does not provide any measurable health benefit. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have raised a dispute of material fact for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs produced internal documents by Dr. Pepper's marketing team showing that Dr. Pepper intended to take advantage of the health benefits associated with ginger.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 237-22 at 15. These documents strongly suggest that Dr. Pepper not only intended to take advantage of the health halo of ginger, but also relied on a perceived link between \"awareness that [Canada Dry] is from real ginger\" and health.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 237-12 at 16 (consumer responded that \"[i]t is very important (to know that Canada Dry has real ginger in it) because you know there are health benefits so that when you make you're [sic] choices when it comes to soft drink [sic], you might as well enjoy something that has some benefits.\"). Indeed, at least one document, an internal memorandum by Dr. Pepper's advertising team, concluded that conveying to consumers that Canada Dry was made from real ginger \"implied that Canada Dry Ginger Ale was healthier because it contained real ginger.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 237-13 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The evidence listed above distinguishes this case from cases cited by Dr. Pepper in support of their argument. In\n   <em>\n    Chuang\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court dismissed a false advertising claim alleging that packaging misled consumers into thinking a fruit snack was healthy by claiming it was \"made with Real Fruit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204286577\">\n    2017 WL 4286577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. The packaging, however, also stated that the snacks were \"not intended to replace fruit in the diet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15. By contrast, in this case, Plaintiffs are not simply alleging that the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label leads consumers to believe that Canada Dry is \"healthy,\" but that the \"Made from Real Ginger\" claim implies that Canada Dry is healthier than other sodas. Plaintiffs are not relying solely on the label, but also rely on Dr. Pepper's own documents suggesting that \"Made from Real Ginger\" implies that Canada Dry is healthier than other sodas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Furthermore, Dr. Pepper's internal marketing documents strongly suggest that Dr. Pepper's push to get consumers to associate Canada Dry with ginger-related health benefits may have been successful.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 237-24. In a 2014 study, Dr. Pepper's third-party consultant concluded that over 30% of consumers who increased their ginger ale consumption did so because of the perceived health benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. That study, as well as Dr. Pepper's other internal marketing documents, did not specifically look at the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label to draw its conclusions and it is possible that broader advertising efforts by Dr. Pepper, not the\n   label, is responsible for consumer perceptions about the health benefits of Canada Dry. That possibility, however, is a factual consideration that must be resolved by the trier of fact at trial. Simply put, it would be odd for the Court to conclude that Dr. Pepper's advertisements do not affect consumer expectations regarding Canada Dry, when Dr. Pepper itself believes that it had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

For the most part, the Court denied requests to seal portions of deposition transcripts that did not discuss trade secrets or other confidential information. The Court also denied the parties' request to seal Ms. Leslie Norris's declaration (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 236-1) in its entirety as significant portions of her declaration discusses non-confidential matters, such as generally applicable principles of flavor science (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The parties must file revised redacted versions of the deposition transcripts and Ms. Norris's declaration within seven days of this order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court GRANTS Dr. Pepper's motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiffs' claim that the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label misleads consumers as to the amount of ginger in Canada Dry. The Court DENIES summary judgment on all other claims presented in Dr. Pepper's motion. The claims to be tried are Plaintiffs' remaining claims under the CLRA, FAL, UCL, and common law against Dr. Pepper:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   1. Whether the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label misleads consumers as to the form of ginger in Canada Dry; and\n   2. Whether the \"Made from Real Ginger\" label misleads consumers as to the health benefits of Canada Dry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Additionally, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Dr. Pepper and Plaintiffs' motions to seal. The parties must file revised redacted versions of the deposition transcripts and Ms. Norris's declaration within seven days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Though the Court recognizes that there are two related defendants in this action, the Court will refer to defendants collectively as \"Dr. Pepper\" in the singular.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Pepper's \"Made from Real Ginger\" label is literally false.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 237 at 27. The evidence before the Court does not support Plaintiffs' argument. It is undisputed that Dr. Pepper makes Canada Dry from ginger oleoresin, which is made from real ginger.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Kramer Depo. at 56:7-18.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Except for deposition transcripts, all page numbers refer to the automatically generated CM/ECF page numbers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    This exhibit was submitted in support of Plaintiffs' motion for class certification.
