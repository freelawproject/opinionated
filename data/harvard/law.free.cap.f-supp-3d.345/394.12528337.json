First, Peloton argues that the claims in which these terms appear impermissibly claim both an apparatus\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a method of using that apparatus, running up against Federal Circuit holdings forbidding such dual claiming. (Dkt. No. 77 at 10-11, 14.) Second, Peloton argues that the patent's use of the different words \"control\" and \"drive\" in an otherwise identical manner renders both of these terms indefinite, because these separate words are presumed to have different meanings that the '513 patent fails to disclose with reasonable certainty. (Dkt. No. 77 at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   VR Optics disputes both of these conclusions. First, VR Optics contends that these terms are both part of pure apparatus claims, and that the Federal Circuit permits the use of functional language to describe a claimed apparatus. (Dkt. No. 85-1 at 11-12.) Second, VR Optics cites Federal Circuit authority permitting patentees to use different words to describe the same subject matter or similar concepts. (Dkt. No. 75 at 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   It is Peloton's burden to establish the indefiniteness of these claim terms, and indefiniteness must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    BASF Corp. v.

Peloton fails to meet that burden here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court first addresses Peloton's argument that these claim terms impermissibly claim both an apparatus\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a method of using that apparatus. The Federal Circuit has \"held that 'reciting both an apparatus and a method of using that apparatus renders a claim indefinite under section 112, paragraph 2.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt Data Techs., LP v.

Similarly, the language of the relevant claim term in\n   <em>\n    IPXL Holdings\n   </em>\n   clearly included within its scope both a \"system\" and different ways a \"user uses the [system].\"\n   <em>\n    IPXL Holdings, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1594208\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/1377/#p1384\">\n    430 F.3d at 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The claim terms at issue here are unlike those that the Federal Circuit rejected in\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    IPXL Holdings\n   </em>\n   . VR Optics correctly disputes Peloton's contention that the '513 patent's references to \"[controlling/driving] the display\" clearly encompass both apparatus and methods of using that apparatus. Instead, an examination of the relevant claim terms in context reveals that they are limited to a claimed apparatus, an apparatus which itself functions to \"[drive/control] the display.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For example, claim 6 includes the following limitation: \"logic configured to control the display in response to both the first and second performance parameters, such that a performance comparison between the fitness equipment and at least one remote fitness equipment is visually displayed.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 24 ll. 2-6.) The claimed invention here is the apparatus itself, which the claim describes as including logic that performs the claimed functions. The claimed invention thus does not call for the user to perform or utilize the apparatus in any specified way. Instead, the invention merely describes how the claimed apparatus itself is capable of functioning. \"A patent applicant is free to recite features of an apparatus either structurally or functionally.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Schreiber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"977967\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/128/1473/#p1478\">\n    128 F.3d 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1997). That is all that the '513 patent applicant did with the claims at issue here. Accordingly, the claim limitations using the terms \"control/drive the display\" are not indefinite for including both an apparatus and a method for using that apparatus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Peloton's second argument is that the patentee's varying use of \"drive\" and \"control\" to describe identical functions without providing a method for distinguishing the meaning of these two words renders both terms indefinite. But the Federal Circuit has explained that \"[d]ifferent terms or phrases in separate claims may be construed to cover the same subject matter where the written description and prosecution history indicate that such a reading of the terms or phrases is proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Nystrom v. TREX Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927598\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/1136/#p1143\">\n    424 F.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143 (Fed. Cir. 2005). For example, the Federal Circuit has previously declined to mandate separate constructions of a patent's varying uses of the words \"connected\" and \"associated\" to describe identical concepts, instead holding that \"the context does not show that 'connected' and 'associated' should be differentiated ..., and we must conclude that this is simply a case where the patentee used different words to express similar concepts, even though it may be confusing drafting practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9202616\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/1111/#p1115\">\n    381 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Similarly here, Peloton points to no evidence intrinsic to the patent indicating that these terms were intended to describe different functions. Instead, the consistent manner in which the specification describes the invention's display functions, and the nearly identical contexts of these terms' usages in the claim limitations, indicates that the patentee simply chose to use a different word, namely \"drive\" instead of \"control,\" to describe the same otherwise clear function. This may have been poor drafting, but that poor drafting does not provide clear and convincing evidence sufficient to render these claim terms indefinite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the Court affords the claim terms \" control the display\" and \" drive the display\" their plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Course Data\" and Related Terms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-50\"><strong>Claim Language</strong> <strong>Claim(s)</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's Proposed</strong> <strong>Defendant's Proposed</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"course data\"/\"course\" 5, 9, 18, 19 \"course data\" as \"data \"course data\" as \"data defining a particular defining at least a route interactive exercise activity and distance\" (for example, a spin class, a treadmill class, a race, etc.)\" \"course\" as plain and ordinary meaning \"course\" as \"a particular interactive exercise activity (for example, a spin class, a treadmill class, a race, etc.)\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The parties' disputes regarding the construction of the claim terms \"course data\" and \"course\" turn on whether the types of \"courses\" covered by these claims need to be construed in a limiting or broadening manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Peloton proposes that \"course data\" be construed as \"data defining at least a route and distance,\" because, according to Peloton, the specification clearly and consistently uses the word \"course\" to refer only to virtual race courses that follow a set route and distance. (Dkt. No. 77 at 16-19.) Peloton adds that construing the scope of \"course\" as covering a broader range of exercise activities would run afoul of the plain terms of certain of the claim limitations, which clearly employ the word \"course\" in exclusively spatial terms. (Dkt. No. 77 at 20-21;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 24 ll. 16-17 (\"such that a user's relative position on a course is determined and maintained\").) At the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing, counsel for Peloton disclaimed the need to construe \"course\" differently from the phrase \"course data,\" and conceded that its proposed construction of \"course data\" would be sufficient for purposes of this case. (Dkt. No. 110-5 at 63-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   VR Optics proposes that the word \"course\" as used in the '513 patent's references to \"course data\" should not be so limited, but rather should be construed to include any \"particular interactive exercise activity (for example, a spin class, a treadmill class, a race, etc.).\" (Dkt. No. 75 at 15.) VR Optics cites to portions of the patent specification where, it asserts, \"course\" is used open-endedly to refer to indeterminate types of events or activities. (Dkt. No. 75 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The intrinsic evidence of the '513 patent favors Peloton's proposed construction. The Court starts with an examination of the use of the phrases \"course\" and \"course data\" in the claim limitations themselves. \"Because claim terms are normally used consistently throughout the patent, the usage of a term in one claim can often illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. AWH Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/\">\n    415 F.3d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). Only Peloton's construction of \"course\" is consistent with the use of the phrase in each of the '513 patent's claim limitations. For example, the '513 patent includes, in relevant part, the following claim limitation: \"logic to compare the first performance parameters with course data, such that a user's relative position on a course is determined and maintained.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 24 ll. 14-17.) Adopting VR Optics' proposed construction would require construing this claim as referring to a user's \"position on a spin class,\" which is nonsensical. Other claim terms refer to a user's \"current position\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   on a \"course\" relative to a computer-generated \"racer.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 25 l. 54 - col. 26, l. 15.) Again, adopting VR Optics' proposed construction of \"course\" as expressly including within its scope spin classes renders these claim terms nonsensical, a strongly disfavored result under the principles of claim construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Consistent with the usage of the terms \"course\" and \"course data\" in these claim limitations, the specification's preferred embodiments also exclusively use the word \"course\" to refer to courses involving route and distance, such as \"racing courses.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 6 ll. 60-63; col. 7 ll. 3-9; col. 8 ll. 29-36.) For example, the specification uses the word \"courses\" in parallel with the phrase \"racing circuits,\" and it frequently uses spatial and physical descriptors such as \"layout, distances, terrain, scenery, etc.\" to describe a \"course.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And all of the figures in the '513 patent displaying what a user would experience or perceive when using the invention represent the user traversing a race course or a physical space. (Dkt. No. 1-1 figs. 2-5B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   VR Optics' selective quotations from other portions of the specification do nothing to rebut this conclusion. For example, VR Optics cites a portion of the specification that uses the phrase \"course data\" to refer to the environmental graphics that competing virtual-bicycle racers might perceive when using the invention. (Dkt. No. 75 at 16 (citing Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 11 l. 61 - col. 12 l. 21.) ) This usage of \"course data\" in a portion of the specification describing racers and their physical environment only buttresses the conclusion that the phrase \"course data\" is intended to convey a physical race course to be traversed by the user. The other portions of the specification cited by VR Optics are similarly unavailing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 75 at 16 (citing Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 15 ll. 10-13 (\"[O]ne embodiment of the present invention ... effectively defines a course over which a competitive race or event is to take place.\"); col. 16 ll. 13-18 (describing \"courses that a user may select among for competing in a given race\") ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   VR Optics also points to the \"Background of the Invention\" section of the '513 patent, which describes the rising popularity of \"Spinning Classes\" and \"Treadmill Classes.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 1 l. 65 - col. 2 l. 9.) But importantly, the patentee refers to these activities using the word \"classes\" rather than \"courses,\" indicating that the patentee viewed these classes as distinct from its invention's \"courses.\" The consistent usage of the word \"course\" to refer to racing activities in all of the '513 patent's preferred embodiments and claim limitations, contrasted with the patentee's use of a different word in the background section to describe \"Spinning Classes\" and \"Treadmill Classes,\" confirms rather than rebuts the propriety of Peloton's proposed construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the Court construes \" course data\" as \"data defining at least a route and distance,\" and concludes that no further construction of \"course\" is necessary in light of that construction of \"course data.\"\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-60\"><strong>Claim Language</strong> <strong>Claim(s)</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's Proposed</strong> <strong>Defendant's Proposed</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"selected course\" 5 \"a particular interactive Plain and ordinary exercise activity (for meaning example, a spin class, a treadmill class, a race, etc.) selected by a user\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In light of the Court's construction of \"course data\" as \"data defining at least a route and distance,\" the Court concludes that no further construction of \"course,\" as that word is used in the claim term \"selected course,\" is necessary. It remains only for the Court to consider the parties' dispute with respect to whether \"selected course\" must be construed to clarify the identity of the course's selector. (Dkt. No. 75 at 18; Dkt. No. 77 at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With respect to VR Optics' proposed introduction of the phrase \"selected by a user\" to the construction of this claim term, the Court finds this proposed addition to the limitation without support. The Federal Circuit has cautioned that \"it is important not to import into a claim limitations that are not a part of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    SuperGuide Corp. v. DirecTV Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296161\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/870/#p875\">\n    358 F.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 875 (Fed. Cir. 2004). While at times the specification describes the user as the selector of a course, \"a particular embodiment appearing in the written description may not be read into a claim when the claim language is broader than the embodiment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296161\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/870/#p875\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, VR Optics does not point to any evidence, either intrinsic or extrinsic, justifying this substantive modification of the scope of a claim limitation. (Dkt. No. 75 at 18.) The Court therefore rejects VR Optics' proposed construction of the claim term \"selected course\" and concludes that no further construction of that phrase is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-63\"><strong>Claim Language</strong> <strong>Claim(s)</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's Proposed</strong> <strong>Defendant's Proposed</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"data defining course data for a 5 Plain and ordinary meaning Indefinite selected course\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Peloton proposes that the phrase \"data defining course data for a selected course\" in claim 5 be construed as indefinite. (Dkt. No. 77 at 15.) It bases this proposed construction on the use of different phraseology to describe seemingly similar concepts in other claims, such as claim 8, which speaks of \"data defining a selected course,\" and claims 9, 18, and 19, which speak simply of \"course data.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Peloton, because \"the patentee used three irreconcilably different phrases in claims 5, 8, 9, 18 and 19, they must be given distinct meanings. Here, the specification provides no such disclosure and the phrase is, accordingly, indefinite.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   VR Optics counters that the phrases used in claims 5, 8, 9, 18, and 19 are not irreconcilably different, but rather each is independently clear, despite their different usages of the underlying phrases \"selected course\" and \"course data.\" (Dkt. No. 85-1 at 15-16.) VR Optics asserts that the additional preface \"data defining,\" which is unique to claim 5, serves a purpose specific to that claim, namely limiting the types of \"data\" described in claim 1, on which claim 5 is dependent, as specifically \"defining course data for a selected course.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Peloton fails to present clear and convincing evidence sufficient to render the disputed claim term indefinite.\n   <em>\n    BASF Corp. v.

Claim 5 reads in full as follows: \"The system as defined in claim 1, where each fitness equipment further includes logic to download data defining course data for a selected course through the communication interface.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 23 ll. 54-57.) In turn, claim 1, on which claim 5 is dependent, references data in the following claim limitation: \"a communication interface through which data may be communicated to and from the fitness equipment.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 23 ll. 27-28.) Standing alone, the meaning of these phrases is perfectly clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Claim 1 lays claim to an apparatus capable of communicating data to and from fitness equipment, and claim 5 further provides that the data to be downloaded through that interface defines course data for a selected course. These \"claims, viewed in light of the specification and prosecution history, inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580976,12707010\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2120/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The extrinsic evidence in the record also supports this conclusion. (Dkt. No. 78 \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The other claims highlighted by Peloton, each of which describe slightly different but similar functions to those claimed by claim 5, use the phrases \"data defining a selected course\" or simply \"course data\" rather than the disputed term \"data defining course data for a selected course.\" But Peloton does not assert that any of the varying subcomponents of each of these phrases (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"course data\" and \"selected course\") are themselves indefinite. (Dkt. No. 69-1 at 1, 3.) Furthermore, Peloton also does not dispute that each of the claims it points to contributes a substantively different feature to the claimed invention. Accordingly, the Court finds that the syntactical differences highlighted by Peloton in the wording of these various claims are indicative at most of \"confusing drafting practice,\" but the patentee's consistent and clear use of the same underlying substantive component phrases in these claims supports the conclusion that \"this is simply a case where the patentee used different words to express similar concepts.\"\n   <em>\n    Innova/Pure Water, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9202616\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/1111/#p1115\">\n    381 F.3d at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In short, Peloton fails to identify clear and convincing evidence of the indefiniteness of the phrase \" data defining course data for a selected course\" in claim 5.

No. 75 at 11-13.) To support its proposed construction, VR Optics emphasizes the context of this term's use in claim 1 of the '513 patent. According to VR Optics, this context indicates that the \"interactive\" nature of the relevant events clearly encompasses interaction among a plurality of users. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, with respect to the scope of the claimed \"exercise events,\" VR Optics argues that the specification's description of both races and classes supports its proposed construction, which would make the inclusion of those types of activities within the scope of claim 1 explicit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Peloton argues that \"interactive exercise events\" should be afforded its plain and ordinary meaning. (Dkt. No. 77 at 22.) Peloton relies on the Federal Circuit rule mandating that claim terms be given their plain and ordinary meaning rather than a limiting construction absent \"any express disclaimer or independent lexicography in the written description that would justify adding that negative limitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Omega Eng'g, Inc. v.

Cir. 2003). Peloton urges the Court to apply that rule here, because the term \"interactive exercise events\" is found nowhere in the specification, is used only once in claim 1 of the '513 patent, and is sufficiently clear on its own to render an additional limiting construction unnecessary. (Dkt. No. 77 at 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   VR Optics' proposed construction would improperly add limitations to claim 1 beyond the scope of the '513 patent's otherwise allowed-for claims. For example, VR Optics' introduction of the requirement that an \"interactive exercise event\" involve a \"plurality of participants\" would substantively alter the plain and ordinary meaning of the claim term in violation of the '513 patent's clear indication that some \"interactive\" activities involve only one participant. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 8 ll. 4-28 (describing a method of using the invention in which single users can race against themselves).) Consistent with this preferred embodiment, claim 1 as actually written would include within its scope a single user engaging in \"interactive exercise events\" involving himself interacting with the invention alone. VR Optics' construction mandating that \"interactive exercise events\" necessarily involve a plurality of users would exclude this preferred embodiment from the scope of claim 1, a strongly disfavored result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broadcom Corp. v.

The sole mention of the phrase \"interactive exercise events\" in the entire '513 patent is its use in the final claim limitation of claim 1. Still, VR Optics urges that its limiting construction is supported by the specific context of its use in claim 1, which reads in full as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   a computer program executed by the server to configure the server for coordinating the communication among the plurality of fitness equipment, such that a plurality of the geographically-separated fitness equipment may simulate interactive exercise events.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 23 ll. 35-39.) Contrary to VR Optics' contentions, this context does not foreclose the possibility that the plurality of linked fitness equipment could simulate for each individual user his or her own individual interactive exercise event. As such, context alone fails to \"reveal[ ] ... express intent to confer on the claim language the novel meaning imparted by [VR Optics' proposed] negative limitation.

Moreover, the patent's mention of spinning and treadmill classes is limited to a brief discussion\n   in the background section. (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 1 l. 67 - col. 2 l. 9.) This one mention also fails to \"reveal[ ] ... express intent to confer on the claim language the novel meaning imparted by [VR Optics' proposed] negative limitation.

VR Optics argues that the phrase's plain meaning fails to account for the manner in which any single piece of the claimed equipment is intended to be coupled with other pieces of similar equipment for cooperative interactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Peloton argues that the claim term \"interactive fitness equipment\" does not require any construction, but urges that if the term is to be construed it should be construed as a \"single piece of interactive fitness equipment.\" (Dkt. No. 77 at 24.) In support of its proposed addition of the words \"single piece of,\" Peloton notes that the two independent claims to use the term do so with the singular article \"\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   \" prefacing the phrase, and that subsequent dependent claims and the specification use the phrase in singular form. (Dkt. No. 77 at 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court agrees with Peloton to the extent that it asserts that the phrase \"interactive fitness equipment\" requires no additional construction. VR Optics' proposed construction inserting the requirement that \"interactive fitness equipment\" be \"coupled, directly or indirectly, with other exercise equipment\" would render subsequent dependent claim terms redundant. For example, dependent claim 12 provides: \"[t]he interactive fitness equipment as defined in claim 6, further including a communication interface.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 24 ll. 28-29.) But if the core term \"interactive fitness equipment\" is construed as inherently \"communicatively coupled\" with other equipment, the entirety of claim 12-which serves only to add to the \"interactive exercise equipment\" described in claim 6 an interface capable of communicating-becomes superfluous. This is a disfavored result under the principles of claim construction.\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/\">\n    415 F.3d at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise\n   to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The specification further indicates that the patentee's use the word of \"interactive\" does not necessarily indicate communicative coupling with other fitness equipment. For example, the specification uses \"interactive\" in the following manner in describing one preferred embodiment of the invention: \"It will be appreciated that the embodiment ... may allow a user to compete against his or her own skill sets from day to day, and effectively provide an interactive and real-time racing environment.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 19 ll. 50-53.) This description makes clear that the patentee conceived that its invention's \"interactive\" functions could be employed by a single user engaging with the invention alone, undermining VR Optics' assertion that based on the \"intrinsic evidence 'interactive fitness equipment' is understood to refer to exercise equipment that is coupled ... to other exercise equipment.\" (Dkt. No. 75 at 14.) Instead, the intrinsic evidence of the patent indicates that \"interactive fitness equipment\" is capable of functioning both independently\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   in communication with other coupled equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   By the same token, Peloton's proposed addition of the qualification \"single piece of\" to the construction of \"interactive fitness equipment\" would serve only to confuse in the jury in that it may appear to foreclose the otherwise clear and consistent use of the phrase \"interactive fitness equipment\" in the '513 patent to refer to such equipment both when coupled with other equipment and when used independently. This phrase as a whole is consistently and clearly used in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning throughout the '513 patent, and the Court sees no need to construe the claim otherwise for the benefit of the fact-finder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, the Court sees no need to supplement the plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase \"interactive fitness equipment\" with VR Optics' potentially confusing list referencing specific types of covered \"interactive fitness equipment.\" Instead, construing the phrase in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning is independently and sufficiently clear for the fact-finder with respect to the specific types of \"interactive fitness equipment\" claimed by the '513 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will afford the phrase \" interactive fitness equipment\" its plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    D. \"Logic configured to\" / \"Logic\" and Related Terms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-90\"><strong>Claim Language</strong> <strong>Claim(s)</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's Proposed</strong> <strong>Defendant's Proposed</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"logic configured to\"/\"logic\" 1, 5, 6, 9, Plain and ordinary meaning; Subject to 35 U.S.C. 13, 16, not a \"means plus function\" \u00a7 112(f) (formerly 35 17, 18, term under 35 U.S.C.

According to Peloton, this is because the word \"logic\" does not connote structure but is instead merely a placeholder word that describes only functions to be performed by the patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Peloton then surveys and fails to identify in the specification sufficient structures corresponding to each of the claimed functions for \"logic.\" (Dkt. No. 77 at 5-10.) Accordingly, Peloton would have all of the\n   patent's claims referencing \"logic\" be construed as invalid for indefiniteness. (Dkt. No. 77 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   VR Optics argues that the terms \"logic configured to\" and \"logic\" are not means-plus-function terms, and accordingly urges that the terms be given their plain and ordinary meaning. (Dkt. No. 75 at 27-30.) VR Optics emphasizes the presumption against applying Section 112, \u00b6 6 to claims not using the word \"means,\" as well as the evidentiary burden required for Peloton to overcome that presumption. (Dkt. No. 75 at 27-28.) VR Optics asserts that the presumption should govern here because a POSITA would understand \"logic\" as used in the '513 patent to connote a reasonably definite structure. (Dkt. No. 75 at 28-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   References to \"logic\" and \"logic configured to\" are ubiquitous throughout the '513 patent's claim limitations.

Starting with the claim limitations themselves, the patentee's choice to use the word \"logic\" rather than a \"nonce\" word such as \"means,\" \"mechanism,\" or \"element\" indicates that the word \"logic\" serves as more than a mere placeholder but actually refers to a specific structure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275499\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1339/#p1347\">\n    792 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1350 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smartflash LLC v.

The specification provides numerous diagrams depicting how \"logic\" is intended to be incorporated into the proposed invention. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 1-1 figs. 14-19.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The placement of \"logic\" alongside and in the same format as these other clearly structural terms highlights that the '513 patent is using the term logic to connote a known structure rather than as a nonce substitute for the word \"means.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, the extrinsic evidence in the record further supports the conclusion that \"logic\" as used in the '513 patent connotes a specific and definite structure. VR Optics submitted the declaration of a POSITA who reviewed the '513 patent and determined that \"the structure of the 'logic configured to' is readily apparent from the claim language itself\" and that \"the structure recited in the claim is sufficient for a POS[IT]A to carry out the desired function.\" (Dkt.

Though of course of less value than the intrinsic evidence contained in the patent, this extrinsic evidence confirms the Court's construction of \"logic\" as connoting structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Even if all of this evidence were ambiguous or weighed slightly in Peloton's favor, which it does not, the Court would still be constrained from construing these claims as means-plus-function terms because of the presumption against doing so in the absence of the word \"means.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275499\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1339/#p1347\">\n    792 F.3d at 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Peloton produces no evidence to rebut this presumption, let alone a preponderance of such evidence. As such, Peloton has not \"\n   <em>\n    demonstrate\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    d\n   </em>\n   ] that [each] claim term [referencing 'logic'] fails to recite sufficiently definite structure or else recites function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function,\" which bars this Court from adopting its proposed construction of the relevant claim terms as means-plus-function claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Zeroclick, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517016\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/1003/#p1007\">\n    891 F.3d at 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275499\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1339/#p1347\">\n    792 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1348 ). Accordingly, the terms \" logic\" and \" logic configured to\" in the disputed claim limitations will be afforded their plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-106\"><strong>Claim Language</strong> <strong>Claim(s)</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's Proposed</strong> <strong>Defendant's Proposed</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"logic configured to drive the display 1 \"logic configured to drive the Plain and ordinary in response to both the first and display to visually display a meaning (subject to the second performance parameters, such difference in performance proposed constructions for that a performance comparison between the fitness terms within this between the fitness equipment and at equipment and at least one limitation) least one remote fitness equipment is remote fitness equipment visually displayed\" based on a difference between the first and second performance parameters\" <strong>Claim Language</strong> <strong>Claim(s)</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's Proposed</strong> <strong>Defendant's Proposed</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"logic configured to control the 6 \"logic configured to control Plain and ordinary display in response to both the first the display to visually display meaning (subject to the and second performance parameters, a difference in performance proposed constructions for such that a performance comparison between the fitness terms within this between the fitness equipment and at equipment and at least one limitation) least one remote fitness equipment is remote fitness equipment visually displayed\" based on a difference between the first and second performance parameters\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   These two claim terms are restated in nearly identical forms in claims 1 and 6, with the only difference between them being that claim 6 replaces claim 1's use of \"drive\" with \"control.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 23 ll. 30-35; col. 24 ll. 2-6.) Peloton's proposed construction for these terms is their plain and ordinary meaning, while VR Optics' proposed construction for these terms is derived from statements made in the patent specification. (Dkt. No. 75 at 20-23; Dkt. No. 77 at 26-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court finds VR Optics' proposed construction to be fully consistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the claim terms. The only substantive phrase added by VR Optics' proposed construction is the phrase \"a\n   <em>\n    difference\n   </em>\n   in performance\" (emphasis added). This addition does not alter the scope of the patent's already-claimed functions. As used in the '513 patent, the display of a \"comparison\" between the performances of two users would look identical to the display of a \"difference\" between the performances of those two users. VR Optics' proposal is also consistent with all of the numerous descriptions of the \"comparison\" displays provided in the specification. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-1 col. 5 ll. 29-33 (\"The displays, however, on the various fitness equipment may provide a visual read indication [that] show[s] where the particular user is in relation to the user or users that are operating the coupled fitness equipment.\"); fig. 2.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Peloton counters that the addition of the phrase \"difference\" materially alters the scope of the claim because the \"comparison\" of two identically-performing users, which the plain and ordinary language of the '513 patent would otherwise permit, would be foreclosed by VR Optics' proposed introduction of the word \"difference.\" But the display of a \"difference in performance\" does not foreclose the display of a difference of zero. Both the plain language of the '513 claim and VR Optics' proposed construction would equally permit this sort of display. VR Optics clarified this point in its reply brief. (Dkt. No. 85-1 at 11 (\"[I]f both users had the same speed ..., the difference in performance could be shown in the text as 'lead by 0.00 miles' and 'lead 0.0 seconds.' This could also be reflected in a ranking where the users are\n   shown as sharing the same position (i.e., having no difference in position).\").) Peloton thus identifies no way in which VR Optics' proposed construction fails to align with its own understanding of the plain and ordinary meaning of the relevant claim limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   A restatement of these disputed claim terms in plainer language may be helpful for the fact-finder, and VR Optics' proposed constructions are consistent with the claim terms' plain and ordinary meaning as well as with the '513 patent specification. As such, the Court adopts VR Optics' proposed constructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \u2022 Claim 1: \" logic configured to drive the display in response to both the first and second performance parameters, such that a performance comparison between the fitness equipment and at least one remote fitness equipment is visually displayed\" will be construed as \"logic configured to drive the display to visually display a difference in performance between the fitness equipment and at least one remote fitness equipment based on a difference between the first and second performance parameters.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \u2022 Claim 6: \" logic configured to control the display in response to both the first and second performance parameters, such that a performance comparison between the fitness equipment and at least one remote fitness equipment is visually displayed\" will be construed as \"logic configured to control the display to visually display a difference in performance between the fitness equipment and at least one remote fitness equipment based on a difference between the first and second performance parameters.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    E. \"One [element] selected from the group consisting of\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-114\"><strong>Term</strong> <strong>Claim(s)</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's and Defendant's Proposed</strong> <strong>Constructions</strong> \"one [element] selected from the group 2, 3, 4, 13, 18, 19 Interpreted as Markush Group consisting of\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The parties both propose that the claim term \" one [element] selected from the group consisting of\" be interpreted as a Markush group.
