Both parties cite facts that are not relevant to resolution of the pending motion. To the extent certain facts are not mentioned in this Memorandum, the Court has not relied on them in reaching its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 30, 2016, Winder was convicted of violating California Penal Code \u00a7 69, which states that \"[e]very person who attempts, by means of any threat or violence, to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon the officer by law, or who knowingly resists, by the use of force or violence, the officer, in the performance of his or her duty\" is guilty of a violation of the statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2069\">\n    Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To prove a violation of this statute, the People must demonstrate, as an element of the crime, that the officers were acting lawfully in performing their duties.\n   <em>\n    People v. Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3888662\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/44/636/#p673\">\n    44 Cal. 4th 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20126\">\n    80 Cal.Rptr.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20P.3d%20970\">\n    187 P.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (\"[I]t is also a well-established rule that when a statute makes it a crime to commit any act against a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties, part of the corpus delicti of the offense is that the officer was acting lawfully at the time the offense was committed.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Winder pled no contest to a violation of Section 69, stipulating that the factual basis for his conviction and sentencing (which included a charged prior strike for robbery) were contained in the transcript of the preliminary hearing and his rap\n   sheet. (Mtn., Ex. C Tr. of Plea Hr'g [Dkt. 32-5] at 3:8-20.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Only Deputy Bustamante testified at the preliminary hearing. According to his testimony, he was on duty on March 29, 2015, when he was dispatched to the scene of a domestic disturbance call. (Mtn., Ex. A Tr. Of Prelim. Hr'g at 2-3.) He noticed Winder, who matched the description of the man in the call, who at first ran from him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Deputy Bustamante gave Winder commands to keep his hands up, but according to the deputy's testimony, Winder did not listen and reached into his pocket to pull out a cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Bustamante then ordered Winder to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Winder initially complied, but when Bustamante went to handcuff Winder, he \"began to push off the ground like he was trying to escape.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:27-28.) Winder got to his feet, pushed the deputy off, and started running. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Bustamante caught the back of Winder's t-shirt, Winder lost his footing, and Bustamante caught back up to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At that point, according to Deputy Bustamante's testimony at the preliminary hearing, he (the deputy) tried to pull Winder to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Winder \"kind of swiped across [Bustamante's] face and hit [him] near [the] right face because [Bustamante's] glasses fell off, and they broke,\" and then Bustamante pulled Winder to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:25-28.) They \"started fighting again,\" and nothing Bustamante did was \"effective in subduing him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:1-11.) \"[T]he fight just continued over a 30-second to one-minute duration\" with Bustamante trying to pull Winder to the ground, \"fighting with him,\" and Winder continuing to try to \"push\" the officer; Winder \"caught [the deputy's] throat area\" while pushing him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:20-25.) Bustamante then disengaged because he \"didn't want to keep fighting with him\" and \"didn't want to hurt [himself],\" gave Winder further verbal orders and a chance to comply, and then - when Winder did not comply - delivered strikes to his lower leg with his baton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:1-16.) According to the testimony, Winder continued to ignore commands and tried to get off the ground in a push up position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Bustamante got Winder in a headlock from the front and held Winder, who had his arms wrapped around the officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) Deputy Bustamante \"had to sit down a little bit to keep him in the headlock position in order to keep him from getting back up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:1-3.) It was then that Deputy Ortiz showed up and struck Winder with his baton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) \"After that, he was still fighting because none of the strikes were effective.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:7-9.) \"[S]hortly after that, [Deputies Bustamante and Ortiz] had to force his hands behind his back ... because he was still trying to take - trying to get away from [them], pushing [their] arms, pulling [their] arms off of him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:10-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the preliminary hearing, Winder's criminal defense counsel cross-examined Deputy Bustamante. At the close of evidence, counsel argued that the People had not made their case, because Deputy Bustamante's use of force was excessive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The detention at gunpoint I don't think the detention's lawful no matter what, but the detention at gunpoint and ordered to the ground is excessive. If that's not excessive, the baton strikes escalating it all the way up to nonlethal but very close to lethal force was excessive force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:22-27.) The judge acknowledged the arguments of excessive force and that Winder was free to bring them up at trial, but held Winder to answer \"based on the standard of proof at a preliminary hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:26-22:5.) The court found that there was \"sufficient cause to believe that the offense set forth in the Complaint ha[d] been committed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:26-22:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Contrary to his plea in open court to having violated Penal Code \u00a7 69, Winder now avers in his complaint that he never resisted the deputies or did anything to warrant being struck by either deputy's baton. (Compl., [Dkt. 1] \u00b6 30 (\"Plaintiff was at all times compliant and never resisted or refused any deputy's command.\").) Winder contends in his declaration and argument in support of his opposition to Defendants' motion that he never intended to resist Deputy Bustamante or Deputy Ortiz. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Winder Decl. in support of Pltf.'s Opp. [Dkt. 39].) Rather, according to Winder, after he fully complied with the Deputy Bustamante's request to get on the ground, the deputy \"got on top of me, and elbowed me in the spine.\" (Id. \u00b6 8.) Winder states that he arched his back in response and pushed Deputy Bustamante off in the process. (Id. \u00b6 8.) After that point, according to Winder's declaration, the deputy put him in a \"headlock/chokehold,\" and lifted him off the ground so that he could not breathe. (Id. \u00b6 9.) He thereafter fell on the ground and did not struggle further, nor did he attempt to \"punch, kick, or fight Deputy Bustamante.\" (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.) He contends that after the baton strikes by Deputy Bustamante, he was on the ground in the fetal position, not resisting, when Deputy Ortiz arrived and broke his left leg with strikes from his baton. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants present the declaration of Deputy Ortiz, whose testimony is consistent with that of Deputy Bustamante. (Mtn., Ex. F Dep. of Deputy Ortiz. [Dkt. 32-8].) However, the issue before the Court is whether Winder's sworn statements in this case, which are inconsistent with that of Deputy Bustamante during the preliminary hearing, can form the basis for an excessive force claim where Winder agreed that the preliminary hearing transcript provided the basis for his Penal Code \u00a7 69 conviction. Deputy Ortiz's testimony is irrelevant to that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, based on Winder's plea and adoption of the preliminary hearing transcript, without qualification, as a basis for his plea, the Court holds that this case is\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   -barred. A finding in favor of Winder in this case would, of necessity, undermine his criminal conviction and require collateral litigation of an issue already determined in the prior action, in violation of\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and identifying portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, or affidavits that it believes demonstrate the absence of a triable issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Winder failed to oppose the County's motion for summary judgment on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability issue. In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   case is nowhere cited in Winder's opposition. In addition, the Court has independently reviewed the evidence and argument cited in support of the motion with respect to this issue and finds nothing in the record to demonstrate a material issue of fact exists with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   issue. The Court thus grants summary judgment on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   \"claim\" alleged in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants also move for summary judgment based on the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   doctrine, arguing that Winder's plea to a violation of Penal Code \u00a7 69 - based on his agreement that the preliminary hearing transcript provided a factual basis for that plea - necessarily means that his Section 1983 claim is barred under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   . Defendants contend that a finding in favor of Winder on his civil rights claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction, because an element of a charge for resisting arrest (under either Penal Code \u00a7 148 or \u00a7 69 ) is that the officer defendants acted properly, without the use of excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Winder disagrees, arguing that a finding that one or both of the deputies used excessive force would not necessarily call his conviction into question. He primarily argues that even accepting that the preliminary hearing transcript provided the basis for his no contest plea, he is still able to ask a civil jury to decide what, specifically, within that testimony actually formed the basis for the conviction. In other words, despite Winder's agreement that the judge accepting his plea should rely on the facts set forth in the hearing transcript to find a basis for his plea, he asserts that \"there was no specific factual basis for the plea.\" (Pltf. Opp. to Def. Mot. for Summ. J. \"Pltf.'s Opp.\" [Dkt 37] at 1.) Winder also argues that it was \"clearly never adjudicated at the time of the preliminary hearing\" that the officers did not use excessive force when they struck him with their batons, and that Deputy Ortiz cannot be immunized from suit even if Deputy Bustamante is, because Deputy Ortiz was not a named victim against whom Plaintiff used force when resisting arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Winder correctly points out that a plea to resisting arrest does not necessarily bar a Section 1983 claim, even when the acts constituting both the illegal conduct and the alleged excessive force arise from one \"continuous transaction,\"\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yount v.

But if the district court determines that the plaintiff's action, even if successful, will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Heck v.

Winder did not limit his agreement to only certain portions of the transcript, provide a separate factual basis, or in any other manner suggest that the criminal trial judge should not rely on any particular portion of the transcript in finding a factual basis for his plea. Defendants argue that this fact precludes Winder from picking apart and collaterally attacking the basis for the plea in later civil litigation, as this would essentially allow re-litigation of some or all of his criminal case, which is exactly what the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   -bar is designed to prevent.

In\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that he was walking near some apartments in Pasadena when he was approached by police \"because of the clothing that [he] was wearing.\" (Pltf.'s Supplemental Authority, Ex.

According to Holloway, he ran away from the police, and while still facing away from the officer, tossed a gun over a fence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 21-24).)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). The court concluded that the plaintiff's no contest plea did not, as the record stood at the pleading stage, necessarily determine the lawfulness of the officer's actions throughout the entire transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). The court quoted\n   <em>\n    Kyles v.

(Pltf.'s Supplemental Authority, Ex. B Court of Appeals Order [Dkt. 55-3] at 2-3.). Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals considered the type of evidence presented to this Court on summary judgment. It would have been improper to do so. Without a factual basis for Holloway's no contest plea, the court properly held that it was possible to construe Holloway's no contest plea as consistent with the facts alleged in his complaint.

(Pltf.'s Supplemental Authority, Ex.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The plaintiff and deputies fought, with the plaintiff alleging that he was kicked, punched, and tased multiple times after the parties fell to the ground and he stopped resisting arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) In the underlying criminal case related to the fight, Parker was held to answer after a preliminary hearing and then tried. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The jury hung. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the mistrial, Parker entered a plea to a violation of Penal Code \u00a7 69. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Winder contends that the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   case is on all fours with what happened here, where Winder contends that the officers used their batons to strike him after he fell to the ground and stopped resisting during one continuous transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   case discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   was decided on summary judgment.

The judge in the underlying criminal proceeding did not \"elaborate[e on] the basis for its finding,\" only finding the plaintiff guilty \"based on his plea.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Because factual issues remained as to what conduct supported Parker's plea, summary judgment was not proper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 n.5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

In\n   <em>\n    Melgar\n   </em>\n   , the court dismissed the plaintiff's Section1983 claim with leave to amend, finding that his contention that officers used excessive force against him \"while escorting him on the catwalk and in the elevator\" after he was \"handcuffed 'without incident or resistance' \" was at odds with the police reports and preliminary hearing transcript that were attached to plaintiff's complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.

He agreed in his criminal case to a factual basis, and cannot now pick apart the testimony that forms that factual basis - revising his own position in an attempt to be consistent with only portions of it - in order to manufacture \"two isolated factual contexts\" to maintain his claim. Only one factual context - one in which Winder never stopped struggling, and the deputies only used their batons after other attempts to restrain Winder failed - exists according to the hearing testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In fact, this case is akin to one in which the underlying criminal case proceeded to trial. If a jury, presented with the same evidence that was presented to the judge at the preliminary hearing, decided Winder was guilty, it would of necessity have determined that none of the actions taken by the deputies constituted excessive force.\n   <em>\n    Beets,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723044\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/1038/\">\n    669 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1045 ;\n   <em>\n    City of Hemet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169332\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/689/\">\n    394 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   699 n.5. The same result would obtain even if Winder had presented additional evidence. If the jury nevertheless convicted, he would not now be able to ask a new civil jury to pick apart the earlier evidence to determine the factual basis for his underlying conviction. Thus, allowing Winder to do so in this situation, when he agreed that the preliminary hearing transcript provided the factual basis for his no contest plea - and when he also had the opportunity, even if he did not take it, to limit the facts on which the criminal judge relied - would undermine the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   -bar. Winder's speculation that certain actions \"alone\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   constitute resisting by use of force,\" (Pltf.'s Opp. [Dkt. 37] at 8 (emphasis added) ), and that he can therefore point to the preliminary hearing transcript and essentially say that the factual basis is \"in there somewhere\" is not supported by the law. \"Where a defendant is charged with a single-act offense but there are multiple acts involved each of which could serve as the basis for a conviction, a jury does not determine which specific act or acts form the basis for the conviction,\" rather, the jury's verdict - or, here, the judge taking Winder's plea - \"necessarily determines the lawfulness of the officers' actions throughout the whole course of the defendant's conduct, and any action alleging the use of excessive force would 'necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Beets\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723044\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/1038/\">\n    669 F.3d at 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Hemet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169332\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/689/\">\n    394 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   699 n.5 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Susag v.

While only Deputy Bustamante is specifically named in the felony complaint against Winder, the testimony given by Bustamante at the preliminary hearing encompassed\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the actions taken by both deputies, including all of the baton strikes about which Winder complains. Again, this single factual context, all of which was presented at the preliminary hearing and adopted by Winder as the factual basis for\n   his plea, may not be, in hindsight, subjected to temporal hair splitting. Winder's claims against both deputies fail. And because his claims against the County employee defendants fail, his claim against the County likewise fails of necessity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

While the\n    <em>\n     Holloway\n    </em>\n    case may be similar - defendants in\n    <em>\n     Holloway\n    </em>\n    assert in the pending summary judgment proceedings that the plaintiff agreed, as in this case, that the preliminary hearing transcript in his criminal case provided the factual basis for his plea - the Court is not familiar with the record in that case and has not taken, nor can it, any view of the merits of the\n    <em>\n     Holloway\n    </em>\n    defendants' motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Melgar\n    </em>\n    filed a second amended complaint.

This is not true. The judge found probable cause to hold Winder for trial. The judge thus found it \"more probable than not\" that Winder had committed the charged crime, which is precisely what the judge indicated during the proceedings. That probable cause standard is essentially that which a jury uses in a civil case,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the jury decides which side wins based on a preponderance of evidence (except in specific instances not applicable here). But, in any event, it is the criminal trial court judge that relied on Winder's adoption of the preliminary transcript as the basis for his plea. The trial court judge acted as the trier of fact in determining whether Winder could be found guilty or not.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
