Ishii, SENIOR DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Progressive Express Insurance Company (\"Progressive\" or \"Defendant\") submits to this Court a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, partial summary judgment (Doc. 16), on Plaintiff John Michael DeFrenza's (\"DeFrenza\" or \"Plaintiff\") single claim that Progressive acted in bad faith in resolving his uninsured motorist insurance claim. DeFrenza was in an accident on September 18, 2011 and did not receive a settlement from Progressive until April 2, 2015, almost 3 and a half years later. This matter is now fully briefed. For the reasons that follow, Progressive's motion for summary adjudication will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   DeFrenza was a \"Rated Driver\" under a Progressive Commercial Automobile Insurance Policy, Number 06764199-5 (the \"Policy\"), issued to DeFrenza's employer, Ross Fabrication and Welding Inc. (\"Ross\"), with a policy period of June 12, 2011 through December 12, 2011, and including Underinsured Motorist coverage with a combined single limit of $750,000. SUMF 1. DeFrenza had underinsured motorist coverage through his own carrier, AAA, with a limit of $250,000/500,000. SUMF 2. Coverage was pro-rated between the two carriers. SUMF 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 18, 2011, DeFrenza and a co-worker were driving a pickup truck owned by Ross to a jobsite, when it was struck by a 1999 Chevrolet Astro Van. SUMF 4. The driver of the Astro Van, who was at fault, struck DeFrenza's vehicle at 30 to 35 miles per hour while running a red light, and spun DeFrenza's vehicle clockwise. Doc. 20 at 6-7. The 2011 Ford F-150 pickup truck DeFrenza was driving, which was less than a year old, was totaled. Doc. 20 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 13, 2012, Progressive confirmed DeFrenza would present an Uninsured Motorist (\"UIM\") claim through his attorney, Brandon Holladay. SUMF 5. DeFrenza filed a first party UIM claim on or about October 10, 2012. Doc. 20 at 8. On October 10, 2012, after confirming DeFrenza's policy-limits settlement with the at-fault driver, Progressive opened the UIM claim. SUMF 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 12, 2012, three days after the claim was opened, Emy Liberty (\"Liberty\") confirmed UIM coverage was in order, with limits of $735,000 ($750,000 - 15,000), and documented the amount of coverage in the claim file. DSUF 7. While confirming coverage, Liberty noted initial\n   questions about DeFrenza's own UIM coverage and a possible offset for worker's compensation coverage. DSUF 8. On October 23, 2012, Rowena Pavlinac entered her own coverage statement again affirming the amount of UIM coverage and noting the need to rule out worker's compensation and whether DeFrenza had his own UIM coverage. Pavlinac documented the amount of UIM coverage in the claim file. DSUF 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 25, 2012, Holladay's office told Pavlinac they had no medical records for DeFrenza but would send them when they became available. SUMF 10. On November 20, 2012, Pavlinac wrote and left a voicemail message for Holladay following up on her requests for information. SUMF 11. On January 24, 2013, Pavlinac again spoke with Holladay, who represented that he would provide medical authorizations and confirmation of DeFrenza's personal UIM coverage. SUMF 12. On February 4, 2013, Holladay sent a demand letter for the policy limits of $735,000. SUMF 13. On February 4, 2013, Holladay represented that DeFrenza had no personal UIM coverage. SUMF 14. On February 4, 2013, Holladay stated that DeFrenza was anticipated to undergo two additional surgeries. SUMF 15. On February 4, 2013, Holladay did not return the medical authorizations. SUMF 16. On February 4, 2013, Holladay provided 365 pages of medical records relating to DeFrenza's treatment, along with wage information. SUMF 17. On or about February 8, 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DeFrenza made a demand to Progressive to pay the underlying UIM policy limits of $735,000. Doc. 20 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 15, 2013, Pavlinac told Holladay she required all of DeFrenza's prior Kaiser records, not just the surgery records. SUMF 18. On March 8, 2013, at Progressive's request, Holladay provided what he represented were DeFrenza's medical records for three years prior to the accident. SUMF 19. On April 10, 2013, Pavlinac sent Holladay a letter requesting the promised medical authorizations and AAA declarations page. SUMF 20. On April 10, 2013, after speaking with Holladay and explaining the medical records provided were incomplete, Pavlinac again asked for complete medical records and billings. SUMF 21. Holladay never returned the signed medical authorizations. SUMF 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 29, 2013, Holladay asked for Progressive's settlement position, Pavlinac advised Holladay that she needed to review specific coverage issues, including whether worker's compensation applied, and possible additional UMBI coverage through DeFrenza's policy with AAA, which up to that date had not been notified of a potential claim. SUMF 23. On June 14, 2013, Holladay-while continuing to demand policy limits-asked that Progressive make an offer of the \"undisputed value\" of DeFrenza's injuries \"even if they are keeping believe [sic] that a reduction should be taken against the worker's compensation benefit.\" SUMF 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 31, 2013, Pavlinac advised Holladay that Progressive would \"not be able to make any payments ... until we reach an agreement for the full amount of the claim.\" SUMF 25. On August 2, 2013, Pavlinac informed Holladay that Progressive still had not received DeFrenza's post-operative reports and requested updated medical records and billing. Holladay said he was unaware that Progressive did not have the updated medical records. SUMF 26. On August 13, 2013, Pavlinac advised Holladay that Progressive would not assert a workers' compensation offset and renewed her request for updated medical records. SUMF 27. August 26, 2013, Pavlinac\n   received the updated Kaiser records and began her evaluation of DeFrenza's injury and medical records and billings. SUMF 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 27, 2013, assuming pro-rata coverage with AAA, Pavlinac arrived at a settlement range of $219,942-294,742 as Progressive's 88% share. SUMF 29. On September 4, 2013, using,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a different loss of earnings component, Pavlinac's manager reached a settlement range of $152,791-327,791. SUMF 30. On September 10, 2013, Holladay made a formal arbitration demand. SUMF 31. On September 17, 2013, Progressive offered the low end of its evaluation, $152,791 (as its pro-rated share), to settle DeFrenza's entire claim. SUMF 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 17, 2013, while making her offer of settlement, Pavlinac advised Holladay that the medical records he provided were neither numbered nor Bates-stamped, and that they made references to numerous procedures for which there were no corresponding records. SUMF 33. On September 17, 2013, Holladay told Progressive that it could obtain any additional necessary records via subpoena. SUMF 34. In a letter dated September 17, 2013, Holladay rejected the $152,791 offer, asserted that it constituted an \"undisputed amount,\" and demanded immediate advance payment \"while we move forward with the demanded arbitration.\" SUMF 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The basis for Holladay's demand for immediate payment of the settlement offer was language from the implementing regulations of the Fair Claims Practices Act found at Cal. Code.Regs. tit. 10 \u00a7 2695.7(h). SUMF 36. Progressive referred the arbitration defense to Richard Phillips (\"Phillips\"). SUMF 37. On October 11, 2013, Rowena Pavlinac (\"Pavlinac\") spoke with [Phillips] who had further researched Insurance Code 2695.7(h), and noted on its face it appears Progressive ought to pay out its undisputed offer of $152,791. PSUF 6. On October 14, 2013, Phillips communicated to Holladay that the authority he relied upon for his argument that Progressive had a duty to advance an undisputed amount was inapposite. SUMF 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 28, 2013, Phillips and Pavlinac discussed the case and confirmed the value of the case was at a range of $350,000 to $450,000 with a target range of $390,000. However, no new offer was made after the original offer of $152,791 (offered on September 17, 2013). PSUF 7. Carolyn Nogy (\"Nogy\") PMQ for Progressive testified that each time a new value was placed on a claim the adjuster was to start at the low end of the settlement value and Progressive encouraged assertive negotiations as Progressive's goal was to settle the claims quickly as it was not Progressive's aim to delay claims in any manner. SUMF 9. Progressive failed to follow and/or comply with its own policy of adjusting its previous offers once new information was obtained that increased the projected settlement value of the case. PSUF 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During discovery, Kaiser provided nearly 1,500 pages of medical records pursuant to subpoena. SUMF 39. Progressive and AAA retained an expert, Brian Grossman, M.D., who opined that DeFrenza's injury-related complaints about his back and spine related back to previous injuries, prior surgery, and a history of strenuous work. DSUF 40. Michael Tivnon, M.D., a shoulder expert, performed an IME and opined that the need for both shoulder replacement surgeries was due to degeneration not the automobile accident. DSUF 41. Geoffrey Miller, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, opined that at least one shoulder surgery and treatment to both shoulders and the cervical spine were directly related to the auto accident. Declaration of Seth\n   O'Dell, Exh. C., Doc. 20-1 (\"Miller Report\") at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 11, 2015, when the new adjuster Paul Nummelin (\"Nummelin\") completed a new evaluation for the DeFrenza case, and based on his review of the file information, he placed a settlement range with $243,232 at the low range and $518,232 as the high range for settlement. PSUF 8. On April 2, 2015, the parties resolved the claim at mediation for $400,000 ($300,000 from Progressive and $100,000 from AAA). SUMF 42. The settlement agreement, executed April 2, 2015, included a release of all claims \"arising out of or in any way connected with [the accident], including all injuries and deaths, loss of services and consortium, and property damage, resulting therefrom....\" SUMF 43.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AAA advised Progressive that it placed a maximum value of $400,000 on DeFrenza's claim.

If the Court is unable to grant the motion in full, Progressive requests discrete rulings that it did not commit bad faith based on one or more of DeFrenza's three theories for purposes of narrowing the case for trial. Progressive maintains that their actions were reasonable, timely, and thorough, and that they had no obligation to make advance payments on a claim in the absence of a settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In DeFrenza's opposition to the motion (\"Doc. 20\"), DeFrenza addresses the three main theories of bad faith as outlined by\n   Progressive, and argues that there are at least seven issues of fact that the jury must decide, namely:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. Did Progressive intentionally delay its investigation into the facts and circumstances of Plaintiff's injuries;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. Did Progressive breach its duty to investigate all aspects of Plaintiff's claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   3. Did Progressive intentionally ignore evidence which supported coverage as to Plaintiff's injuries;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   4. Did Progressive breach its duty to diligently search for evidence which supports its first party insured's claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   5. Did Progressive seek to discover only the evidence that defeated the first party claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   6. Did Progressive hold its own interest above that of the first party insured; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   7. Did Progressive fail to comply with its own internal policy to actively negotiate to resolve the case after each re-evaluation of the case was completed by an adjuster each time the case values increased by starting at the low end of each new evolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   DeFrenza argues that Progressive's actions in delaying to make a reasonable offer for years were done for the sole purpose of placing additional pressure on DeFrenza to settle the claim. DeFrenza was enduring increasing hardships due to lack of income and his inability to work after the auto accident in September 2011. Doc. 20 at 7. DeFrenza claims that due to the significant delay on the part of Progressive, his medical bills went into collections and he was forced to cash out money from his retirement, at a penalty, due to financial strain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC. The medical records reflect that since the accident, DeFrenza had to have both shoulders replaced and is also a candidate for spinal surgery. To support these alleged material issues of disputed fact, DeFrenza mainly relies upon the declaration from his expert, Dan Jacobson (\"Jacobson\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     DeFrenza's Expert in Support of his Opposition and Progressive's Objections\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Jacobson submitted a declaration in support of the opposition, in which he states he is an expert in the field of property/casualty insurance generally and specifically in the area of claims handling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In relevant part, Jacobson provides the following opinions, as characterized by Plaintiff: Progressive \"failed in attempting in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of Plaintiff's claim in which liability is reasonably clear.\" PSUF 1 (citing Declaration of Dan Jacobson, Doc. 20-2 (\"Jacobson Decl.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 7-20). Progressive \"failed to provide a prompt and reasonable explanation for the basis it relied upon in relation to the facts or applicable law, for the delay in offer to Plaintiffs claims or for the offer of a compromise settlement.\" PSUF 3 (citing Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 16-17). Progressive \"failed in its duty to diligently search for evidence which supports its insured's claim.\" PSUF 4 (citing Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Progressive was seeking to discover only the evidence that it needed to defeat and or reduce Plaintiff's claim and as such Progressive was holding its own interest above that of the Plaintiff. PSUF 5 (citing Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Progressive attacks the Jacobson declaration on a number of levels, including arguing that that he is unqualified as\n   an expert. Jacobson was the Governor of the California Insurance Guarantee Association (\"CIGA\"), a quasi-governmental agency that operates as the property insurer of last resort. Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 1(a)-(b). In that role, Jacobson oversaw \"adjust[ment] [of] a significant number of California's property\" claims. Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 1(b). Jacobson \"stud[ied] and learn[ed] the practices and standards in the California insurance industry.\" Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 1(e). Jacobson has also lectured and written scholarly articles on a wide range of insurance related topics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6\u00b61(g), (j). Given Jacobson's significant experience, the Court disagrees that he is unqualified to opine on insurance practices. That in mind, the Court does not afford Jacobson any deference on the meaning of insurance law. The above-referenced opinions recite legal conclusions. They are not the appropriate subject of expert witness opinions. In sum, the Court will consider the underlying opinions regarding insurance industry practice. It will not accept the proposed legal conclusions that Jacobson (and Plaintiff) relay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further, Progressive has made evidentiary objections to portions of Jacobson's declaration. Aside from correctly noting that much of Jacobson's declaration contains improper expert testimony, those objections are without merit. Jacobson declaration contains sufficient detail to assure the Court that the permissible opinions and supporting factual basis are relevant to the issues at hand and would be admissible in some form at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraser v.

Progressive acknowledges that it did not immediately pay out its initial settlement offer of $152,791.00 because DeFrenza did not accept the offer. Doc. 16 at 17. However, Progressive argues that the settlement offer was not an \"undisputed amount,\" within the meaning of the California Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations such that it was obliged to immediately pay the amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal.

DeFrenza suffered a covered loss. DeFrenza filed an uninsured motorist claim on October 10, 2012. DeFrenza demanded payment of policy limits on February 8, 2013. Progressive made a counter offer of $152,791.00 on September 12, 2013. That counter offer was rejected. The uninsured motorist claim settled for a total of $400,000.00 (300,000.00 of which was paid by Progressive).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is unclear whether the parties agree on the scope of DeFrenza's bad faith delay claim. Progressive represents that \"DeFrenza agreed during discovery that his claim of delay is based on pre-litigation activity....\" Doc. 16 at 20; Declaration of Julia Azrael, Doc. 21 (\"Azrael Decl.\") at 13-14. Any delay as a result of arbitration, Progressive contends, is not part of the basis of DeFrenza's claim. Doc. 16 at 20. DeFrenza does not directly respond to Progressive's characterization of his claim or to the alleged agreement of the scope at discovery. His opposition is less than clear on the topic. From what the Court can glean from Jacobson's declaration, DeFrenza contends that the wrongful delay occurred when Progressive failed to respond to submission of the uninsured motorist claim, submitted no later than October 10, 2012, within 40 days. Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10 \u00a7 2695.7(b) (requiring an insurer \"[u]pon receiving proof of claim ... immediately, but in no event more than forty (40) calendar days later, accept or deny the claim, in whole or in part.\") Plaintiff further contends that Progressive failed to \"continue to ... request[ ]\" information every thirty days until a determination regarding acceptance or denial is made. Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10 \u00a7 2695.7(c)(1). DeFrenza makes no other\n   reference to delay by Progressive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Shortly after the uninsured motorist claim was opened, and certainly within 40 days, Progressive confirmed coverage under the policy. SUMF 7-9. After that time, Progressive's adjustors sought medical information from DeFrenza's then-counsel, Holladay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUMF 10-12. Apparently, no medical records were provided until February 4, 2013. SUMF 17. On the same date, DeFrenza demanded payment of the policy limit. SUMF 13. No medical information release authorization was provided. SUMF at 16. The medical records that were provided apparently pertained only to DeFrenza's course of treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUMF 18. Approximately one month later, Holladay provided medical records for the prior three years to Progressive. SUMF at 19. Progressive continued to seek the medical record release authorization which was ultimately never provided. SUMF 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On August 26, 2013, Progressive was provided with updated medical records and \"began ... evaluation of DeFrenza's injury and medical records and billings\" SUMF 28. On September 17, 2013, Progressive made its first settlement offer of $152,791.00. SUMF 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Neither party identifies in their moving papers when \"proof of claim\" was given for purposes of Section 2695.7(b). Jacobson suggests that proof of claim was given by October 9, 2012-the date that Progressive was notified of DeFrenza's claim. Jacobson Decl. at \u00b6 9. However, neither party attempts to distinguish \"proof of claim\" from \"notice of claim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code Regs. tit. \u00a7 2695.2(s) (\" 'Proof of claim' means any evidence or documentation...that provides any evidence of the claim and that reasonably supports the magnitude or the amount of the claimed loss.\");\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code Regs. tit. 10 \u00a7 2695.5(e) (\"Upon receiving notice of claim\" an insurer must \"provide to the claimant necessary \u2026 instructions, and reasonable assistance ... specifying the information the claimant must provide for proof of claim.\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code. Regs. tit. 10 \u00a7 2695.7(b)(1). It is not clear to the Court that the opening of an uninsured motorist claim or DeFrenza's counsel telling Progressive's adjustor about the scope of DeFrenza's injuries constituted proof of claim such that Section 2695.7(b) was triggered. It does not appear that any \"evidence or documentation\" supporting the \"magnitude or amount of the loss\" was submitted to Progressive at that time. Cal. Code.
