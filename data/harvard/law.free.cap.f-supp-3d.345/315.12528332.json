(Dkt. 1). The charges were based on drugs and firearms discovered upon execution of a search warrant at an apartment allegedly occupied by Defendant (359 Alexander Street, Apartment # 2, in the City of Rochester). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). The drugs were discovered next to the bed in the master bedroom, and two firearms were discovered in the master bedroom's closet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 23, 2018, Defendant waived indictment and pleaded guilty before United States Magistrate Judge Marian W. Payson, based upon a referral order from the undersigned (Dkt. 35), to a two-count Information charging violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (possession of fentanyl with intent to distribute) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j) (possession of a stolen firearm). (Dkt. 37; Dkt. 38). Based on Judge Payson's Report and Recommendation (Dkt. 39), this Court accepted Defendant's guilty plea (Dkt. 45) and sentencing was originally scheduled for August 6, 2018 (Dkt. 42). Sentencing was adjourned at Defendant's request to September 19, 2018. (Dkt. 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sentencing did not go forward on September 19, 2018, due to concerns raised by the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   with respect to a proposed 10-level upward departure in the offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21 as set forth in the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") (Dkt. 48 at \u00b6 67), which was consistent with the Plea Agreement (Dkt. 38 at \u00b6 11). While not specified in the Plea Agreement, at Defendant's plea hearing it was explained that this 10-level upward departure reflected the Government's agreement not to pursue the initially charged \u00a7 924(c) count, which would have resulted in a mandatory minimum sentence of five years to be imposed consecutively to any other sentence. (Dkt. 44 at 22-23). Specifically, the Plea Agreement stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   It is the agreement of the parties, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.21 (dismissed conduct), that a 10-level upward departure is warranted to reflect the seriousness of the offense based on conduct underlying a potential charge not pursued as part of the plea agreement which did not fully enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range, which would result in a combined adjusted offense level of 30.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Dkt. 38 at \u00b6 11). Consistent with the Plea Agreement, the PSR stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to the plea agreement, the parties agree, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.21 (dismissed conduct), that a 10-level upward departure is warranted to reflect the seriousness of the offense based on conduct underlying a potential charge not pursued as part of the plea agreement which did not fully enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range, which would result in a combined adjusted offense level of 30.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Dkt. 48 at \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court expressed concerns over this upward departure, because the Guidelines calculation for the offenses of conviction already accounted for the conduct that served as the basis for the \u00a7 924(c) charge in the criminal complaint. Specifically, the PSR increased the offense level for the \u00a7 841(a)(1) charge by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(1) because firearms were possessed by Defendant. As stated in the PSR:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequent to the search of 359 Alexander Street, Apartment # 2, located in the City of Rochester, New York, officers located a Beretta Model 950-BS .25 caliber pistol, bearing serial number BU67186V, and a Rohm Model RG 20 .22 caliber revolver, bearing serial number 51441.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Dkt. 48 at \u00b6 39). Therefore, Defendant's possession of firearms in furtherance of his drug trafficking was already accounted for in the Guidelines calculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court raised questions as to whether this 10-level\n   upward departure could be reconciled with the requirements of \u00a7 5K2.21, which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The court may depart upward to reflect the actual seriousness of the offense\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     based on conduct\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   (1) underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement in the case, or underlying a potential charge not pursued in the case as part of a plea agreement or for any other reason;\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     that did not enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range\n    </em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21 (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Due to these concerns, the Court requested the Government to set forth in writing the basis for its belief that this upward departure could be applied pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt 57). The Government submitted two letters to the Court setting forth its position concerning the 10-level upward departure under \u00a7 5K2.21. (Dkt. 60; Dkt. 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A further status conference was held before the undersigned on October 17, 2018, at which time the Court informed the parties that it would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be imposing the 10-level upward departure and sentencing was rescheduled to go forward on November 28, 2018. (Dkt. 59). This Decision and Order sets forth the Court's reasoning as to why it concludes that the parties' agreed-upon 10-level upward departure would run afoul of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Government argues that without an upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.21, \"the potential sentence for a conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), and thus the serious[ness] of the conviction, is not fully factored into the sentencing guideline range.\" (Dkt. 60 at 2). The Court does not necessarily disagree with the Government. However, \u00a7 5K2.21 applies not just when the Guidelines calculation fails to account for the seriousness of dismissed or not pursued charges; \u00a7 5K2.21 also requires that the Guidelines calculation for the charges that remain not account for the conduct that served as the basis for the dismissed or not pursued charges. In other words, the Government's position ignores the second part of \u00a7 5K2.21 requiring that the conduct underlying the dismissed or not pursued charge \"not enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) provides that when calculating the Guidelines range for possessing controlled substances with the intent to distribute, the following specific offense characteristic applies: \"If a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed, increase by 2 levels.\" The Government argues that this 2-level increase \"does not reflect the seriousness of any potential offense brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1),\" as it only increases the recommended Guidelines range by a 6-month interval, as opposed to the 5-year consecutive sentence that must be imposed for a \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction. (Dkt. 60 at 2). The Government's argument is well-taken. In other words, a 2-level increase pursuant to\n   \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) is not commensurate with the punishment that would have been imposed had Defendant been convicted pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nonetheless, \u00a7 5K2.21's applicability is based on conduct, and it plainly states that the upward departure can only occur if the conduct that serves as the basis for the conclusion concerning the seriousness of the offense \"did not enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21(2). Here, the conduct at issue-Defendant's possession of firearms in connection with his drug trafficking-is already accounted for in the 2-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) which, as stated in Application Note 11(A), \"reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2D1.1 Application Note 11(A);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The 2-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) is warranted \"if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 Application Note 11(A). Therefore, conduct could serve as the basis for an increase under \u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(1) that may not justify a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, the issue is whether the conduct\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     in this case\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   that serves as the basis for the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) increase is the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     same conduct\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   that served as the basis for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) charge that was not pursued-and as the Government conceded at the appearance before the undersigned on October 17, 2018, it is the same conduct-namely, Defendant's possession of firearms in the master bedroom closet and his possession of drugs intended for distribution in the master bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court's research has not revealed a case dealing with the specific factual scenario at issue here, and the parties have not cited any such case. The Government cited\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Dkt. 61). The defendant in that case pleaded guilty to assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). After being sentenced to 84 months' imprisonment, the defendant appealed arguing that \"the district court improperly granted departures that were adequately taken into consideration by the Guidelines and were not supported by the record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court granted upward departures under four separate Guidelines: \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3 (criminal history inadequacy), 5K2.3 (extreme psychological injury), 5K2.8 (extreme conduct), and 5K2.21 (dismissed and uncharged conduct).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the defendant's objection to the \u00a7 5K2.21 enhancement did not raise the issue of whether the court improperly considered conduct that had already been factored into the Guidelines calculation, and that issue was not addressed by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20113\">\n    at 777-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court does not view\n   <em>\n    White Twin\n   </em>\n   as on point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Other case law, albeit outside the Second Circuit, supports the Court's conclusion\n   here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In other words, an upward departure for the non-pursuit of a \u00a7 924(c) charge when the conduct has already been accounted for in the Guidelines calculation for the underlying offenses, not only contravenes the express requirements of \u00a7 5K2.21, it also arguably conflicts with the policy behind the operation of \u00a7 2K2.4 (the Guideline applicable to a \u00a7 924(c) conviction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This is not to say that the Government was prevented from crafting a plea agreement in this case to reflect its agreement not to pursue a \u00a7 924(c)(1) count by, for example, entering into an agreement pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), so that regardless of the Guidelines calculation by the Court, the Government would have had the option to withdraw from the plea agreement if the Court did not accept an agreed-upon sentence or sentencing range as an appropriate sentence, or as noted above, by agreeing to a plea based solely on the possession of a stolen firearm with a more significant upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.21.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   note 1,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, this does not mean that the Court may not ultimately elect to exercise its discretion and impose a sentence outside the Guidelines based upon its consideration of the factors set forth at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The \u00a7 922(j) conviction is based on the possession of a stolen firearm that traveled in interstate commerce, and it is not dependent on Defendant's drug trafficking. Thus, the parties could have theoretically agreed to a plea based solely on the possession of a stolen firearm, and then agreed upon an upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.21 for not pursuing a drug trafficking charge and the \u00a7 924(c) charge.
