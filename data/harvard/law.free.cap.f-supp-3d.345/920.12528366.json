SARGUS, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company's Motion to Exclude \"Narrative\" Testimony (ECF No. 2821). That Motion is fully briefed. (ECF Nos. 3200, 3548.) For the reasons that follow, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (\"DuPont\") directs its Motion to expert witnesses who were retained by Plaintiff Carla Marie Bartlett and Plaintiff John M. Wolf, the first two Plaintiffs selected for trial (\"Trial Plaintiffs\") in this multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\"), Mrs. Bartlett's case is scheduled for trial on September 14, 2015, and Mr. Wolf is slated to try his case on November 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs both allege that they are members of the class of individuals who are permitted under a contractual agreement (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement\") to file claims against DuPont based on six human diseases (\"Linked Diseases\") that they believe were caused by their exposure to ammonium perfluorooctanoate (\"C-8\" or \"PFOA\") discharged from DuPont's Washington Works plant into their drinking water. (\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement; ECF No. 820-8.) Mrs. Bartlett alleges that she suffered from kidney cancer and Mr, Wolf claims that he suffers from ulcerative colitis. Both of these human diseases are Linked Diseases. The Trial Plaintiffs allege claims for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , personal injury and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its defense, DuPont asserts that it \"neither knew, nor should have known, that any of the substances to which [the Trial Plaintiffs were] allegedly exposed were hazardous or constituted a reasonable or foreseeable risk of physical harm by virtue of the prevailing state of the medical, scientific and/or industrial knowledge available to DuPont at all times relevant to the claims or causes of action asserted by [the Trial Plaintiffs].\" (DuPont's Answer to Bartlett Compl. \u00b6 232; ECF No. 35.) DuPont offers various expert witnesses to support its defenses. Relevant to the present inquiry, DuPont offers expert testimony regarding the scientific methods it utilized to support its decisions about the release of C-8 from its Washington Works plant and its communication about the health effects of the releases of C-8. DuPont proffers Shane A. Snyder, Ph.D.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   who offers several opinions, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Analytical detection limits for quantification of chemicals in water are continually evolving, and PFOA was not able to be accurately and precisely identified and quantified in ng/L concentrations in water until the 2000's, when advances in liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry methods became available and applied to PFOA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   From before the 1980s and forward, DuPont has been proactive in continuously pursuing increasingly robust, sensitive, accurate, precise, and reproducible analytical methods for measuring PFOA in media, including water, resulting m numerous publicly-available peer-reviewed publications and contributions to the relevant science.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Snyder Report at 11, ECF No. 2807-5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs have offered James S. Smith, Ph.D., CPC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to provide opinions on the same subject matter. (Smith Report, ECF No. 3441-9; Smith Dep., ECF No. 165-66.) Specifically, Dr. Smith was retained to testify on:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1) the precision, accuracy, representativeness, completion, and comparability (PARCC) of the methods used by DuPont to measure the concentrations of [PFOA] in drinking water; 2) the extent of DuPont's knowledge of the PARCC of the reported PFOA concentrations in drinking water over time; 3) the actual error of the PFOA concentrations in drinking water over time; and 4) the accuracy of DuPont's representations to the public and others concerning the levels of PFOA concentrations in drinking water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Smith Report at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Smith concludes his Report with a summary of the opinions he reaches in his Report as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. Methods used by DuPont to measure the concentration of PFOA in water are not accurate and have led to reported levels of PFOA in drinking water supplies that are lower than the true value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. DuPont was aware that the PFOA levels in drinking water were reported lower than the true concentration values, and DuPont had the knowledge and expertise to correct the discrepancy in the data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. Prior to the water analysis performed by Exygen in 2001, the PFOA concentrations in drinking water were higher than reported by DuPont and exceeded 1 ppb on numerous occasions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   4. The information concerning the October letter to the LPSD water customers about PFOA concentrations in drinking water was not accurate and PFOA concentrations were underreported.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   5. Forensic techniques to age date the PFOA using the isomers of PFOA were not performed. The FC-143 produced by 3M and used by DuPont at the Washington Works plant prior to 2002 included up to 30% C-8 branched-chain isomers that were not present in the APFO produced by the telomerization process, which was used by DuPont after 2002. According to Hyeong-Moo Shin, et al., PFOA entered the municipal water supplies via air transport and deposition of PFOA from the Washington Works\n   plant. It is unknown whether this PFOA is from the use of FC-143 from 3M by the Washington Works facility, or C-8 from the PFOA made by DuPont and used after 2002 when the 3M PFOA was no longer available. Isomer analysis could be of forensic aid in the transport mechanism as well as making the analytical results more reliable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   6. Three decades of qualitative and quantitative analysis of PFOA for the health and safety of employees and the Washington Works plant community by one of the world's major chemical companies shows that the analytical sampling and analysis are still questionable due to accuracy, precision, representativeness, completeness, and comparability concerns. None of these analytical chemistry concerns apply to other chemicals of considerable and probable health concerns, such as dioxin, or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). All of these substances are semi-volatile compounds like PFOA and their sampling and analysis can be accomplished to very low concentrations accurately and precisely. There is a disconnect in the approach to accurate and precise analytical chemistry of PFOA. This disconnect has led to DuPont's underestimation and underreporting of PFOA concentrations and the reluctance to correct the analytical system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Smith Report at 66-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs also offer Robert W. Johnson to opine on the financial condition of DuPont in the event the trial goes to a punitive damages phase. (Johnson Report, ECF No. 2811-5; Johnson Dep. Tr., ECF No. 2809-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its Motion, DuPont moves for exclusion of the entire testimony of both Dr. Smith and Mr. Johnson as unreliable. DuPont also contends that Dr. Smith's testimony should be excluded because it is unfairly prejudicial, confusing, misleading, and needlessly cumulative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   DuPont's motion is governed by Rules 702 and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the use of expert testimony, providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case,\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Fed.

Dr. Smith addresses the chronology of C-8 analysis and the methods DuPont utilized to analyze its presence and effects beginning in 1984 when DuPont first collected water samples in the vicinity of the Washington Works plant. Dr. Smith reviews the methodology DuPont utilized in the 1984 studies that were evaluated at DuPont's Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The water samples were analyzed by gas chromatography /electron capture detector (GC/ECD) using a modification of DuPont's Method ES-567, a method for C-8 in the blood.

Dr. Smith goes on to explain the Experimental Station's analytical results:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The Experimental Station reported the analytical results in units of ng (nanograms) F (fluoride) per g (Gram) water or parts per billion (ppb). The report also states that, \"The results are expressed as ppb fluoride where ppb F = 0.688 \u00d7 ppb perflourooctanoate.\" This conversion factor is derived from the faction by weight of fluorine in perfluorooctanoic acid or 15 \u00d7 19/414 = 0.688. Another way of saying this is ppb F \u00d7 1.45 = ppb perfluorooctanoate where 1/0.688 = 1.45 or rounded to 1.5. A linear calibration curve was used for quantitation over a range of 0.4 to 1 ppb as fluoride (F) or 0.6 to 1.5 ppb perfluorooctanoate. No C-8 peak was detected in spiked standards at 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 ppb F. A reproducible and detectable peak was seen at 0.4 ppb F (0.6 ppb perfluorooctanoate) and this concentration was used as the detection limit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dr. Smith next reviews DuPont's internal memorandum related to the 1984 testing, DuPont's use of other methods, including the \"Stafford method\" and a \"detector response vs. PFOA isomer\" method.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23.

This analysis includes, for example, explanations of the methods employed by CH2M Hill from 1991 through 1998, Lancaster Laboratories until October 2001, and those later used at Exygen Research, Inc. which \"developed a new method for analysis of FC-143 utilizing liquid chromatography /tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in the negative ion mode.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-51 (internal citations omitted). During this analysis, Dr. Smith also refers to the scientific knowledge available on which\n   he relied to reach his opinions. By way of example, in evaluating the new method developed at and utilized by Exygen Research, Dr. Smith relies upon his knowledge of the subject matter as well as scholarly publications on the subject matter and opines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The LC/MS/MS method used by Exygen depends on the electrospray ionization of PFOA to be consistent between the standards and the samples. In the Exygen method the straight-chain PFOA and the branched-chain isomers elute as one peak. According to Jonathan W. Martin et al., in a 2004 paper co-authored by Mary Kaiser of DuPont, \"Isomers respond to electrospray ionization (ESI) differently, and thus the relative areas in the chromatogram do not necessarily reflect the relative amounts in the standard,\" Thus, the isomers content in the standards should match isomer ratio of the samples. Martin et al. also state that \"coeluting matrix components can either suppress or enhance ionization, which must be controlled to achieve maximum accuracy.\" Procedures to control the matrix effects can include matching the standard matrix to the samples, the method of standard additions, and isotope dilution. Martin et al, write: \"standard addition quantitation which involves spiking successive known quantities of a standard into the sample and reanalyzing, is common in atomic absorption spectroscopy and an acceptable technique to use when matrix effects are unavoidable.\" However, Martin et al. also state, \"Isotopically labeled perfluoroalkyl internal standards (isotope dilution) are probably the most appropriate approach for negating ionization effects because they will have the same retention times as their natural analogues (excluding any isomeric separation).\" Exygen did not use any of these procedures for the water samples collected from the community drinking water systems. Therefore, it raises questions about the accuracy of Exygen's water analysis for PFOA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dr. Smith ultimately summarizes his report as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   In 1984 DuPont was aware that APFO was present in the drinking water system served by the LPSD and in Little Hocking Water Association by virtue of its own sampling and analysis. These samples were analyzed by GC/ECD by DuPont's own laboratory at the Experimental Station, Wilmington, Delaware. Although DuPont questions the analytical accuracy of their results prior to January 1991, the detection of this substance in the community drinking water occurred on more than one occasion between 1984 and 1991. These results are probably biased low because DuPont only measured the main straight-chain isomer. However, because of the lack of quality assurance/quality control with the Experimental Station results such as surrogates and matrix spiking, the accuracy and precision of this data are not known.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   From September 1991 through November 1998 DuPont used CH2M Hill to analyze the drinking water samples by GC/ECD. CH2M Hill's method included internal standards, surrogates, and matrix spikes. CH2M Hill only measured the main straight-chain isomer of PFOA. DuPont intentionally\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   chose CH2M Hill\n   to analyze the drinking water samples for a period of seven years even though DuPont knew that CH2M Hill's results were significantly lower than the Experimental Station's results for split samples and \"CH2M Hill experienced poor surrogate recovery.\" DuPont was aware that CH2M Hill's \"numbers may be low on the absolute basis.\" DuPont did not voluntarily stop using CH2M Hill for C-8 water analysis but only switched laboratories after CH2M Hill's went out of business in the Fall of 1998.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   At DuPont's direction, Lancaster Laboratories used the CH2M Hill's method with some minor changes to analyze drinking water samples submitted by DuPont from February 1999 through October 2001. Lancaster experienced poor surrogate recoveries and poor recoveries of FC-143 spiked into samples and blanks. DuPont was aware of the poor recoveries and continued having Lancaster analyze the samples using the CH2M Hill method even though DuPont knew the results were biased low. Lancaster proposed an improved method using GC/MS with good surrogate recoveries and good FC-143 spike recoveries. Preliminary results from Lancaster's proposed method yielded higher results than the traditional CH2M Hill method but DuPont never authorized the use of this improved method on any of the drinking water samples from LPSD or Little Hocking. Instead DuPont intentionally chose Exygen's LC/MS/MS method that DuPont knew did not include surrogates to monitor if the method was performing properly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The valid challenges that DuPont, and Dr. Snyder, make go more to the accuracy and import of Dr. Smith's conclusions, which \"bear on 'the weight of the evidence rather than on its admissibility.' \"\n   <em>\n    Little Hocking Water Ass'n, Inc. v.

A lay jury cannot be expected to understand the analytical detection limits for quantification of a \"semi-volatile compound like PFOA,\" which requires the use of methodologies such as the chromatography /electron capture detector and/or the liquid chromatography /tandem mass spectrometry. Dr. Smith's testimony, similar to Dr. Snyder's testimony, will certainly assist the jury. Additionally, the Court does not find Dr. Smith's testimony creates a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence that would warrant exclusion under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Johnson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs offer economist Robert W. Johnson to \"frame, in economic terms, the financial condition of [DuPont],\" (Johnson Report at 1.) Mr. Johnson relies on statistics from publicly-available information such as Security and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings, proxy statements, news releases from DuPont's website, and data from the Yahoo! Finance website. He opines that DuPont is a financially healthy and growing company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   DuPont moves to exclude Mr. Johnson's testimony as unreliable, arguing that he arbitrarily chose the information from the financial documents, admitting \"that there were more financial numbers and metrics in the SEC filings than what he utilized in his report. (DuPont's Mot. at 10) (citing Johnson Dep. at 38-42.) DuPont further suggests that Mr. Johnson's testimony is suspect because he has testified as an expert witness in numerous cases. DuPont concludes that \"Mr. Johnson's attempted regurgitation of publicly-available facts is thus 'junk science' that would not help the jury in any way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189582\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/645/164/#p192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Trial Plaintiffs respond that Mr. Johnson's testimony will be helpful to the jury and that DuPont's complaints about his testimony go to its weight, not its admissibility. Specifically, they argue that interpretation of the financial information analyzed by Mr. Johnson is a specialized field; that the average layperson would not be able to simply review DuPont's SEC filings, proxy statements, news releases, and data from the Yahoo! Finance website and come to an informed conclusion as to the financial condition of a multi-national corporation, such as DuPont. The Trial Plaintiffs' arguments are well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As the parties both agree, DuPont's financial condition is at play if either Mrs. Bartlett's or Mr. Wolf's case goes to a punitive damages phase. In the Court's view, there are a limited number of ways to explore DuPont's financial condition. There are the SEC filings and proxy statements, which are admissible as admissions and excluded from the hearsay rule. These filings could be explained by counsel during closing arguments. However, that avenue would leave no room for clarifying questions and is a poor way to provide helpful information to the jury. On the other hand, Mr. Johnson, who is a qualified economist, could be questioned about the meaning of the documents presented to the jury and he would be subject to cross examination. DuPont can then explore the perceived weaknesses in Mr. Johnson's analysis and conclusions, as well as his work as an expert witness. These issues go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Scrap Metal Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566796\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/517/#p528\">\n    527 F.3d at 529-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, even though much of the testimony involved could be explained by counsel at closing, the Court thinks it is better for the jury to understand what the documents mean through the questioning of Mr. Johnson by counsel for both parties,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (any doubts should be resolved in favor of admissibility).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   DuPont's Motion to Exclude \"Narrative\" Testimony (ECF No. 2821).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Dr. Snyder holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry and a Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology and Environmental Toxicology.
