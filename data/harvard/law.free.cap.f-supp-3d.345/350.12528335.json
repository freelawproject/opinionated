ROM\u00c1N, United States District Judge\n  Jimmy Beauvoir (\"Plaintiff\"), an incarcerated\n  <em>\n   pro se\n  </em>\n  litigant, commenced this action on January 30, 2014 against: Rockland County Sheriff Falco (\"Falco\"), Lieutenant Byran (\"Byran\"), Sergeant Mueler (\"St. Mueller\" or \"Mueller\") (incorrectly spelled in the caption as \"Mueler\"), Sergeant Hickey (\"Hickey\"), C/O Pereze (\"Pereze\"), C/O Levine (\"Levine\"), (collectively \"Defendants\"), pursuant to\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n  </extracted-citation>\n  . (\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Amended Complaint (\"AC\"), ECF No. 29.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are liable for violating his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishments because they inflicted pain on him in a wanton, malicious, or sadistic way when they 1) sprayed him with pepper spray and 2) placed him in locked intake for two weeks, during which he allegedly spent several days without access to toiletries or a shower. (\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Plaintiff's Letter dated 8/14/14, (\"8/14/14 Letter\"), ECF No. 29; Plaintiff's Letter Dated 10/23/17, (\"10/23/17 Letter\"), ECF No. 14.) Consequently, Plaintiff seeks $2.5 trillion in damages. (AC \u00a7 V.)\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Presently before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Motion for Summary Judgment, (\"Defendant's Motion\"), ECF No. 110.) For the reasons discussed below, Defendants' Motion is GRANTED in its entirety.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts below are taken from the parties' Rule 56.1 statements, affidavits, declarations, and exhibits, and are not in dispute except where so noted. All rational inferences are drawn in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Placement of Plaintiff on Suicide Watch\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 1, 2013, Plaintiff was an incarcerated inmate at Rockland County Correctional Facility (\"RCCF\"). (Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement (\"Def. 56.1\"), \u00b6 2, ECF No. 110-27.) At around 3:05 pm, Plaintiff was in his cell, where he was observed upset and crying, with tears going down his cheeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCCF Officer Puccio observed Plaintiff in this distressed and tearful condition and decided to place him on \"suicide watch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Defendants' Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment (\"Def. Mem.\"), Ex. D, ECF No. 110-10.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, Officer Puccio escorted Plaintiff to the Intake Booking area and ordered him to change into suicide watch apparel, pursuant to RCCF Policy. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 6; Def. Mem., Ex D; Surveillance Video, Ex. O, ECF No. 110-24.) Plaintiff, however, refused Officer Puccio's order to change into suicide watch apparel. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7; Def. Mem., Ex D.) Plaintiff claims that he refused the orders because he told Officer Puccio that he was okay and that he did not want to hurt himself. (10/14/14 Letter.) (\"I simply asked him if I can talk to the doctor or the chaplain so I wouldn't have to go on suicide so they can know that I don't want to hurt myself.\"). Plaintiff also claims that the reason he did not want to be placed on suicide watch was\n   because he believed he would be placed in a very cold location and would get sick. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) (\"...its very cold I mean very very cold on top of that I get sick very easy when I get to[o] cold[.] I start shaking then I'll end up at a hospital, so that's what I was trying to prevent.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nevertheless, after Plaintiff refused multiple orders from Officer Puccio, St. Mueller arrived to assist Officer Puccio (Def. Mem. Ex. D.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When St. Mueller arrived, he also told Plaintiff to change apparel from the orange suit he was wearing to the blue suit that inmates are supposed to wear when on suicide watch. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; Def. Mem., Ex D.) Plaintiff continued refusing to change and became increasingly worked up. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 16; 8/14/14 Letter) (\"...yes I did ask[ ] him a couple of times again to talk to the doctor and the chaplain maybe that's the reason he got so mad...\"). Plaintiff claims that at this point Sergeant Mueller started cursing him out, told him to \"shut the fuck up\" and \"spit on [his] face.\" (8/14/14 Letter.) Defendants claim that it was only Plaintiff who \"became increasingly demonstrative and animated,\" whilst continually refusing to change into the suicide watch apparel. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, St. Mueller escorted Plaintiff to the shower area adjoining the intake area. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 17; Pl. Dep. 46: 9-14; Ex. O.) There, St. Mueller applied a burst of Oleoresin Capsicum (\"OC\" or \"pepper\") spray on Plaintiff. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 18; AC Attachment A; 10/14/14 Letter.) While Plaintiff claims that he subjectively thought St. Mueller was going to hit Plaintiff, the undisputed facts and surveillance footage reflect that both parties become increasingly agitated, but neither party became violent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8/14/14 Letter; Surveillance Video, Ex. O.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties disagree as to how much pepper spray St. Mueller emitted. Defendants claim that St. Mueller used the paper spray for a \"short, one second burst,\" whereas Plaintiff contends that St. Mueller sprayed so much spray \"to the point that everyone [was] [coughing] so much\" and three other officers had to leave the room. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/14/14 Letter; Ex. O).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants claim that the surveillance video demonstrates that \"[n]o staff demonstrated adverse reactions.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After St. Mueller sprayed Plaintiff with the pepper spray, Plaintiff showered, put on fresh clothes, and was immediately escorted to the medical facility to irrigate his eyes. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; Pl. Dep. 55:17-18.) Plaintiff admits that he did not require any physical assistance to walk to the Nurse's office, but also claims that he could not open his eyes and was suffering from the immense pain. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 23; Pl. Dep. 56:2-3, 64:14-20.) (\"I couldn't open my eyes. My eyes was watering and tears all over and it was red, it was hurt - it was hurting. And my head was also - I felt like my head was going to blow. My head hurt a lot.\") The Nurse then provided Plaintiff with several fluids with which to rinse his eyes that Plaintiff then used to thoroughly rinse and irrigate his eyes. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 24; Pl. Dep. at 69-73.) Plaintiff then left the Nurse's office and was taken to a Psychiatrist. (Pl. Dep. 79:1-6.) The Psychiatrist\n   examined Plaintiff and wrote a letter instructing Plaintiff to be taken \"off suicide watch.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Soon thereafter, Plaintiff entered a guilty plea and accepted 15 days of \"lock-in\" as a penalty for refusing to comply with corrections officer orders, and he was placed in Administrative Segregation for his refusal to comply with correctional officer orders. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 25; Ex D.) Plaintiff claims that before he was placed in this segregation, Defendants wrongfully took away all his legal papers, his bible, his clothes, all the food he had brought with him (10/14/14 Letter.) (\"they took everything I had owned and put it in the trash.\") At some point on June 1, 2013, St. Mueller properly filled out an OC Report, detailing the incident and his use of OC spray on Plaintiff. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 26; Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Attempt to File a Grievance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   About five months later, on November 15, 2013, Plaintiff submitted a grievance in connection with the June 1, 2013 pepper spray incident, in which Plaintiff claimed to have suffered injuries to his eyes, including losing sight in his right eye, getting blurry vision in his left eye, and having to get scheduled for a surgery as a result of exposure to the spray. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 27; Ex. D.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the same day that Plaintiff filed this grievance, Lt. John Byran, the Grievance Coordinator at RCCF, denied Plaintiff's application. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 28; Ex. D.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff appealed the initial determination of the Grievance Coordinator to the Chief Administrative Officer. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 29; Ex. D.). Subsequently, on November 25, 2013, the Chief of Correction, Anthony Volpe, rendered a decision, in which he denied Plaintiff's Grievance. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Ex. D.). Plaintiff then appealed this decision to the Citizen's Policy and Complaint Review Council, and the appeal was sent to the Council on November 29, 2013. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; Ex. D.). On February 19, 2014, the Citizen's Policy and Complaint Review Council rendered a final decision, sustaining the action taken by the facility administration. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 35; Ex. D.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiff's Chronic Eye Conditions and Medical History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff has a documented history of chronic inflammatory changes in his peripheral cornea that date back to 2004. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 35; Ex. F, L.). This history reflects that Plaintiff had chronic conjunctivitis with corneal changes, and an assessment and plan of corneal superficial vascularization. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 37; Ex. F.) On March 3, 2004, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital for an evaluation of superficial corneal vascularization and was noted with vision of 20/25, 20/30 with superficial pannus and anterior corneal inflammation on examination, with an assessment of corneal inflammation/pannus/pigmentation. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 38; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although he was advised to follow up in two months, Plaintiff next went to New York Presbyterian Hospital on March 31, 2005 with complaints of itchiness and inflammation and increased pannus. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 44; Ex. F.) During that visit, the doctor noted that Plaintiff had superficial\n   pannus and corneal thinning. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 45; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 1, 2005, Plaintiff was again treated at New York Presbyterian and had a vision of 20/25 and pannus. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 46; Ex. F.) Subsequently, on January 19, 2006, Plaintiff was again treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital and this time was noted with having pannus in both eyes, being \"inactive,\" and was directed to follow up in three months. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 47; Ex. F.) Although Plaintiff was advised to follow up in three months, he did not, and his next treatment at New York Presbytarian was on January 4, 2007, where he was noted as having asymptomatic pannus and vision 20/25, 20/30. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 48; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 21, 2007, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian again. This time, the doctor noted that he had clumps of white infiltrates with staining in his right eye, and assessed it as pannus with inflammation, secondary to atopic disease. He was advised to follow up in two weeks. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 49; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff was next treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital on December 20, 2007 and was noted as having white infiltrates bilaterally with staining and atopic disease with pannus; he was advised to follow up in two to three months (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 50; Ex. F.) Plaintiff was next treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital on October 7, 2009 and noted with blurry vision in his right eye and diplopia (double vision) in his left eye for approximately one year, mild chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), epithelial infiltrates and pannus worse since 2007, and was directed to follow up in two to three weeks (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 51; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 21, 2010, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital for chronic pannus secondary to atopic disease. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 52; Ex. F.) On June 24, 2010, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital with worsening pannus of the left eye, neovascularization of the cornea (worse in right eye), opacification, and chemosis. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 53; Ex. F.) On July 29, 2010, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital and noted with a vision of 20/50 (right) and 20/30 (left), phlyctenules worse in the right eye, neovascularization, pannus with corneal haze worse in the right eye, persistent irritation and redness. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 54; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 9, 2010, Plaintiff was treated at the Rockland County Department of Health at the immunotherapy clinic for his complaints of daily headaches and right eye redness (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 55; Ex. F.) On November 2, 2010, Plaintiff was treated at the Rockland County Department of Health with complaints of right eye redness. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 56; Ex. F.) On June 1, 2011, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital with noted redness, itchiness, and pain in both eyes, vision 20/200 (right) and 20/40 (left). (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 57; Ex. F.) In this visit, the doctor's notes reflect that Plaintiff was supposed to be on Patanol, Tobradex, and Doxy, but he only last followed up in July 2010 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on an exam taken during Plaintiff's June 1, 2011 visit, Plaintiff was noted with,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   pannus with stromal vessels, phlyctenules and corneal haze\n   <em>\n    worse in the right eye\n   </em>\n   (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 58; Ex. F.) Again, the June 1, 2011 medical chart notes that Plaintiff was noncompliant with follow-up or treatment, and there was a possible need to rescrape his right cornea-that is, a need for Plaintiff to have surgery on his right eye. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 59; Ex. F.) On June 2, 2011, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital again, and this time was noted with vision 20/80 (right) and 20/40 (left) (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 60; Ex. F.) The chart from that visit notes that Plaintiff needed to exercise strict compliance with treatment, follow-up,\n   and medicine, in order to avoid severe visual loss, and he was advised to follow up in two weeks (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 61; Ex. F.) The notes also stated \"may need to rescrape cornea OD\" (Ex. F.) On April 30, 2012, Plaintiff was again treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital for his complaints of eye redness, pulsating, and having blurry vision and itching for two to three months; he was also noted with vision of 20/300 (right) and 20/30 (left) (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 62; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 19, 2012, Plaintiff was treated at the Rockland County Department of Health and had complaints of blurred vision (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 63; Ex. F.) On July 20, 2012, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital, with vision readings of 20/125 (right) and 20/30 (left). (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 64; Ex. F.) He was also noted to have not been using any eye drops (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The chart from this visit also reflects that he had right pannus with stromal vessels and phlyctenules, neovascularization /pannus with corneal haze\n   <em>\n    worse than the left\n   </em>\n   . (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 65; Ex. F.) Finally, the chart from this visit also notes that Plaintiff now presented himself with fully vascularized (superficial) cornea in the right eye with potential need to rescrape the cornea-so again at this point, Plaintiff was considered a candidate for eye surgery. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 66; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The July 20, 2012 New York Presbyterian Hospital medical chart notes indicate that Plaintiff had a history of non-compliance with follow-up and treatment (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 67; Ex. F.) On August 31, 2012, Plaintiff was treated at Nyack Hospital and displayed mild scleraicterus in his eyes on examination. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 68; Ex. F.) On October 4, 2012, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital and was noted for a history of chronic stromal vascularization, thinning, and inflammation in both eyes, but worse in the right. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 69; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The October 4, 2012 New York Presbyterian Hospital medical chart notes show an assessment and plan reflecting chronic pannus, scarring and thinning associated with atopic conjunctivitis, fully vascularized (superficial) and scarred cornea in the right eye with diffuse thinning and was advised to follow up in four weeks (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 70; Ex. F.) On April 23, 2013, Plaintiff was treated at the Rockland County Correctional Facility and was noted with a history of pannus (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 71; Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 1, 2013, Plaintiff was treated by a nurse at RCCF and was given an eye flush following the OC spray incident (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 72; Ex. C.) About one year later, on May 21, 2014, Plaintiff underwent surgery to his right retina, specifically a keratoplasty and limbal vessel cautery of the right eye. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 73; Ex.

(AC \u00a7 III) (\"I went blind from getting mist, and they did take me to Nyack Hospital, but nothing was result, until May 21, 2014. I had a surgery and now I am in really bad condition right now. It can take me days just to write a letter.\") Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff is blind in his right eye and required having retinal surgery. Rather, they dispute that Plaintiff's injury is attributable to the pepper spray incident since Plaintiff has a long medical history of poor vision and was already legally blind and in need of retinal surgery more than a year before the pepper spray incident. (Def. Mem. at 25-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants' assessment. Although, losing vision and needing and eye surgery are certainly sufficient to show an extensive injury, the injury has to be causally related to the application of excessive force to make a successful excessive force claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ajamu Olutosin v. William Lee\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 14-cv-00685, ECF No. 151 (S.D.N.Y. October 11, 2018) (NSR) (rejecting claim that retinal detachment of inmate was the result of excessive force where two physicians provided undisputed expert testimony reflecting that Plaintiff had a previous history of retinal detachment and a need for surgical intervention that was neither caused by nor aggravated by the use of force incident in prison.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, similar to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Olutosin\n   </em>\n   , Defendants presented the expert testimony of Dr. Stamm, a licensed physician and Board Certified ophthalmologist, who testified with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that \"plaintiff's corneal disease was not proximately caused by plaintiff's exposure to pepper spray\" and that \"plaintiff's corneal transplant surgery was not necessitated by plaintiff's exposure to pepper spray on June 1, 2013, but instead was the by-product of the progression of plaintiff's documented history of chronic inflammatory changes of the peripheral cornea dating back to 2004.\" (Mark Stamm Expert Affidavit, Ex. L, ECF No, 110-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Upon reviewing all of Plaintiff's medical records, Dr. Stamm further concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 \"Plaintiff suffered from chronic eye problems since at least the year 2004, which presented as chronic inflammatory changes of the peripheral cornea, the changes have progressed over time to the point that the vision in Plaintiff's right eye was at the level of less than 20/200 prior to June of 2011, which was legally blind.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 \"In April 2012, more than one year prior to the pepper spray incident, Plaintiff was noted by his doctors, as having significant corneal disease in his right eye with pannus formation, deep stromal blood vessels, and stromal thinning. At that point, he already was not able to be refracted to a better vision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 \"In addition, Plaintiff's medical records indicate that Plaintiff was noncompliant with both follow-up and treatment from 2004 to 2011.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 \"Consequently, Plaintiff had a very significant corneal disease prior to June 1, 2013, which necessarily required\n   a corneal transplant to visually rehabilitate his eye.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 \"Neither Plaintiff's vision impairment, nor his need for corneal transplant surgery were proximately caused by Plaintiff's exposure to pepper spray on June 1, 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Similarly, Defendants' provided Plaintiff's entire medical history for his eyes, which unequivocally reflected that he had severe eye issues since as early as 2004, nearly a full decade before the pepper spray incident. For example, the notes from a doctor's visit on February 24, 2004 reflect that Plaintiff was HIV-positive since he was 14 years old and had chronic conjunctivitis with corneal changes, and an assessment and plan of corneal superficial vascularization since he was 18 years old. (Doctor's Report from 2/27/04 visit, Ex. F.) Similarly, the notes from a doctor's visit at New York State Presbyterian on July 20, 2012 reflect that Plaintiff had \"chronic pannus\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   . a film forming on his eyes) and that the right eye was already in considerably worse shape than his left eye. (Doctor's Report from 7/20/12 visit, Ex. F) He was also reported as not going to any of his follow up appointments for over a year (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (\"h/o noncompliant with follow-up or treatment\"; \"not using any eyedrops.\") Moreover, his vision was reported as a debilitating \"20/300\" in his right eye, indicating that he was already legally blind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Additionally, on at least two documented occasions before the pepper spray incident, Plaintiff was considered likely to need future retinal surgery in his right eye. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 1, 2011 and July 10, 2012 Medical Notes, Def. 56.1 \u00b6 59; Ex. F.) (\"may need to rescrape cornea/PKP OD\"; \"may need to rescrape cornea OD but will defer to cornea clinic.\") And finally, Plaintiff was complaining about his headaches, right eye redness, itchiness, and pain in both eyes well over a year before the pepper spray incident. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.C.) (\"On August 9, 2010, Plaintiff was treated at the Rockland County Department of Health at the immunotherapy clinic for his complaints of daily headaches and right eye redness...On November 2, 2010, Plaintiff was treated at the Rockland County Department of Health with complaints of right eye redness...On June 1, 2011, Plaintiff was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital with noted redness, itchiness, and pain in both eyes.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Consequently, although Plaintiff's vision loss and subsequent surgery would otherwise suffice as an extensive injury, here the Court finds that Plaintiff's injury had nothing to do with the use of force incident and was neither caused nor significantly exacerbated by the pepper spray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The only additional injuries that Plaintiff has alleged are minor injuries related to pain in his eyes, his body, and head. For example, Plaintiff claims he suffered increased pain and burning to his eyes\n   <em>\n    several months\n   </em>\n   later. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/14/14 Letter) (\"A few months after the whole thing happen, I started feeling weird. I was in a lot of pain, my eyes was blood shot red and burning... the side of my face was hurting, my eyes was in bad shape, it was burning and hurting.\") Those claims suffer a lack of any corroborating evidence, but more importantly, suffer the same causation issues as Plaintiff's loss of vision and retinal surgery claims-that is, Plaintiff had already made those\n   <em>\n    exact\n   </em>\n   complaints on numerous occasions prior to the pepper spray incident, and there are no facts on the record to allow a jury to conclude that those complaints of pain many months later had any causal relationship to the use of force incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Critically, nowhere in Plaintiff's Complaint does he complain of suffering any immediate pain or injury right after the\n   pepper spray incident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC.) This is corroborated by Defendants' video surveillance footage. While Defendants' video surveillance footage does not depict what occurred in the shower stall when St. Mueller actually sprayed Plaintiff, the video does show that within moments of the incident, Plaintiff emerges from the shower and walks out of the hallway with no visible signs of pain or visual loss. He is not hunched over, he is not limping, he is not veering off in the wrong direction, he is not grabbing his eyes, and he is not even coughing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. O.) This is corroborated by Plaintiff's conduct in the Nurse's office. Even though Plaintiff testified that he was experiencing pain immediately after the incident, when he was at the Nurse's office, he did not once complain about any pain or suffering to the Nurse. (Pl. Dep. at 69-76.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, based on a thorough review of all the evidence on the record including Plaintiff's deposition, the video surveillance footage, Plaintiff's medical history, and Dr. Stamm's expert report, the Court finds that Plaintiff's injuries from the force incident are very minor indications of a malicious or deliberately indifferent intent. Therefore, this factor weighs in Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Mental State of Defendant\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This factor goes to the core of the excessive force inquiry. Courts must assess the facts on the record to determine \"whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline,\" or whether there were ulterior motives driving the use of force.\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    503 U.S. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    112 S.Ct. 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To survive summary judgment, a Plaintiff must make some showing to indicate that Defendants acted \"maliciously and sadistically,\" intending to cause harm.\n   <em>\n    Perry v. Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778573\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/659/577/#p581\">\n    659 F.Supp.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 581 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (\"The subjective element requires that the prison official involved possess a \"wanton\" state of mind when he or she engaged in the alleged conduct.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Blyden v. Mancusi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857722\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/252/#p262\">\n    186 F.3d 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (2d Cir.1999) ). In other words, because Eighth Amendment excessive force issues do not hinge on whether there was grave injury, but on whether officers inflicted\n   <em>\n    unnecessary\n   </em>\n   pain and suffering that can be deemed cruel and unusual\n   <em>\n    punishment\n   </em>\n   , this factor directly looks for proof of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, Plaintiff only provides scattered statements that could go to mental state of St. Mueller and one or two unknown officer. For example, Plaintiff claims that prior to spraying pepper spray, St. Mueller said things such as \"shut the f** up\" and \"get you're a** in the shower.\" (AC, Attachment A.) Plaintiff also claims that St. Mueller \"pulled out his pepper spray asking me if I knew what it was\" and adds that St. Mueller \"was getting so mad I thought he was going to hit\n   me.\"(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff vaguely states that \"Sgt. Mueler had two other C/Os with him [which] made me more afraid\" and later claims \"Sgt. Mueler was so close to my face to the point that his hand was touching my face.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Subsequently, Plaintiff adds that St. Mueller made him take a shower with cold water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court first notes that much of Plaintiff's testimony is uncorroborated by any evidence, and, apart from being self-serving testimony that is insufficient to defeat summary judgment, it is belied by the video evidence. The surveillance video does not depict any yelling or violence, just marginally aggressive dialogue exchange. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. O). Even if Plaintiff's allegations were taken as true as to St. Mueller's conduct in the shower stall, which was not fully visible on the surveillance footage, it does not rise to a level of sadistic or malevolent conduct. Rather, it constitutes\n   <em>\n    de minimus\n   </em>\n   use of physical force, which is occasionally permissible. The Eight Amendment does not prohibit all uses of force that could be avoided or all malevolent touch that may seem unwarranted.\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    503 U.S. at 9-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    112 S.Ct. 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hence, the Court recognized that a prison or a correctional facility is a nuanced setting, where order must be maintained and riots and disturbances need to be quelled.

In contrast, Defendants have provided excerpts from New York State Corrections Law, which provides that when inmates \"disobey any lawful direction, the officers and employees shall use all\n   <em>\n    suitable means\n   </em>\n   to defend themselves, to maintain order, to enforce observation of discipline, to secure the persons or the offenders and to prevent any such attempt or escape.\" (Def. Mem. at 21) (citing New York State Corrections Law \u00a7 137.5.) They also provided excerpts from New York State Penal Law, Article 35.10, which provides that \"a warden or other authorized official of a jail, prison or correctional institution may, in order to maintain order and discipline, use such physical force as is authorized by the correction law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22). They similarly provide excerpts from the Rockland County Sherriff's Office Policies (\"RCSO\"), which provides that officers may use pepper spray when they are authorized to do so in a manner that is reasonable, necessary, and safe-\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they have tried communicating orders verbally. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 23; Blasko Affidavit, Ex. L). And lastly, they also provided expert testimony of Dominick Blasko, a Chief Police Officer for the Town of Crawford who is a Master Instructor on the administration of pepper spray, who upon reviewing all the evidence and regulations that apply to RCCF, testified that St. Mueller's \"use of force\n   through administration of OC (pepper) spray was reasonable and necessary and in accordance with good and accepted correctional industry standards.\") (Expert Affidavit, Dominick Blasko, Ex. K, ECF No. 110-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court thus finds that Defendants' were within their right to judge Plaintiff as a suicide risk The facts show that it is within RCCF officers' authority to preliminarily judge inmates' state of well-being and strive to effectuate their proper placement within the correctional facility. They also show that it is within their authority to maintain order and discipline within the facility. It is inevitable that inmates will occasionally refuse to obey the authority of officer commands or disagree with their judgments. In such instances, officers need to resort to pressure tactics of some sort to instill order. \"[T]he question... ultimately turns on whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\")\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    503 U.S. at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    112 S.Ct. 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   It is not within the Court's province to write or advocate particular rules in the prison system.

The Court explained that \"being violently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offense against society.\" Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained the proportionality concept in its reasoning when it explained: \"[t]o deny... the difference between punching a prisoner in the face and serving him unappetizing food is to ignore the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eight Amendment\"\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    503 U.S. at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    112 S.Ct. 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, the undisputed facts show that the length of pepper spraying is not in dispute. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 12: \"the OC spray was only administered one time in a single short burst\"\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. 50:1-5: \"Q: And do you recall about how long\n   you were actually sprayed in the face? A: About-for a couple of seconds.\") At the same time, there is a dispute about the quantity of pepper spray that was emitted and the proximity of St. Mueller to Plaintiff's face. Plaintiff testifies that \"[h]e was so close to my face, his fingers was touching my nose while he sprayed me with the thing. And after he did it-after he did it, ... he just left while I was in the shower. I was in the shower breathing the whole thing. It was so strong.\" (Pl. Dep 47:21-23, 48:1-4.) Although Plaintiff offers no facts to corroborate his testimony, none of Defendants' evidence fully belies Plaintiff's statement. At best, Defendants' surveillance video shows that the duration of the spray was short because Plaintiff emerged from the shower within a few seconds of being sprayed, and did not appear to be in excruciating pain. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. O). Because the video does not depict what happened in the shower, the Court cannot assess how close the pepper spray was to Plaintiff's eyes, only that it could not have been close enough to cause immediate, debilitating pain and suffering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Because there are still questions about exactly how close St. Mueller held the pepper spray from Plaintiff's eyes, this factor is not fully assessable by the Court and weighs neither in favor of Plaintiff nor Defendants. The Court simply notes that the effects of the injury are minor, and whatever force was applied, was not applied for long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Threat reasonably Perceived by the Defendants\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The undisputed facts show that the threat that Plaintiff would cause physical harm was slight, as Plaintiff was not being violent or belligerent-rather, he was just getting increasingly agitated. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.A.) (\"...yes I did ask[ ] him a couple of times again to talk to the doctor and the chaplain maybe that's the reason he got so mad...\"). Indeed, the surveillance video corroborates that while Plaintiff was getting a little more animated, he was always unarmed, and never created any dire chaos, such as by trying to flee, attack, or do anything that could objectively or subjectively be perceived as a threat to Defendants' safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Here, the Court cannot find that a confined inmate, who was unarmed and not behaving violently, was posing much of a physical threat to Defendants' safety or well-being. He was, however, posing a modest threat of disorder in an environment where he had no right to do so and where maintenance of civility and discipline is of utmost importance. Accordingly, this factor minutely weighs in Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   vi.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Efforts Made by the Defendants to Temper the Severity of a Forceful Response\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Lastly, the Court finds that Defendants did make several good-faith efforts to temper the severity of the situation before resorting to a forceful response. The surveillance video depicts that before Officer Mueller arrived on the scene, Officer Puccio was talking to Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. O). When Officer Mueller arrived, talking to Plaintiff for a few minutes before leading Plaintiff into the shower stall and offered Plaintiff the blue suit several times by holding it out towards him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, Plaintiff himself admits that he was asked to change into the blue suit multiple times, but he kept resisting because he wanted to first speak to the nurse or chaplain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. at 46: 15-23 (\"He was just - he was - he was talking to me in a really loud voice and I don't know - just it really - it wasn't necessary the things he was saying. And I just - I was just trying to make sure that he understood\n   where I was coming from too. I said please, please, you know, please, please, please Sergeant Mueller, let me speak to the doctor, please.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court finds that Defendants tried multiple times to convince Plaintiff to follow their orders and change apparel before resorting to use of force. Although reasonably minds might disagree on whether Plaintiff's or the Defendants' request was reasonable, the Court finds that the undisputed facts reflect that Defendants made at a sufficient effort to temper the need to use force before deploying it. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On the balance, the Court finds that the undisputed facts related to the subjective test indicate that Defendants did not have the requisite culpable state of mind, and although these is no video footage showing the exact interaction in which St. Mueller sprayed Plaintiff, there is no other fact on the record that could allow a jury to find a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of deliberate indifference, recklessness, or knowing willingness of a serious risk of harm. Accordingly, Defendants' have met their burden of proof with regards to the subjective test, and the Court next turns to the objective test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Objective Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Again, the objective test focuses on the harm done in light of \"contemporary standards of decency,\"\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684610\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/255/#p268\">\n    554 F.3d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and asks whether the alleged violation is \"sufficiently serious\" to warrant Eighth Amendment protections.\n   <em>\n    Blyden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857722\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/252/#p262\">\n    186 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   262 ;\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

(\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.1.a.) There is no need for the Court to rehash its analysis about the lack of causation between the pepper spray incident and Plaintiff's loss of vision, subsequent retina surgery, and various eye and body pains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Absent any proof of a causal relationship between Plaintiff's numerous alleged injuries and the pepper spray incident, the Court holds that no reasonable juror could find that St. Mueller or the other officers' conduct was such a grave departure from \"contemporary standards of decency\" or that Plaintiff's injury was serious enough to invite an Eighth Amendment violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Plaintiff also mentions that prior to being sent to intake, his belongings were taken, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC Att. A) (\"...they took all my stuff [put] them in the trash my legal papers my bible my clothes my commissary everything that I had owned. They took it all.

(Def. Mem. at 27-28).

None of these statements, alone or in combination, rise to the level of reflecting a deliberate indifference, a recklessness, or an intentional sense of sadism, sufficient to meet the subjective intent requirement for Plaintiff's claim. For one thing, none of these statements are tied to the hygiene and sanitation issues specifically. Second, Plaintiff never even alleges that the single deprivation of medicine affected him at all, let alone severely, and third, the statements, at best, reflect that the officers were being negligent, not intentionally cruel or reckless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Despite Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status, Plaintiff's claims are just the type of \"bald\" assertions that are unsupported by any evidence.\n   <em>\n    Shariff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999398\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/689/470/#p476\">\n    689 F.Supp.2d at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Here, the Court already explained that the officers were charged with maintaining order in the correctional facility and were allowed to use their judgment to assess the well-being of the inmates. Indeed, it was in their prerogative to ensure that inmates who were deemed to be at risk of self-harm were placed on suicide watch. The officers necessarily have to base their decisions on judgments that they make in the moment that are inherently subjective. Plaintiff was on his knees weeping when he was first placed on suicide watch. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.A.) He subsequently acted difficult and repeatedly denied verbal offers to change his clothes and proceed to intake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As the Court stated earlier, it may not have been strictly necessary or desirable for Defendants' to resort to using force to ensure Plaintiff's compliance, but certain \"situations may require prison officials to act quickly and decisively,\"\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    503 U.S. at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n    112 S.Ct. 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the Supreme Court encourages courts to afford prison administrators \"wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain security\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219215\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court finds that the facts on the record reflect that it was objectively reasonable for St. Mueller to believe his actions were lawful at the time he acted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that, in addition to their not being a constitutional violation under the Eighth Amendment, Defendants have adduced enough evidence to show that they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Claims Against Other Named Officers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiff loosely brings claims against other named officers as well, including: Sherriff Falco, Lt. Byran, Sgt. Hickey, C/O Pereze, and C/O Levine. (See 8/14/14 Letter, Att. A.) Though it is a bit nebulous which claims Plaintiff is alleging against whom, Defendants seek to dismiss each of these claims on the basis that they are either inadequately pleaded or are moot. (Def. Mem. at 33-34.) The Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Grievance Claims Against Byran, Hickey, and Levine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiff vaguely raises claims against Levine, Hickey and Byran, each of whom allegedly told Plaintiff that his complaint was not grievable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8/14/14 Letter) (\"The first time I asked [Levine] he said he was going to call the Sgt. for me but he did not. I waited for a few more days I asked him again he ignored me. I waited again to ask him about the situation, then he told me my complaint was not grievable. He did not call the Sgt. for me.\"); (\"When I asked [Byran] for the grievance he brought [it] right away but he acted like he never knew about the situation because after I told him what happened to me he says I don't believe it, I don't believe it. Sgt. Hickey never give you the grievance.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not plead a cognizable claim against any of the officers for being advised that his claim was not grievable, and that in any event, the claim is moot because Plaintiff was ultimately able to file his formal grievance. (Def. Mem. at 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court finds that any claim against any of the officers, asserting that they violated Plaintiff's constitutional rights by interfering with the grievance process cannot stand. \"[I]nmate grievance programs created by state law are not required by the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Rickett v.

Subsequently, he successfully pursued this Section 1983 action in federal court, and this Court is permitting Plaintiff to re-allege his claims against any officers that concern the cruel and unusual treatments that were central to his grievance.

(Def. Mem. at 33.) At best, Defendants construe Plaintiff's claims as failure to supervise claims, which they argue, must be dismissed on the pleadings. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Beginning with the allegations against Lt. Byran, in \"Attachment A\" of his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff argues that \"being a Lt. is like being a supervisor. He should be the one making sure that everything goes right in the jail. He should be the one to make sure all C/Os and Sgts. are doing their Job.... that's his job to know what goes down in the facility. [I]f by chance Lt.

After the situation happen they took all my legal papers, my bible, my clothes, all the food I brought from commissary at least forty dollars' worth of food or more.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff added, \"I complain to the C/Os and Sgts. they all said they cannot find my stuff or even buy them back.

To plead a claim for supervisor liability in \u00a7 1983 actions, a plaintiff must allege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (1) The defendant participated directly in the alleged constitutional violation, (2) the defendant, after being informed of the violation through a report or appeal, failed to remedy the wrong, (3) the defendant created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred, or allowed the continuance of such a policy or custom, (4) the defendant was grossly negligent in supervising subordinates who committed the wrongful acts, or (5) the defendant exhibited deliberate indifference to the rights of inmates by failing to act on information indicating that unconstitutional acts were occurring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Colon v.

Regarding Lt. Bryon, all that Plaintiff seems to be alleging is that Bryon did not know about the pepper spray incident and should therefore be liable. This does not satisfy even the first element for supervisory liability, which is direct involvement. Plaintiff certainly makes no mention of a policy or custom or anything that could color claims of deliberate indifference or a grossly negligent mindset. Accordingly, this claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   As to Sheniff Falco, Plaintiff's claims are equally as vague and deficient. With Plaintiff's claim that \"I complain to the C/Os and Sgts. they all said they cannot find my stuff or even buy them back. Rockland County jail do whatever they want because no one is doing anything about it not even the sheriff department,\" the Court finds that it fails as a matter of law because an inmate's allegation that an official ignored a written protest or request is insufficient to establish personal involvement.\n   <em>\n    Platt v. Incorporated Village of Southampton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3948410\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/391/62/#p65\">\n    391 F. App'x 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that allegations that a supervisor ignored a letter protesting unconstitutional conduct was insufficient to establish that the supervisor\n   was personally involved). Consequently, both of these claims are insufficiently plead, and all of Plaintiff's complaints against individual officers are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in its entirety, and all claims in this action against all named Defendants are DISMISSED. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 110, terminate the case, and to enter judgment in favor of Defendants. The Clerk of the Court is additionally directed to mail a copy of this order to Plaintiff at his last known address on ECF, and show proof of service on the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Plaintiff claims that he was crying because as he was praying on his knees, he started to \"tear up a bit.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Letter dated 8/14/14, \"10/14/14 Letter\"), Ex.

(Plaintiff Deposition, Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment, Ex. C at 47, ECF No. 110-7-9.) Plaintiff also claims that St. Mueller was \"so close to my face, his fingers was touching my nose while he sprayed me with the thing.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    \"I cannot see from my right eye ever since I got spra[yed] with pepper spray. I'm blind from my right eye so now my left eye is beginning to get blurry and blurry. I have been taken to the doctor many times. Nothing is working so now they talking about having a surgery very soon now that I'm blind on one eye because somebody was being who they are and did this to me for no reason.\" (Def. Decl., Ex. D.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    In his deposition, Plaintiff did testify that right after being sprayed \"I was bending down and I couldn't breathe and then I kneeled down after. And I was still-you know, I felt like I was going to pass out or something, you know, it was just pain all over. And for some reason when they sprayed the pepper spray it stayed in the air. So every time I move or turn around its get on my body, also, and it hurts a lot.\"(Pl. Dep. 51: 6-14.) But, the Court has pointed out that there is not one piece of corroborating evidence for this statement. There is nothing in Plaintiff's complaint, the video surveillance, or the Nurse's report. Accordingly, the Plaintiff's deposition testimony is simply self-serving testimony that cannot be used to defeat summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fincher v.
