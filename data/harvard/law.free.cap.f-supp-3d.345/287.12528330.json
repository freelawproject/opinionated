Defendants President Donald Trump, Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Claire M. Grady filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Defendants also filed a motion to stay this action.

Duke's termination of Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\") for Haiti, effective July 22, 2019. Plaintiffs claim,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the decision to terminate TPS for Haiti violated the requirements of the TPS statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a, implemented a new standard for terminating TPS that is arbitrary and unlawful under the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, and was\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court assumes the reader's familiarity with the history of TPS and Haiti's TPS designation, and the allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint.

Pl. Opp'n at 14; Tr. 30:8-31, 70:1-19.
