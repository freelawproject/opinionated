The complaint alleges defendant, in sending the letter, used a false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of a debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e. Specifically, it alleges defendant's letter 1) falsely represented or implied that an individual was an attorney or that a communication was from an attorney in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(3) and 2) used a false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect a debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10). The complaint also alleges that, in sending the letter, defendant violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f by using an unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect a\n   debt. Defendant moves [13] to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ.

Civelli\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The letter is on defendant's letterhead which identifies the firm as attorneys at law with an address in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The letterhead lists names of firm attorneys, including Scarfone and Civelli, as well as each attorney's jurisdictions of admission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   An illegible, apparently handwritten, signature appears in the area of the letter provided for signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The bulk of the letter's content sets forth the information a debt collector is required to provide to a debtor by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(11) (disclosure that it is from a debt collector attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g (information about the debt and the process for disputing and validating the debt). The letter makes no demand for payment nor any threat, or\n   even mention, of the possibility of litigation. Its first sentence states: \"This law firm has been retained to collect the above-referenced debt.\" Its final paragraph begins: \"If you would like to make a payment on this debt,\" and goes on to describe the options available for making payment. What lies between the first sentence and the final paragraph is exclusively the statutorily required Section 1692e(11) and Section 1692g information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff does not object to the content of the letter. Rather, she contends it violates the FDCPA because the letter falsely represents that it is from an attorney. At first blush, one might think that a letter on law firm letterhead, bearing a signature on behalf of the firm by someone licensed to practice law, and who is listed on said letterhead as one of the law firm's attorneys would, ipso facto, be a communication from an attorney. But, when the letter is an attempt to collect a debt, it has been settled law for some time that this is not the case for purposes of the FDCPA. More is required for the letter to be considered actually a communication from the attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[A] debt collection letter that is issued on an attorney's letterhead and over his signature conveys the notion that the attorney has directly controlled or supervised the process through which the letter was sent - i.e., that he assessed the validity of the debt, is prepared to take legal action to collect on that debt, and has, accordingly, decided that a letter should be sent to the debtor conveying that message. The attorney letter implies that the attorney has reached a considered, professional judgment that the debtor is delinquent and is a candidate for legal action.\"\n   <em>\n    Nielsen v.

Attorney letters prepared en masse are frequently false for want of such judgment. In order to avoid that falsehood, the attorney must have a genuine involvement in the process through which the letter was sent to the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Avila v.

She alleges Bank works with defendant on a regular basis and defendant sends out thousands of collection letters to consumers on a daily basis. Plaintiff asserts that the attorneys who purportedly sent the correspondence to plaintiff \"allow their signature to be included on hundreds of such collection letters per day without engaging in a meaningful review of the underlying account prior to determining the veracity of the representations. The lack of attorney review is evidenced by the inclusion of both Scarfone and Civelli's names on the signature line, yet only one signature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff alleges defendant violated Sections 1692e, e(3), and e(10) of the FDCPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"by sending a correspondence to Plaintiff stating it was from, and reviewed by, two attorneys. Upon information and belief, the attorneys whose signature appears on the correspondence allow their signature to be used on hundreds of collection letters on a daily basis. Based on the sheer volume of collection letters Defendant's attorneys send on a daily basis, Defendant's attorneys could not have engaged in a meaningful review of each collection letter sent and the underlying account(s) associated with those letters.\" She claims sending form collection letters said to be from an attorney when the attorney did not engage in a meaningful review of the letter or the associated account \"falsely implies that such attorney has reviewed the file and made the professional, considered determination to send the letter.\" She alleges the lack of sufficient review and exercise of attorney judgment in deciding whether to send collection letters is a violation of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The complaint further alleges that defendant violated Section 1692f\"when it unfairly and unconscionably attempted to collect on a debt\" by falsely representing to plaintiff that the letter was reviewed by multiple attorneys. Plaintiff alleges \"[b]oth Scarfone and Civelli did not review the correspondence even though it bore their signature lines.\" By doing so, it is alleged defendant \"unfairly attempted to escalate the concern over the subject consumer debt in Plaintiff's mind by suggesting multiple attorneys were handling her file. These means employed by Defendant only served to worry and confuse Plaintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, defendant argues plaintiff's complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support an inference that defendant did not provide meaningful attorney review of plaintiff's account prior to sending the letter. Defendant contends plaintiff's failure to plead any information concerning the number of letters sent from defendant's Chicago office, its process for reviewing files prior to sending collection letters, or how many attorneys are involved in the review process dooms her claim that no attorney meaningfully reviewed her account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Buchholz v.

Mich. Sept. 27, 2018)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support its argument for dismissal. In\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, Gustav Buchholz, represented by the same law firm that represents Ms. Knack-Toms in this case (Sulaiman Law Group, Ltd.), filed suit against Meyer Njus Tanick, PA (\"MNT\"), the same law firm that is the defendant in this case. At issue were two letters MNT sent to Mr. Buchholz. These letters (\"\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   Letters\") were nearly identical to the letter at issue in this case. The creditor identified in the\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   Letters is also Synchrony Bank and the text of the\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   Letters (except for the file number) is identical to the text of the letter in this case. The only difference of any note is the\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   Letters' signature blocks are both as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Meyer Njus Tanick, PA\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Kara L.

Harms\" appears in the space directly above her name and below defendant's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   court found the plaintiff had not demonstrated the defendant violated the FDCPA. Although the plaintiff had alleged the first letter he received \" 'represented that it was sent by Ms. Harms after she had engaged in meaningful review of Plaintiff's account prior to sending the letter' [record citation omitted],\n   the letter made no representation regarding a review, much less a 'meaningful review'.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204625740\">\n    2018 WL 4625740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2. The court observed that the letter \"simply states that the law firm had been retained to collect the debt, and as such, the letter was from a debt collector.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204625740\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, this view is clearly at odds with\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   which holds that the mere fact the letter \"is issued on an attorney's letterhead and over his signature conveys the notion that the attorney has directly controlled or supervised the process through which the letter was sent - i.e., that he assessed the validity of the debt, is prepared to take legal action to collect on that debt, and has, accordingly, decided that a letter should be sent to the debtor conveying that message.

Under\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , the representation of \"meaningful review\" is implicit in the letter being on an attorney's letterhead and bearing an attorney's signature and, therefore, no explicit statement that such a review occurred is required for the representation to have been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In further support of its decision that the letter did not misrepresent that a \"meaningful review\" had been performed by Attorney Harms,\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   notes that the \"letter even specifically states that if Plaintiff disputed the debt or any portion thereof, 'this firm will obtain verification of the debt or obtain a copy of a judgment and mail you a copy of such verification or judgment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Buchholz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204625740\">\n    2018 WL 4625740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2. Though the opinion does not discuss this language further, it appears the court saw the letters' statement that defendant \"will\" obtain verification of the debt as contradicting the plaintiff's claim that the letter was a representation that Attorney Harms \"had engaged in a meaningful review of Plaintiff's account prior to sending the letter[s].\" In this view, because the letter specifically stated that the firm \"\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   obtain verification of the debt\" (emphasis added)\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   \"you dispute the debt\", the letter could not be read as a representation that Attorney Harms had already reviewed the account and verified the debt prior to sending the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Again, this view is clearly at odds with\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   . The letter at issue in\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   contained virtually the same language (\"we will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment and mail a copy of such verification or judgment to you.\")\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n    307 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet,\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   held the letter was a representation that the attorney had \"assessed the validity of the debt\" and implied the attorney had \"reached a considered professional judgment that the debtor is delinquent and is a candidate for legal action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n    , at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
