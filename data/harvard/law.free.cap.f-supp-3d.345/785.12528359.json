(Doc. No. 21-2 at 12.) On June 6, 2009, he was released from the Harris County Jail into ICE custody. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 12.) On the same day, he was served with a notice to appear, ordering him to appear before an immigration judge at \"5520 Greens Road Houston, TEXAS 77032,\" on \"a date to be set\" at \"a time to be set.\" (Doc. No. 21-2 at 14.) Mr. Santiago Tzul appeared at his hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was ordered deported on June 16, 2009. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 16.) The record indicates that he was removed to Guatemala on August 12, 2009. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 19.) This removal order was reinstated twice, first on April 4, 2012, and again on April 1, 2013. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 19, 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   When Mr. Santiago Tzul was arrested in Houston on August 19, 2016, the Government again attempted to reinstate the removal order against him. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 25.) Mr. Santiago Tzul was convicted on a DWI charge and sentenced to three-years' incarceration. (Doc. No. 21-2 at 33.) At the end of his sentence, the Government filed an indictment against him for illegal reentry, which is the subject of this case. (Doc. No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is Defendant Santiago Tzul's motion to dismiss the indictment against him. (Doc. No. 13.) The Court understands Mr. Santiago Tzul's argument as follows: As a threshold matter, the statutory bar on collateral challenges to removal orders does not apply to jurisdictional arguments.

As a valid notice to appear is required to vest jurisdiction in the immigration court, the 2009 removal order is void. In the absence of a removal order, the Government cannot prove an element of the offense of illegal reentry, and the indictment must be dismissed. (Doc. No. 13.) The Government opposes this motion.

This argument relies on a regulation providing that \"[j]urisdiction vests and proceedings commence before an immigration court when a charging document is filed with the immigration court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2018).

The Government responds that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   was narrow and applied only to the circumstances before the Court in that case: \"whether a notice to appear that lacks a specific date and time for removal proceedings triggers the stop-time rule under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A).\" (Doc. No. 21 at 7.) According to the Government,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable here, because the regulation vesting jurisdiction upon filing of a proper charging document\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is governed by the\n   <em>\n    regulatory\n   </em>\n   definition of a notice to appear, which does not require inclusion of the time and place of the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

The\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   Court appeared to contemplate the potentially wide-ranging ramifications of its decision. The Court noted that \"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), at least in recent years, almost always serves noncitizens with notices that fail to specify the time, place, or date of initial removal hearings whenever the agency deems it impracticable to include such information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2111. Despite acknowledging that the practice it invalidated was overwhelmingly routine, the Court did not cabin its language, but instead stated broadly that \"[a] putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear' under section 1229(a)....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2113-14.

However, Mr. Santiago Tzul's argument is about the jurisdiction of the immigration courts, not the Supreme Court. While federal courts\n   must ensure they have jurisdiction before ruling on a dispute, there is no obligation to raise arguments\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   that would question the validity of a prior underlying judgment issued by another court entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Many of these courts found that the failure to include the time and date in the notice to appear was merely a statutory defect cured by a subsequent notice of hearing issued to the noncitizen, or by the noncitizen's appearance at the hearing. The Court finds that this analysis improperly analogizes removal orders to criminal indictments, especially in its failure to account for the substantial differences in the scope of jurisdiction between Article III and non-Article III courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, there is some support in Fifth Circuit precedent for the argument that defects in a notice to appear are curable. In\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Palacios v.

He was originally served with a notice to appear lacking a time or date for his hearing, and subsequent notice was returned as undeliverable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429287\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/354/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There are several important differences between\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Palacios\n   </em>\n   and the issue before the Court. First, the standard of review in\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Palacios\n   </em>\n   was \"a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429287\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/354/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429287\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/354/\">\n    at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second,\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Palacios\n   </em>\n   held only that a second notice of hearing may cure a defect in the original notice to appear for the purposes of the statutory notice requirement, without mentioning jurisdiction. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Gomez-Palacios\n   </em>\n   presents no bar to granting Mr. Santiago Tzul relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Mauricio-Benitez\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit denied a petition for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") which refused to reopen a proceeding in which the noncitizen claimed he never received actual notice of his removal hearing due to a typo in his mailing address.\n   <em>\n    Mauricio-Benitez v.

In that footnote, the court characterized\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   as deciding only \"whether a[n] NTA that does not specify the time or place of the removal hearing triggers the 'stop-time rule' for purposes of a cancellation of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519135\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/144/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, the court emphasized that \"cancellation and reopening are two entirely different proceedings under immigration law with different standards of review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519135\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/144/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 148 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government interprets this footnote as confining\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   to the context of cancellation of removal and the stop-time rule. The Court disagrees. The discussion of different standards of review assumes that there is a valid judgment to which appellate courts can defer. It does not appear that the parties presented any arguments about jurisdictional deficiencies in this case, and the court was under no obligation to decide\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   whether the immigration court had jurisdiction, since it need only be concerned with its own jurisdiction to decide the case at hand. This difference is critical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's time-and-place requirement applies to the regulation vesting jurisdiction in an immigration court.
