As to\n   both claims, Plaintiff seeks $2,172,285.23 in money damages, plus prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. Colonial, in turn, brings a variety of counterclaims against ACC and asserts that it incurred losses in the amount of $723,049.14 to finish the project that ACC failed to complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After denying Defendants' motion for summary judgment, the court conducted a five-day bench trial in March 2018. After the bench trial concluded, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as briefs in rebuttal. The court held a final oral argument on June 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1), the court now makes its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The court has reviewed the parties' submissions, carefully considered the evidence presented at trial, weighed the credibility of the witnesses, and applied the applicable law. For the reasons set forth below, the court has determined that Plaintiff has met its burden of proof with respect to its Miller Act claim against Colonial and its breach of contract claim against Hirani. On the other hand, the court finds that Defendant Colonial has not sustained its burden of proof on its counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, the court will enter final judgment in favor of ACC. It will formally do so, however, only after ACC submits a final damages calculation that is consistent with these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To provide clarity and context for these findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court provides a brief overview of the undisputed facts underlying this case and then summarizes the case's procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2010, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"USACE\") issued a solicitation for bids to construct a levee wall across 17th Street, N.W. in the District of Columbia, south of Constitution Avenue, N.W. (the \"Project\"). Flanked on the west side by the National World War II Memorial and on the east side by the Washington Monument, the 380-foot-long levee wall was designed to prevent the Potomac River from flooding across the National Mall into downtown Washington, D.C. As designed, the 17th Street levee wall consists of two permanent stone-clad levee stem wall sections, one on the east side and the other on the west side of 17th Street, which sit on a curved grade beam foundation supported by twenty-four reinforced concrete caissons running underground across the street. The grade beam foundation running across 17th Street contains eight \"post pockets.\" In the event of a 100-year flood, these pockets are filled with an eight-foot-tall temporary metal post and aluminum panel system that connect to the east and west levee stem walls to block surging floodwaters. The images below illustrate the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Images: completed stone-clad levee stem walls (Source Pl.'s Ex. 5)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Drawing of 17th Street levee (Source: Washington Post)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a bid process, on September 16, 2010, the USACE awarded Hirani the contract (\"the Prime Contract\") to construct the 17th Street levee wall for the amount of $3,833,097.00. The USACE subsequently awarded \"Option 1\" to Hirani on December 16, 2010, requiring Hirani to install stone veneer cladding and coping on the permanent levee walls for $641,369.00. As required by Hirani's contract with the USACE, Colonial issued performance and payment bonds on behalf of Hirani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 4, 2011, ACC and Hirani entered into a fixed-price subcontract (\"the Subcontract\") for $2,845,600.00, under which ACC agreed to perform most, but not all, of Hirani's obligations under the Prime Contract. ACC began performing under the Subcontract a week later, and Hirani subsequently subcontracted Option 1 to ACC in the amount of $613,650.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ensuing years on the Project were beset by a series of delays, modifications to the scope of the Project, and work-related disputes. By letter dated April 26, 2013, two-and-a-half years after it awarded the Prime Contract to Hirani, the USACE gave notice of its intent to terminate Hirani. In the days following Hirani's termination, ACC left the Project site. The USACE subsequently made a demand against the Performance Bond issued by Colonial, and Colonial stepped in to complete\n   the Project. With the assistance of Loewke Brill, a consulting firm, Colonial contracted with Akima Construction Services, LLC, Lorton Stone, LLC, and Structural Stone, LLC, to complete the Project, including Option 1, and did so around November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ACC filed suit in this court against Hirani and Colonial on April 29, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. Colonial responded by filing four counterclaims against ACC: (1) two for breach of contract, one as assignee of Hirani and one as surety; (2) one for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) one for interference with contractual relations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Colonial's Answer &amp; Countercls., ECF No. 8. With leave of court, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on February 16, 2016, asserting two claims: (1) breach of contract against Hirani, and (2) a payment demand under the Miller Act against Colonial, premised on the payment bond Colonial issued in connection with the Prime Contract. Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint sought\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   damages in the amount of $2,070,185.23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Compl., ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following discovery, Defendants jointly filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and a Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Jury Demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 44; Defs.' Mot. to Strike Jury Demand, ECF No. 45.

Op., ECF No. 54; Order, ECF No. 55. Following a delay in the proceedings, the parties appeared for a Pretrial Conference on February 23, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pretrial Conf. Hrg. Tr.

In that full-time role, Ms. Stephen was expected to maintain a presence at the Project site; to assist with the scheduling, reviewing, checking, and certifying of all submittals and shop drawings; and to draft and submit daily logs memorializing the status of the Project site, known as \"Contractors Daily Quality Control Reports,\" or QCRs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 77 at 16-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    125.\n   </strong>\n   As a fact witness, Ms. Stephen testified about her personal knowledge and observations as Hirani's on-site Contractor Quality Control Administrator from the time Hirani and ACC executed the Subcontract to the end of ACC's presence on the Project site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    126.\n   </strong>\n   The court found Ms. Stephen's testimony as a fact witness to be credible. Ms. Stephen possessed a strong memory and excellent recall of the events, which she witnessed first-hand as a representative of Hirani on the Project. Ms. Stephen is the only witness called during trial who was present on the Project site nearly every day, and the court found her testimony regarding progress on the Project site to be reliable and helpful. To the extent that Ms. Stephen's testimony regarding the state of affairs on the Project may be biased by her interest in the outcome of the litigation, the court is assured that the testimony of Ms. Stephen it relies on is also substantiated by record evidence admitted at trial and other witness testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    127.\n   </strong>\n   As an expert witness, Ms. Stephen offered her opinion on the reasonable markup for the highway and heavy construction industry and project overhead in the District of Columbia area from 2011 to 2013.

Mr. Hirani was defensive and hostile in answering questions posed by ACC's counsel on direct examination, and often responded that he could not recall or did not remember key events central to the dispute between Hirani and ACC and to Hirani's termination from the Project. Mr. Hirani spent little time at the Project site, and there was little documentary evidence presented to corroborate Mr. Hirani's version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    132.\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Hirani testified that he personally asked ACC to submit scheduling information \"50 to 100 times\" and that, each time, ACC refused to submit the information upon demand, as required by the Subcontract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    133.\n   </strong>\n   The court does not credit Mr. Hirani's testimony with regard to ACC's role in the scheduling of the Project. Mr. Hirani was unable to articulate how and when he asked ACC for these scheduling updates, nor how and when ACC rejected or ignored his requests. Moreover, Mr. Hirani's assertion that he unsuccessfully asked ACC for scheduling information \"50 to 100 times\" is unsupported by any record evidence, such as correspondence or emails with ACC. The first such correspondence is dated February 18, 2013, almost two years after the parties entered into the Subcontract. The lack of such records, when the Project otherwise was heavily documented, leads the court to find that ACC did not refuse to submit scheduling information as claimed by Mr. Hirani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    134.\n   </strong>\n   Michael Vogt is an executive vice president of the construction consulting firm, Loewke Brill Consulting Group.

Mr. Vogt testified as a fact witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    135.\n   </strong>\n   As a fact witness, Mr. Vogt testified about his personal knowledge and observations about the completion of the Project following Hirani's termination, including the status of the Project after ACC left the site, and the hiring of Akima Construction and other subcontractors to complete the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    136.\n   </strong>\n   The court found Mr. Vogt to be a credible witness.

Mr. Janeiro testified honestly and helpfully regarding ACC's work on Option 1, Janeiro's involvement in locating suitable stones for cladding and coping of the permanent levee walls, and resolution of the geometry \"bust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    139.\n   </strong>\n   Robert Franklin is a project engineer for the USACE who was tasked with management and oversight of the Project. Day 5 A.M. Tr. at 24:1-24:22. Mr. Franklin testified as a fact witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    140.\n   </strong>\n   As a fact witness, Mr. Franklin specifically testified about progress (or lack thereof) on the Project from January through April 2013, as well as the decision\n   to terminate Hirani. Mr. Franklin asserted that Hirani was terminated in part because ACC failed to progress the work on the Project beginning in mid-March 2013 due to disputes between ACC and Hirani regarding payment. Mr. Franklin also asserted that the USACE\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   prohibit ACC and Hirani from continuing field operations at the Project due to inadequate on-site supervision by Hirani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    141.\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Franklin testified to the best of recollection, but he had difficulty accurately recalling details of the Project during the critical time period of mid-March 2013 through early May 2013. The record evidence refutes key portions of Mr. Franklin's testimony, most notably his testimony that (1) the USACE had not ordered ACC to stop work in April 2013 because of the absence of a Hirani on-site Project manager and (2) ACC had essentially ceased doing productive work during this period without cause. The court therefore does not credit Mr. Franklin's testimony to the extent it was inconsistent with record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    142.\n   </strong>\n   Although he did not testify, the court accepted for their truth statements made by Eric Hirani, as reflected in correspondence prepared by ACC or in ACC's Daily Reports.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88, 100, 104.

First, Colonial maintains that ACC failed to progress the work on the Project after ACC demanded, but did not receive, payment for Requisition No. 19 from Hirani, in violation of Paragraph 14.1 of the Subcontract. Second, Colonial claims that ACC breached Paragraph 2.2 of the Subcontract by failing to provide Hirani with scheduling information. According to Colonial, these material breaches of the Subcontract caused the USACE to terminate Hirani and to make a claim against the Performance\n   Bond issued by Colonial. The court considers each of these alleged breaches in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    A. ACC Did Not Fail to Substantially Progress the Work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Under Paragraph 14.1, ACC agreed that, in the event a \"dispute, controversy[,] or question\" arose in the interpretation of the Subcontract, ACC would not stop or delay performance of the Work or delivery of labor or material, but would continue to work \"pending the determination of such dispute or controversy.\" Subcontract at Art. XIV, \u00a7 14.1. Relying on the testimony provided by Robert Franklin, Colonial asserts that ACC violated Paragraph 14.1 of the Subcontract by delaying work on the Project because of its ongoing dispute with Hirani regarding non-payment of Requisition 19.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' FOF &amp; COL at 35-37. According to Colonial, once engaged in this payment dispute, ACC unilaterally suspended operations at the Project site after David Lussier's resignation and failed to perform any critical work to progress the project from March 2013 through Hirani's termination on April 26, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Based on the record evidence and the testimony of witnesses at trial, the court rejects Colonial's view of the final months of the Project. Because ACC did not unilaterally suspend operations on the Project from April 15 through April 22, 2013, and because it progressed the available work during the relevant period, the court concludes that ACC did not breach Paragraph 14.1 of the Subcontract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <em>\n    1. The April 2013 Shutdown Was Not Unilateral\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Colonial's claim that ACC unilaterally suspended operations on the Project following David Lussier's resignation lacks record support. The court has found that the Project site shutdown from April 15 through April 22, 2013, was caused by Hirani's failure to provide competent field supervision as ordered by USACE.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-89. Contemporaneous business records in the form of ACC's Daily Reports, Hirani's QCRs, and correspondence between ACC and Hirani confirm that the shutdown was due to Hirani's failure to provide on-site supervision. Notably, one Daily Report reflects that Eric Hirani informed ACC that it could resume work upon Hirani's hiring of an on-site Project manager, and that he planned the on-site manager's start date to coincide with the first day that the work resumed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 31 at 918. Moreover, it is simply implausible that ACC could have unilaterally shut down the Project without a single record documenting or protesting such a shut down. Had ACC acted as Colonial insists, surely there would exist in the record at least one piece of paper from either Hirani, the USACE, or the National Park Service reflecting or objecting to ACC's complete work stoppage. But there is no such record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that ACC did not breach the Subcontract by unilaterally shutting down the Project site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <em>\n    2. ACC Progressed Work on the Project\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Relying predominately on Robert Franklin's testimony, Colonial maintains that certain critical path items were available to ACC to complete from mid-March 2013 until Hirani's termination, but that ACC did only meaningless work and willfully delayed progress on the Project because of the payment dispute. This contention lacks sufficient evidentiary support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Mr. Franklin testified that the following \"critical path\" work was available to ACC, but not performed, during the time period of mid-March 2013 through April 2013: (1) installing the stone on the stem walls; (2) working on the grade beam sections between caissons 12 and 13, and caissons 13\n   and 14; and (3) trimming the east-side grade beam pursuant to Modification BJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 5 A.M. Tr. at 26:20-28:2, 36:18-37:7. Despite Mr. Franklin's forthright demeanor at trial, the court does not credit Mr. Franklin's recollection about the work available to ACC during the relevant time period because it is directly contradicted by record evidence. Each item identified by Mr. Franklin as \"available\" to ACC after March 2013 was actually unavailable due to delays and events beyond ACC's control, or ACC actually performed the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   First, contrary to Mr. Franklin's testimony, ACC could not even begin to cut the stone required to complete Option 1 until March 21, 2013, when Mr. Franklin responded to RFI No. 122 and approved the use of two-inch thick stone cladding and a joint width of three-eighths inch. Pl.'s Ex. 43 at 262. Critically, upon receiving this approval, on March 26, 2013, Ed Hollander submitted to Hirani and the USACE, including Mr. Franklin, an \"aggressive\" schedule to move forward on Option 1, with a projected completion date at the end of July 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 139. The schedule contemplated mid-April as the earliest time for installing the stone-work that would be done by Janeiro, not ACC-and that most of that work would occur after May 1.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Before May 1, nearly all the stone cladding-related work was to be done off-site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (showing design, fabrication, and delivery work prior to May 1). Thus, there was little available stone work at the Project site itself during the period that Mr. Franklin claimed ACC was not progressing the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Second, from February 24, 2013, through April 16, 2013, the National Cherry Blossom Festival prevented ACC from performing work in and on 17th Street-the precise location of the grade beam supported by Caissons 12, 13, and 14. In other words, because ACC did not have access to the roadway for seven weeks in the spring of 2013, ACC could not work on the grade beam sections between caissons 12 and 13, and 13 and 14, as Mr. Franklin recalled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   And finally, Mr. Franklin's testimony that ACC did not perform the work required by Change Order BJ, or \"even begin to cut the grade beam\" on the east side of 17th Street, was plainly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 5 A.M. Tr. at 28:5-28:16. Photographs show ACC excavated and cut the east side grade beam on April 26, 2013, as required by Change Order BJ. Pl. Ex. 1 at 84-85. Moreover, it is noteworthy that while Change Order BJ was issued to Hirani for $59,033,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 123 at 5, upon Akima's completion of Change Order BJ, Akima was paid only $9,115.33,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 98 (line 87). Those different amounts make clear that ACC did the bulk of the work required to complete Change Order BJ before Akima came on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   In summary, ACC's final six weeks on the job was beset with delays and work stoppages that were beyond ACC's control. When ACC\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   work it did. Therefore, the court rejects Colonial's assertion that ACC failed to progress the Project in violation of the Subcontract's dispute clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ACC Did Not Fail to Provide Scheduling Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Colonial next argues that ACC violated Paragraph 2.2 of the Subcontract by failing to timely provide essential scheduling information in the form required by Hirani. Paragraph 2.2 required ACC, \"if requested,\" to \"furnish all scheduling information in such form and detail as required by [Hirani], to the satisfaction [of] [Hirani],\" within seven days of the request. Subcontract at \u00a7 2.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   As the court already has found,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-33, Mr. Hirani's insistence that he demanded scheduling information from ACC \"50 to 100 times\" is not credible. Mr. Hirani was unable to articulate how and when he asked ACC for these scheduling updates, nor how and when ACC rejected his requests. Additionally, there is no evidence that Hirani made any written demand for scheduling information prior to Hirani's letters to ACC dated February 18, 2013, and March 22, 2013. Not by coincidence, Hirani sent these letters only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the USACE issued Hirani a Cure Notice on February 14 of that year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Exs. 54, 62. Nor is there any evidence of any demand by Hirani that ACC submit scheduling information in a form conducive to creating a \"Primavera\" schedule-a type of scheduling software-as Colonial now suggests was required.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   . Defs.' Rebuttal at 7 \u00b6 56. This absence of evidence leads the court to conclude that ACC did not repeatedly refuse Hirani's scheduling demands, as Colonial maintains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The record evidence, in fact, supports the conclusion that ACC\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   regularly provide scheduling information to Hirani, in the form of (1) outlines of work already performed on site,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 29; and (2) three week \"look-ahead\" schedules,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 41; as well as (3) the Option 1 schedule, Pl.'s Ex. 139.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Rebuttal at 7 \u00b6 56 (conceding receipt of the listed scheduling information). Hirani's QCRs also provided daily updates on the work's progress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 30. Other than Mr. Hirani's incredible testimony, Colonial presented no evidence of any expressed dissatisfaction with these forms of scheduling information prior to February 2013. ACC thus did not violate Paragraph 2.2 of the Subcontract by failing to provide scheduling information to Hirani, as requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the court concludes that Colonial has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that ACC breached the Subcontract. Therefore, as to Colonial's counterclaims, the court finds in favor of ACC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ACC'S CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Having concluded that ACC did not breach the Subcontract, the court proceeds to ACC's Miller Act and breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Mem. Op. at 16-18. Evaluating these approaches in light of the Miller Act's statutory text and broad remedial purpose, the court concluded that, in order to avoid engaging in a \"subjective line-drawing exercise,\" it would \"simply look to the contract to determine for what tasks the parties agreed the subcontractor would be compensated, then determine the last date on which the subcontractor supplied materials or labor for one of those tasks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensel Phelps Constr.

Accordingly, to determine whether ACC brought a timely Miller Act claim, the court must: \"(1) identify the compensable tasks to which the parties agreed, as set forth in the subcontract, and (2) determine the last date on which labor was performed or materials were supplied for any one of those tasks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The court concludes that ACC timely filed its Miller Act claim on April 29, 2014. ACC last performed compensable work under the Subcontract on May 1, 2013, when it (1) backfilled the east side grade beam cutting hole along the curb line, as required by Change Order BJ, and (2) supplied equipment to perform that work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 123 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Subcontract at Sch. B., Pt. 14 (providing that ACC \"shall provide all grading including all excavation &amp; backfill as per the plans and specifications\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reaches this conclusion based on the following record evidence: (1) photographs of the Project site depicting the east side grade beam area during the relevant time period; (2) the testimony of Ms. Stephen; and (3) the daily reports of ACC and Hirani, which recorded the events that took place on the Project site on May 1, 2013. This evidence is described further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Colonial contends that ACC's backfilling of the east side grade beam area does not constitute compensable work performed within the applicable limitations period for two reasons: (1) no photographic evidence or eyewitness testimony establishes that ACC actually backfilled the area on May 1, 2013; and (2) even if backfilling did occur on that date, backfilling of the east side grade beam area is not compensable under the Subcontract or Change Order BJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' FOF &amp; COL at 41-44; Defs.' Rebuttal at 30-31 \u00b6 8. The court finds neither of these arguments convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <em>\n    1. On What Date Did ACC Backfill the East Side Grade Beam?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   As to its first argument, Colonial insists that ACC has not shown that compensable work took place on May 1, 2013, because ACC failed to come forward with any photographic or firsthand testimonial evidence that backfilling occurred on that date. The absence of such\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   evidence, Colonial says, means that such work could have been performed on April 27, 28, or 29 (outside the one-year limitations period) or even by someone other than ACC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' FOF &amp; COL at 48.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The flaw in Colonial's position is that ACC presented sufficient\n   <em>\n    circumstantial\n   </em>\n   evidence to show that it backfilled the east side grade beam area on May 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See Standardized Civil Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2.03 (2018) (\"The law says that both direct and circumstantial evidence are acceptable as a means of proving a fact. The law does not favor one form of evidence over another.\"). Colonial points out that Ms. Stephen was not present on the Project site on May 1, 2013, due to illness. But her observations as to what occurred on the days before and after May 1, 2013, establish that backfilling took place on that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 2 A.M. at 58:21-62:12. Ms. Stephen testified that she was at the Project site on April 26 when ACC excavated the east side grade beam. She further knew that ACC had performed no work on the site from April 27 through April 30, in part because of rain.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276139\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/267/#p274\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When she returned to the Project site on May 2, Ms. Stephen stated, she observed that the east side grade beam area that previously had been excavated was now backfilled, leading her to conclude that the work had been performed the day before.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276139\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/267/#p274\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though this testimony qualifies as circumstantial evidence, it nevertheless shows that ACC backfilled the east side grade beam area on May 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See Standardized Civil Jury Instructions\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2.03 (overnight falling of snow example).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Other evidence corroborates Ms. Stephen's recollections. Photographs taken on April 26, 2013, depict the exposed east side grade beam area covered with plywood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 172 at 1-5. Then, photographs taken on May 2, 2013, depict the previously exposed areas now backfilled,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Day 5 A.M. Tr. at 66:4-66:7 (Robert Franklin reviewing these photos and testifying that the area portrayed on April 26, 2013, covered with plywood is the same area shown backfilled on May 2, 2013). In between these two dates, both Hirani's QCRs and ACC's Daily Reports confirm that ACC did no work from April 27 to April 30.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 30 at 910-912; Pl.'s Ex. 31 at 925-30 (no reports for April 27 and April 28, which were a Saturday and Sunday; reports for April 29 and April 30 indicate no work due to, at times, \"heavy\" rains). Therefore, the backfilling must have occurred on the first day after\n   April 26 that ACC worked on the Project site, which was May 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Though there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support that finding, there is also\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   evidence. Hirani's QCR for May 1, 2013, states under the heading \"Activities in Progress\": \"Backfill east side grade beam.\" Pl.'s Ex. 30 at 913. ACC's Daily Report is to the same effect. It memorializes that the east side grade beam areas, temporarily covered with plywood the previous week, were backfilled on May 1: \"Backfill remaining East Side Grade Beam cutting hole along curb line at East Side of project; Remove that covering lumber and plywood and take to staging yard.\" Pl.'s Ex. 31 at 931-32. These records thus corroborate the logical inference the court draws from Ms. Stephen's testimony and the photographs taken on April 26 and May 2, 2013, namely, that ACC backfilled the east side grade beam area on May 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Accordingly, based on the foregoing evidence, the court finds that ACC's \"last of the labor [ ] performed,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203133\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), occurred on a date within the one-year limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <em>\n    2. Was Backfilling Compensable Work under the Subcontract?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Next, Colonial argues that, even if backfilling occurred on May 1, 2013, ACC's Miller Act claim is still untimely. According to Colonial, because Change Order BJ does not expressly identify \"backfilling\" as a covered task,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 123 at 4, it was not compensable work under the Subcontract. Therefore, the day on which backfilling occurred under Change Order BJ, May 1, 2013, cannot qualify as the \"last of the labor [ ] performed\" for purposes of the one-year limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   By pressing this argument, Colonial demands a literal reading of Change Order BJ that defies common sense. Change Order BJ provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   The contractor shall supply the labor, equipment, and materials to trim the concrete and the rebar from the east side grade beam in accordance with the drawings that were provided with the RFP. The top of the grade beam should be saw cut to create a clean cut line across the top. The rebar will be removed to a depth of 1? below the concrete surface. Non-shrink epoxy mortar will be used to repair the concrete surface\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   The grade beam modification will only occur in the areas where the grass meets the grade beam. The grade beam will not be modified in the areas where the roadway and sidewalk meet the grade beam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Pl.'s Ex. 123 at 4. To be sure, the text of Change Order BJ does not expressly address backfilling. But common sense leads to the conclusion that, to complete Change Order BJ, ACC not only had to excavate the ground and cut the grade beam, but it also had to backfill the open hole. Surely, the USACE would not have accepted Change Order BJ as complete if ACC had walked away with a gaping hole in the ground along the path of the grade beam, leaving the grade beam exposed. A common sense reading of Change Order BJ therefore supports the conclusion that it encompassed backfilling as compensable work.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keepseagle v. Perdue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276948\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1039/#p1047\">\n    856 F.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047 (D.C.

But Change Order AY does not help Colonial's cause. Change Order AY, issued on the same date as Change Order BJ, pertains\n   to electrical wiring for the west side.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 123 at 3-4. Change Order AY requires the contractor to \"provide all labor, materials, and equipment to install the electrical wiring and conduit on the west side of 17th Street\" and further provides that \"[t]he existing soil (minus organics and large rocks), will be used to backfill the excavation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. As the quoted text demonstrates, the USACE expressly provided for backfilling in the context of Change Order AY because such backfilling was to be performed in a specific manner using specific materials. By contrast, the absence of a similar instruction in Change Order BJ does not mean that backfilling of the excavated east side grade beam was outside the scope of the modification; rather, it suggests only that the USACE did not require the contractor to use any particular material for that purpose. Colonial's reliance on Change Order AY is therefore unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Finally, it is notable that, after Hirani's termination, Akima received compensation for backfilling as part of its work to complete cutting the east side grade beam.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 171 at 4, 8 (invoice from Akima subcontractor, Asher Construction, Inc., describing work of excavating along the grade beam, coating the beam, \"and backfill\"). As Mr. Vogt testified, Akima's scope of work under the Akima Subcontract did not exceed ACC's work under its Subcontract with Hirani.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 4 A.M. at 77:13-77:16. Akima's receipt of compensation for backfilling the excavated east side grade beam area is further proof that backfilling was a compensable activity under Change Order BJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   In view of the foregoing, the court concludes that ACC has satisfactorily shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it performed compensable work under the Subcontract within one year of filing its Miller Act claim on April 29, 2014. Furthermore, ACC has established that (1) it \"furnished labor or material in carrying out work provided for in a contract for which payment bond is furnished under section 3131\" and (2) it was not \"paid in full within 90 days.\" 40 U.S.C. 3133. The court therefore will enter judgment in favor of ACC on its Miller Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Count I of the Second Amended Complaint seeks relief against Hirani for breach of contract. ACC asserts that Hirani breached the Subcontract by: (a) failing to pay ACC for work performed after November 21, 2012, through May 1, 2013; (b) failing to provide constant Project on-site supervision; (c) failing to update the baseline schedule per contract requirements so as to demonstrate the effect of the government's responsibility for causes of delay; and/or (d) causing the Prime Contract with the USACE to be terminated on April 26, 2013, due to Hirani's failure to provide updated schedules and failure to pay ACC for work performed for the last five months of its subcontract performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s FOF &amp; COL at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   For essentially the same reasons already discussed, the court finds in favor of ACC on its breach of contract cause of action against Hirani. Put simply, Hirani breached the Subcontract by refusing to pay ACC for the work that it performed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81, and Hirani had no valid justification for doing so. The court therefore will enter judgment in favor of ACC on its breach of contract claim against Hirani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     REMEDIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Having determined the outcome of ACC's claims and Colonial's counterclaims,\n   the court moves on to determine an appropriate damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Equitable Adjustment Under the Federal Acquisition Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   The court first considers Defendants' assertion that ACC is barred from recovering more than the original price of the Subcontract because ACC provided Hirani no notice of any request for an equitable adjustment within 30 days of receipt of any change order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' FOF &amp; COL at 48. Under what is known as the \"Changes Clause,\" federal regulations provide that a \"[c]ontractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written [change] order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2052.243-1\">\n    48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.243-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Subcontract 4.1 (stating that the \"subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that it shall make no claim for extra or additional compensation on account of any such work,\" unless authorized in writing by Hirani). Because ACC did not comply with the Changes Clause, Defendants maintain, ACC cannot recover costs associated with any of the change orders. The court rejects this argument for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   First, even if the Changes Clause is incorporated into the Subcontract\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   -ACC does not contend otherwise-the Clause on its face does not apply as between a prime contractor and subcontractor. The Clause provides that a \"Contractor\" must assert its right of adjustment within 30 days after receipt of a change order or other written notice by \"submitting to the Contracting Officer a written statement describing the general nature and amount of proposal, unless this period is extended by the Government.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2052.243-4\">\n    48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.243-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The references in the regulation to \"Contractor,\" \"Contracting Officer,\" and \"Government\" make clear that the Changes Clause concerns a change to the prime contract, that is, the agreement the between the prime contractor and the United States. It does not impose any notice requirements on a subcontractor of the prime contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The very case that Defendants rely upon,\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Sequoia Electric, LLC v. Guarantee Co. of N.A.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:14-cv-2045 JCM (VCF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201320042\">\n    2018 WL 1320042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Nev. March 14, 2018), is consistent with this interpretation. There, the court held the subcontractor could not obtain an equitable adjustment because it had failed to make a timely request to the prime contractor within 10 days, as required under the\n   <em>\n    subcontract.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The court observed that the 10-day period was included in the subcontract to allow enough time for the\n   <em>\n    prime contractor\n   </em>\n   to submit its right of adjustment to the government within 30 days\n   <em>\n    to the government\n   </em>\n   , as required under the Changes Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 &amp; n.2 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Ga. Mar. 29, 2013) (similarly interpreting a 14-day notice obligation contained in a subcontract \"so that [the prime contractor] could then satisfy any obligations it may have had with the Corps\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conner Bros.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Sequoia Electric\n   </em>\n   's discussion of the subcontractor's obligations refers only to the notice requirement of the subcontract, not the Changes Clause. Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that the Changes Clause extends to a subcontractor like ACC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Second, even if the Changes Clause applies as between Hirani and ACC, Defendants have shown no prejudice from the purported absence of notice. Although the regulation contains a time limit for providing notice, \"[w]ritten notice as to constructive changes must be supplied by the contractor before such time that the Government would suffer if not apprised of the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    K-Con Bldg.

Thus, \"[i]f the contracting officials have knowledge of the facts or problems that form the basis of a claim and are able to perform necessary fact-finding and decisionmaking, the Government is not prejudiced by the contractor's failure to submit a precise claim at the time a constructive change occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4103827\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/100/8/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, Defendants do not dispute (nor could they) that Hirani was on notice of the various change orders issued by the USACE. Moreover, as to unanticipated site conditions or design defects, Hirani had actual knowledge of them because Ms. Stephen, as Hirani's representative, was present on the site every day. Hirani also received constructive notice of unexpected developments through, among other records, the QCRs, correspondence from Ed Hollander, and three-week look-ahead schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Rebuttal \u00b6\u00b6 120-126 (listing examples of such records). Thus, to the extent Defendants now claim that they suffered prejudice from a purported lack of notice because it precluded\n   <em>\n    them\n   </em>\n   from seeking an equitable adjustment from the USACE,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' FOF &amp; COL at 48, that assertion simply is not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Markup on Direct Expenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   A substantial portion of the damages that ACC seeks-$1,190,079.59-consists\n   of \"[r]easonable gross markup of ACC's performance throughout the Project from April 2011 through May 1, 2013[.]\" Pl.'s FOF &amp; COL at 59 \u00b6 262. Ms. Stephen testified that, when ACC submitted its bid to Hirani, it included a 35% markup of its direct costs, a percentage that she described was \"not untypical\" within the civil construction industry in the Washington, D.C., area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 2 PM at 85:8-86:1. Defendants object to the 35% markup, asserting that Ms. Stephen's testimony was not sufficient to support that percentage as an industry norm. Defs.' Rebuttal \u00b6\u00b6 261-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   The court finds that the 35% markup as a component of Plaintiff's damages calculation is reasonable and consistent with the industry standard in this locality. To be certain, evidence that the 35% markup was customary came largely from Ms. Stephen. But her testimony was sufficient to sustain Plaintiff's burden for several reasons. First, the court accepted Ms. Stephen's testimony not only as a percipient witness, but also as an expert in cost accounting in the heavy and highway civil construction and found her to be credible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 123-24, 127-28. Second, Ms. Stephen's testimony concerning the reasonableness of the 35% was based on her experience in the industry, including her work as a consultant for other companies which gave her access to their books and records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 2 PM at 86:1-86:22. That experience allowed Ms. Stephen to testify credibly, and with actual knowledge, that others in the industry charged a higher markup than ACC.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Third, Ms. Stephen's testimony was corroborated in part by independent data from an industry publication. During her testimony, Ms. Stephen referenced the industry publication RS Means Site Work &amp; Landscape Cost Data,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. Pl.'s Ex. 7, which reported an \"Average Fixed Overhead\" cost in the industry of 16.3% during 2010,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. That average is in line with the 17.5% overhead figure that ACC used when it bid the Project. Finally, Ms. Stephen's expert opinion concerning the reasonableness of the 35% was not rebutted by any contrary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   For these reasons, ACC provided satisfactory proof justifying a 35% markup of recoverable direct expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Equipment Standby Expenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   ACC seeks $138,135.34 in damages for costs related to its idle equipment at the Project site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 36. According to ACC, that figure represents \"the standby costs of having its owned equipment idling at the site as part of the reasonable value of ACC's owned equipment furnished in connection with the Project.\" Pl.'s Rebuttal \u00b6 140. That figure does not represent, ACC says, \"rental or use value of the equipment, which represents opportunities to create profits by using the equipment left idling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants assert that standby equipment expenses are not available under the Miller Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' FOF &amp; COL at 49-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The parties agree that the D.C. Circuit has not addressed whether idling or standby time for owned equipment is recoverable under the Miller Act. So, both parties cite various out-of-circuit authorities to support their respective positions, but none provides a clear answer. Defendants, for instance, rely on a host of cases that stand for the proposition that the rental value of a contractor's equipment is not recoverable under the Miller Act during periods of delay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

ACC, on the other hand, relies primarily on a 1972 case from the Middle District of Tennessee, in which the court stated that \"[t]he fair rental value of equipment used on the project is covered by the Miller Act payment bond even though the equipment may be idle at times during the period of the lease.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

These cases are not on point, however, because ACC seeks not rental value, but the standby costs of its own equipment for\n   <em>\n    all purposes\n   </em>\n   . ACC makes no distinction as to the reason for a piece of equipment's non-use, whether it remained idle because of project delays or because of a lack of need on a given day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 36 (calculating value of standby costs for each piece of equipment for the days each piece of equipment was on the Project site). The cited cases do not address whether such costs are recoverable under the Miller Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   The court thus returns to first principles. The Miller Act allows a contractor who \"furnish[es] labor or material in carrying out work provided for in a contract\" to sue on a payment bond.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203133\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(a). \"[T]he language of the statute, interpreted in light of its protective purpose, provides the analytical key to determining whether the supplier can recover under the Miller Act.\"\n   <em>\n    T.M.S. Mech. Contractors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526202\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/946/#p952\">\n    942 F.2d at 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Viewed through this lens, it is apparent that standby time cannot be viewed as an indivisible whole. Consider two scenarios. In the first a contractor brings a piece of equipment to the work site and uses it over a period of weeks but not on each day during those weeks. In the second, the contractor brings that same piece of equipment to the site, but it remains idle for 60 days before it is used. In the former case, the equipment reasonably can be treated as \"furnished\" \"in carrying out work\" even on those days it is in non-use. After all, the contractor cannot reasonably be expected to remove equipment from the site for every period of idle time between uses. The same does not hold true for the second scenario, however. If a contractor brings a piece of equipment to the job site and it sits unused for two months, absent some reasonable explanation for its non-use during such an extended period, the contractor cannot be said to have \"furnished\" the equipment \"in carrying out work.\" The equipment cost is compensable in the first case, but not the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   The challenge the court faces here is that, in calculating costs for standby time, ACC has not distinguished between these two scenarios. It seeks, for instance, the standby costs for a hydraulic breaker, which it brought to the site on April 11, 2011, but used for the very first time on March 6\n   <em>\n    of the following year\n   </em>\n   , and intermittently thereafter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 36 at 1-10. Similarly, ACC seeks full standby costs for a \"C12 Trailer\" brought to the site on April 11, 2011, yet used only six times during the entire life of the project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526202\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/946/#p952\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, ACC asks to be compensated for a \"Cat 325/Rev Drill\" brought to the site on December 27, 2011, used for six days in January 2012, but only once more for the remainder of the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-10. Not all equipment was used so infrequently, however. Take the \"Cat 236.\" It arrived at the site on December 11, 2017, and was used regularly until the end of the job, though not every day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-10. The same is generally true of the \"Cat 430,\" though ACC did not use it for nearly six\n   weeks after it first arrived and for multiple extended periods of time thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   ACC's indiscriminate demand for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   standby costs cannot be sustained under the Miller Act. A plaintiff seeking\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   as a measure of damages \"has the burden of showing facts and circumstances sufficient to justify the inference of an implied promise to pay for the services or materials in question and of proving the amount and value thereof to a reasonable degree of certainty or by a preponderance of the evidence.\" 66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution and Implied Contracts \u00a7 87 (2d ed.)

With respect to pieces of equipment that were present at the site and used with regularity, awarding the costs of standby time is consistent with the text and purposes of the Miller Act. The same cannot be said, however, of equipment that idled at the site for extended periods of time without any explanation (e.g., the hydraulic breaker). At most, ACC offered evidence that it decided to keep equipment on site \"in case [ACC] need[ed] it.\" Day 3 A.M. Trial Tr. 112:8-23.

Hollander was the President of ACC and an engineer by training. Trial Tr. Day 1 A.M. Session at 64:18-65:18. He was a daily presence at the worksite,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 31, and he wore many hats. According to Ms. Stephen, Hollander functioned as project manager, superintendent, and estimator for ACC. Day 3 A.M. Tr. at 101:19-22. He had a work space in the on-site trailer, Day 1 A.M. Tr. at 61:15-18, and his specific tasks included drafting the daily reports, writing letters, and preparing scheduling information,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:11-15; 63:9-64:4; Day 3 A.M. Tr. at 45:10-15. On the manual labor side of the ledger, Mr. Janeiro described Hollander as a \"unique engineer\" because \"he worked with his hands in the field.\" Day 3 A.M. Tr. at 11:15-18. But other than that limited testimony, which is not even specific to the Project, ACC offered no evidence that Hollander engaged in manual labor. Moreover, even if Mr. Janeiro's testimony applied to the Project, ACC offers no evidence establishing the percentage of time Hollander devoted to physical work in the field or the average number of hours per day that he engaged in such work. The court therefore has no reasonable basis to determine what share, if any, of the over $300,000 ACC seeks for Hollander's time constitutes compensable \"labor\" under the Miller Act. To award any percentage of that amount would require the court to speculate. And that it cannot do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USA Machinery Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11543368\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/257/#p265\">\n    184 F.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court finds that ACC is not entitled to recover any amount for Hollander's time during the life of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Salvage Value of Fencing Material\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   ACC seeks to collect $43,046.95 for the salvage value of fencing material that was left at the work site but never recovered. Pl.'s Ex. 169. According to ACC, the Subcontract \"took into consideration the fact that after the construction was completed, the eight-foot stockade fence material would be returned to ACC,\" and ACC negotiated the price of the Subcontract in part \"to include the cost of the stockade fence and the labor to install it, less the salvage value.\" Pl.'s Rebuttal at 48-49. ACC, however, cites no evidence for that assertion. The only agreement about fencing reflected in the Subcontract is that ACC agreed it would \"[f]urnish &amp; install all fencing (site, silt, tree protection, temporary) and relocate as per the drawings and specifications with appropriate signage.\" Subcontract, Schedule B, \u00b6 11. ACC bid $110,000 for \"Site Fencing Installation/Removal\n   Work,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, and Hirani agreed to pay ACC an upfront lump sum of $125,000 for initial project staging costs, including putting up fencing, that ACC would pay back to Hirani over time,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Nothing in the Subcontract, however, states that ACC would take the fencing at the end of the job, or that ACC discounted the fencing component of its bid to account for post-job salvage value. Therefore, there is simply no evidence that ACC \"furnished\" fencing material to the Project under terms that would entitle ACC to recover $43,046.95 in salvage value under the Miller Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The court rooted its decision in basic principles of contract law. The contractor could seek to recover the subcontractors' costs, the court explained, because the subcontractors could not directly sue the prime contractor. In other words, there was \"no privity\" between the subcontractor and the prime contractor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670890,3627282\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/671/539/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 550-51 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, the court concluded, \"[a]s long as [the contractor] was required to remit to [the subcontractors] any amount it recovered on their behalf from [the prime contractor]-as its contracts with those two firms required it to do- [the contractor] was entitled to assert claims on [the subcontractors'] behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 551.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   The holding of\n   <em>\n    Blake Construction\n   </em>\n   , at first blush, arguably supports ACC's position that it can seek from Defendants the costs incurred by Janeiro. But not so fast. The D.C. Circuit was careful to distinguish the situation in\n   <em>\n    Blake Construction\n   </em>\n   from a Miller Act claim. The district court had disallowed the contractor to assert the subcontractors' claims because of a concern that allowing the contractor to do so would provide the subcontractor with an end run around the requirements of the Miller Act (the project in that case was the building of an army hospital, and the prime contractor was a party to the government contract).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The D.C. Circuit rejected that reasoning. It explained: \"The [district] court's concern that permitting [the contractor] to assert the claims would circumvent the jurisdictional requirements of the Miller Act ignores the fact that this suit is not on the performance and payments bonds (to which the Miller Act relates), but for breach of the\n   contract between [the contractor] and [the prime contractor].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Stated differently, the district court's concern might have been valid had the subcontractors' claims been made under the Miller Act. After all, under the Miller Act, the subcontractors could have sought recovery from the surety directly. To allow the subcontractors to present their claims indirectly through the contractor would circumvent the Miller Act's requirements. Of course, that is the very factual circumstance of this case. Nothing prevented Janeiro from seeking recourse directly from Colonial on the payment bond. For reasons not apparent on the record, it elected not to make a claim. ACC cannot now stand as a proxy for Janeiro on a claim that Janeiro, in effect, has forfeited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   There is yet another critical distinction between this case and\n   <em>\n    Blake Construction\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the contractor had entered into separate agreements with its subcontractors promising that it would prosecute the subcontractors' claims on their behalf and would compensate them for any amounts recovered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 544. Here, on the other hand, ACC presented no evidence that it has such an agreement with Janeiro. That fact distinction is legally consequential. In\n   <em>\n    Morrison Knudsen Corp. v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit explained the general rule of government contracting that allows a prime contractor to recover against the government for the unpaid costs of its subcontractor, but only if the prime contractor has first settled with the subcontractor.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720022\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/1221/#p1249\">\n    175 F.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1249-54 (10th Cir. 1999) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2049-108-1\">\n    48 C.F.R. \u00a7 49-108-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (\"Upon termination of a prime contract, the prime contractor and each subcontractor are responsible for the prompt settlement of the settlement proposals of their immediate subcontractors.\").

This court will do the same. Accordingly, the court finds that a prejudgment interest award at the rate of 6% per annum will fairly compensate ACC for the delay in the receipt of payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   Finally, there remains the question of from what date should prejudgment interest accrue. Once more, looking to District of Columbia law, section 15-109 affords courts \"discretionary equitable power\" to fix the effective date of accrual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen. Ry. Signal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3467890,10529092\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/320/\">\n    875 F.2d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pierce Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7876689\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/527/306/#p310\">\n    527 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   310 ). Exercising such discretion here, the court looks to the Subcontract, which stipulates by when Hirani was required to pay ACC. Subcontract \u00b6 3.2. Section 3.2 of the agreement provides (including the parties' deletions and interlineations):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   The Subcontractor shall accept the credit worthiness of the Owner, if the cause of the nonpayment relates to the obligation or responsibilities of [Hirani] then the Subcontractor shall be entitled to receive payment for its work within 30 days of approval of the work. In any event, \"Progress Payments\" shall not become due and payable prior to the 30th of the following month or five (5) days after [Hirani] receives payment from the Owner on account of the Subcontractor's work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   The court finds this provision to be confusing. It is unclear whether the first sentence sets the payment date in this instance (\"within 30 days of approval of the work\"), or whether the second sentence that starts with \"[i]n any event,\" is controlling. The best the court can tell from the structure of the \"Price and Payments\" provision is that the parties contemplated that ACC would receive payment\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the USACE approved the work and paid Hirani. Using that understanding as a measure, and to simplify the prejudgment interest calculation, the court sets June 1, 2013-30 days after the last day of compensable work ACC performed on the site-as the date on which prejudgment interest began to accrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Attorney's Fees and Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   At last, the court arrives at ACC's demand for attorney's fees and costs. The Miller Act does not expressly authorize the award of attorney's fees to a successful plaintiff. The Supreme Court, however, has filled the statutory void. It has held that whether attorney's fees are available on a Miller Act claim is a matter of federal common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.D.

The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   <em>\n    1. Contractual Obligation to Pay Attorney's Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   The Subcontract contains no attorney's fees provision. ACC therefore points the court to a letter agreement between the company and Hirani dated April 4, 2011, the same day the parties entered into the Subcontract. Subcontract at 16. That agreement provides in relevant part that \"Hirani agrees to indemnify and hold harmless [ACC] against any and all claims, suits, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees ... arising out of the Project or Subcontractor's acceptance or performance of this Subcontract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11914061\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/758/#p764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   ACC's reliance on this letter agreement suffers from two fatal problems. First, it is not in evidence. When Plaintiff presented its Exhibit 54, the court admitted only the pages comprising the actual Subcontract, and not any extraneous pages contained therein, including the letter agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 1 A.M. Tr. at 68:23-70:5. The court invited ACC to lay the foundation as to these extraneous pages, but it never did so.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11914061\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/758/#p764\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the letter agreement is not evidence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   Second, even if it were evidence, the letter agreement does not have the legal effect ACC ascribes to it. Properly understood, the letter agreement is no more than an indemnification agreement as to third-party claims against ACC. It is not a fee-shifting provision as to claims between ACC and Hirani that might arise out of the Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensel Phelps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276139\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/267/#p274\">\n    861 F.3d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring that there be \"clear and unequivocal intent to include first-party claims ... on the face of the instrument\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James G.

The letter agreement therefore provides no basis for an award of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   <em>\n    2. Bad Faith\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   ACC's fees demand based on bad faith likewise fails. ACC claims that Defendants acted in bad faith by not promptly paying ACC for the work it performed. As evidence, ACC points to the non-payment of Payment Requisition No. 19, even though the USACE had approved it and remitted money to Colonial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s FOF &amp; COL at 74-75 \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   The D.C. Circuit has strictly construed the bad-faith exception to the American Rule. \"Bad faith in conduct giving rise to the lawsuit may be found where 'a party, confronted with a clear statutory or judicially-imposed duty towards another, is so recalcitrant in performing that duty that the injured party is forced to undertake otherwise unnecessary litigation to vindicate plain legal rights.' \"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). Because the \"underlying rationale of fee-shifting upon a showing of bad faith is punishment of the wrongdoer rather than compensation of the victim,\" such an award is reserved \"only when extraordinary circumstances or dominating reasons of fairness so demand.\"\n   <em>\n    Nepera Chem., Inc. v.

Although the court finds that ACC is entitled to be compensated for the work it performed, Defendants' refusal to make such payment is not so extraordinary as to distinguish this matter from run-of-the-mill Miller Act disputes. ACC believed it was owed money for the work it had done; Defendants thought they were relieved of their obligation to pay because ACC had failed to perform. Such disputes are commonplace in the construction business. Therefore, ACC is not entitled to attorney's fees on the ground Defendants acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   To summarize, the court finds that ACC has carried its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence as to its Miller Act claim against Colonial and its breach of contract claim against Hirani.
