In sum, Plaintiffs argue that the statute, which began as a private law-enforcement database in 1991, has radically expanded in its obligations, restraints, and disabilities over the last three decades, to the point that it currently infringes on their constitutional rights. Defendants in turn seek dismissal of this suit under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) arguing that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Specifically, the suit challenges the constitutionality of certain provisions in the most recent amendment to Chapter 62 made in 2017. The suit is brought by 152 individual Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and as a putative class action on behalf of all others who are similarly situated. Although each Plaintiff has uniquely individualized factual allegations thoroughly outlined in their Amended Complaint, each Plaintiff was charged or convicted with an offense covered by the statute prior to the 2017 version of Chapter 62 going into effect and is currently subject to the statute's requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 4, Am.

Besides identifying this general duty placed on Governor Abbott as chief executive of Texas, Plaintiffs fail to identify any specific action or threats of action taken by Governor Abbott related to enforcing Chapter 62. Further, Chapter 62 contains no specific provisions that task Governor Abbott with any enforcement role. Instead, the statute places the enforcement and implementation roles on the Department of Public Safety. Tex. Code Crim.

As-applied\n   challenges requires a court to determine whether a statute is administered unconstitutionally against a particular plaintiff, whereas a facial challenge looks at the constitutionality of a statute as written and without regard to an individual plaintiff. Besides Plaintiffs' \"class of one\" equal protection claim as to John Doe # 3 (Count VI), Plaintiffs do not explicitly state whether their challenges to Chapter 62 are brought as facial or as-applied claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29, Pls.' Resp., 23. Further, Plaintiffs have not put forth evidence of the specific manner in which the statute is administered unconstitutionally against them to support an as-applied challenge for their remaining nine claims. Thus, the Court interprets those claims as facial challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Justice v.

Finally, the Court noted that the law's rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose-\"public safety, which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in their community\"-was the \"most significant factor in [its] determination that the statute's effects are not punitive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    at 102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doe\n   </em>\n   , Chapter 62's more burdensome scheme still renders it punitive in effect. Specifically, Plaintiffs distinguish Chapter 62 in that it requires in-person reporting for registrants; attaches and publicizes a state-sanctioned label of dangerousness; requires registrants to provide DNA samples; restricts certain registrants from being employed at certain jobs; and limits some registrants from living on college campuses or being on a secondary school's campus without notice to the school.

The Fifth Circuit agrees, albeit in unpublished opinions, and has \"repeatedly affirmed a district court's dismissal as frivolous the claim that the retroactive application of Texas law requiring sex offender registration and notification violates the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

Although Plaintiffs cite to the\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors in their briefing, it is difficult to tell under what specific grounds or factors they challenge the law-besides seeking to distinguish certain provisions in Chapter 62 from the Alaska statute in\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Thus, the Court will consider each of those provisions in light of the\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors to determine whether they make the statute as a whole punitive in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, although the labeling of registrants based on a classification system and publicizing those classifications may in theory lead to public shame, \"[o]ur system does not treat dissemination of truthful information in furtherance of a legitimate governmental objective as punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    538 U.S. at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The state has a legitimate interest in employing these classification levels to ensure that compliance with the different requirements\n   of Chapter 62 are met, depending on the type, number, and severity of the sexual offenses committed. Like in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds that \"[w]idespread public access is necessary for the efficacy of the scheme, and the attendant humiliation is but a collateral consequence of a valid regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Supreme Court stated that in conducting this analysis, a statute's rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose is a \"most significant\" factor in determining whether the statute's effects are punitive.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    538 U.S. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is clear to this Court that all of these requirements-imposed against individuals who have already been convicted of sexual offenses-are rationally connected to serving the state's goal and duty of keeping its citizens safe. In light of the\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors and absent the \"clearest proof\" that the effects of Chapter 62 are punitive, the Court finds that this statute constitutes a nonpunitive civil scheme. Thus, Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause Claim (Count VII), Eighth Amendment Claim (Count VIII), and Double Jeopardy Claim (Count IX) all fail as a matter of law and are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED with prejudice.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Claim (Count I) Fails Because Texas's Classification System Is Based Solely on the Registrant's Conviction.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs also bring a procedural due process claim arguing that Chapter 62 does not afford them a hearing or individualized consideration before classifying their present level of dangerousness, via Chapter 62's three-tier classification system.

The state, for example, did not pass any regulations (except for the ones affirmed above) explicitly prohibiting Texas employers from hiring persons on the sex-offender database. The Court acknowledges the difficulty Plaintiffs face in pursuing employment opportunities in light of their criminal history; however, the Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   that \"[a]lthough the public availability of the information may have a lasting and painful impact on the convicted sex offender, these consequences flow not from the Act's registration and dissemination provisions, but from the fact of conviction, already a matter of public record.\" 538 U.S. at 101,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, Plaintiffs' arguments on these issues lack specificity and are not sufficient to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to legislative enactments such as Chapter 62.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, Chapter 62 does not impose strict liability for noncompliance with reporting requirements imposed by the statute. Article 62.102 states that a person commits the offense of failing to comply with sex-offender registration requirements \"if the person is required to register and fails to comply with any requirement of this chapter.\" Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 62.102(a). Although the statute does not contain a culpable-mental-state requirement, the statute does not explicitly dispense with any mental-state requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining the offenses for noncompliance and that a person charged under this Article would have the opportunity to go to trial).

Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that John Doe # 3-a current citizen of Minnesota-entered into a plea agreement for a sexual assault while living in Texas in 1993, received deferred adjudication, and had his case dismissed in 2003; however, he continues to be listed as a sex offender in Texas even though he is no longer required to register or be listed as such in Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 314-15.

In any case, Plaintiffs' claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For one, Plaintiffs state in their pleadings that \"the state of Texas is treating John Doe # 3\n   <em>\n    similarly\n   </em>\n   to other sex offenders on its sex offender registry by allowing his information to be publicly disseminated over the Internet.\" Doc. 4, Am. Compl., \u00b6 304 (emphasis added). This forecloses the argument that John Doe # 3 is treated differently from other Texas registrants. Also, even if Plaintiffs are claiming that John Doe # 3 is treated differently from other Minnesotan registrants this claim fails because (1) those Minnesotan registrants are not similarly situated-they, unlike John Doe # 3, do not have a reportable conviction in Texas; and (2) there is a rational basis for requiring that John Doe # 3 register and be listed in Texas-John Doe # 3 has a reportable conviction in Texas and Texas has a rational basis for maintaining the registry of those individuals to keep its citizenry safe. Furthermore, if other sex offenders like John Doe # 3-those that do not live in Texas and who have completed their registration requirements in their current home state-were somehow no longer required to register or be listed as sex offenders in Texas, then John Doe # 3 might assert a proper \"class of one\" equal protection claim. Plaintiffs, however, present no evidence or allegations of this sort, thus, this claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' \"class of one\" equal protection claim (Count VI) and because the Court finds that allowing Plaintiffs to replead this claim would be futile, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   the claim\n   <strong>\n    with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    6.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Contracts Clause Claim (Count X) Fails Because Chapter 62 Does Not Substantially Impair Plaintiffs' Plea Agreements.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that Chapter 62 violates the Contracts Clause by adding punishment conditions in violation of many of the Plaintiffs' plea agreements.

In determining whether a state has impaired a contract, courts employ a two-part test considering (1) \"whether the state law has operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship,\" and if so, (2) \"whether the state law is drawn in an appropriate and reasonable way to advance a significant and legitimate public purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Sveen v.

As previously discussed, the Court does not find that Chapter 62 is punitive in effect, and thus, on its face Chapter 62 does not impair any agreement because it does not impose additional punishments that would violate or conflict with any existing plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.
