Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Mississippi's Unnatural Intercourse law, as well as their inclusion on the MSOR. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Arthur Doe is a Mississippi resident convicted under Mississippi's Unnatural Intercourse statute. Brenda Doe, Carol Doe, Diana Doe, and Elizabeth Doe are Mississippi residents convicted of Louisiana's Crime Against Nature by Solicitation (CANS) law. Because of these offenses, the State required Plaintiffs to register with the Mississippi Department of Public Safety as sex offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants are five state officials responsible for enforcing Mississippi's sodomy prohibition or the MSOR: Jim Hood, the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi; Marshall Fisher, the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety; Charlie Hill, Director of the Department of Public Safety Sex Offender Registry; Colonel Chris Gillard, the Chief of the Mississippi Highway Patrol; and Lieutenant Colonel Larry Waggoner, the Director of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A month after filing their Complaint, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment and moved to certify a class.

Defendants argue that, based on this dicta, \"the\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   Court identified only one unconstitutional application: private sexual activity between consenting adults.\" Pointing to Doe's criminal history report, the State alleges that Doe engaged in nonconsensual sodomy. And for that reason, they say, he is not entitled to as-applied or facial relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   It is worth pausing here a moment. The Court does not know whether Doe committed consensual or nonconsensual sodomy. The question in an as-applied challenge is whether the law, as written by the state legislature, is constitutional. Therefore, what is pertinent is Doe's conviction, not the facts alleged to underlie his conviction. Mississippi prosecutors must prove only one element to support a conviction under the anti-sodomy statute: participation in an act of sodomy. This is the only conduct of which Doe admitted guilt, and he did so without the benefit of plea colloquy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The MSOR similarly does not call for a post hoc inquiry into the underlying facts of an offense. Only the conviction necessitates registration.
