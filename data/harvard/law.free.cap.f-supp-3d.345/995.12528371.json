Zummo has been a taxi driver in Chicago for 32 years. Compl. at 1. For some 20 years, he owned a Chicago taxi medallion, which allowed him to operate his own car as a taxicab under Chicago's municipal regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. About three years before filing the Complaint in this case, Zummo paid a City department, known as the Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Public Vehicle Operations Division, a $1,200 medallion fee and a $1,000 tax to operate his taxi for the following two years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. He paid this medallion fee expecting only to compete with 7,000 licensed taxicabs and 300 licensed limos in the City of Chicago.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since becoming a driver, Zummo has driven seven days a week to afford maintaining his taxi medallion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Zummo alleges that, in about early 2014, the Business Affairs Division conspired to commit fraud by allowing \"Transportation Network Providers\" (known by their acronym, TNPs) to provide ridesharing services within Chicago without requiring them to comply with the same regulations as taxicabs. Compl. at 6, 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MCC \u00a7 9-115\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (legislation regulating TNPs enacted in May 2014). Zummo \"mistakenly assumed\" that the City would \"prohibit[ ] unlicensed non-public commercial vehicles\" to operate in Chicago. Compl. at 9. Because of this \"two-tiered system\" of regulation of the transportation industry, Zummo alleges that he has been unable to make money as a taxi driver, and as a result, has suffered financial problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 10. According to Zummo, because it failed to protect his investments in his medallion, the Business Affairs Division forced him into involuntary default on his debts and foreclosure of both his home and his taxicab.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Zummo claims that by avoiding the regulation of TNPs at the expense of the taxicab industry, the City has denied him due process and engaged in restraint of trade and tortious interference. Compl. at 9, 30. Zummo also brings a claim against the City for promissory estoppel based on: (1) his understanding that only a limited number of taxicabs would be driving in Chicago; (2) his financial investment in his medallion; and (3) the City's issuance of only minimal regulation in allowing TNPs to enter the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. Finally, Zummo alleges that the City engaged in deceptive practices by allowing \"unlicensed vehicles\" to drive in Chicago and \"br[e]aking of regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 24, 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In late September 2017, Zummo's taxicab was impounded because he was driving\n   with an allegedly expired license and medallion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. at 10. Zummo alleges that the Business Affairs Division impounded his car without giving him an opportunity to contest the impoundment, thus denying him due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The Department of Administrative Hearings then issued multiple Administrative Notices of Violation of the municipal code to Zummo, including engaging in consumer fraud, unfair methods of competition or deceptive practices in violation of MCC \u00a7 2-25-090(a), and driving a taxicab without a license in violation of MCC \u00a7 9-112-020 and MCC \u00a7 9-112-260.

By denying him a chance to contest the basis of the water bill, Zummo alleges, the City denied him due process and committed extortion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Zummo is currently paying the water bill in monthly installments under a payment plan, he alleges that the City is denying him due process by refusing to reinstate his now-expired license and medallion without letting him contest the bill and other administrative fines (discussed below) until they are paid in full.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 7, 2017, the Department of Administrative Hearings entered a default judgment against Zummo, ordering him to pay $10,040 in fines. Compl. at 20. In January 2018, the Department vacated the default judgment and granted a motion to continue, setting a hearing date of March 1, 2018. Def. Br. Exh. C. On that date, the Department granted a continuance of the hearing, setting another hearing date in April 2018. Def. Br. Exh. B.

The subject of the administrative proceedings-that is, driving a taxicab with an expired taxicab license and medallion-has very little to do with the allegedly disparate application of municipal regulations to taxicab drivers.

Although the City's argument is expressed at a high level of generality, a detailed march through the pertinent inquiry, as required by the Supreme Court, shows that the government's interests are indeed important. In\n   <em>\n    Middlesex County\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court looked to how similar the administrative enforcement proceeding was to a criminal proceeding: \"the importance of the state interest may be demonstrated by the fact that the noncriminal proceedings bear a close relationship to proceedings criminal in nature.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189854\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/423/#p432\">\n    457 U.S. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189854\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/423/#p432\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Later, in\n   <em>\n    Sprint Communications\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court emphasized that, for\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention to apply, proceedings must be \"quasi-criminal,\" lest\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   apply too broadly to almost all state proceedings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702001\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/69/#p81\">\n    571 U.S. at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In assessing whether an enforcement proceeding is quasi-criminal, courts look to see whether the proceeding shares three specific features of criminal prosecutions: (1) the action was initiated by the State in its sovereign capacity; (2) the action involves sanctions against the federal plaintiff for some wrongful act; and (3) the action commonly involves an investigation, often culminating in formal charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79-80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The administrative proceeding against Zummo is sufficiently \"quasi-criminal\" for\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention to apply. First, one way that impoundment and licensing proceedings are initiated by the state are by police officers, who may have taxicabs towed when the officers have probable\n   cause to believe that the owner of the car is driving without a license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MCC \u00a7 9-112-640(b). Unlike proceedings in which an individual is seeking a license, for example, the proceeding at issue here begins with a police officer issuing a citation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolton v. Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4210837\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/802/#p815\">\n    71 F.Supp.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 815 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (holding\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention did not apply in a proceeding challenging denial of a gun license because, among other things, licensee initiated the proceeding). Second, if the government prevails in the enforcement proceeding, the proceeding would end with sanctions against Zummo for misconduct. The City charges that Zummo made fraudulent misrepresentations, in violation of MCC \u00a7 9-112-390, which is equivalent to the crime of fraud crime under state law,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   720 ILCS 5/17-1(A)(3) (a person commits the crime of deceptive practices when, with the intent to defraud, he \"knowingly makes a false or deceptive statement addressed to the public for the purpose of promoting the sale of property or services\"). The proceeding would end with a fine of up to $10,000 if Zummo is found to have violated the municipal code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MCC \u00a7 2-14-076(l), MCC \u00a7 2-25-090(a), (f). And, third, although the municipal code does not require a formal investigation into unlicensed taxicabs, the Municipal Code directs police officers to seize and impound unlicensed taxicabs on probable cause. MCC \u00a7 9-112-640(b). This is akin to the general approach for criminal offenses: probable cause is needed for an arrest, so by definition the officer must conduct\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   investigation in order to establish it. Indeed, one of the Municipal Code provisions that Zummo is charged with violating-revocation of license on grounds of fraud-authorizes the Business Affairs Division to revoke the taxicab license \"after investigation and hearing.\" MCC \u00a7 9-112-390. Plus, the administrative proceedings have provided formal notice of the violations-in other words, charges-to Zummo. Under\n   <em>\n    Sprint Communications\n   </em>\n   , the administrative proceedings against Zummo are quasi-criminal in nature, so the government's interests are important.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702001\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/69/#p81\">\n    571 U.S. at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The final question under\n   <em>\n    Middlesex County\n   </em>\n   is whether Zummo has an opportunity to raise federal constitutional challenges in the administrative proceedings.

On the due process claim, Zummo alleges that his due process rights were violated by (1) the City's two-tiered system of regulation of TNPs and taxicabs; and (2) his lack of opportunity to contest the impoundment of his car and certain fines he incurred for driving with an expired taxicab license.

In both impounding Zummo's car and refusing to reinstate his license before he paid outstanding bills, the City was enforcing the law.

MCC \u00a7 9-112-640, Compl. at 26. The City was similarly justified in not reinstating Zummo's license before he paid his outstanding water bills because, under the municipal code, \"no initial taxi license or renewal shall be issued\" if a person owes a debt to the City. MCC \u00a7\u00a7 4-4-150(b), 9-112-260. The City's conduct was proper and its demands were justified because it was enforcing laws that Zummo violated.

Whether Zummo is claiming that the City interfered with a contractual relationship or a prospective economic advantage is unclear, but it does not matter because both versions fail.

In the alternative- that is, if the Court is mistaken on\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention-the Court would dismiss those due process claims for failure to state claim. All other claims are dismissed for failure to state a claim.
