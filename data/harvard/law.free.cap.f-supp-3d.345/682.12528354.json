(\"HEEP Fund\"), and CU Fund, Inc. (\"CU Fund\") (collectively, \"Respondents\"). (ECF No. 95.) Respondents contend that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\" or the \"Commission\") brought this action beyond the applicable statute of limitations, that FERC does not have the authority to seek disgorgement as a civil penalty, and, assuming disgorgement is available, that it is also barred by the statute of limitations. (Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 1, ECF No. 96.) FERC opposed the Motion to Dismiss, and Respondents replied. (ECF Nos. 99, 106.)

Chen owns the entirety of Respondents HEEP Fund and CU Fund. Respondents conducted financial trades through the wholesale electricity market administered by PJM Interconnection, LLC (\"PJM\"), an organization that operates various electricity markets throughout the Mid-Atlantic. Certain energy trades qualified market participants to receive a payment, known as a \"Marginal Loss Surplus Allocation,\" or MLSA, which PJM distributed to customers making certain trades. (Am. Compl. Ex. 1 (\"Penalty Order\") \u00b6 2, ECF No. 93-1.) FERC alleges here that, during the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period, Respondents \"designed and implemented a fraudulent ... trading scheme to receive excessive amounts of MLSA payments,\" by manipulating \"day-ahead\" and \"real-time\" energy trades to engage in wash trades: \"trades that are pre-arranged to cancel each other out and involve no economic risk.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   FERC became aware of Respondents' purportedly manipulative activities after PJM received two complaints from a market participant about someone \"trying to game the system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) In August 2010, in response to these complaints, PJM submitted a \"referral\" to the Commission's Office of Enforcement (\"Enforcement\"), alerting the Commission to Respondents' allegedly fraudulent behavior and setting off the investigations that ultimately resulted in this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That same month, Enforcement began investigating Respondents. On August 25, 2010, the Commission issued an order formalizing the investigation. The investigation, while formal, was not adversarial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 C.F.R. \u00a7 1b.13. Under applicable regulations, the investigation became formal because FERC issued an Order of Investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 9, 2013, after nearly three years of formal investigation, Enforcement staff issued letters of preliminary findings to Respondents \"explaining the factual and legal bases for its preliminary findings of violations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Respondents replied to the letters on October 9, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 5, 2014, almost one year later, four years after the Commission began investigating Respondents, and more than four years after the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period, the Office of the Secretary issued a Notice of Alleged Violations. Settlement discussions failed, and Enforcement issued Respondents a notice of its \"intent to recommend the initiation of a public proceeding against Respondents\" (the \"Notice\"). Respondents replied to the Notice on September 24, 2014. The Notice and Respondents' opportunity to reply constituted the first procedural requirement with which the Commission had to comply in the investigation and penalty assessment process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondents submitted their response, and almost two months later, on December 17, 2014-four years and four months after the end of the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period-the Commission issued an Order to Show Cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The OSC constituted the second procedural requirement-and the first process compelled by statute-with which the Commission had to comply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(a) (\"After\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   and an opportunity for public hearing, the Commission may issue such orders as necessary to require compliance ....\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The OSC alleged Respondents violated the statute and regulation forbidding the use of manipulative behaviors in connection with the purchase or sale of electric energy:\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824v(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 1c.2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   respectively. The OSC recommended that the Commission assess penalties and profit disgorgement against each of the Respondents in the following amounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   CU Fund: $10,080,000 civil penalty; $1,080,576 disgorgement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   HEEP Fund: $1,920,000 civil penalty; $173,100 disgorgement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Powhatan: $16,800,000 civil penalty; $3,465,108 disgorgement; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Chen: $1,000,000 civil penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (OSC 1, ECF No. 93-2.) The OSC also recommended that: (1) HEEP Fund, CU Fund, and Chen be jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of unjust profits; (2) HEEP Fund, Powhatan, and Chen be jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of unjust profits; (3) HEEP Fund and Powhatan be jointly and severally liable for the penalties against HEEP Fund; and, (4) HEEP Fund and Powhatan be jointly and severally liable for the penalties against Powhatan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The OSC directed Respondents to show cause within thirty days why they should not be found to have engaged in manipulative trading and required to disgorge profits and be assessed the proposed civil penalties. The OSC also ordered Respondents to elect either a formal hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") prior to the assessment of a penalty, pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(2), (the \"Default Option\"), or to proceed under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(A), (the \"Alternate Option\"), under which the Commission would \"promptly\" assess penalties upon a finding of violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the OSC allowed Enforcement thirty days after Respondents filed their answer to file a reply with the\n   Commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Commission extended Respondents' deadline to respond once, on December 31, 2014, granting Respondents until February 2, 2015, to respond to the OSC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 12, 2015, before submitting their response, Respondents submitted a joint notice of their election to proceed in accordance with the Alternate Option, \"thereby electing an immediate penalty assessment if the Commission [found] a violation.\" (Penalty Order \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After cross-briefing\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a review of the extensive record, the Commission issued its eighty-nine-page Order Assessing Civil Penalties (the \"Penalty Order\") on May 29, 2015-just over five months after issuing the OSC, and almost five years after the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period. In the Penalty Order, the Commission found that Respondents had \"violated section 222 of the [FPA] and section 1c.2 of the Commission's regulations, which prohibit energy market manipulation, through a scheme to engage in fraudulent Up-To Congestion (UTC) transactions in [PJM's] energy markets to garner excessive amounts of certain credit payments to transmission customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) The Commission also determined that Respondents \"engaged in round-trip UTC transactions not for hedging or arbitraging price spreads but instead to receive large shares of MLSA payments that otherwise would have been allocated to other market participants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) The Commission ruled that \"Respondents' round-trip UTC trades [were] wash trades, and therefore\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   fraudulent and manipulative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) Citing the Commission's Market Behavior Rules, the Commission stated that wash trades possess \"two key elements[.] ... [T]he transactions: (1) are pre-arranged to cancel each other out; and[,] (2) involve no economic risk.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because of its findings, and pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Commission assessed penalties and profit disgorgement in the same amounts as those recommended in the OSC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   CU Fund: $ 10,080,000 civil penalty; $1,080,576 disgorgement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   HEEP Fund: $1,920,000 civil penalty; $173,100 disgorgement; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Powhatan: $16,800,000 civil penalty; $3,465,108 disgorgement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Chen: $1,000,000 civil penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Penalty Order \u00b6\u00b6 164, 174, 187, 190.) The Commission also agreed with the OSC recommendations regarding joint and several liability, and therefore held: (1) HEEP Fund, CU Fund, and Chen jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of unjust profits; (2) HEEP Fund, Powhatan, and Chen jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of unjust profits; (3) HEEP Fund and Powhatan jointly and severally liable for the penalties against HEEP Fund; and, (4) HEEP Fund and Powhatan jointly and severally liable for the penalties against Powhatan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Commission ordered the payment of all penalties and profit disgorgement within sixty days, and directed PJM to \"establish a method to resettle and distribute the resettled MLSA Payments .... [and] to provide reimbursement of MLSA payments ... to those entities identified as a result of PJM's proposed methodology.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88.) Respondents failed to pay the penalties within 60 days, and, pursuant to \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(B),\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Commission filed the action in this Court on July 31, 2015-two months after the Commission issued its Penalty Order, seven months after the Commission issued the OSC, and almost five years after the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 31, 2015, FERC filed this action seeking an order affirming and enforcing the Commission's Penalty Order. (ECF No. 1.) Respondents filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 20, 22.) Neither party adequately addressed what procedures the Court must follow in conducting the \"review de novo [of] the law and the facts involved\" required by \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(B), under which this action proceeds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 20, 22, 28, 29, 33, 34.) The Court ordered the parties to address this threshold matter and submit briefing \"detailing the respective party's position regarding the procedure mandated by 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(B).\" (ECF No. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After the parties submitted cross-briefs discussing the meaning of this Court's\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review procedure under \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(B), the Court denied the initial motions to dismiss without prejudice and ordered additional briefing. (ECF No. 44.) The parties then filed supplemental briefs, and a great deal of supplemental authority. (ECF Nos. 52, 53, 55, 68, 69, 70, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 88-1.) On December 28, 2017, the Court issued\n   <em>\n    FERC I\n   </em>\n   , ruling that Respondents were entitled to a trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence. (ECF Nos. 89, 92.) The Court ordered FERC to file an Amended Complaint, and set a schedule by which Respondents should file their responsive pleadings to the Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 92.) Respondents timely filed their Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As with the Court's determination on the meaning of the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review procedure under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(B) in\n   <em>\n    FERC I\n   </em>\n   , the Motion to Dismiss presents an issue of first impression in this District,\n   and one which neither the Supreme Court of the United States nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has addressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondents argue in the Motion to Dismiss that FERC's claim in this Court accrued at the time of the alleged violations (the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period), the vast majority of which occurred outside the statute of limitations. Respondents further assert that no statutory basis exists for the Commission's ordered disgorgement of profits or for this Court to enforce the order of disgorgement, and, even if one did exist, the statute of limitations also bars this Court from enforcing most of the ordered disgorgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FERC disagrees with each of Respondents' arguments. Pertinent here, FERC asserts that its claim in this Court accrued, for statute of limitations purposes, only when Respondents failed to pay the penalty within sixty days of the Commission assessing it via the Penalty Order. FERC also argues that the Commission's ordered disgorgement is remedial and not subject to any statute of limitations, and the Court may order disgorgement under its inherent equitable powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   No clear answer exists for any of these issues, but the outcome materially impacts the parties' rights and responsibilities. If FERC prevails, all penalties remain timely and Respondents could be liable for more than $28 million dollars in civil penalties and more than $4 million dollars in disgorgement. On the other hand, if Respondents present the correct interpretation, FERC cannot maintain a suit for enforcement of the penalty assessment order as to the vast majority of the dates within the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period, substantially reducing the monetary value of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The atypical statutory scheme for assessing a penalty under the Alternate Option of \u00a7 823b has generated prolonged litigation before this Court and other courts addressing FERC's attempts to assess and enforce assessed penalties pursuant to that statute. Statutes, more commonly, presume enforcement after a formal agency adjudicative process pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm'n v. City Power Mktg., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175829\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/218/#p230\">\n    199 F.Supp.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (D.D.C. 2016) (noting that the \"traditional form of judicial review of agency action[ is] based on the record developed in an agency proceeding.\"). In the alternative, some statutes provide for immediate adversarial action in a federal court, thereby bypassing full agency review.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (allowing for district court jurisdiction if the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cannot reach a satisfactory conciliation agreement with the offending employer within thirty days after a Title VII charge is filed). Because the Alternate Option does neither, a catch-all statute of limitations applicable to all actions (and which seemingly presumes\n   more common procedures) does not jibe well with the principles of statutory interpretation that must govern this Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, considering the plain language of the relevant statute of limitations in the context of the process by which FERC assesses civil penalties, and mindful of the long-established principle that courts may not interpret statutes contrary to the plain language, the Court finds that the action currently before it accrued sixty days after Respondents failed to pay the Penalty Assessment Order. FERC's action in this Court therefore falls well within the five-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, given the fact-intensive nature of determining whether disgorgement constitutes a penalty, the Court cannot determine on the record before it whether the ordered disgorgement operates as a penalty falling within the language of the statute of limitations. Regardless, the Commission had the authority to order disgorgement, and this Court has the inherent equitable power to affirm or modify that order as to the disgorgement. Given the Court's finding that FERC commenced this action within five years of the date on which it accrued, the action seeking affirmance of the order of disgorgement would be timely even if the disgorgement did amount to a penalty. The Court will therefore deny Respondents' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Relevant Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although the Motion to Dismiss presents a pure question of law for the Court, the Court remains mindful of, and will apply, the familiar standard for ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. \"A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the sufficiency of a complaint; importantly, it does not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Republican Party of N.C. v.

First, the Alternate Option presents an administrative scheme to which neither the parties nor the Court can identify an analogue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second-and possibly because of the Alternate Option's singularity in the administrative law context-no line of cases directly addresses the question before the Court, despite the parties' attempts to assert otherwise. The Court, ultimately, faces a general statute of limitations that must be evaluated under legal precepts and principles of statutory construction more readily applied to traditional administrative processes. As such, the Court must apply the\n   <em>\n    most reasonable\n   </em>\n   interpretation that remains consistent with the statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although aspects of all parties' positions make sense, the Court must turn to the plain language in \u00a7 823b. FERC's position conforms to the plain meaning and accepted definition of \"accrue.\" Under the Alternate Option, FERC clearly lacks the authority to \"institute an action ... for an order affirming the assessment of the civil penalty\" until two events have occurred: (1) the Commission must have assessed the penalty, by order; and (2) sixty days must have elapsed without payment of the civil penalty. Unless and until both events happen, FERC has no right to commence any action in a district court. It runs counter to the definition of \"accrue\" that a claim could accrue before a party has the right to initiate an action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Respondents' position, however, seemingly comports well with the overall structure of \u00a7 823b. The Court in this action adjudicates\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the propriety of the civil penalty assessment, which flows directly from the alleged violations, making it commonsensical that the claim would accrue at the time of the violation. Furthermore, this district court action under the Alternate Option functions as the equivalent of an adjudication before an ALJ under the Default Option-an action that clearly accrued at the time of the purported violations. Finally, given the lack of statutory or regulatory requirements for the Commission's penalty assessment under the Alternate Option, and the Commission's near-exclusive control over the speed with which the penalty assessment order issues, the possibility exists that the intended \"prompt[ ]\" penalty assessment might not be prompt after all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, absent any statute or regulation dictating the speed at which the penalty assessment must issue, statutes of limitations' \"basic policies of ...: repose, elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff's opportunity for recovery and a defendant's potential liabilities,\"\n   <em>\n    Gabelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/#p445\">\n    568 U.S. at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/#p445\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rotella v.

(Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 28-29.)

The terms of the Penalty Order itself appear to indicate that the disgorgement was assessed for purely remedial-and not penal-purposes. The Penalty Order required Respondents to \"distribute [their] unjust profits, plus interest, to PJM,\" which would thereafter \"establish a method to resettle and distribute the resettled MLSA payments.\" (Penalty Order 88.) The Commission further directed PJM to identify \"market participants that would have received higher MLSA payments in the absence of Respondents' activity,\" and \"provide reimbursement of MLSA payments, and any available interest\" to the market participants PJM identified who had been\n   harmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This method for redistributing the MLSA payments to market participants who would otherwise have received the payments, and which the Commission had deemed Respondents wrongfully received, was directed at \"restoring the status quo and ordering the return of that which rightfully belongs\" to the legitimate market participants.\n   <em>\n    Tull\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216100\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/412/#p424\">\n    481 U.S. at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216100\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/412/#p424\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377260\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/395/#p398\">\n    328 U.S. at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377260\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/395/#p398\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   However, the Commission also assessed disgorgement in way that made different groups of Respondents jointly and severally liable for the ordered disgorgement.

The Court must determine how \u00a7 2462 applies in the particular context of \u00a7 823b, and specifically, in the context of the Alternate Option.

Before the person or entity subject to civil penalties chooses a path, the statute requires that \"the Commission ... provide to such person notice of the proposed penalty.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(1). Here, the Commission issued the notice-the OSC-on December 17, 2014, more than four years after the end of the Two-Month Alleged Manipulation Period. Under the statute, the person or entity has thirty days after receiving notice to inform the Commission which procedural track he or she elects to follow.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276167\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/271/58/#p62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That choice determines\n   which route is taken for the civil penalty adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As determined in\n   <em>\n    FERC I\n   </em>\n   , the Default and the Alternate Options both envision, at some point, an adversarial proceeding encompassing procedural protections. Under the Default Option, the propriety and amount of the civil penalty is adjudicated before an Administrative Law Judge in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. Under the Alternate Option, the adjudication occurs before a federal district judge in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence. On January 12, 2015, Respondents elected the Alternate Option, meaning that Respondents elected to have the propriety and amount of the penalty adjudicated before a federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The structure of the statute itself demonstrates the intent that adversarial adjudication of the penalty occur\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   in the administrative context-under the Default Option-\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   in the judicial context-under the Alternate Option. First, Section 823b(d)(4) allows the Commission to \"compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions,\" any civil penalty imposed \"at any time prior to a final decision by the court of appeals under [the Default Option] or by the district court under [the Alternate Option].\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(4). By allowing the Commission to modify the penalty it imposed at any time before either a final decision under the administrative Default Option or a judicial decision under the Alternate Option, the statute itself describes district court adjudication as an alternate track for reaching the same result as the administrative option: a final adjudication on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   A second provision of \u00a7 823b even more clearly illustrates a statutory scheme allowing for two alternate paths for civil penalty adjudication. Section 823b(d)(5) provides that, if a party fails to pay a penalty assessment \"after it has become a final and unappealable order under [the Default Option], or after the appropriate district court has entered final judgment in favor of the Commission under [the Alternate Option], the Commission shall institute an action\" in a district court to recover the penalty amount. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(5). In this enforcement action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"the validity and appropriateness of [the] final assessment order or judgment\n   <em>\n    shall not be subject to review.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276167\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/271/58/#p62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, two similarities between the Default Option and Alternate Option also indicate an intention of different paths meant to arrive at the same destination. First, both are commenced by issuance of the notice of proposed penalty under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   After this notice issues, thirty days elapse before the alleged violator either elects to have the Alternate Option process apply, or fails to do so, in which case the Default Option governs. Second, both the Default and Alternate Option contemplate an ultimate adversarial adjudication. Under the Default Option, which is governed by the APA, the adversarial adjudication occurs before an ALJ: when an individual fails to elect the Alternate Option, a penalty is assessed, \"by order,\n   <em>\n    after a determination of violation has been made on the record\n   </em>\n   after an\n   opportunity\" for a formal administrative hearing. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Under the Alternate Option, the adversarial adjudication occurs before a district court after the Commission \"promptly assess[es]\" the penalty by order. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(A)-(B). The Alternate Option contains no requirement that the Commission determine a violation has occurred before assessing the penalty, but provides for a \"review de novo of the law and the facts involved\" in the district court. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 823b(d)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Thus, several aspects of \u00a7 823b indicate a statutory intent that the initial adversarial penalty adjudication occur either before an ALJ or before a district court: (1) the path to adjudication in either forum begins with the notice required by \u00a7 823b(d)(1) ; (2) the Commission may modify its penalty assessment at any time before the adjudication in either forum completes; and, (3) the Commission institutes an enforcement action for a penalty left unpaid after the completion of adjudication in either forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, under the Alternate Option, the statute provides no method by which FERC could bring an action in district court before alleged violators fail to pay the assessed penalty under the Alternate Option. Thus, although the structure of \u00a7 823b indicates an intent that the adversarial\n   <em>\n    administrative\n   </em>\n   proceeding under the Default Option and the adversarial\n   <em>\n    judicial\n   </em>\n   proceeding under the Alternate Option pave different avenues to equivalent destinations, the statute dictates that those avenues begin at different times, and FERC exercises differing amounts of control over the time at which each avenue commences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   An administrative adjudication under the Default Option, like traditional administrative ALJ proceedings, begins when FERC issues the OSC, which provides the requisite notice under \u00a7 823b(d)(1) -which FERC, under the statute, can do at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In contrast, a judicial adjudication begins only after: (1) FERC issues an OSC; (2) the alleged violator has chosen the Alternate Option; (3) a penalty has been assessed by order; (4) sixty days have elapsed without the violator paying the assessed penalty; and, (5) FERC has instituted a suit in a district court for an order enforcing the civil penalty. FERC exercises only\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   control over the timing of the process leading to adversarial adjudication under the Alternate Option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Because FERC had no statutory authority to initiate this action until the first four of these events occurred, only then were \"the factual and legal prerequisites for filing suit ... in place,\"\n   <em>\n    3M\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3818512,1830191\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/1453/\">\n    17 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1460 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931704\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/346/568/#p569\">\n    346 U.S. at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931704\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/346/568/#p569\">\n    74 S.Ct. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

And although the parties acknowledge that neither the Fourth Circuit nor the Supreme Court has directly addressed this issue-and therefore no decision\n   <em>\n    binds\n   </em>\n   this Court-the parties each fail to place the square pegs of the cases they rely on into the round holes of the administrative scheme at bar, or to even acknowledge that no perfect \"fit\" exists. The cases that the parties have cited and the Court has identified fall into three general categories, none of which parallels the situation before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   First, the parties identify cases addressing enforcement actions after traditional administrative adjudications, similar to those that occur under the Default Option.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   line of cases, however, cannot govern this action because of the important procedural differences between the Alternate Option and a traditional administrative action, specifically the potential for delay inherent in what some courts refer to as a byzantine administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The parties also point to cases involving enforcement actions against the United States after mandatory administrative proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crown Coat Front Co. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Crown Coat\n   </em>\n   cases also cannot control here, because those cases involve administrative proceedings over which the plaintiff had no control, and\n   <em>\n    Crown Coat\n   </em>\n   and cases like it expressed concern over the possibility that a plaintiff could-through no fault of his or her own-face situations in which the mandated pre-filing administrative proceedings consumed the entire statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Finally, the parties refer to cases addressing enforcement actions by the United States under statutes requiring\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   prior administrative process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unexcelled Chem.

The\n   <em>\n    Unexcelled\n   </em>\n   cases, however, cannot dictate because the Alternate Option requires FERC to comply with\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   administrative procedures before initiating this action. Accordingly, as noted, the Court finds no individual case or line of cases directly inform this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Enforcement Actions after a Traditional Administrative Adjudication\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   One group of cases interpreting the meaning of \u00a7 2462 are those in which a government agency sues in district court for the enforcement of a civil penalty that was imposed through an adversarial administrative adjudication-a process similar to the Default Option. The\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   line of cases presents the enticingly simple rule that, when a statute mandates administrative proceedings before a court action may commence, \u00a7 2462 provides one five-year time limit within which the\n   <em>\n    administrative\n   </em>\n   proceedings must commence, and another, separate five-year time limit after the conclusion of the administrative proceedings within which\n   <em>\n    judicial\n   </em>\n   proceedings must begin. This reasoning, although attractive in its simplicity, cannot govern here. The administrative processes in cases following\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   contain important procedural safeguards absent from those in the Alternate Option, meaning that the concerns for abuse and delay that drove much of the\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   court's decision do not present themselves in the Alternate Option. Under the Alternate Option, the investigation and assessment period is subject to few statutory or regulatory requirements and is almost exclusively within the Commission's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In the end, the parties overstate the holdings of this line of cases.\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   and cases following it have stated generally that when a statute that \"authorizes the assessment of a penalty provides for an administrative procedure for assessing that penalty, the statute of limitations at \u00a7 2462 does not begin to run until 'the penalty has first been assessed administratively.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, these cases involved the enforcement of civil fines, assessed via a final agency action whose procedural protection more closely mirrored the Default Option than the Alternate Option.

The FPA, of course, has no comparable statute of limitations.

Respondents had no equivalent right to process or discovery, or to control the pace of the investigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    The investigation and penalty assessment process imposed few statutory or regulatory requirements or limits on the Commission.

Under this interpretation, because the Commission issued the Order to Show Cause well within the five-year time limit, FERC asserts that the statute of limitations has not run on its claims.
