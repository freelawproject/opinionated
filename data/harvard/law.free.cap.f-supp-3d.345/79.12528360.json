The Forest Service withheld some of these records in their entirety, redacted some, and released others in full to Plaintiffs. To justify its withholdings and redactions, the Forest Service invoked FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, 6, and 9.

For the reasons described below, the court finds that the Forest Service properly withheld information under Exemption 5. However, the court also finds that the Forest Service has not properly justified withholding information under Exemptions 4, 6, or 9. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In the view of Plaintiffs' declarant, Miranda Fox, the Campaigns Manager of Story of Stuff Project, NWNA does not face \"actual competition\" as it relates to its operations in the San Bernardino National Forest because \"there is no opportunity for another company to come into this area and access the water, or otherwise compete, since [NWNA's] right to the water it withdraws is based upon asserted water rights which it alleges it holds to the exclusion of all others.\" Fox Decl. \u00b6 6. According to Fox, \"no other commercial spring or other water developments [exist] near the project site\" and \"[t]he only application in decades to San Bernardino County for this type of use was ... about 15 miles away and it was dropped due to agency and public opposition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11754883,3668839\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   NWNA's Natural Resource Manager, Larry Lawrence, on the other hand, explains that \"[t]he spring water bottling industry is a competitive industry with relatively narrow profit margins\" and that \"NWNA has numerous competitors, including large, nationally-recognized spring water bottling companies, as well as smaller regional or specialty spring water bottling companies.\" Lawrence Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 14.

The inquiry here is not whether disclosure of the withheld information will cause competitive harm to NWNA solely as to its ability to obtain a special use permit to draw water from the San Bernardino National Forest, but instead whether disclosure will cause competitive harm to NWNA as to \"day-to-day competition\" with other businesses offering bottled spring water.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Parks II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5691581,999167\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/547/673/\">\n    547 F.2d at 681-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing between the competitive harm faced by concessioners as a result of disclosure of withheld financial records as to \"their day-to-day business operations\" and as to \"renewal of their contracts\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For this reason, the case of\n   <em>\n    National Parks II\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant\n   matter. There, the D.C.

Because renewal of the park concessioners' contracts with the Park Service \"tend[ed] to be automatic\" pursuant to a statutory renewal preference, the court concluded that there were too many \"practical barriers to competition by potential contract bidders\" to conclude that the concessioners faced \"actual\" competition in renewing their concession contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5691581,999167\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/547/673/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5691581,999167\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/547/673/\">\n    at 681-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Lawrence maintains that \"NWNA's competitors could use the [withheld information] to reverse-engineer NWNA's internal business processes-a unique system that NWNA uses to scientifically evaluate, license, and operationalize spring sites-in order to use these same internal processes to develop their own spring sources and spring water business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.

Together, these statements persuade the court that \"[d]isclosing this information would provide [NWNA's] competitors with something of a free roadmap to the industry\" and allow NWNA's competitors to gain an unfair competitive advantage based on NWNA's significant investments in time and resources to develop internal business processes, equipment, and infrastructure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518335\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/343/#p352\">\n    901 F.3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (agreeing with the agency that disclosing the airline carriers and transport routes used by private importers would provide an unfair \"windfall\" to competitors who could thereby \"enter the market without the startup costs associated with researching successful importation means and practices\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Beyond reiterating their public domain argument and re-asserting that NWNA does not face \"actual competition,\" Plaintiffs offer no response to Lawrence's detailed allegations of substantial competitive harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

According to the Forest Service, \"[t]he individuals who are mentioned in the responsive records are private individuals who are employed by a private business and government employees.\" Rush Decl. \u00b6 19. The Forest Service asserts that these individuals-\"including [the] government employees\"-have a \"legitimate privacy interest[ ] in guarding information about themselves from public dissemination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3472141,10537717\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather than provide detailed information about\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   disclosing the withheld names would constitute an invasion of privacy, the Forest Service merely concludes that these individuals have a privacy interest in the nondisclosure of their names. Such a conclusory assertion is clearly insufficient to satisfy an agency's burden to invoke Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News v. Lappin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240025\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/780/29/#p41\">\n    780 F.Supp.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (D.D.C. 2011) (holding that agency's conclusory assertion that Exemption 6 applied to withhold \"all personal psychiatric/medical information\" was\n   merely a \"good start\" that failed to adequately \"describe the documents and the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail\" (cleaned up) ). The Forest Service's explanation is deficient in another respect: by seeming to suggest that the private individuals identified in the records have the same privacy interests as the government employees, the Forest Service impermissibly \"lump[s]\" the privacy interests of two disparate categories of individual.\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229457,4222558\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1142/\">\n    787 F.3d at 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Depending on context, a government employee and a private employee may have varying degrees of privacy interests in the non-disclosure of their names. An agency affidavit with sufficient \"reasonable specificity of detail\" to invoke Exemption 6 would address as to each group how disclosure of their names would constitute an invasion of privacy.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Climate Investigations Ctr. v.

Sept. 19, 2018) (\"A categorical approach can be appropriate. But Defendant must explain the privacy interests at stake as to each appropriately categorized group of individuals whose names and identifying information it has withheld.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In light of the agency's unsatisfactory explanation, the court denies summary judgment to the Forest Service as to Exemption 6. The court, however, also denies summary judgment to Plaintiffs, because Plaintiffs' Exemption 6 argument arose for the first time in their reply brief, thereby denying the Forest Service the opportunity to respond to those arguments and to cure any shortcomings in its affidavits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Digital Democracy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123635\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/151/#p159\">\n    189 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   163 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 1 (explaining that Plaintiffs would not oppose the Forest Service's filing of a surreply limited to the issue of Exemption 6 \"because of the confusion surrounding\" the withholdings). The court therefore will grant the Forest Service an additional opportunity to address why the withheld names warrant protection under Exemption 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 19, is granted in part and denied in part and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 25, is denied, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   1. The parties' cross-motions are denied as to Exemptions 4 and 9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   2. Defendant's motion is granted as to its withholdings under Exemption 5 pursuant to the deliberative process privilege and the attorney-client privilege.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   3. The parties' cross-motions are denied as to Exemption 6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The parties shall meet and confer and, no later than October 10, 2018, propose a schedule for an additional round of summary judgment briefing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Per the Plaintiffs' request, the court has considered only the arguments contained in the corrected filing of Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 25-1, which replaced Plaintiffs' previous filings at ECF Nos. 20 and 21.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.'

At first, Plaintiffs did not challenge the Exemption 6 withholdings, but later did so in their reply brief, asserting that the Forest Service mistakenly labeled certain name withholdings as protected by FOIA Exemption 4.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Reply at 1-2. Plaintiffs also initially challenged the adequacy of Defendant's search,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Cross-Mot. at 17-18, but later conceded that the Forest Service conducted an adequate search,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Reply at 13-14. Thus, the only issues left for the court to resolve are the propriety of the Forest Service's withholdings under the FOIA Exemptions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    All citations to the 1999 Dames &amp; Moore Report are to the pages electronically generated by CM/ECF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    For these reasons, the court also denies the parties' cross-motions with regard to Exemption 9, which permits agencies to withhold \"geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(9). As the Forest Service notes, \"all of the information the agency withheld under Exemption 9 is also being withheld simultaneously under Exemption 4.\" Rush Decl. \u00b6 22 n.7. Assuming without deciding that the withheld information regarding NWNA's boreholes \"concern[s] wells\" within the meaning of Exemption 9,\n    <em>\n     compare\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Cross-Mot. at 15-16 (arguing that \"bore holes\" are not \"wells\"),\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Lawrence Decl. \u00b6 22 (asserting that \"NWNA's spring water collection facilities at Arrowhead Springs include wells bored into the earth\"), the problem remains that the court cannot ascertain whether the withheld information about NWNA's boreholes is different from the 1999 Dames &amp; Moore report because of the 2003 fire. The court will give the agency another opportunity to address this issue as to Exemption 9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
