BROOKS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Currently pending before the Court are a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 10) and Brief in Support (Doc. 11) filed by Defendants Huntsville School District, Roxanne Enix, and John Does 1-10 (Huntsville School Board members). Plaintiff Jessica McKinney, as next friend and legal guardian of K.P., has submitted a Response in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 17). The Court heard oral argument on the Motion during a hearing held on July 19, 2018, at which time it\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion from the bench. This Opinion and Order memorializes that ruling. To the extent anything written here differs from the Court's pronouncements from the bench, this Opinion and Order controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On Saturday evening, February 24, 2018, K.P., a student at Huntsville High School, posted to social media a photograph of himself wearing a trench coat and beanie while posing with an assault rifle. The photograph did not include a caption. The next morning, after reading several comments mentioning school shootings, K.P. removed the photo and posted a second photograph of himself in the same clothing without the assault rifle. This time, however, he included a caption that read, at least in part, \"If I wanted to make an impact I would choose a much more high profile crowd th[a]n a bunch of hicks and jocks who are never going to be anything of particular value.\" (Doc. 6, p. 13). In the interim, other students from the school viewed the photo and commented on it, and school officials were notified. Over the next several days, concerned parents, students, and teachers contacted the school, requesting to know how the school was going to handle the perceived threat and whether it was safe to come to work or to bring a pupil to the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to these events, K.P. was initially suspended for ten days. Subsequently, the School Board expelled him for 365 days. As part of this year-long expulsion, K.P. will be allowed to take the classes necessary for graduation through an online program called A+, provided to him by the District. This will ensure that he remains eligible to graduate on-time, and any credits that he earns from the program will appear on his transcript and will not note that they were earned through this program while he was expelled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint contends that Defendant Huntsville School District (\"District\") violated K.P.'s free speech (Count I), procedural due process (Count II), and substantive due process rights (Count III). Plaintiff also claims that Defendant Enix (the Huntsville High School Principal) violated K.P.'s free speech rights (Count IV) and also defamed him (Count V). Additionally, Plaintiff claims that John Doe School Board Defendants violated K.P.'s free speech rights (Count VI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Counts III, IV, V, and VI pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. 10). They argue that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for substantive due process violations (Count III) because, in punishing\n   K.P., the District did not act arbitrarily and capriciously but rather in accordance with its legitimate interest in school order and safety. (Doc. 11 at 4). Defendants also argue that qualified immunity protects Enix and the School Board members from damages and therefore request that Counts IV and VI be dismissed. Finally, Defendants argue that the defamation claim (Count V) against Enix should be dismissed due to qualified privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, a pleading must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The purpose of this requirement is to \"give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

In cases applying both of these tests, the Eighth Circuit has upheld a variety of student discipline for off-campus speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.J.W. ex rel. Wilson v.

Thus, it is now well-established law within the Eighth Circuit that under certain circumstances school officials may discipline students for off-campus expressive activity without offending the First Amendment. Differently stated, there is no clearly established right for students to post images that may be threatening to a school or its members or that substantially disrupt the school environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court concludes that Principal Enix and the John Doe School Board Members are entitled to qualified immunity for the actions they took in response to K.P.'s posts. At the time of K.P.'s social media posting, school officials would not have been on notice that they were violating his clearly established rights under the First Amendment. To the contrary, a reasonable school official would have known that, under longstanding Eighth Circuit precedent, schools could discipline students for out-of-school speech without offending the First Amendment when the speech involved school safety or a disruption to the school. Ten days after the Parkland school shootings and in light of existing law, a reasonable school official could reasonably conclude that disciplining K.P. for his conduct was permissible under extant law. Consequently, Principal Enix and the School Board Members are entitled to qualified immunity. As a result, Counts IV and VI of the Complaint will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Count V: Defamation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To establish a claim for defamation under Arkansas law, a Plaintiff must show \"(1) [that] he sustained damages, (2) that [Defendants] published a false statement concerning him, (3) that the statement of the fact was defamatory, (4) that [Defendants] acted with knowledge that the statement was false, and (5) that the publication of the statement was a proximate cause of damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Calvary Christian Sch., Inc. v. Huffstuttler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695600\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/367/117/\">\n    367 Ark. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695600\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/367/117/\">\n    238 S.W.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a plausible claim of defamation. Plaintiff does not plead sufficient facts from which the Court can infer that Defendant Enix made a false statement of fact. Plaintiff makes broad, conclusory statements and points to only one specific instance\n   in which she alleges Defendant Enix defamed K.P. Indeed, she hangs the defamation claim exclusively on Principal Enix's letter to Plaintiff in which she informs Plaintiff that K.P. had been suspended \"because of terroristic threatening of school shooting posts on social media ...\" (Doc 1., \u00b6 19). However, nowhere in the Complaint does Plaintiff allege that this was not the reason for the suspension, which would be necessary for this to qualify as a false statement. Consequently, the defamation claim is insufficiently pleaded and will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There are two final matters before the Court. First, Principal Enix and the John Doe School Board Members appear as Defendants only in Counts IV, V, and VI of the Complaint. Because the Court has dismissed these counts by this Opinion and Order, these Defendants are also entitled to be, and hereby are,\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   from this action. Relatedly, Plaintiff has now learned through discovery the identity of the School Board Members identified only as John Doe Defendants in Count VI. Plaintiff therefore filed a Motion for Leave to Amend (Doc. 20) to substitute their real names for the John Doe designations. However, as Count VI, the only Count in which they appear, has been dismissed, the Motion for Leave to Amend (Doc. 20) is\n   <strong>\n    MOOT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 10) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as follows: Counts III, IV, V, and VI are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants Roxanne Enix and John Does 1-10 are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   from this case, and the Clerk is directed to update the docket sheet to reflect their dismissal from this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend (Doc. 20) is\n   <strong>\n    MOOT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   on this\n   <em>\n    12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of October, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Because the defamation claim is insufficiently pleaded, the Court need not reach the question of whether qualified privilege applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
