This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.

FLOOD'S PETITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   All seven of the remaining claims in Flood's Petition claim that McKenna and Lawlor provided constitutionally ineffective assistance before and during trial.

Though counsel did move for severance from Lighty, which the Court denied, Flood argues that the Court would have granted the motion if it had been made in conjunction with a motion to join with Wilson because the Court would then have had two, rather than three, trials. ECF No. 396-1 at 9-10. Flood asserts that counsel erred in not making such a request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Government responds that joining Flood's trial with Wilson's would not have been feasible. The Government states that it moved to severe Wilson's case initially because it sought to introduce testimony recounting a confession Wilson made to his girlfriend that, under\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968), would have been inadmissible\n   against Flood and Lighty. The Government further responds that \"it is government counsel who determines whether or not to seek a joint trial when it intends to introduce a statement against one defendant that may implicate another defendant under\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   .\" ECF No. 409 at 16. In other words, Flood's counsel would not have been able to file such a motion. Finally, the Government asserts that Flood cannot establish that he was prejudiced by the joint trial with Lighty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court agrees with the Government. Defense counsel could in no way have forced the Government to conduct a joint trial with Flood and Wilson because that would have prevented it from presenting certain other key evidence that was admissible against Wilson. Since such a request by Flood's counsel would have been futile, and counsel has no duty to raise claims that lack a legal basis,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greer v.

Section 924(c) provides that a person who \"during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm\" shall receive a certain mandatory minimum sentence, depending on how the firearm is used. Flood argues that he should have been charged with only one count because his use of a firearm was in support of one continuous crime, i.e. kidnapping resulting in murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This claim has no traction. The Fourth Circuit ruled definitively on this exact issue during Flood's and Lighty's direct appeals, denying both of their claims and finding that there were \"three separate uses of a firearm\" in both Lighty and Flood's cases.\n   <em>\n    Lighty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n    616 F.3d at 370-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel of course cannot be deemed ineffective for not raising an argument that would fail as a matter of law. Claim Three of the Petition is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Claim 5: Counsel Rendered Constitutionally Ineffective Assistance When They Promised Evidence of Flood's Innocence and Good Character but Failed to Provide It.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Flood next claims Attorney McKenna was ineffective in promising evidence of Flood's innocence and good character in his opening statement, but failing to provide such evidence during trial. Flood asserts that this failure left the jury with the impression that Flood had no alternative explanation as to his whereabouts during the crime and that there were no witnesses who could testify to his good character under oath. Indeed, Flood points to the Court's own admonition to McKenna at the bench, warning him not to cross the line between promising to show that the Government had not met its burden of proof and promising to show that Flood did not commit the crime. Hearing Tr. 7/27/17 at 7:2-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government responds that the \"failure to keep a promise made in opening arguments does not constitute ineffective assistance\" and can very well amount to reasonable trial strategy. ECF No. 409 at 21-22. Further, says the Government, the\n   Court's statement to counsel was merely a warning going forward, not a finding of ineffective assistance already committed. Had the Court believed McKenna's representation was constitutionally ineffective to Flood's incurable prejudice, it certainly would have acted on the spot and more definitively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Tr. 7/27/17 at 20:17-21:12. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Though the Court concedes that making promises to a jury that are not fulfilled during trial is risky business, as it noted at trial, there is no basis to that counsel's performance then and there fell below the threshold of effectiveness mandated by the Sixth Amendment. In fact, the Court believes that by cautioning McKenna at the outset from making unfulfillable promises, it prevented him from possibly crossing the line into the realm of ineffective assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Tr. 7/27/17 at 11:17-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In any event, Flood has not established that McKenna's performance during his opening statement prejudiced the outcome of the case, i.e., he has not demonstrated a \"reasonable probability\" that the outcome of the case would have been different but for this supposed error.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It seems highly unlikely-certainly far from the requisite \"reasonable probability\"-that the jury would have reached a different verdict had counsel called character witnesses on Flood's behalf or-against all probability-found a witness to establish an alibi for Flood, a person, by the way, not specifically identified by Flood. In short, what clearly appears to have happened was that trial counsel pulled back from a promise he realized he could not fulfill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 406 at 5. This claim also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     d. Claim 6: Counsel Rendered Constitutionally Ineffective Assistance of Counsel When They Conceded Evidence Sufficient to Support a Finding of Guilt Against Flood.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Flood asserts that counsel rendered ineffective assistance when they conceded that both his car and his cell phone were used during the crime, which, he claims, amounted to a concession that provided sufficient evidence to support his guilt. In particular, Flood asserts that, because only a \"slight connection between the defendant and the conspiracy [is required] to support conviction,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520345\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/1138/#p1147\">\n    957 F.2d 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147 (4th Cir. 1992), the car and cell phone alone were enough to establish his guilt before the jury. ECF No. 396-1 at 23. In other words, according to Flood, by agreeing that these items were used in the crime, his counsel provided the jury with enough circumstantial evidence to convict him of the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court finds it highly unlikely the mere use of Flood's car and his cell phone sufficed to convict Flood of any of the crimes with which he was charged, but again, in any event, Flood was not prejudiced by the arguable concession of these indisputable facts by counsel. There was overwhelming evidence that Flood owned the cell phone and the car that the conspirators used and the jury certainly would have found those facts irrespective of the concession. Recall the testimony of Flood's girlfriend-Tynika Marshall-she \"observed Flood pull his Lincoln Continental up behind her car ... one block from Keating Street [and,] [a]fter seeing Flood, Marshall called him on his cell phone\" approximately fifteen minutes before Hayes was killed.\n   <em>\n    Lighty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n    616 F.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, \"[a]ccording to Marshall, sometime in February 2002, Flood asked her to help him take his Lincoln Continental to North Carolina,\" and this car was later discovered containing drops of Hayes' blood.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 341 &amp; n.21. Marshall's trial testimony alone clearly indicated that Flood's car and cell phone were used during the crime. The jury almost certainly would have decided these facts regardless of whether counsel conceded this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nor was there prejudice with respect to the kidnapping resulting in death charge. As the Fourth Circuit found, the evidence overwhelmingly supported the conclusion that Flood participated in the kidnapping of Hayes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n    at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In support of that contention, the Fourth Circuit stated not only that the use of Flood's car during the crime supported a guilty verdict; it also pointed to a litany of other facts sufficient to support conviction independently.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition to Marshall's testimony just mentioned, the appellate court noted that Flood had arrived with Lighty and Wilson at the location where Wilson instructed Phauls to pick him up minutes after the murder, at a point which was just outside the house which Marshall testified was where she retrieved Flood's car; that Lighty had blood on his shirt when Phauls picked the Defendants up; and that in the car the Defendants spoke of having done something bad to somebody.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, despite counsel conceding what was obvious from testimony-that the car and cell phone used during the crime belonged to Flood-there was strong evidence of Flood's participation in the actual kidnapping based on separate and distinct evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Flood cannot show a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different even if his counsel had not \"conceded\" that his cell phone and car were used during the crime.

Massey was called by Lighty as part of his defense counsel's strategy to imply that Flood and a third man named Tony Mathis, who was then involved with Massey, actually killed Hayes. Massey testified that Flood called Mathis the morning of Hayes' death, and shortly thereafter Flood and Mathis went somewhere.\n   <em>\n    Lighty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/#p336\">\n    616 F.3d at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the same time, Massey agreed with the Government that \"in fact, in January or February of 2002, there were several murders that happened in that neighborhood\" and that she \"[didn't] know which particular murder [she] heard about that [she] associated this incident with.\" Trial Tr. 10/19/05 at 49. That uncertainty would similarly work to Flood's benefit. She was not certain if she could link Flood to Hayes' murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   But Flood claims that Massey's testimony created the impression that Flood may have committed a different violent crime the day Hayes was killed and had the effect of tainting the jury's impression of Flood. ECF No. 396-1 at 25-26. During oral argument on the present Petition,\n   Flood's most recent attorney, Kahn, elaborated on exactly what sort of instruction she would have requested had she been counsel at the trial: \"[Y]ou've heard the implication from this testimony that Mr. Flood was somehow involved in another murder. You are in no way to consider her testimony as evidence that he was involved in another murder or consider the possibility that he was involved in another murder in deliberations in this case.\" Hearing Tr. 7/27/17 at 32:3-10. Well and good.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   However, a juror parsing Massey's testimony would have had to make several logical leaps to extrapolate that Flood and a co-conspirator were involved in another crime. Any implication of such involvement was subtle, if present at all. In that circumstance, reasonable defense counsel could very well have decided not to seek a jury instruction, on the theory that telling the jury not to \"consider [Massey's] testimony as evidence that he was involved in another murder\" would have at run the considerable risk of underscoring for the jury that Flood was indeed involved in possible additional murderous activity. Counsel's performance would thus have been a sound \"strategic decision.\" But in no way was it constitutionally deficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell v.

In fact, Flood does not suggest what sort of plea agreement he would have accepted. He merely states that he wanted to avoid a life sentence and \"was hoping [he] could get a plea and get a lower sentence.\" ECF No. 397-4. This further demonstrates the hollowness of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Toro v.

Notwithstanding this, \"[i]t is settled that \"evidentiary hearings on [\u00a7] 2255 petitions are the exception, not the norm, and there is a heavy burden on the petitioner to demonstrate that an evidentiary hearing is warranted.\"\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v.

Va. Feb. 13, 2012) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As the above discussion on the merits indicates, the Court is satisfied that the files and records of the case \"conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief\" and that, as a result, an evidentiary hearing is not warranted. The facts are not in dispute with regard to trial counsel's performance. Nor is it disputed that no formal offer of a plea was made nor were any details of an offer, including of course the critical component of how much time would have to be served, discussed. Though Flood suggests that an evidentiary hearing is necessary to determine what the Government would have offered if his counsel had pursued plea negotiations and to further determine whether he would have accepted it, ECF No. 417 at 2-3, a hearing would add nothing to the factual predicate already in the record. The Court is especially reticent over \"bringing in this defendant years after the fact to say whatever he may say now,\" particularly given the \"menu of things he can say\" to serve his own interests. Hearing Tr. 7/27/17 at 66:9-15. It would be far too speculative today-twelve years after the fact-to attempt to determine what a hypothetical offer might have been and whether Flood would have accepted this hypothetical offer, including cooperating with the Government. No evidentiary hearing will be held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Flood's Motion to Vacate under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2255 (ECF No. 396) Claims 1-8 are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   The Court will take up Flood's supplemental \u00a7 2255\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim in a subsequent Opinion, pending further briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A separate Order will\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Both Flood and Lighty have also filed supplemental \u00a7 2255 motions (\"supplemental petition\") challenging whether, in the wake of\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.
