INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In June of 2017, Plaintiff Jonathan Otto attended a friend's wedding at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey. To the surprise of the celebrants, President Trump, the owner of the venue, crashed the wedding. The guests seem to have been delighted by the appearance of this unexpected guest, who lingered at the reception to take photographs with the newlyweds and sign autographs. Otto took the opportunity to capture the moment and snapped a photo on his iPhone, and later texted it to another guest at the wedding, Sean Burke. The next morning, Otto discovered that the image had gone viral: it had been published on the social media platform Instagram and in several media outlets, including Esquire.com, operated by Defendant Hearst Communications. Perhaps recognizing a lucrative business opportunity, Otto retained counsel the following day and quickly filed a copyright in the image. Otto brought this action, among several others against various media publishers, alleging that his copyright in the photograph had been infringed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the court are cross motions for partial summary judgment. Otto seeks judgment on Hearst's liability for copyright infringement and the affirmative defenses asserted by Defendant. Pl.'s Memo iso Mot. for Part. Summ. J. (Dkt. No. 36) (\"Pl.'s Memo\"). Defendant seeks judgment on its fair use defense and on whether Hearst's alleged infringement was willful. Def.'s Memo iso Mot. for Part. Summ. J. and Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Dkt. No. 51) (\"Def.'s Memo.\"). Stealing a copyrighted photograph to illustrate a news article, without adding new understanding or meaning to the work, does not transform its purpose-regardless of whether that photograph was created for commercial or personal use. For this reason, among others, Plaintiff's motion is granted in whole and Defendant's motion is denied in whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Photograph was also posted to the social media platform Instagram by Laura Piatowski, a relative of the bride (\"Ms. Piatowski\"). Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 46. It appeared that the news outlets had published the Photograph, among others, after finding them on Ms. Piatowski's Instagram account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 80. Many other photographs depicting President Trump at the wedding were also circulated on the Internet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79, 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That same day, Hearst ran its own article on Esquire's website entitled \"President Trump is the Ultimate Wedding Crasher.\" Compl. \u00b6 11; Esquire Article.

Wade used the photographs from Ms. Piatowski's Instagram in the article, crediting her account as the source of the photos. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 138-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Esquire article reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The most recognizable guest at Kristen Piatowski and Tucker Gladhill's wedding on Saturday night wasn't even invited. President Donald Trump crashed the couple's wedding taking place at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Photos surfaced on Instagram showing the husband and wife smiling with President Trump, who apparently stopped by to greet the couple and shake hands with the guests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Trump has become such a fixture at nuptials at his resorts, the Bedminster club once advertised a Trump appearance as a potential feature of booking a wedding there, according to a now-discontinued brochure obtained by the New York Times:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"If [Trump] is on-site for your big day, he will likely stop in &amp; congratulate the happy couple. He may take some photos with you but we ask you and your guests to be respectful of his time and privacy.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   This was Trump's 24th visit to a golf course since he was elected.

Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 59; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 149. Hearst did not license the Photograph from Otto, nor did it obtain Otto's consent for its use.

Nonetheless, Hearst removed the Photograph from its website after this suit was filed. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 109; Sebastian Decl. \u00b6 15. The photograph is stored on Hearst's servers. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 55. Hearst does not charge for access to Esquire.com, but advertisements were displayed on the web page displaying the Trump article and Hearst earned revenue from those ads. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 157-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The day after the Photograph was published widely on the Internet, Otto hired counsel and registered the Photograph with the Copyright Office.

Hearst argues that summary judgment should be denied on this issue because there exists a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the copyright certificate proffered by Otto actually protects the photograph at issue. Def.'s Memo. at 37-38. This position is based on the fact that the copyright certificate that Otto originally submitted with his briefing did not include a copy of the photograph deposited with the United States Copyright Office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the issue was easily resolved when Otto filed on the docket a certified deposited copy of the copyright registration that included the Photograph, of which he requests the Court take judicial notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Judicial Notice (Dkt. No. 76-78). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, the Court can take judicial notice of a fact not subject to reasonable dispute. Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Here, Hearst has not set forth any evidence that would support a finding that the registration is invalid, and examining the record before the Court, no reasonable juror could find it so.

The day after the Photograph appeared in media outlets, Otto retained the services of counsel who registered his copyright in the Photograph with the United States Copyright Office. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 83-84, 90-92. The first affidavit is from Otto, the second is from defense counsel Richard Liebowitz who supervised the application process, and the third is from Donna Halperin, an employee of the Liebowitz Law Firm who submitted the application. Defendant has moved to strike Ms. Halperin's affidavit on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to disclose her in his Rule 26 disclosures. Def.'s Mot. to Strike (Dkt. No. 55) at 3-4. The Court need not address this issue as the certified and deposited copyright registration and remaining two affidavits are more than sufficient to determine that Otto owned a valid copyright in the Photograph. Thus, regardless of the availability of Ms. Halperin's testimony, a reasonable jury could only find that Otto has satisfied the first element of his infringement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Otto's status as an amateur photographer with an iPhone does not limit his right to engage in sales of his work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Publishing the Photograph without permission essentially destroys the primary market for its use. As the owner of the\n   work, Otto had the right to try to sell the Photograph to media outlets, if he decided to do so. The fact that the Photograph was reported on so widely indicates that there was indeed a market for it. Hearst has done nothing to show that the general audience for Otto's photograph would not be equally satisfied with its version. Thus, the publication can reasonably be expected to harm Plaintiff's ability to license the work for publication and use in derivative works. Because the images are nearly identical, Defendant's unauthorized publication impacts the market for the work-simply put, more supply, less demand. If the practice of using photographs without licensing were to become widespread, \"the market for such images would diminish correspondingly: [i]f media outlets could use such images for free, there would be little or no reason to pay for works.\"\n   <em>\n    Barcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524050\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/339/#p352\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the fourth factor weighs against a finding of fair use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Balance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On balance, weighing the four non-exclusive factors in light of the purposes of copyright, the Court finds that Hearst's use of the image was not fair. The fact that Hearst's commercial use did not transform the Photograph's purpose or add new meaning to the image; the fact that Hearst used the work in its entirety; and the potential harm to any financial opportunities Otto might reasonably pursue for use of the photo, outweigh the fact that the image is factual and published. Allowing a news publisher to poach an image from an individual's social media account for an article that does little more than describe the setting of the image does not promote \"the Progress of science and useful Arts.\" U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castle Rock\n   </em>\n   , 150 F.3d at 141. Accordingly, no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the Hearst on the issue of fair use and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the defense is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court must remind the parties, however, of the \"fact-driven nature\" of the fair use inquiry and thus, the outcome may have been different in a similar scenario.\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

It is not unreasonable to think that the use could be considered fair in another matter involving a news publisher's incorporation of a personal photograph. Though the Court did not find fair use in this particular instance, it does not preclude a finding of fair use in other matters, depending on the balance of the fair use factors. Therefore, the Court emphasizes that a finding of fair use in a matter involving personal photographs used by the media might be readily sustainable on facts other than those presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiff asserts that Hearst acted in bad faith because it \"(a) failed to provide attribution on the Photograph; (b) failed to conduct due diligence concerning the identity; (c) removed the infringing content from its website after this lawsuit was filed; and (d) failed to consult counsel prior to publication.\" The Court is not aware of any cases in this Circuit in which these factors alone indicate bad faith on Defendant's part and reminds Plaintiff that bad faith is not determinative of the first factor's outcome.
