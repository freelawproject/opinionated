Taken in this context, \"Pro\" constitutes a broad commendation relaying a view of an attorney's level of experience or skill that can only be subjective.

The plaintiff does not offer any facts showing that consumers rely on the allegedly misleading Avvo ratings, pro badges, client reviews, or statements by the defendant in choosing or gauging the reputation of an attorney. Nor does the plaintiff offer facts connecting these attributes of the defendant's website to reputational harm or lost business. Moreover, the plaintiff does not offer any basis for, or any evidence corroborating, his belief that he and others similarly situated have suffered any - much less \"many millions of dollars\" of - injury due to the defendant's alleged misrepresentations. The only fact the plaintiff pleaded to support his theory of harm is that the defendant's website holds a prominent presence on the internet, and thus consumers who perform a Google search with phrases like \"top litigation attorney\" will see the website on the first page of results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. The plaintiff has asserted no facts to support a conclusion that any potential clients are likely to be dissuaded from hiring him because of anything that has appeared on the defendant's website. Alleging that the defendant's website has high visibility on the internet does not change the plaintiff's mere subjective belief of harm into something more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, the plaintiff has not alleged sufficiently that the defendant's conduct caused him harm. The plaintiff has therefore failed to state a claim under the Lanham Act or NYGBL \u00a7 349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the parties. To the extent not specifically addressed, the arguments are either moot or without merit. For the reasons explained above, the defendant's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   . The Clerk is directed to enter judgment dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The Clerk is also directed to close all pending motions and to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The plaintiff also takes issue with these descriptive qualities as they relate to the Avvo ratings. The plaintiff contends that the defendant touts attorneys as having these qualities as exemplified by the attorneys' Avvo ratings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp'n at 2. Thus, according to the plaintiff, consumers are misled when linking a description such as \"high quality\" with an allegedly misleading rating system that purports to be objective. But the Avvo ratings - even as they relate to other representations made by the defendant - are constitutionally protected opinions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The plaintiff also alleges that attorneys who pay the defendant for its services receive \"enhanced visibility\" on the defendant's website, dominating the first page of results when a consumer runs a search on the website.

The plaintiff contends that this prominence, \"[w]hen coupled with [the defendant's] claim of objectivity, ... is a misleading statement or description of fact in violation of the Lanham Act.\" Opp'n at 7. But the plaintiff does not expand upon this vague statement. It can be inferred that the plaintiff means that the prominence of paying attorneys is misleading when considered with the defendant's allegedly misleading Avvo ratings, \"Pro\" badges, and representations of attorneys in its advertising. But, as explained above, these features of the defendant's website are nonactionable; and enhancing the visibility of paying attorneys is not misleading in and of itself.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The defendant points out that client reviews do not factor into an attorney's Avvo rating. Def.'s Mem. Ex. M. Thus, whether the defendant removes or refuses to post a negative client review of an attorney is irrelevant to the attorney's Avvo rating. Moreover, counsel for the plaintiff conceded at the argument of the current motion that the plaintiff has no client reviews. Therefore, he is not harmed by any highlighting or prioritizing of his reviews.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
