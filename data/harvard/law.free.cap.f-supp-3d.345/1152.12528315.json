Rather than simply losing the numbers game, Plaintiffs allege that Google's hiring process systematically discriminates against applicants ages 40 and older in violation of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"). The question before the Court is whether these applicants are \"similarly situated\" under the relevant law such that they may proceed collectively in pursuit of their disparate treatment age discrimination claims against Google.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court held a hearing on Google's motion to decertify on July 12, 2018. Having considered the briefing, oral argument, evidentiary record, and applicable law, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have put forth substantial evidence to demonstrate that they are similarly situated. For the reasons that follow, Google's motion to decertify the collective action is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Google LLC (\"Google\") is a global technology company that began as a search engine and has expanded into other areas of software, hardware, and cloud computing. Google's parent company as of October 2015, Alphabet Inc., has a workforce of over 85,000 employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alphabet Announces First Quarter 2018 Results, Press Release, (April 23, 2018), available\n   at: https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/2018Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf. On April 22, 2015, Plaintiff Robert Heath (\"Heath\") initiated this action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated alleging age discrimination against Google under the ADEA and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (\"Compl.\"), ECF 1. Heath alleged that Google failed to hire him when he applied for a software engineer position at age 60 despite Heath's \"highly-pertinent qualifications and experience\" and notwithstanding a Google recruiter deeming Heath a \"great candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the original Complaint, Heath alleged that through its hiring and employment practices, Google engages in a pattern and practice of intentional employment discrimination against individuals who are age 40 and older.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Among other allegations, Heath pointed out that Google's workforce had a median age of 29 years old as of 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. In contrast, workforce statistics from the United States Department of Labor in 2013 indicated a median age of 42.4 years for all U.S. workers. As discussed below, Plaintiffs rely on statistics to support their argument that Google disproportionately fills a large percentage of its workforce with individuals under the age of 40 even though many individuals over 40-such as the class members in the instant suit-are available and well-qualified for the positons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition to an intentional discrimination or \"disparate treatment\" claim under the ADEA, the original Complaint alleged an ADEA disparate impact claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Google moved to dismiss the Complaint on June 11, 2015, ECF 16,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in response, Heath filed a First Amended Complaint as of right. ECF 18 (\"FAC\"). The FAC omitted any allegations concerning a Rule 23 class claim under FEHA, and also voluntarily withdrew the disparate impact claim under the ADEA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, Cheryl Fillekes (\"Fillekes\"), a 47-year-old engineering candidate, joined the case as a named plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8, 32-48. Google answered the FAC and the case proceeded through discovery. ECF 21. Heath subsequently sought leave to file a second amended complaint to re-assert his FEHA age discrimination claim as a class action, which Google opposed. ECF 65, 67. The Court denied Heath's motion on July 29, 2016, reasoning that Heath made no showing of diligence as required to show \"good cause\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16. ECF 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 5, 2016, the Court granted Fillekes' motion to conditionally certify an ADEA collective action and denied Heath's motion for partial joinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 119. The Court conditionally certified Fillekes' proposed collective action consisting of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All individuals who interviewed in-person for any Software Engineer (\"SWE\"), Site Reliability Engineer (\"SRE\"), or Systems Engineer (\"SYSEng\") position with Google in the United States who were age 40 or older at the time of the interview; and were refused employment by Google; and received notice that they were refused employment during the time period from August 28, 2014 through October 5, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8; ECF 121 at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Heath objected to Fillekes' proposed class because it excluded\n   him: Heath only received a phone interview rather than an on-site interview before he was rejected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Thus, Heath proposed a much broader class that the Court declined to certify.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. In its denial, the Court explained that \"Heath's vast class would include every individual applicant over the age of 40 without regard to their qualifications, including, for example, a lawyer applying for a software engineer position. Common sense dictates that Google would have rejected those individuals based on their lack of qualifications, not their age.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, this action proceeded as a conditionally certified collective action with Fillekes as a representative, and Heath remains in this case only as to his individual claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 12, 2016, the Court approved the Opt-In Notice and Consent to Join forms for Fillekes' conditionally certified collective action. ECF 126. Notice was sent to 4,270 individuals and 265 opted in at the time of decertification briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Brian D. Berry (\"Berry Decl.\") \u00b6 2, ECF 252-1. The parties then engaged in vast discovery on both sides, including deposing 34 Opt-In Plaintiffs, deposing Google's Rule 30(b)(6) witness, and propounding written discovery on Google as well as on 75 randomly-selected Opt-Ins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Meanwhile, on August 1, 2017, Fillekes and the Opt-In Plaintiffs moved for leave to file a second amended complaint (\"SAC\") in which they sought to re-allege an ADEA disparate impact claim based on recent district case law indicating that applicants as well as employees had standing to bring a disparate impact claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 187. Google opposed the motion, but the Court granted Plaintiffs leave on the grounds that \"[w]hether applicants may allege disparate impact claims under the ADEA is a novel question in the Ninth Circuit, and the parties were limited in their briefing on the issue in the context of Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend.\" ECF 219 at 4. Rather than deem Plaintiffs' disparate impact claim futile under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, the Court found that the issue warranted full briefing on the merits in the context of a motion to dismiss the disparate impact claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 11, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") in the record. ECF 218. Google moved to dismiss the disparate impact claim, ECF 227, and the Court held a hearing on January 11, 2018. The Court granted Google's motion to dismiss the disparate impact claim with prejudice, finding that Fillekes waived her disparate impact claim by failing to re-plead it in the FAC after it was voluntarily withdrawn over two years ago. ECF 235. Accordingly, the Court did not reach the issue of whether the ADEA authorizes disparate impact claims brought by applicants for employment along with employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 26, 2018, Google answered the SAC. ECF 237.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Google now moves to decertify the collective action on the grounds that the collective, whose members allege a single cause of action for intentional age discrimination under the ADEA, are not \"similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 252 (\"Mot.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Plaintiffs oppose, arguing that the Plaintiffs are similarly situated and decertification would be improper in this pattern-or-practice case under the framework set forth in\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/#p360\">\n    431 U.S. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/#p360\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1670\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/324/#p360\">\n    52 L.Ed.2d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 258 (\"Opp'n\"). The Court held a\n   hearing on Google's motion to decertify on July 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As motions for decertification come at the end of discovery with a well-developed evidentiary record, the Court begins with an overview of the evidence pertaining to Google's hiring practices and the experiences of the Plaintiffs. The Court then turns to its analysis of the commonly adopted\n   <em>\n    Leuthold\n   </em>\n   factors to determine whether Plaintiffs are similarly situated pursuant to \u00a7 216(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leuthold v.

Google's Hiring Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Google hires technical employees by relying on feedback from numerous Google engineers in a multi-stage process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Brian Ong (\"Ong Decl.\") Exh. 249-5 \u00b6 16. The first step after resume review is for a candidate to pass an initial phone screen. Only [redacted] of all technical applicants are contacted by a Google recruiter for an initial phone screen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kotchen Decl. Exh. 2 at 10. Once a candidate passes the initial screen, the next step is a Technical Phone Screen (\"TPS\") where the candidate is asked to write code, formulate algorithms, and/or answer substantive questions. Ong Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Approximately [redacted] of applicants move on to the TPS. Kotchen Decl. Exhs. 2, 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   TPS interviewers then submit their interview scores, comments, and notes in Google's internal applicant tracking system: gHire.

Roughly [redacted] of all applicants make it to the on-site interview stage. Kotchen Decl. Exh. 2 at 10.

If the feedback indicates \"[redacted] the recruiter normally advances the candidate to review by a Hiring Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Approximately [redacted] of applicants make it to the Hiring Committee. Kotchen Decl. Exh. 2 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Google has numerous Hiring Committees [redacted] come [redacted] Ong Decl. \u00b6 23. Hiring Committees for SWE, SRE, and SysEng positions are usually comprised of [redacted] engineers with relevant engineering and interview experience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The Hiring Committee members have never met the candidates and base their reviews on the candidate's \"dossier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Each candidate's \"dossier\" is a compilation of a candidate's interview notes, internal referral notes, internal reference notes, and resume.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.

Exh. 8 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Google's multi-stage interview and hiring process discriminates against applicants ages 40 and older in violation of the ADEA.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SAC. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that Google intentionally discriminates against older workers by: (1) collecting age-related data from applicants, which allows interviewers and senior staff to estimate applicants' ages; (2) emphasizing abstract, theoretical interview questions of the type currently taught and tested in school, which Google interviewers themselves admit favor recent graduates; (3) discounting real-world experience; (4) using higher standards for older, more \"senior\" applicants than are used for younger applicants for the same positions; and (5) emphasizing \"Googleyness\" or \"cultural fit,\" which Plaintiffs allege is effectively a euphemism for youth. SAC \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, these five aspects of Google's alleged discriminatory hiring process work in combination to disadvantage applicants for technical positions ages 40 and older. The exhibits and depositions attached to the parties' briefing show evidence related to each of these five aspects of the allegedly discriminatory practice. First, Plaintiffs point to evidence that in 2015, Google began requesting applicants to disclose the start and end dates for their educational history on their application forms prior to attending an on-site interview.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Daniel Kotchen (\"Kotchen Decl.\"), ECF 258-1, Exh. 11,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Kotchen Decl. Exh 12. Moreover, several Opt-In Plaintiffs testified at their depositions that Google recruiters specifically asked them to disclose their graduation and employment dates.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Kotchen Decl. Exh. 17 (Google recruiter e-mail to applicant on July 23, 2016 stating: \"Need start and end dates for University(ies) attended AND all companies you've worked - be sure to include month and year.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Kotchen Decl. Exh. 19 (Google recruiter e-mail to applicant on October 16, 2015 asking: \"What years did you attend college?\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs provide evidence that Google's on-site interviewers focus on abstract and theoretical questions that-by the interviewers' own admissions-favor recent graduates with recent classroom experience. For example, one interviewer commented that the problem posed to the applicant was \"[redacted] [The applicant] is clearly far removed from this environment.\" Kotchen Decl. Exh. 27 at 14. The interviewer went on to opine: \"I personally succeeded at interviewing for a position at Google when I was fresh out of grad school. If I were to be interviewed today, five years later, I'm not confident that I would fare as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs provide evidence from several Opt-In deposition transcripts and discovery responses indicating that Google interviewers discount real world experience by not asking questions (or asking cursory questions) to the majority of applicants about their prior work experience or skillset.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compilation Exhibit C, ECF 257-10, Exhs. C1-C53.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, one Opt-In recalled: \"While I had over 18 years of professional experience in the embedded industry at the time of my interview,\n   the interviewers' questions did not relate to my work experience, and did not take into consideration my work history.\" Compilation Exhibit C12 at 1. Another Opt-In explained: \"A number of questions were unrelated to the position at issue ... and did not touch on my almost thirty years of professional experience in the industry. I felt that these interview questions did not take into consideration my work history or skill set, and were not related to my suitability for the position.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exh C23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fourth, the Opt-Ins testified that they felt Google held them to a higher standard because of their age, evidenced by interviewers asking older applicants more difficult interview questions, requiring more polished technical answers, and considering older applicants for higher-level job positions only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compilation Exhibit D, ECF 257-11; Compilation Exhibit F, ECF 257-15. Fifth and finally, Plaintiffs provide evidence that certain Opt-Ins were rejected based on their lack of \"Googleyness\" or \"cultural fit,\" which Plaintiffs argue is effectively a euphemism for youth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compilation Exhibit E, ECF 257-14. As one Opt-In Plaintiff recalls following the on-site interview, the recruiter \"informed me that I was not a good fit for the Software Engineer position and that the hiring committee had rejected my candidacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exh. E3 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In contrast, Google argues that the evidence shows that the only corporate policy in evidence is Google's \"Equal Employment Opportunity Policy\" that prohibits employment discrimination of any kind, including age discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Brian D. Berry (\"Berry Decl.\"), ECF 252-1, Exh. 42. Google's Rule 30(b)(6) witness further testified that Google trains interviewers and Hiring Committee members on conscious and unconscious bias.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Exh 44 at 76:9-18, 86:6-87:5, 101:11-102:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The record indicates that Google makes offers to only [redacted] of candidates who receive on-site interviews.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Expert Report of Dr. John Johnson at 4, 12 (\"Johnson Report\") Berry Decl. Exh. 43. However, Plaintiffs present statistical evidence that their expert opines is strongly consistent with age discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Expert Report of Dr. David Neumark (\"Neumark Report\"), Kotchen Decl. Exh. 21. Plaintiffs' expert report indicates that during the relevant period, [redacted] of younger applicants who received on-site interviews at Google received job offers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 36. Only [redacted] of older applicants who interviewed on-site during the Class Period received offers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This results in a statistically significant disparity of [redacted] standard deviations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The statistical likelihood that such a disparity is due to chance is less than [redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, Plaintiffs' expert used Google's data to show t[redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (explaining that statistical analysis \"shows a negative effect of experience on the probability of a job offer.\") Plaintiffs further point to national statistics to support their position that Google's workforce with a median age of 29 is \"grossly disproportionate\" to the labor market for the relevant IT services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 5; SAC \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Experiences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As discussed at length in this Court's prior order conditionally certifying Fillekes' proposed class, Plaintiffs in this case are technical candidates for SWE, SRE, or SysEng positions at Google who were age 40 or older at the time of their on-site interviews and received notice that they were refused employment by Google between August 28, 2014 and October 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 119, ECF 121. Plaintiffs present evidence that these three engineering positions share similar and overlapping\n   job responsibilities, such as writing code and troubleshooting/problem solving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kotchen Decl. Exhs. 3-7. Moreover, Plaintiffs were all among the [redacted] of applicants to make it to the on-site interview stage. Fillekes herself interviewed with Google on four separate occasions and although she reached the in-person interview stage each time, she never received an employment offer. ECF 119 at 2. In contrast, Google rejected Heath, who is not a member of the conditionally certified collective, after a phone interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. This Court declined to certify Heath's proposed collective of\n   <em>\n    all technical applicants\n   </em>\n   age 40 and older because it would have included an unknown number of \"applicants\" who demonstrated no plausible qualifications for the job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After their on-site interviews for technical positions at Google, Plaintiffs were each denied employment. Google submits evidence that [redacted] of the Plaintiffs made it to the Hiring Committee before they were rejected while the remainder never advanced to the Hiring Committee stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johnson Report at 21-22. In moving for decertification, Google points to differences in the interview experience and evaluation of each candidate to show that Plaintiffs' factual allegations and legal claims, as well as Google's defenses, are unique as to each Opt-In Plaintiff and must be tried individually.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. at 3-7.

However, the Court would be remiss to ignore the two-phase approach under the\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   framework in evaluating the\n   <em>\n    Leuthold\n   </em>\n   factors. In particular, the Court must consider what evidence would be offered\n   at phase one and phase two of a\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   trial in considering whether collective adjudication is fair and manageable. Ultimately, the Court finds that Google emphasizes differences that largely apply to phase two of a\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   trial, or go to the merits of the dispute and are more appropriate for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As discussed at the July 12, 2018 hearing, the parties have presented the Court with polarizing alternatives: to accept Google's argument would result in decertification in every instance, whereas to accept Plaintiffs' position would permit every\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   case to defeat decertification. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the answer lies somewhere in between.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Teamsters\n    </em>\n    Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Before turning to the\n   <em>\n    Leuthold\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court addresses Plaintiffs' argument that the Court should apply the\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework to this ADEA case. Plaintiffs' disparate treatment theory is that Google engages in a systematic pattern-or-practice of discriminating against applicants age 40 and older in violation of the ADEA by instituting a hiring process that knowingly and intentionally treats older individuals adversely while treating younger individuals preferentially, and disproportionately filling its workforce with younger individuals when there are many individuals age 40 and older who are available and well-qualified for the positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 60, 62-66. Neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit has addressed whether pattern-or-practice claims apply in ADEA collective actions.

Instead, Plaintiffs premise their disparate treatment theory on Google's overarching \"umbrella\" hiring policy that encompasses at least five different components that combine to intentionally discriminate against older workers. Thus, even if the record shows that some Plaintiffs were ensnared by different filters than others, there is substantial evidence that Plaintiffs' experiences were similar because they were all subject to the same allegedly discriminatory scheme. Whether these five factors allegedly embedded in Google's hiring process were actually discriminatory and whether Google utilized them as its \"standard operating procedure\" are merits questions that are not before the Court at decertification. The Court's inquiry at decertification is limited to whether Plaintiffs have shown they are similarly situated and not whether Google actually has such a policy-an issue the Court expects that the parties will brief extensively in their dispositive motions. Nor are Plaintiffs required to show evidence of a \"smoking gun\" such as a memo from Google executives instructing interviewers to use the hiring criteria to eliminate older candidates.

Rather, Google argues that the evidence is too varied to allow the jury to determine that there was a pattern or practice at all. The Court is not persuaded that any of Google's potential defenses require individualized determinations at phase one. And permitting Google to decertify the class before phase one based on individualized defenses that are only applicable at phase two would improperly deprive Plaintiffs of the opportunity to prevail at phase one in order to trigger the presumption of discrimination at phase two.\n   <em>\n    Thiessen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500362\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/1095/#p1102\">\n    267 F.3d at 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Google has not shown that its individualized defenses properly asserted in phase one outweigh the clear benefits to proceeding as a collective action at phase one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This Court has the discretion to examine the relevant factors for maintaining a collective action, and the Court is not convinced\n   that the prospect of individual defenses would render a phase one trial unmanageable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moss v.

Google makes three arguments that maintaining this case as a collective action would be neither fair nor efficient. The Court has already considered and found unpersuasive two of Google's three arguments under this factor. First, Google argues that collective treatment raises due process concerns because the case would devolve into \"mini-trials\" due to the lack of representative testimony. Mot. at 23-24. Second, Google makes the contention-already rejected above-that pattern-or-practice claims are not cognizable under the ADEA, or alternatively, are irrelevant to the decertification analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Similarly, the Court has already rejected Google's third argument that Plaintiffs' statistical evidence is flawed and not significant at decertification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. The Court therefore need only address Google's due process argument under the third\n   <em>\n    Leuthold\n   </em>\n   factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Contrary to Google's assertion, this case is unlike\n   <em>\n    Benedict v.

Cal. July 13, 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Benedict\n   </em>\n   , this Court decertified an FLSA collective action in part because Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that collective members are \"substantially similar such that certain Members could offer representative testimony to cover the experiences of all Members.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203742342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Benedict\n   </em>\n   did not proceed under a\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   pattern-or-practice framework, and Google's due process argument in this case is based in part on its flawed assumption that\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   does not apply at decertification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The proposed\n   <em>\n    Teamsters\n   </em>\n   trial plan reduces any concerns regarding the jury's ability to review the evidence and determine Google's liability at phase one. For similar reasons to those discussed above, the jury need not \"keep individual Plaintiffs straight\" when hearing testimony, for example, that some candidates were rejected based on cultural fit while others had their professional experience ignored.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 15. The evidence regarding Plaintiffs' interview experiences does not conflict because Plaintiffs' theory is that Google's discriminatory hiring practice included at least five aspects-any one of which could have resulted in an older candidate not receiving an offer. When the five challenged aspects of Google's hiring process are considered in conjunction rather than disjunctively, there is little risk at phase one that an Opt-In Plaintiff's testimony would misrepresent the claims of\n   others. Accordingly, the Court finds that Google's due process argument and the cases on which it relies are inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs persuasively argue that proceeding collectively would actually safeguard Plaintiffs' due process rights. Opp'n at 20. This is because the individual plaintiffs \"are less able to bear the cost of separate trials because they have fewer resources\" than Google and a collective action provides Plaintiffs with a fair and full opportunity to adjudicate their age discrimination claims.\n   <em>\n    Glass v. IDS Financial Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872774\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/778/1029/#p1081\">\n    778 F.Supp. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1081-82 (D. Minn. 1991) (holding that a collective action is the most fair and efficient way to resolve the ADEA lawsuit in light of due process considerations). Because Plaintiffs have shown they were all subject to the same allegedly violative hiring policy during their on-site interviews at Google, and proceeding individually on their age discrimination claims would be too costly to be practical, the Court concludes that both procedural and fairness considerations weigh in favor of proceeding collectively. In any event, because the FLSA is a remedial statute that should be broadly construed, close calls regarding collective treatment should be resolved in favor of certification.\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.
