JUUL argues that the Tobacco Control Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20387\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (\"TCA\") preempts plaintiffs' claims. It is partially correct concerning its product labelling, because the TCA is very detailed about what must appear on the label. But claims that JUUL misrepresents the amount of nicotine in its product are not preempted. JUUL also moves to dismiss plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC), because it fails to meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirements, to state a claim, and to identify applicable state laws. As discussed below, I grant in part and deny in part JUUL's motion to dismiss, with leave to amend. JUUL's motion to strike plaintiffs' nationwide class allegations pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(f), 23(c)(1)(A), and 23(d)(1)(D) is not ripe and is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are thirteen individuals from seven states: California, New Jersey, Washington, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, and Massachusetts.

First, plaintiffs allege that that JUUL should have warned consumers that the pharmacokinetics of JUUL's nicotine formulation contained in JUUL's pods utilizes benzoic acid to create nicotine salts, delivering an exceptionally potent dose of nicotine compared to traditional cigarettes. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 78-92.

Plaintiffs believe that JUUL should be required to warn consumers of the pharmacokinetics, i.e. greater potency its benzoic acid and nicotine salt formulation delivers. If plaintiffs' claims were allowed to go forward in this respect, it would constitute a usurpation of the power vested in the FDA by Congress to regulate the content of the warnings on covered tobacco products. Plaintiffs' labelling claims are preempted to the extent\n   that they are related to JUUL's failure to warn consumers that pharmacokinetics of their formulation, even at a similar percentage of nicotine, is more potent than it would be in a traditional cigarette due to its chemical makeup. JUUL may only be required to comply with the labeling requirements as articulated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201143.3\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1143.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(2).

What Claims Survive Preemption?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims are essentially based on either JUUL's labelling and advertising. As discussed above, I find that\n   only claims based on the allegation that the product labelling fails to warn consumers that JUUL's nicotine formulation is more addictive than other methods of nicotine ingestion are expressly preempted. Any claims based on the mislabeling of the percentage of nicotine per pod are not preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further, I find that this distinction does not extend to advertisements. The TCA contains a subsection titled \"EXCEPTION\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [The preemption clause] does not apply to requirements relating to the sale, distribution, possession, information reporting to the State, exposure to, access to, the advertising and promotion of, or use of, tobacco products by individuals of any age, or relating to fire safety standards for tobacco products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 387p(2)(B). The exception clause expressly excepts advertisements from preemption and no aspect of plaintiffs' claims based on an allegedly misleading or fraudulent advertising is preempted by the TCA, including the issue of warning consumers about the potency and addictiveness of JUUL's benzoic acid and nicotine salt formulation.

Plaintiffs' second cause of action only identifies the relevant laws of Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Washington for the definition of \"persons.\" FAC \u00b6 188.

Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that at least Plaintiff Colgate relied on JUUL's representation that the pods contained a formulation of 5% nicotine when plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the pods contain a formulation of 6.2% nicotine. FAC \u00b6 13. I find that Colgate's reliance on JUUL's representation of the amount of nicotine in each pod to be approximately equivalent to the amount of nicotine in a pack of cigarettes was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   JUUL's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' identified consumer protection statutes in plaintiffs' second and fourth causes of action based on JUUL's product labelling is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As applied to JUUL's advertisements, plaintiffs have not specifically identified what advertisements they saw and what statements in the advertisements were allegedly false, misleading, or unfair. This lack of specificity is insufficient to state a claim under the identified state consumer protection statutes. JUUL's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' identified consumer protection statutes in plaintiffs' second and fourth causes of action based on JUUL's advertisements is granted with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

It contends that because plaintiffs' other claims fail, the unjust enrichment claim would be duplicative and must necessarily fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As I have found that several plaintiffs' claims survive JUUL's motion to dismiss, plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim is not duplicative.

As stated above, allegations relating to the pharmacokinetics and role of benzoic acid are preempted by the TCA and FDA Rule. For the purposes of deciding this motion to dismiss, I accept as true that JUUL has misrepresented the amount of nicotine in each pod. The question here is whether plaintiffs have shown that they reasonably or justifiably relied on JUUL's representation that the pods\n   contained a formulation of 5% nicotine when they alleged that the pods contain a formulation of 6.2% nicotine. Plaintiff Colgate asserts that he relied on JUUL's representation that a JUUL pod had an equivalent amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes when he purchased JUUL's ENDS and pods in an effort to curtail his nicotine addiction and quit smoking. FAC \u00b6 13.
