Educational institutions must meet certain requirements to participate in these financial-assistance programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2016, the Department promulgated regulations adding new requirements for institutions that offer distance-education or correspondence-course programs.\n   <em>\n    Program Integrity and Improvement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2092%2C232\">\n    81 Fed.

Section 668.50 of the regulations (the \"Disclosure Rule\") required the institutions to issue certain disclosures, both publicly and individually, to their enrolled and prospective students (collectively, the \"Disclosures\"). Among other things, the Disclosure Rule required the educational institutions to disclose (1) any adverse actions that a state entity or an accrediting agency might have initiated against them and (2) whether their educational programs that prepare students for jobs in fact satisfy the educational requirements for state licensing or certification for those jobs (e.g., whether a program that prepares students to become teachers satisfies the educational requirements for its students to get teaching certificates).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2092%2C232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2092%2C232\">\n    at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,262 -63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Disclosure Rule was set to go into effect on July 1, 2018. Following a change in presidential administrations, however, the Department issued a new rule in the summer of 2018 (the \"Delay Rule\"), delaying the effective date of the Disclosure Rule from July 1, 2018 to July 1, 2020 and raising the prospect that it would revise and reconsider the Disclosure Rule entirely.\n   <em>\n    Program Integrity and Improvement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C296\">\n    83 Fed.

The plaintiffs allege that the Department failed to comply with certain statutory requirements in promulgating the Delay Rule and that the Delay Rule thus is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (the \"APA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Department moves to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on the ground that the plaintiffs do not have Article III standing. The Department argues that the plaintiffs (1) have not suffered an injury in fact (2) that is fairly traceable to the Department (3) that is redressable. The Department argues that the loss of the Disclosures does not constitute an injury in fact caused by the Department. The Department also argues that any purported harm to the plaintiffs is speculative and conjectural. The plaintiffs respond that they are being deprived of information that they would have received in the Disclosures and that they would use that information to make decisions about whether to continue to spend their time and money in continuing in their online-education programs. The plaintiffs argue that the loss of this information is an injury in fact and\n   that this injury is fairly traceable to the Department's actions in issuing the Delay Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court denies the Department's motion to dismiss.

Students also may not receive other information about an institution, such as information about refund policies or whether a program meets certain State licensure requirements. This information could help students identify programs that offer credentials that potential employers recognize and value; delaying the requirement to provide these disclosures may require students that desire this information to obtain it from another source or may lead students to choose sub-optimal programs for their preferred courses of study. We note, however, that the Department has never required ground-based campuses to provide this information to students, including campuses that enroll large numbers of students from other States. Thus, for students who attend on-ground campuses, the program they completed may meet licensure requirements in the State in which the campus is located but not licensure requirements in other States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   We recognize that the burden of the delay does fall on students and believe that the description of the effects of the delay reflects this. However, as noted in the Analysis of Comments section in this preamble, many students will still receive sufficient disclosures regarding distance education programs during the period of the delay due to steps institutions have already taken to comply with the 2016 final regulations.... The Department maintains its position that, in allowing reconsideration of the 2016 final regulations to provide institutions greater clarity on key issues, the benefits of the delay of the selected provisions are greater than the potential costs to students of the delayed disclosures and complaint processes that could already be accessible from other sources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2031%2C296\">\n    at 31,298, 31,301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Disclosures that say, for example, that the plaintiffs' educational programs meet all state licensing and certification requirements, or that their schools have never been subject to adverse action by a state or accrediting agency, would engender a different reaction from Disclosures that the programs do not meet state requirements and that their schools are under investigation by a dozen state attorneys general for fraud. The plaintiffs' inability to say at this juncture what the Disclosures would say, and thus to say how they would react, does not render their injury hypothetical or speculative. Their loss of the Disclosures and the opportunity to use them to make a more informed decision is itself a concrete injury.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/#p19\">\n    524 U.S. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181205\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/11/#p19\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They fail to allege, for example, that such information is not publicly available (e.g., on an institution's website) or that they have attempted to obtain such information by contacting the institution directly but have been rebuffed.... [T]he Court should reject Plaintiffs' theory of standing because, to the extent Plaintiffs have suffered any harm, it is self-inflicted. Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge that they may be able to obtain the requested information even absent the 2016 Rule.

The court is not persuaded. When it issued the Disclosure Rule, the Department estimated that it would take an educational institution an average of 100 hours per program to research and disclose the job licensing and certification requirements called for by the Disclosure Rule, plus 15 hours to research and disclose the other required information (adverse actions by state or accrediting agencies, refund policies, etc.) - time the Department valued at $3,655.00 for the program-specific disclosures and $548.25 for the other disclosures.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2092%2C232\">\n    81 Fed.

Plaintiffs say they are harmed because the ballots cast for NOTC are not given legal effect, yet they do not actually ask that, as the remedy for this injury, the Secretary of State be ordered to give legal effect to such ballots. Rather, they demand that the option of casting a ballot for NOTC be entirely removed from the Nevada election system. As a result, if plaintiffs were to prevail in this lawsuit, voters' opposition to named candidates would not be given legal effect, but instead voters would no longer have the opportunity to affirmatively express their opposition at the ballot box at all. The relief plaintiffs seek will therefore\n    <em>\n     decrease\n    </em>\n    their (and other voters') expression of political speech rather than increase it, worsening plaintiffs' injury rather than redressing it....
