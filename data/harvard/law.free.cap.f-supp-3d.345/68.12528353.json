The perpetrators were members of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), a group since found to be terrorists by the United States Department of State. In 2008, his family sued FARC and Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda, also known as Simon Trinidad, under the Antiterrorism Act. After this Court found Defendants liable for Mr. Pescatore's death, this case trailed a related case in Florida\n   for years; that case has now settled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Returning to the District of Columbia, Mr. Pescatore's family seeks $240 million in damages.

Many substances trigger depression systems like lethargy, sadness and hopelessness. In addition, many depressed individuals reach for drugs or alcohol as a way to raise their spirits or to numb painful thoughts and anxieties.

These events were unexpected and had an immense effect on each member of Mr. Pescatore's family. Twice, Olivia was unable to care for her family for months after her husband's kidnapping and almost had nervous breakdowns; Josh dropped out of high school and turned to drugs; Jada felt as if \"someone had reached into my chest and ripped my heart out\"; Jarrod felt \"cripple[d]\" when he saw friends with their fathers; Jordan experienced \"mental struggles, addictions, pain, loneliness and grief\"; Frank Sr. collapsed emotionally and never regained full health; Carol experienced \"an indescribable pain that never completely goes away\"; Richard felt guilt for not having done more to help Frank; and John felt the immediate and long-term loss of a beloved older brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to factor two, Mr. Pescatore's kidnapping and murder was clearly the result of intentional malice, not negligence. Indeed, as the only non-Colombian in his group, he was the only one taken so that his captors could extort a ransom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Facts related to the third factor, medical treatment, are not well substantiated in the record. The Court has only hints that one or more of the family members sought treatment for depression or other disorders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In a factor that is difficult upon examination,\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   suggests that the \"closeness\" of plaintiff to the decedent should contribute to an award for solatium damages.\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/#p30\">\n    999 F.Supp. at 31-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties' declarations show that Olivia and Frank Sr. were very close to Mr. Pescatore and that all of Mr. Pescatore's children felt an immense and wrenching loss at his death. While his siblings were also deeply affected by Mr. Pescatore's death, they were all adults and lived separate lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The last\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   factor seeks to identify the duration of each person's excessive grief and to compensate for that. Again, Olivia and Frank Sr. clearly suffered until at least 2016. Josh turned away from the family and to alcohol and drugs for his pain and guilt, recovered, relapsed in 2011, and has basically had a serious drug addiction since his father's death. His status after 2016 is not known. Jada, Jarrod, Jordan, Richard, and John Pescatore and\n   Carol Harpster all were reported to be in good health in 2011. This statement is not meant to suggest that their grief had ended or that they no longer thought about or missed Frank Pescatore; that result may never come. On a comparative scale, however, their grief seems to have materially abated over the years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition to consideration of the factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   , \"[c]ompensatory damages awards to family members of the victim of a terrorist attack are generally determined by the nature of the relationship.

Whether any monetary award so long after the terrorizing events can otherwise bring further solace, the law attempts to perform that function.

Having sat with each Plaintiff for one day some 20 years after the underlying events, Dr. Strous reaches essentially the same clinical diagnosis for each Plaintiff: Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder (moderate); PTSD (partial); and sometimes Persistent Depressive Disorder (moderate). Different Plaintiffs report suffering from a wide range of effects over various durations and yet have the same diagnoses. Dr. Strous formulaically repeats that each Plaintiff displays \"some form\" of these conditions \"either currently or in the past\" and that these conditions \"may even be permanent,\" even though\n    <em>\n     when\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     for how long\n    </em>\n    each Plaintiff was affected weighs on the Court's judgment; indeed, Dr. Strous does not explain how a condition present only in the past, but not currently, could be permanent. The Court appreciates the expertise Dr. Strous brings to his psychiatric evaluations and the passage of time with which he was dealing but, as indicated, relies more on Plaintiffs' (very helpful) statements to him, the health update they provided in 2011 (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , Pls.' Health Update), and their declarations here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Plaintiffs also ask the Court to deem them \"crime victim judgment creditors with perfected liens on proceeds derived from drug trafficking criminal activities.\" Dmg.
