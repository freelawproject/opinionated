Grecco contracts with clients through Michael Grecco Productions (\"MGP\"), his photography studio and business. This matter arises from a copyrighted photograph that Grecco took for Barron's, a financial news outlet. Valuewalk, LLC is a competitor of Barron's, owned and operated by Jacob Wolinsky. After the Barron's article was published, Valuewalk issued its own article on the same subject, illustrated by a photograph identical to the one Grecco had taken-without MGP's permission. MGP brought this action, alleging that Valuewalk and Wolinsky directly infringed on its copyright in the image, that Wolinsky is vicariously and contributorily liable for Valuewalk's infringement, and that Valuewalk and Wolinsky have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by intentionally removing the information identifying Grecco as the author of the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court are cross motions for partial summary judgment.

Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   , Wolinsky's path crossed with Valuewalk's on a daily basis and he was in a position to control the activities responsible for the underlying infringement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3910932\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/378/110/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Defendants also cite to\n   <em>\n    Mayimba Music Inc.\n   </em>\n   to support their argument that mere ownership is insufficient to establish vicarious liability, but that case is similarly inapplicable. In\n   <em>\n    Mayimba\n   </em>\n   , the defendant had little involvement with the infringer, as it was only a parent company.\n   <em>\n    Mayimba Music, Inc. v.

Aug. 19, 2014). Wolinsky's relationship with Valuewalk was not akin to that of a parent and its subsidiary, as in\n   <em>\n    Mayimba\n   </em>\n   . Wolinsky was the owner, CEO, and sole member of the company and operated the company on a full-time basis. Wolinsky worked directly with the company's employees and contractors.\n   <em>\n    Mayimba\n   </em>\n   is clearly not on point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The legal standard for vicarious liability requires that Wolinsky had the\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to supervise or control the infringing activities.\n   <em>\n    Gershwin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"774074\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/443/1159/#p1162\">\n    443 F.2d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The non-transformative purpose of Valuewalk's commercial use of the image; the fact that Defendants used the image in its entirety; and the potential harm to Plaintiff's business model outweigh the neutral fact that the image is creative and published. Allowing a commercial competitor to use a substantially identical, creative image to illustrate an article-the exact purpose as the work's original use-does not promote \"the Progress of science and useful Arts.\" U.S. Const., art.

Many of the issues relevant to contributory liability are discussed in other parts of this opinion. As the Court has described in other sections of this opinion, there are material issues of fact regarding Wolinsky's level of involvement with the infringement. Therefore, summary judgment on Wolinsky's liability for contributory infringement is denied on similar grounds as his liability for direct and vicarious infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   To be liable for contributory infringement, Wolinsky must have had knowledge of the underlying direct infringement and engaged in personal conduct that induced, caused, or materially contributed to the infringing conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arista Records, LLC v.

Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at 10. However, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Wolinsky should have known what content was published on his website or that he was willfully blind to any infringement, since he admitted to ignoring prior notifications of copyright infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wolinsky Dep. at 134:9-18; Ex. 13 to Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt.

(ECF No. 92-21) (\"Effie Gang Email Chain\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Defendants also claim that Wolinsky did not engage in substantial conduct that \"encouraged or assisted the infringement.\" Defs.' Mot. for Part. Summ. J. at 10. Wolinsky correctly agrees that \"[t]he fact that an individual is president and shareholder of a company is insufficient on its own to create secondary liability for a corporation's copyright infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Stanacard, LLC v. Rubard, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-cv-5176,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20462508\">\n    2016 WL 462508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (S.D.N.Y.

Valuewalk Assignment Email. However, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Wolinsky's role as the supervisor of that assignment demonstrates that he did have reason to know of any subsequent changes. A jury could similarly find that Wolinsky's receipt of advertising funds from the site did create a sufficient financial interest in using an infringing photo to make the page visually appealing and draw readers to the site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Wolinsky's liability for contributory infringement is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on the claim that Defendants violated provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"the DMCA\").

At the same time, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are in violation of Section 1202(b)(3), which prohibits the distribution of works or copies of works, with the knowledge \"that copyright management information has been removed or altered without authority of the copyright owner or the law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). For both provisions, the defendant must know or have reasonable grounds to know that \"it will induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement\" to be found liable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Barron's Article. There is a material issue of fact as to whether Defendants knew the CMI existed, and whether any removal of CMI was intentional, as required by the DMCA. Defendants contend that the CMI was only accessible with a valid subscription to Barron's. Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 88-90. They maintain that without evidence in the record that Defendants owned a subscription to Barron's, Plaintiff cannot show that any person at Valuewalk had knowledge of the CMI because the image could have been downloaded directly from Google, or directly from the Barron's server. Defs.' Mot. for Part. Summ. J. at 14. Defendants further argue that there is no evidence of any intentional, rather than inadvertent, CMI removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   However, a reasonable trier of fact could find for the Plaintiff on all points. The Valuewalk pages containing the work reference the Barron's article, supporting a finding that Defendants had knowledge of the CMI identifying Grecco as the photographer of the image. 2012 Valuewalk Page; 2015 Valuewalk Page. The knowledge element is further supported by the Google search results for the Gundlach photograph, proffered by Defendants themselves, which include the copyright management information with the description \"Michael Grecco for Barron's.\" Google Image Search Result. The question of whether Defendants had the requisite intent is one that the Court is unable to ascertain from the record. Therefore, a judgment on whether Defendants had the knowledge and intent required for a DMCA violation is inappropriate at this stage of the case. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability for alleged violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
