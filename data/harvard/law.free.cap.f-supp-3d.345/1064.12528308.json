PETERSON, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Mitchell Maes alleges that defendant Charter Communication repeatedly called him using an autodialer in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). Dkt. 1. Defendants move to dismiss Maes's claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), contending that Maes has not alleged facts sufficient to show that Charter used an autodialer. Dkt. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case raises an interesting question regarding which definition of autodialer the court should apply. The term autodialer is defined in both the TCPA itself and through rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC's most recent definition comes from a 2015 order, but earlier this year that definition was struck down by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    ACA International v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2018). Since then, courts have disagreed about whether the scope of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   is limited the 2015 FCC order or also applies to prior FCC rulings from 2003, 2008, and 2012. Because Maes's allegations are based on a definition of autodialer promulgated by the FCC in 2003, Charter contends that his claim fails if the 2003 order is no longer valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After reviewing\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   and the decisions interpreting it, the court concludes that the 2003 FCC order is still valid, and it will deny Charter's motion to dismiss. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   indicates that the court of appeals intended to strike down the 2003 order. Applying\n   the definition of autodialer promulgated in the 2003 order, the court finds that Maes plausibly alleges that Charter used an autodialer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ALLEGATIONS OF FACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court draws the following facts from Maes's complaint, Dkt. 1, and accepts them as true for the purpose of deciding Charter's motion.\n   <em>\n    Zahn v. N. Am. Power &amp; Gas, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147600\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/1082/#p1087\">\n    815 F.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087 (7th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around August 2017, Charter began calling Maes on his cell phone. Charter's representatives told Maes that they were attempting to collect debt from a person named \"Nancy.\" Maes is not Nancy, and he said so to Charter's representatives. Maes asked Charter to stop calling him. Despite Maes's request, Charter continued to call Maes. Maes does not state how many times Charter called him, but he alleges that he told multiple Charter representatives that he wanted the calls to stop and that Charter ignored his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Charter called Maes using a predictive dialer, a piece of equipment used in call centers to automatically dial phone numbers and connect representatives to customers that answer the phone. Maes states that when he answered phone calls from Charter, he heard dead air before the phone system connected him with a representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Maes is suing Charter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii), which prohibits making \"any call ... using any automated telephone dialing system ... to any telephone number assigned to a ... cellular telephone service.\" The sole question raised in Charter's motion to dismiss is whether Maes has adequately alleged that Charter used an \"automatic telephone dialing system,\" or autodialer, to call him. This question has two parts. First, the parties debate what an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" is. Charter says that the controlling definition is provided in the statute; Maes says that the court is bound by broader definitions found in FCC orders. Second, Charter contends that Maes does not allege facts sufficient to plausibly suggest that Charter used any type of automatic dialing equipment. The court will consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Charter contends that Maes cannot meet this definition of autodialer because he does not allege that Charter used a device that has the capacity to dial \"random or sequential\" phone numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Maes contends that under the FCC's interpretation of the statute, he does not have to show that Charter's device dialed \"random or sequential\" numbers. The general rule is that courts are bound by the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA, even if the court believes that the agency's interpretation is clearly wrong.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202342\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).

The FCC recognized that not all predictive dialers have the capacity to dial random or sequential numbers, but it reasoned that Congress intended for the TCPA to adapt to changes in technology.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 132. Telemarketers in the past may have used equipment to create and dial arbitrary 10-digit numbers, but it is now far more cost effective for telemarketers to use curated lists of numbers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, even as the technology evolved, the basic function remained the same-the capacity to dial numbers without human intervention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, a device may qualify as an autodialer even if it does not generate random or sequential numbers.

But they disagree whether\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   also invalidated the 2003 FCC definition of autodialer that Maes relies upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , the court of appeals reasoned that the statutory definition of autodialer raised two questions: (1) when does a device have the \"capacity\" to perform the two enumerated functions; and (2) what precisely are those functions?\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It struck down the FCC's treatment of both questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the court held that the FCC unreasonably interpreted the meaning of the word \"capacity\" in \u00a7 227(a)(1).\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the 2015 order used a definition of capacity not found in prior orders, this portion of the court's ruling is not relevant to the validity of the 2003 definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, the court found that the FCC's description of the functions of an autodialer in the 2015 order was contradictory. On the one hand, the FCC ruled that to qualify as an autodialer, equipment must have the capacity to generate and dial random or sequential numbers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 701-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But at the same time, the FCC reaffirmed its prior rulings on predictive dialers, and those prior rulings had unequivocally held that a predictive dialer falls under the statute even if it cannot be programmed to generate random or sequential numbers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that although either interpretation of the statute may be correct, the FCC could not choose both at the same time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   So which is it: does a device qualify as an ATDS only if it can generate random or sequential numbers to be dialed, or can it so qualify even if it lacks that capacity? The 2015 ruling, while speaking\n   to the question in several ways, gives no clear answer (and in fact seems to give both answers). It might be permissible for the Commission to adopt either interpretation. But the Commission cannot, consistent with reasoned decisionmaking, espouse both competing interpretations in the same order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    at 702-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the short time since\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   was decided, many courts have considered the question whether the decision implicitly invalidated the 2003 order.

The court of appeals rightfully held that the FCC could not issue contradictory orders. But the court of appeals explicitly stated that it was not ruling on which interpretation of the TCPA was correct, so it is not reasonable to infer that it was reaching back and invalidating all prior FCC orders that expressed a particular interpretation of the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

Although the court of appeals may have expressed doubt about the previous orders, the court did not expressly reject them. In the absence of such a rejection, district courts do not have the authority to impose their own interpretation of the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Charter asks this court to follow\n   <em>\n    Pinkus v.

Ill. 2018), a case which reached a contrary conclusion and which Charter asks this court to follow. But the court is not persuaded by\n   <em>\n    Pinkus\n   </em>\n   for several reasons. First, it overstates the holding of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   when it says that the \"D.C.

The text that\n   <em>\n    Pinkus\n   </em>\n   quotes from is not the holding.

But this is a conflation of two different issues. Although the 2003 order recognized that there were two types of predictive dialers, it ruled that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   types fell under the definition of autodialer.\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d at 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the 2015 order, the FCC added rules that seemingly excluded one of these types, while at the same time reaffirming that the 2003 ruling was valid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So the flaw in the 2015 ruling was that it added a new regulation that made it\n   <em>\n    unlike\n   </em>\n   the 2003 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Charter also contends that the court of appeals must have ruled on the 2003 order, as well as the 2015 order, because the court ruled that it had jurisdiction to review it.

But assuming that Charter is correct and the court of appeals invoked jurisdiction to review the 2003, 2008, and 2012 orders, the court of appeals did not actually review them. Its analysis and holding were limited to the 2015 order: it looked at the ways in which the 2015 order expanded upon prior rulings, and then struck down those expansions as unreasonable. Although it discussed the content of the 2003 order, it did so only to highlight its contradictions with the new rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Charter's final argument relies on a request for comment the FCC issued in response to\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Charter says that the FCC \"explicitly recognized that its prior precedent on what qualifies a device as an ATDS was vacated.\" Dkt. 17, at 6. Charter also points out that power has shifted within the FCC, and the dissenters to the 2015 order have taken control of the agency, suggesting that the FCC will soon promulgate rules that define autodialer more restrictively. But this argument is undeveloped and unpersuasive. Charter does not point to any language in the request for comment stating that the commission's old rulings are invalid and Charter\n   cites no authority that the FCC has the power to invalidate a rule in the context of a request for comment. Even assuming that the FCC will promulgate new rules that are in Charter's favor, Charter has made no argument regarding whether the rules would apply retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beller v. Health &amp; Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cty., Indiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869513\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/388/#p391\">\n    703 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (7th Cir. 2012) (substantive regulatory changes are not retroactive unless Congress has given the agency express authority to create retroactive rules and the agency uses language expressly requiring retroactive application). Regardless what the FCC does in the future, this court must apply the law as it exists today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This court concludes that it is still bound by the FCC's 2003 ruling that a predictive dialer is an autodialer, even if the device does not dial random or sequentially generated numbers. But even if Charter were correct that\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   vacated the 2003 order, it is not clear that the court would adopt Charter's proposed construction of the TCPA. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the 2003 ruling on predictive dialers was no longer valid, but the court's construction of the statutory definition of autodialer was essentially the same as the definition found in the FCC's 2003 order.\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518614\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/1041/\">\n    904 F.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that under the statutory language, equipment can qualify as an autodialer even if it does not have the capacity to generate random or sequential numbers);\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinkus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526140\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/927/#p932\">\n    319 F.Supp.3d at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding the opposite). Because the court has concluded that the 2003 order remains in effect, it will not decide whether the statutory language should be construed differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Adequacy of Maes's allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Having determined that the 2003 FCC order still applies, the court now turns to the allegations found in Maes's complaint. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires only \"adequate notice of the scope of, and basis for\" the asserted claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avila v. CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340981\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/777/#p783\">\n    801 F.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (7th Cir. 2015) (citing\n   <em>\n    Vincent v.

On a motion for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must construe the complaint \"in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, accept well-pleaded facts as true, and draw all inferences in [plaintiff's] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. CB Sports Bar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791580\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1143/#p1146\">\n    623 F.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 (7th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To prove his claim under the TCPA, Maes must establish three elements: (1) Charter placed a call to Maes's cell phone; (2) using an autodialer; (3) without Maes's express consent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii). Maes alleges that Charter called his cell phone multiple times, after he explicitly told Charter not to call him. Each time Maes answered, he heard a period of silence before he was connected with a Charter representative. Dead air after answering the phone is an indicator that the caller is using a predictive dialer,\n   <em>\n    Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. 14014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8 n.31, so it is plausible that Charter used a predictive dialer to call Maes. Because a predictive dialer is an autodialer under the TCPA, Maes states a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that defendant Charter Communication's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 9, is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Maddox v.
