[Dkt. no. 15.] Plaintiff Gerald D. Gipaya (\"Plaintiff\") filed his memorandum in opposition on July 9, 2018, and Defendant filed her reply on July 16, 2018. [Dkt. nos. 18, 20.] This matter came on for hearing on July 30, 2018. On August 31, 2018, this Court issued an entering order ruling on the Motion. [Dkt. no. 23.] The instant Order supersedes that entering order. Defendant's Motion is hereby granted for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Employment Discrimination Complaint (\"Complaint\"). [Dkt. no. 1.] Plaintiff states served in the United States Air Force (\"Air Force\") from 1969 until his honorable discharge in 1977. He then worked for the Air Force as a civilian employee from 1978 until his retirement in 2005. In 2006, Plaintiff was hired as a reemployed annuitant to be Quality Assurance (\"QA\") Specialist. At all times relevant to this case, Plaintiff was employed as a QA Specialist at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, formerly known as Hickam Air Force Base (\"Hickam\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-10.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2010, Plaintiff suffered a stroke, which Defendant was aware of. He returned to work later that month, but experienced limitations as a result of the stroke. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 15.] According to Plaintiff, in spite of these limitations, \"he was able to complete his regular duties effectively and on time,\" but he was also asked to perform additional duties that were not part of his position description. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.] Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to provide him with reasonable\n   accommodations for his stroke-related limitations. For example, Plaintiff was not provided with the requested ergonomic chair for six months after his return to work, and his June 29, 2012 email request to reduce his workload to his original job duties was denied. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges: in February 2013, he was one of five reemployed annuitants who were notified they would be terminated, effective March 2013; [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20;] supervisors could seek a waiver allowing a reemployed annuitant avoid termination, but no waiver was sought for Plaintiff; [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 25;] and waivers were sought and approved for the other four reemployed annuitants, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23]. Thus, Plaintiff was the only reemployed annuitant who was terminated. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.] Plaintiff asserts that an waiver was not sought for him because he was the only reemployed annuitant who had a disability. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.] He also states he is of Native Hawaiian ancestry, and he was sixty-two years old at the time of the events in question. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was terminated effective March 9, 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.] Plaintiff filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") Complaint on April 22, 2013. On December 17, 2013, he requested a hearing before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges three causes of action, each with multiple theories of liability. Plaintiff alleges violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\" and \"Count I\"), based on theories of: hostile work environment; race discrimination (Hawaiian/Pacific Islander); and retaliation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.] Next, Plaintiff alleges violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a (\"ADEA\" and \"Count II\"), based on theories of hostile work environment and termination based on his age. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.] Finally, Plaintiff alleges the conduct described in the Complaint constitutes disability discrimination, in violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Rehab Act\" and \"Count III\").

[Plaintiff] explained that he needed the chair \"because someone was playing with my chair, and it makes it very hard for me to adjust these things in the morning.\" His request did not refer to disability or to reasonable accommodation. Jones asked him to provide information about what chair he wanted and where to purchase it. By the time [Plaintiff] provided the information it was late in the fiscal year, and the purchase had to wait until the new fiscal year. It took about five or six months for the chair to be delivered. [Plaintiff] did not believe that anyone discriminated against him on the basis of his race, age or disability in connection with the chair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [Def.'s CSOF at \u00b6 3; Pltf.'s CSOF at \u00b6 3 (disputing Def.'s \u00b6 3 only to the extent that\n   Plaintiff asserts he \"requested the ergonomic chair because of his limitations after the stroke - limited use of his hand/arm.\").]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The 6/29/12 Email\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 29, 2012, Plaintiff emailed Master Sergeant Albert Murphy (\"6/29/12 Email\"). [Def.'s CSOF, Decl. of Thomas A. Helper (\"Helper Decl.\"), Exh. 3 (6/29/12 Email) at 2-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] The 6/29/12 Email stated Plaintiff's concerns that: he consistently worked more than other QA staff; he worked in excess of his \"Core Documents\" -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , job description; and management knew others were unfairly shifting their workload to Plaintiff. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.] The email continued, \"[t]hat needs to STOP right now. Here's to inform you, I too, am throttling back to my 10% level,\" which was specified for Plaintiff's work on the Product Improvement Program in his Core Document. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).] The 6/29/12 Email further stated Plaintiff's appointment did not qualify him for managerial duties, and continued: \"I've rode solo from day one. Core documents/TBA, no one adheres to them? If your position states to do this and this and that, step up and contribute.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The 6/29/12 Email \"did not refer to [Plaintiff's] national origin, disability or age.\" [Def.'s CSOF at \u00b6 4; Pltf.'s CSOF at \u00b6 4 (only disputing other portions of Def.'s \u00b6 4).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 10, 2012, Master Sergeant Murphy replied to the 6/29/12 Email. [6/29/12 Email at 1-2.] Master Sergeant Murphy stated he had consulted with the civilian personnel department, and disagreed with Plaintiff's concerns stated in the 6/29/12 Email because: 1) as Plaintiff's supervisor, Master Sergeant Murphy was authorized to assign work as needed for mission operations; 2) unless the assignments were illegal, unethical, or immoral, Plaintiff was obliged to complete his assigned tasks; 3) the Core Document was not an exhaustive description of the permissible work that an employee may be assigned. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.] Master Sergeant Murphy concluded by warning that: \"[b]latant disregard for a direct order and/or failure to properly carry out an assigned duty/task may result in disciplinary action taken against you up to and including removal,\" and stated that he and Plaintiff would meet in person, the next day, to verbally discuss expectations.

A reemployed annuitant is an employee who is receiving a federal pension while employed with the Air Force. Plaintiff was a reemployed annuitant. The Directive \"provided an exception for employees whose skills were 'mission critical.' \" [Def.'s CSOF at \u00b6 5; Pltf.'s CSOF at \u00b6 5 (admitting Def.'s \u00b6 5).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Colonel Michael Novotny was the Commander of the Fifteenth Maintenance Group and was Plaintiff's fourth level supervisor. At the time of the Directive, there were two reemployed annuitants under Colonel Novotny's command: Plaintiff and Fuel Systems Specialist Roger Horiuchi (\"Horiuchi\"). Colonel Novotny was assigned to recommend whether each was mission critical. [Def.'s CSOF at \u00b6 6; Pltf.'s CSOF at \u00b6 6 (only disputing Def.'s \u00b6 6 insofar as \"Human Resources advised that the command could not provided exception\n   packages for every reemployed annuitant.\").]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Colonel Novotny approved a waiver request for Horiuchi, who \"was the QA Specialist responsible for evaluating the maintenance performed by the Fuels Systems Maintenance Shop, which was responsible for the essential task of ensuring that aircraft fuel systems worked properly.\" [Def.'s CSOF, Decl. of Michael Novotny (\"Novotny Decl.\") at \u00b6 4.] Horiuchi had current certifications necessary for his job, and there were only a few individuals in the unit, whether uniformed or civilian, who could perform the QA work Horiuchi did. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Colonel Novotny did not approve a wavier request for Plaintiff, whose work involved investigating incidents in which damage had occurred to airplanes. Plaintiff's work \"was more administrative in nature\" and did not require specialized certifications. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Colonel Novotny knew, prior to Plaintiff's termination, that Plaintiff had serious health issues, but Colonel Novotny was not aware that Plaintiff's work was affected by those health issues. Colonel Novotny understood Plaintiff's work performance to be good. Further, Colonel Novotny was not aware Plaintiff had ever sought accommodation for a disability or otherwise engaged in protected activity opposing discrimination. [Def.'s CSOF at \u00b6 9; Pltf.'s CSOF at \u00b6 9 (disputing Def.'s \u00b6 9 only \"as to whether Plaintiff's age, race, and medical condition, or prior protected activity played a role in the determination he was not mission critical\").]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff's \"first contact with an EEO counselor came on March 29, 2013, after his termination.\" [Def.'s CSOF at \u00b6 10; Pltf.'s CSOF at \u00b6 10 (admitting Def.'s \u00b6 10).] Plaintiff told the EEO counselor that: on February 5, 2013, he received notice that reemployed annuitants within the QA office would be terminated; and, on March 8, 2013, he was terminated.

Plaintiff merely states he had the certifications necessary to perform Horiuchi's duties. [Gipaya Decl. at \u00b6 4.] Even if true, that does not show the Air Force's proffered reason for terminating Plaintiff was false or pretextual. The Air Force's proffered reason for terminating Plaintiff and not Horiuchi is that only Horiuchi's\n   <strong>\n    job\n   </strong>\n   was mission critical, not that only Horiuchi was\n   <strong>\n    capable\n   </strong>\n   of performing a mission critical job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Directive required Air Force components to separate \"[a]ll temporary and term employees (including reemployed annuitants), not considered mission critical.\" [Helper Decl., Exh. 1 at 1.] The Directive contains no criteria for evaluating whether an employee is mission critical. Apparently, the Air Force viewed the Directive as unprecedented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (\"These are unchartered waters concerning the federal budget .... It is imperative we work closely together to balance mission needs and minimize impacts to our dedicated civilian employees and their families.\"). Plaintiff argues the lack of specific criteria showing shows the Air Force's justification for terminating Plaintiff to be pretextual. [Mem. in Opp. at 28.] This Court disagrees. It was not manifestly unreasonable for the Air Force to provide decision-makers on each base with discretion, rather than rigid criteria, to determine who is mission critical. Further, even if that management decision were \"foolish,\" that alone does not show pretext: Plaintiff must show the Air Force did not \"honestly believe[ ] its reason for its actions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villiarimo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396804\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/1054/\">\n    281 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiff must show the Air Force did not \"honestly believe[ ]\" that terminating him was appropriate under the Directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396804\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/1054/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff attempts to make this showing by adducing evidence that: 1) it was Master Sergeant Murphy who decided only Horiuchi, and not Plaintiff, would receive a mission critical waiver, and Colonel Novotny merely ratified the Master Sergeant's decision; [Smith Decl., Exh. 5 (excerpts of trans. of 1/8/15 depo. of Major Mark Rardin) at 26;] and 2) Master Sergeant Murphy believed management should select at least one reemployed annuitant to be terminated, so that senior officers would be more likely to approve mission critical waiver requests for the remainder, [Murphy Depo. at 51-53]. Even\n   assuming Plaintiff has shown there is a genuine issue of fact as to how the Air Force approached its decision about which reemployed annuitants would be terminated, this alone falls short of the sort of circumstantial evidence, which \"must be both specific and substantial,\" sufficient to show pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villiarimo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396804\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/1054/\">\n    281 F.3d at 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In support, Plaintiff points out that, after Plaintiff was terminated on March 9, 2013, another civilian filled his position on August 23, 2013. [Smith Decl., Exh. 8 at 2.] This simply does not show pretext. To the contrary, the fact that Plaintiff's position could go unfilled for over five months suggests it was not mission critical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Court has also considered what significance, if any, there is to the fact that one of the four reemployed annuitants retained as mission critical was classified as a \"Historian.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff mentions this as a background fact, but not in his argument. [Mem. in Opp. at 4.] Plaintiff does not contend the retention of a historian shows any material fact is in dispute.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s CSOF; Pltf.'s CSOF. The Court is therefore not obliged to consider this issue further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule LR56.1(f) (\"When resolving motions for summary judgment, the court shall have no independent duty to search and consider any part of the court record not otherwise referenced in the separate concise statements of the parties.\"). However, for the sake of completeness, the Court notes that Plaintiff has adduced no evidence to establish that the historian was outside any of the protected classes at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Plaintiff fails to show there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendant's nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff was pretextual. Therefore, even assuming Plaintiff had made out a prima facie case that his termination was unlawful discrimination because of age, race, disability status, prior protected activity, or any other characteristic, Defendant would still be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
