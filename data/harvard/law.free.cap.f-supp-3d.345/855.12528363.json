Each defendant has moved for summary judgment. (Doc. No. 164 [\"Kent State MSJ\"]; Doc. No. 161 [\"Oakley MSJ\"]; Doc. No. 166 [\"Linder MSJ\"].) Plaintiff opposes each motion. (Doc. No. 173 [\"Kent State MSJ Opp'n\"]; Doc. No. 171 [\"Oakley MSJ Opp'n\"]; Doc. No. 175 [\"Linder MSJ Opp'n\"].) Defendants have filed reply briefs. (Doc. No. 178 [\"Kent State MSJ Reply\"]; Doc.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the fall of 2012, Kesterson enrolled as a freshman student at Kent State on an athletic scholarship and joined the university's women's softball team. On December\n   7, 2012, she alleges that another student athlete, Tucker Linder (\"Tucker\"), raped her in her dorm room. (Doc. No. 156 (deposition of Lauren Kesterson [\"Kesterson Dep.\"] ) at 67.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The facts surrounding this unfortunate encounter were discussed at length in the Court's March 15, 2017 memorandum opinion denying defendants' motions to dismiss, and familiarity with that opinion is presumed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kesterson v. Kent State Univ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:16-cv-298,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20995222\">\n    2017 WL 995222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 15, 2017). While the Court will briefly revisit the facts surrounding the alleged attack now that the record has been developed after discovery, it must be emphasized that this lawsuit concerns the events that transpired in the months and years that followed, and, particularly, defendants' various responses to Kesterson's reports of sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Alleged Assault\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tucker, a member of the university's male baseball team, was the youngest son of Linder, the head coach of the women's softball team. Linder had recruited Kesterson and her twin sister, Chloe Kesterson (\"Chloe\"), to play softball for Kent State while the girls were still high school juniors. (Doc. No. 155 (Deposition of Karen Linder [\"Linder Dep.\"] ) at 52-56.) Linder was responsible for arranging for both girls to receive athletic scholarships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52;\n   <em>\n    see generally id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.) Upon arriving at Kent State her freshman year, Kesterson developed a friendship with Tucker, and their relationship evolved to the point of a consensual romantic encounter in November 2012. (Kesterson Dep. at 42-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her deposition, Kesterson testified that, on the evening of December 7, 2012, Tucker contacted Kesterson and invited her to meet him in his room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-51.) Kesterson went to Tucker's room and the two talked. Tucker appeared intoxicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.) Because Tucker's roommate was passed out in the room, Tucker and Kesterson jointly decided to retire to Kesterson's room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.) When they first arrived, they found Chloe there, but she quickly retired to the adjoining room of another softball player. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once alone, Tucker and Kesterson began to kiss, which led to some consensual sexual touching, and the two began to remove their clothes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-65.) After a brief interval where the two engaged in some discussion, Tucker attempted to remove Kesterson's underwear, at which time she told Tucker that she did not want to have sex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66.) According to Kesterson, Tucker ignored this and continued to remove her underwear. Kesterson tried to push him away, but Tucker continued to press his advantage and raped her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-67.) The two eventually fell asleep. In the morning, Tucker \"initiated again\" with Kesterson and the two had sex for a second time. Kesterson testified that she would not call this second encounter \"consensual,\" though she concedes that she neither consented nor withheld her consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.) Kesterson did not share the details of the alleged rape with any employee of the university for more than seventeen months. The first employee she told was Linder, her coach and her alleged attacker's mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The 2014 Exit Interview\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In May 2014, Kesterson met with Linder for a routine exit interview following the\n   2014 spring softball season.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Linder Dep. at 309.) When Linder asked Kesterson if she was all right, Kesterson informed her that she had been raped.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Kesterson Dep. at 122; Linder Dep. at 92.) Linder then asked Kesterson if she was referring to her son, Tucker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Kesterson Dep. at 122-23; Linder Dep. at 92-93.) Kesterson initially hesitated but ultimately confirmed that she was referring to Tucker. (Kesterson Dep. at 123; Linder Dep. at 93.) Linder asked her if she wanted to bring criminal charges against Tucker, and Kesterson told her that she did not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Kesterson Dep. at 123;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Linder Dep. at 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Linder then asked who else knew about the assault, and Kesterson informed her that she already told her parents, her twin sister, Chloe, and her roommate, Nicki. (Kesterson Dep. at 125.) Linder indicated that she believed that it would better if they kept this information limited to people who already knew and not tell anyone else, though Kesterson also testified that Linder \"told me not to tell anybody\" and \"I mean, [Linder], had told me not tell anybody about me being raped.\" (Kesterson Dep. at 125, 131, 190-91, 198;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 129 [\"[Linder] asked me not to tell anybody about it.\"].) Linder did, however, suggest that Kesterson speak with Tucker about the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-27; Linder Dep. at 138-39.) Kesterson \"eventually\" told Linder that she would not speak with Tucker. (Kesterson Dep. at 127.) Before the meeting concluded both women were crying, and Linder informed Kesterson that Tucker was struggling and that he \"hadn't been right for a while.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190; Linder Dep. at 136-38.) She also shared with Kesterson that Tucker was considering not returning to school in the fall. (Linder Dep. at 136.) Linder assured Kesterson that she would help her get through the rest of her time at Kent State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that same day, Linder contacted Kesterson's mom and relayed that she was sorry for what had happened between Kesterson and Tucker, and that she wanted to help Kesterson work through the situation. (Kesterson Dep. at 138-39; Linder Dep. 153.) She discussed possible counseling, and her mother advised Linder that Kesterson was seeing a counselor. (Linder Dep. at 153.) Linder also checked in with Kesterson throughout the summer of 2014 to see how she was doing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-53; Kesterson Dep. at 194.) When Kesterson returned to school in the fall, Linder asked her how she was doing. (Linder Dep. at 153.) She also informed Kesterson that a former university employee and \"life coach,\" Deborah Keith, would be available to speak with Kesterson or Chloe, if either\n   woman wanted to receive counseling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154, 311.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kent State's sexual harassment policy designates all employees as mandatory reporters. (Doc. No. 164-8, Kent State Policy Register 5-16.2(D) (requiring employees to report all instances of sexual misconduct to the Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinator). Yet, it is undisputed that Linder did not report the alleged assault by her son to any employee at Kent State. While Linder testified that she believed that Kesterson did not want her to report the assault, she admitted that she was concerned about the fallout and how it would affect her son if he was accused of rape and the matter was investigated. (Linder Dep. at 104, 107, 109, 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Linder Reports a Different Sexual Assault Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Linder did, however, report the sexual assault of another female student athlete. Within days of her 2014 exit interview with Kesterson, another female softball player informed Linder that she had been assaulted by a different male Kent State student athlete. Linder connected the other softball player with the Office of Sexual &amp; Relationship Violence Support Services (\"SRVSS\") at the Women's Center on campus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78.) She also reported the other softball player's rape to Janet Kittell (\"Kittell\"), the senior woman administrator and a deputy Title IX coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Linder's Behavior after Kesterson's 2014 Exit Interview\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is Kesterson's position that Linder's failure to report Tucker's alleged attack left her free to retaliate against Kesterson for mentioning the incident in her exit interview. Though Linder successfully coached Kesterson in a starting position for two years, Kesterson claims that Linder entirely changed her approach to coaching Kesterson in her junior year. (Kesterson Dep. at 195, 198.) According to Kesterson, Linder generally acted with extreme indifference toward Kesterson throughout her junior year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 195 [\"[Linder] didn't address me by my ... nickname, or she didn't seem to talk to me or look at me.\"];\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 198 [\"[I]t seemed like [Linder] wanted to act like I wasn't a part of the team anymore .... I used to be one of [Linder's] favorites, then [Linder's attention] completely dropped off like to where it was almost like she didn't want to recognize that I was still there.\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In her deposition, Kesterson testified that, in the fall of 2014, she became emotional during a practice. After the practice, in the locker room, she heard Linder tell Oakley, one of Linder's assistant coaches, that they could not have Kesterson lose her composure during a practice, and that if she did it again, Kesterson should be asked to leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196.) When Kesterson approached the two coaches, Linder exclaimed, \"speak of the devil.\" After she asked if Kesterson was feeling better, she informed her that she could not act that way in practice in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 196-97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kesterson also claims that Linder retaliated against her by limiting her playing time. While Kesterson admits that she struggled \"[a] little\" with her on-field performance in the aftermath of her report to Linder, she complains that Linder also retaliated against her by taking her out of the starting lineup for a period of time and by moving her from her preferred position of short stop to second base. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 199.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Also during Kesterson's junior year, Linder required Kesterson and her teammates to attend team events, including a team bonfire and a team Christmas party, at Linder's home. Kesterson complains that it was difficult to participate in these team functions when pictures of Tucker\n   adorned the walls of Linder's home. When Kesterson asked Linder if there was anywhere else these events could be held, Linder simply advised Kesterson that Tucker was not going to be there, so that it was not a big deal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 195-96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Kesterson Reports Linder to Kent State's IX Office\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 24, 2015, Kesterson returned to campus to start her senior year. Accompanied by Chloe and the twins' father, Kesterson met with Erin Barton, the deputy coordinator for Title IX in the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (\"EOAA\") Department (\"Title IX office\") to file a complaint against Linder. (Doc. No. 153 (Deposition of Erin Barton [\"Barton Dep.\"] ) at 38-39.) Kesterson reported the details involving her 2014 exit interview with Linder, as well as those surrounding the underlying 2012 sexual assault by Tucker. During the meeting, Barton explained that the process was confidential until after the investigation was completed. (Kesterson Dep. at 251.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At Barton's suggestion, Kesterson and her family met with Kent State Athletic Director Joel Nielsen\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   on August 26, 2015, because Kesterson had expressed concerns to Barton about the continuation of her scholarship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168-69; Barton Dep. at 56.) From his discussions with Kesterson and Chloe, Nielsen understood that there was some question as to whether the twins would continue to play for Kent State. (Doc. No. 147 (Deposition of Joel Neilson [\"Nielsen Dep.\"] ) at 132.) Specifically, Kesterson expressed concerns about the treatment she had received from Linder following her 2014 exit interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38.) Nielsen advised the girls that typically an athletic scholarship is no longer available if a student athlete elects not to continue with his or her school sport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139.) He told them that he would investigate and look into the possibility of the girls keeping their scholarships even if they did not return to the Kent State softball team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139-40.) During the meeting, Nielsen also commented about how these situations are difficult on both sides and there is never a winner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.) Kesterson interpreted this statement to mean that Kent State was unlikely to do anything to improve her situation. (Kesterson Dep. at 170-71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Kent State's Investigation and Linder's Resignation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Notwithstanding Kesterson's impression, the record demonstrates that Barton had already begun to work with the Title IX Coordinator, Loretta Shields, and another deputy director, Pamela Fitzgerald, to develop a plan to expedite the investigation into the complaint against Linder so that it could be resolved before Tucker possibly returned to campus for fall classes. (Barton Dep. at 45, 146-47.) The plan included following up with local authorities, interviewing multiple individuals-including Linder and Kesterson's mother-and meeting with Nielsen and Jennie O'Connell, a Kent State SRVSS official. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38, 56-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although it was not her practice to provide a complainant with continual updates of a pending investigation (Doc. No. 151 (Declaration of Erin Barton [\"Barton Decl.\"] ) \u00b6 7), Barton had regular contact with Kesterson during the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ., Barton Dep. at 91; Barton Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14-16.) Kent State also arranged for Jennie O'Connell from the SRVSS office to work with Kesterson, providing support services. (Barton Decl. \u00b6 17.) Ms. O'Connell\n   had substantial contact with Kesterson during the course of the investigation. (Doc. No. 150 (Declaration of Jennie O'Connell [\"O'Connell Decl.\"] ) \u00b6\u00b6 18-27.) The record also establishes that Kesterson and Chloe made certain requests of O'Connell as to how and when Oakley and others would be informed of their decision to attend certain practices and team events. These requests were honored. (O'Connell Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 35-38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kent State MSJ at 4365, citing record.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 25, 2015, Barton met with Nielsen to follow up with him regarding Kesterson's scholarship concerns. (Barton Dep. at 58-60; Doc. No. 140 (Declaration of Joel Nielsen [\"Nielsen Decl.\"] ) \u00b6 4.) On August 26, 2015, Barton and Fitzgerald interviewed Linder about Kesterson's allegations without giving Linder advance notice of the claims. (Linder Dep. at 207.) Linder confirmed in the interview that Kesterson had reported a sexual assault to her the previous year, and Linder admitted that she violated Kent State's sexual harassment policy in not reporting it. (Barton Dep. at 76, 115.) While it was Linder's position that Kesterson did not want her to tell anybody about the assault, Barton concluded that Linder should have followed through with her duty to report Kesterson's disclosure to university administration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.) On August 27, 2015, Barton recommended to Shields that Linder be terminated for the policy violation, with an aggravating factor being the conflict of interest that was presented by Linder failing to report an issue involving her son. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84, 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the morning of August 28, 2015, Linder called Oakley, who was still on summer vacation, to tell him that she would likely need to resign or be fired. (Doc. No. 158 (Deposition of Eric Oakley [\"Oakley Dep.\"] ) at 145.) Linder shared the details of the situation with Oakley, who cut his vacation short and immediately began driving back to Ohio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Also on August 28, 2015, Barton met with Nielsen, who agreed with the recommendation from the Title IX office that Linder be separated from Kent State for violating the university's policy and for disregarding her clear conflict of interest. (Nielsen Dep. 66-67.) However, in his deposition he testified that the university rarely terminates an employee for cause, and that ordinarily an agreement is reached as to the employee's separation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67.) Accordingly, Nielsen recommended to Kent State's president that Linder be given the opportunity to resign or be terminated, and the president accepted the recommendation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64, 71.) That same day (August 28, 2015), Nielsen met with Linder and presented her with two letters: a letter of termination and a letter of resignation, both of which had been prepared by the university's general counsel's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72-73.) Linder chose to resign, effective August 28, 2015, rather than be terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79-80.) Had Linder been terminated for cause, under the terms of the contract, she would have owed Kent State 25% of her base pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74.) Instead, as part of the negotiated resignation, Linder was permitted to receive the 25% in a lump sum. She and Nielsen agreed that the university would offer a neutral reason for her departure, citing \"philosophical differences.\" (Linder Dep. at 240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Oakley Is Named Interim Head Coach\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Still on August 28, 2015, Oakley was named the interim head coach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oakley Dep. at 160-61.) In a phone call with Nielsen and Kittel, Oakley discussed convening an emergency team meeting that same day for the purpose of announcing Linder's resignation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160-62.) At the direction of Kittel, Assistant Coach Toocheck notified the players of the emergency\n   meeting. (Doc. No. 159 (Deposition of Jessica Toocheck [\"Toocheck Dep.\"] ) at 62.) When Kesterson received news of the meeting, she attempted to contact Barton by email, but Barton was off campus conducting an unrelated training session. (Kesterson Dep. at 253-54; Barton Dep. at 148-49.) Kesterson did not attend the meeting. (Kesterson Dep. at 240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   During the meeting, which was attended by Nielsen, Kittel, and Toocheck, as well as all team members besides Kesterson and one other player, Oakley advised the team that Linder had resigned as head coach. (Oakley Dep. at 167-68, 170-71.) According to Oakley, members of the team appeared surprised and visibly upset by the news. Oakley testified that, because the players did not know about Kesterson's report, he attributed their reaction to a response to evaluations prepared by certain team members the year before that had been critical of Linder and her coaching style. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167-70;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Linder Dep. at 180, 197.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 30, 2015, Oakley and Toocheck met with the returning senior members of the softball team for the annual Senior Breakfast, where seniors traditionally met with the head coach to discuss plans for the upcoming year. (Oakley Dep. at 197.) During the meeting, Oakley advised the seniors that \"there's going to be no more bashing Coach Linder, and we're not going to get into, nor are we going to complain, about her being gone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 199.) As Oakley addressed the team, Toocheck sobbed and expressed her concern for Linder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 216-18; Kesterson Dep. at 245.) While Oakley maintained in his deposition that he was referring to the negative Linder evaluations from the previous season, Kesterson interpreted the remark as a reference to the complaint she lodged against Linder with the Title IX office, though she concedes that Oakley did reference the negative player evaluations in his remarks. (Oakley Dep. at 199, 203-04; Kesterson Dep. at 245-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    News and Social Media Coverage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After her departure, Linder spoke publically about her resignation, and was quoted in a newspaper interview stating that she left the university because coaching had changed and student athletes believed that they were entitled to certain privileges. (Linder Dep at 264-65; Doc. No. 159-3 (\n   <em>\n    Record-Courier\n   </em>\n   Article) at 3864.) Following news of her resignation and the publication of the article, alumni-including Toocheck-began to register social media posts supporting Linder. (Doc. No. 159-4 (Social Media Posts) at 3890-95.) Also, during alumni football weekend in early October 2015, several alumni softball players had planned to participate in an alumni softball game, and alumna Carrie Eneix had t-shirts made displaying the message \"We Support Karen Linder\" to be worn during the game. (Linder Dep. at 270-71; Toocheck Dep. at 142-43.) After the weekend, pictures of various alumni wearing the shirts appeared on social media. (Toocheck Dep. 142-43; Doc.

No. 155-35 (EOAA Investigation Report) at 2792.) Tucker did not return to Kent State for his senior year, and the university held a\n   <em>\n    persona non grata\n   </em>\n   hearing. It is undisputed that Kesterson had no further contact with Tucker. Kesterson and Chloe did not play softball for Kent State their senior year, but both\n   kept their full scholarships and graduated in 2016.

After Kent State and Linder filed early motions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12, Kesterson was granted leave to amend her complaint to, in part, add Oakley as a party defendant. Thereafter, Oakley also filed a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss. On March 15, 2017, the Court issued a ruling disposing of the pending motions, and determining that the case would go forward on Kesterson's Title IX claim against Kent State, her equal protection and First Amendment prior restraint claims against Oakley in his official capacity, her First Amendment prior restraint claim against Oakley in his individual capacity, and her equal protection and First Amendment claims against Linder in her individual capacity.\n   <em>\n    Kesterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20995222\">\n    2017 WL 995222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17.

Without the authority to address the sexual assault or take corrective actions, Kent State insists that Linder's notice of the assault in May 2014 cannot not be imputed to the university.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Kesterson disagrees, focusing on what Linder\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   or was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to do as the head softball coach. For example, she highlights the fact that, Linder (like any Kent State employee) was a mandatory reporter under Kent State's own sexual harassment policy.

Yet, as the case law identified above makes clear, there is a difference between an employee designated to\n   <em>\n    report\n   </em>\n   a sexual harassment complaint and an employee designated to\n   <em>\n    respond\n   </em>\n   to such a claim. Case authority relied upon by Kesterson is in accord with this principle.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yog v. Tex. S.

Specifically, she identifies a laundry list of actions Linder could have taken-such as notifying Kesterson that she could press criminal charges or obtain a restraining order against Tucker, rescheduling training schedules to avoid contact with the boy's baseball team, assisting Kesterson with class scheduling, and referring Kesterson to a university official \"who would take her complaint seriously\"-to ease her distress following the rape. (Kent State MSJ Opp'n at 5250.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Again, Kesterson's expansive definition of \"appropriate person\" would result in\n   respondeat superior liability for the university, as it would permit an employee without the ability to officially address and remedy the alleged sexual harassment to bind Kent State. However, the \"high standard imposed in\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   sought to eliminate any 'risk that the recipient [of Title IX funding] would be liable in damages not for its own official decision but instead for its employees' independent actions.' \"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/\">\n    526 U.S. at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/\">\n    524 U.S. at 290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly, a query that focuses on whether Linder had the power to take corrective measures on a\n   <em>\n    complainant's\n   </em>\n   behalf fails because it misdirects the focus away from whether the Linder had the authority to implement corrective measures on the\n   <em>\n    funding recipient's\n   </em>\n   behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Because Linder lacked the authority to address and institute corrective measures on behalf of Kent State, she does not qualify as an \"appropriate person\" for purposes of Title IX notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Kesterson cannot maintain that Kent State had actual notice in 2014 of Tucker's assault, and Linder's alleged conduct toward her between the exit interview and the 2015 report to Barton cannot factor into the deliberate indifference analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Kent State's Response Was Not Deliberately Indifferent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Having concluded that the second element of the Title IX deliberate indifference prong, notice, was not satisfied until Barton received Kesterson's complaint on August 24, 2015, the Court must determine whether there is evidence that Kent State's response was deliberately indifferent.

Kesterson confirmed that Kent State met those demands, including continuing the scholarships for her and her sister despite the twins' decisions not to play softball. (Kesterson Dep. at 182.)

(Linder MSJ at 4929.) She claims that the concern she exhibited toward Kesterson defeats any claim that she was deliberately indifferent to her situation. She further notes that, by the time she learned of the assault, Tucker was no longer attending Kent State, and the threat of possible ongoing harassment or assault was nonexistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   According to Linder, the only thing she did not do was report the assault, as she was required to do under the terms of Kent State's sexual harassment policy, and that a failure to follow a university policy cannot serve to establish deliberate indifference. Further, she notes that she asked Kesterson if she wanted to press criminal charges against Tucker, and when Kesterson responded in the negative, she took that to mean that she did not want Linder to report the matter to the university. (Linder Dep. at 104, 107.) She highlights the fact that even Chloe, her sister and best friend, believed Kesterson did not want to report the assault. (Doc. No. 145 (Deposition of Chloe Kesterson [\"Chloe Dep.\"] ) at 107 [\"Lauren did tell me that she didn't-yes, she didn't want to report it.\"];\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kesterson Dep. at 15.) Accordingly, Linder argues that she was merely respecting Kesterson's privacy by not referring the matter to the Title IX office. (Linder Dep. at 287-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It is true that a university and its officials are not deliberately indifferent to a claim of sexual assault when they delay in taking action on a complaint out of respect for a complainant's request for confidentiality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roe v.

Aug. 1, 1997) (finding employer appropriately responded to employee's Title VII claim of sexual harassment by \"respecting [the employee's] requests for confidentiality\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Unlike the clear expression of a desire for confidentiality in\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   , the record here is less clear. While Kesterson admits that she told Linder she did not want to press criminal charges, she emphatically states that she was never asked, and never indicated, that she did not want to file a report with the Title IX office. (Kesterson Dep. at 123.) Moreover, while Kesterson waited seventeen months to mention the assault, and only told Linder after Linder probed in a routine exit meeting, Kesterson suggested to Linder that her hesitation in coming forward was grounded in the fact that Tucker was Linder's son. (Linder Dep. at 93.) In fact, Kesterson testified that she told Linder that she did not want to press criminal charges against Tucker because she \"didn't see how [she] could continue to play softball pursuing a rape case against [her] coach's son.\" (Kesterson Dep. at 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Other facts, if believed, would lend support for a finding that Linder acted, not out of concern for Kesterson's privacy, but out of her own desire to keep the assault from coming to the attention of the university. It is true that Linder's policy violation, itself, cannot satisfy the deliberate indifference standard, but Kesterson claims that Linder's failure to report the assault was part of her overall plan to \"deep six\" her complaint so that Linder could protect her son at the expense of Kesterson's rights. Concerted effort designed to forestall any investigation into Kesterson's complaint would certainly qualify as deliberate indifference, as it would amount to a decision to ignore the alleged misconduct by ensuring that it was never investigated. Linder admitted that she was concerned about how the \"fallout\" from Kesterson's allegations and a possible rape investigation would affect Tucker. (Linder Dep. at 120.) Given this concern, a jury could view Linder's remark that she thought it was best if Kesterson not discuss the attack with anyone who did not already know as a subtle form of suppression and coercion by the person who had substantial control over Kesterson and her future as a softball player and scholarship recipient. This is especially true if a jury were to find, as Kesterson has testified, that Linder did more than merely make a suggestion, but, instead, actually ordered Kesterson not to speak about the incident. (Kesterson Dep. at 198.) Under these circumstances, where there are material factual disputes, the Court cannot find, as a matter of law, that Linder was not deliberately indifferent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Class-of-One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For many of the same reasons, Linder is not entitled to summary judgment\n   on Kesterson's class-of-one equal protection claim. To present a \"class-of-one\" equal protection claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate \"that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Willowbrook v.

Linder insists that Kesterson's claims fails because she \"did not treat [these women] differently in responding to their allegations of sexual misconduct. For each woman, Linder gave her the opportunity to decide what she wanted to do and abided by her choices.\" (Linder MSJ at 4933.) While Kesterson's teammate was amenable to filing a report with the university, Linder notes that she \"asked Kesterson if she wanted to press criminal charges and Kesterson said no. Linder took this to mean that Kesterson did not want to report her allegation of sexual misconduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , record cites omitted). Even if the Court were to find the treatment of the women different, Linder argues that the facts surrounding Kesterson's report, including the substantial delay in coming forward and her unwillingness to bring criminal charges, demonstrate a rational basis for treating the two differently, and prevent Kesterson from refuting a conceivable basis to support the different treatment. Again, the Court finds that there is a question of fact as to whether Linder was motivated by a desire to respect Kesterson's privacy in electing not to report the alleged sexual attack, and this factual dispute precludes a ruling on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    First Amendment Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Kesterson claims that Linder violated her right to free speech, as protected by the First Amendment, in two separate ways: (1) by means of a prior restraint, and (2) by means of retaliation for the exercise of free speech. The Court begins with Kesterson's prior restraint claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Prior Restraint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In Claim 3 of the amended complaint, Kesterson alleged that Linder placed upon her an unconstitutional prior restraint of her right to free speech when she asked her not to speak to anyone about Tucker's assault. (Doc. No. 20 (First Amended and Supplemental Complaint [\"FAC\"] ) \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, 318.) As the Court has already noted, there are questions of fact as to whether this remark was part of a subtle form of coercion designed to discourage Kesterson from reporting the assault. The question the Court must now answer is whether it also would be sufficient to establish a prior restraint. The Court finds that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As the Supreme Court uses that term, a law constitutes a prior restraint when: (1) one who seeks to exercise First Amendment rights is required to apply to the government for permission; (2) the government is empowered to determine whether the applicant should be granted permission on the basis of a review of the content of the proposed expression; (3) approval is dependent upon the government's affirmative action; and (4) approval is not a routine matter, but involves an examination of the facts, an exercise of\n   judgment, and the formation of an opinion.\n   <em>\n    Se.

Linder did not require Kesterson to seek her permission before she commented on the assault, she did not reserve a right to screen or censor any statements, and she did not require Kesterson to wait for approval before she would be permitted to speak on the topic. Rather, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Kesterson, the evidence reveals a directive not to speak to anyone who already did not know about the assault and an unspoken consequence based entirely upon Linder's role over Kesterson as her coach. Not only would such a directive fail to the meet the elements identified by the Supreme Court, it would also fall more comfortably in the camp of a restriction that imposes subsequent punishment (although the threat of punishment was implied), rather than prior governmental screening.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355858\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/544/#p550\">\n    509 U.S. at 553-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355858\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/544/#p550\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As such, after the decision in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , school districts were on notice that their deliberate indifference could lead to liability under Title IX.

In support, she cites to two Sixth Circuit cases, one reported and the other unreported, that would have put Linder on notice that her alleged conduct would violate Kesterson's constitutional right to equal protection.

The court also found that it was well established by 2011, the time of the reports lodged with school officials by the student's parents, that this right was clearly established, resulting in a determination that the school official defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Shively\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230798\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/579/348/#p356\">\n    579 F.

Instead, she reported one instance (albeit one very serious instance) of sexual assault, occurring more than seventeen months before she made the report. Moreover, Kesterson does not deny that Linder shared with Kesterson her belief that Tucker would not be returning to campus, and, indeed, he did not return and the two had no further contact. Under these circumstances, the Court cannot find that the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   would have put Linder on notice that her failure to report one past act of sexual assault that was unlikely to repeat itself would have amounted to deliberate indifference. Moreover, it is unclear whether the court in\n   <em>\n    Shively\n   </em>\n   , presented with these facts, would have found the contours of the right clearly established in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

She claims that each of these reports took place in 2014, and each of these employees were also \"appropriate persons\" under Title IX. (Kent State MSJ Opp'n at 5236.) While it is likely that none of these individuals would qualify as \"appropriate persons\" for the same reasons that Linder fails to qualify, the Court need not reach this issue. Allegations relative to these alleged reports were absent from Kesterson's complaint and amended complaint. Further, in its May 8, 2018 memorandum opinion, the Court denied Kesterson's belated request to further amend to add facts relative to these additional reports to support a new theory of deliberate indifference because these allegations, if true, would have been known to Kesterson at the time she filed her complaint and her amended complaint.
