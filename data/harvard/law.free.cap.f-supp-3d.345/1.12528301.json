COLLYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This opinion will bore all but the litigating parties because it must recall so much of the procedural history of the case. In sum, the present question is whether the December 9, 2016 letter from the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior to the General Counsel of the National Indian Gaming Commission remains privileged and confidential, which bars the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, whose lands are the subject matter of the letter, from reviewing or appreciably contesting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The government asserts that the December 9, 2016 letter (Solicitor's Letter) is a predecisional and deliberative document,\n   but its very terms-provided\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   to the Court-demonstrate that it was a final and considered direction to the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) from the top legal officer at the Department of the Interior (Interior or DOI). The government further argues that the Solicitor's Letter is protected by the attorney work product doctrine, the attorney-client privilege, and is a confidential settlement communication. Only the attorney-client privilege warrants discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As detailed below, the Solicitor's Letter was the outcome of an extensive negotiation process among the Chairman of NIGC; the United States of America; DOI; Secretary S.M. Jewell, now Secretary Ryan Zinke, of DOI; the DOI Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs; the DOI Solicitor; the Department of Justice (DOJ); and the Fort Sill Apache Tribe (the Tribe). It is now more than\n   <em>\n    four years\n   </em>\n   since the Tribe first sued to obtain government action after years of delay. To have DOJ and DOI choose to assert the attorney-client privilege for the Solicitor's Letter, even though they usually waive that privilege for Indian lands opinions, is extraordinarily frustrating for the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nonetheless, the government is entitled to assert the privilege. Having done so here, its privilege protects the Solicitor's Letter from publication. Other than the Solicitor's Letter, however, the Court will grant the Tribe's request to complete the record with materials indirectly considered by NIGC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Fort Still Apache Tribe in New Mexico are descendants of the Apache led by the American Indian warrior Geronimo. It has a storied history that should shame the United States: once defeated, the Tribe was forced from its aboriginal lands in New Mexico to imprisonment in Florida under horrible conditions, then to imprisonment in Alabama under horrible conditions, and then to imprisonment in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. These and other details may be critical to a final decision in this matter. For now, it is sufficient to note that the Fort Sill Apache Tribe was listed in 1979 on the first published list of tribes officially recognized by the United States Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Fort Sill Apache have long desired to operate a casino at Akela Flats, New Mexico, which is part of its proclaimed reservation in that State. When it opened a gaming facility at Akela Flats in April 2009, the Chairman of NIGC issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) asserting that the Tribe had violated the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202701\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2719, because the lands were ineligible for gaming. Pending an expedited appeal to the full Commission, the Tribe shuttered the casino. When, after five years the Commission had not yet issued any decision, the Tribe sued in 2014 for unreasonable delay in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   By opinion issued on May 12, 2015, this Court refused to dismiss the lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fort Sill Apache Tribe v.

As recited above, the Tribe submitted documents upon request from DOJ, acting as counsel for NIGC and DOI, to DOJ, and DOI relied on those documents to draft the Solicitor's Letter. As memorialized in this Court's order, NIGC committed to review the Solicitor's Letter and, upon that basis, to decide whether to reconsider its 2015 Decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/17/2016 Order. DOJ now contends that the 39 documents submitted by the Tribe itself, referenced liberally in the Solicitor's Letter, are not part of the record. Specifically, it argues that NIGC was not in \"possession\" of the 39 documents and \"did not rely upon or consider the 39 documents during the decisionmaking process.\" Opp'n at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The argument concerning possession is unpersuasive. DOJ was most certainly in possession of the documents because the Tribe provided them to DOJ directly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clearly, DOI had possession of the 39 documents because it studied them assiduously and cited them in the Solicitor's Letter sent to NIGC. DOJ argues that the documents were \"not submitted to the proper division of an agency,\" Opp'n at 39, but this argument is rejected on these particular facts. As the parties\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   agreed-including DOJ, DOI and NIGC, among others-the DOI Solicitor reviewed the documents submitted by the Fort Sill Apache Tribe and analyzed the status of its lands at Akela Flats. The Solicitor's Letter reflects and cites the documents as part of the Solicitor's directions to NIGC. An agency may not scrub the record of all evidence that does not support the agency's final decision.\n   <em>\n    Blue Ocean Inst. v.

Having agreed to consider the Solicitor's Letter, and being under a Court order to consider the Solicitor's Letter, the Court concludes and finds that NIGC did consider the entirety of the Solicitor's Letter and thus indirectly considered the 39 documents that were discussed in its analysis. The Court finds that the 39 documents submitted by the Tribe comprise part of the administrative record and will order the production of the documents to complete the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The December 9, 2016 Solicitor's Letter is protected by the attorney-client privilege and the government agencies had a choice whether to withhold it from the Administrative Record or waive the privilege. They chose to withhold it. However, as discussed above, the 39 documents submitted by the Fort Sill Apache Tribe to DOJ, at Interior's behest, were part of the materials indirectly considered by NIGC in rendering its 2017 Decision and therefore must be made part of the administrative record so that it is complete.
