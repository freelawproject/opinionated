Finding that Omega's remaining state law claim of negligent misrepresentation satisfied Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court denied United's\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   as to this claim in regards to the non-ERISA plan participants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to the Court's\n   <em>\n    Ruling\n   </em>\n   , on October 20, 2017, Omega filed its\n   <em>\n    First Amended and Restated Class Action Complaint\n   </em>\n   (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, United has filed its second\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   Omega's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Omega is a hospital and surgical center in Metairie, Louisiana, that treats patients whose healthcare benefit plans are insured and/or administered by United. Omega\n   treats United's insureds on an out-of-network basis, which means that Omega does not have a pre-existing provider contract with United concerning reimbursement for medical services and equipment. As in its\n   <em>\n    Original Class Action Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Omega purports to bring ERISA claims on behalf of two representative patients identified as \"SJ\" and \"LL.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Omega now also brings state-law claims on behalf of a new representative patient, \"DB,\" who was allegedly a member of a United plan that was not covered by ERISA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   United, as claims administrator, adjudicates claims submitted on behalf of patients like \"SJ,\" \"LL,\" and \"DB,\" and determines the amounts to which each patient is entitled under the terms of his or her respective plan. For convenience, United pays patients' benefits directly to a provider, if directed to do so by the patient, as Omega alleges was done for \"SJ,\" \"LL,\" and \"DB.\" When United pays benefits directly to a provider, it issues a Provider Explanation of Benefits or a Provider Remittance Advice which explains the costs that are allowed under the plan, the patient's deductible and coinsurance obligations, the amount reimbursed by United, and the amount paid to the provider. A patient (or the properly authorized representative provider) may challenge the initial benefits determination through a multi-level appeals process, as Omega claims that it unsuccessfully did on behalf of \"LL.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In order to expedite the initial payment of benefits, United claims that insurers rely on automated systems to process the massive volumes of submitted claims in the first instance. Subsequently, United conducts audits to validate paid claims. In the event the audit reveals an overpayment on a patient's claims, United issues an overpayment notification to the provider in possession of the overpaid funds for said claims with claim information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   United submitted such overpayment notifications to Omega for previous claims' payments for \"SJ,\" \"LL,\" and \"DB.\" In each of these cases, Omega objected to United's determinations that it was entitled to reimbursement or recoupment of any overpayment. Because the recoupment amount was not paid, Omega contends that United offset the overpayment it sought by reducing subsequent \"payments for services rendered by Omega to unrelated patient accounts, none of which patient accounts and services were covered under the same United Group plan\" as patients \"SJ,\" \"LL,\" and \"DB.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Omega contends that the process used by United to identify, adjudicate, and then recover overpayments (via direct recoupment, cross-plan recoupment, offset, and/or withholding unrelated payments) made to providers and members of the putative classes violates both ERISA and Louisiana law, depending upon the specific plan at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Omega asserts that it brings the action on its own behalf and on behalf of an \"ERISA Plan Class\" which it defines as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   All healthcare providers in the State of Louisiana who, from ten (10) years prior to the filing date of this action to its final termination (\"the Class Period\"), provided or will provide healthcare services or supplies to patients insured under healthcare plans governed by ERISA\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   and insured or administered by the Defendants, and who, after pursuing reimbursement pursuant to an assignment from the Defendants' insured, and after having received payments from the Defendants, were subjected to retroactive requests for repayment of all or a part of such payments and/or to recoupment and/or to setoff, and/or cross-plan recoupment, or to compel[ ] or coerce[ ] repayments of prior benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Omega also brings this action on behalf of itself and a \"Non-ERISA Plan Class\" which it defines as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   All healthcare providers in the State of Louisiana who, from ten (10) years prior to the filing date of this action to its final termination (\"the Class Period\"), provided or will provide healthcare services or supplies to patients insured under healthcare plans governed by ERISA and insured or administered by the Defendants, and who, after pursuing reimbursement pursuant to an assignment from the Defendants' insured, and after having received payments from the Defendants, were subjected to retroactive requests for repayment of all or a part of such payments and/or to recoupment and/or to setoff, and/or cross-plan recoupment, or to compel[ ] or coerce[ ] repayments of prior benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Omega asserts four counts arising under ERISA in its\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint.\n   </em>\n   Because Omega has failed to identify the specific statutory provisions upon which it bases its claims, the Court construes the ERISA claims to be as follows: (1) a claim for benefits under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) a claim for failure to provide \"full and fair review\" of overpayment determinations that United later recouped in violation of ERISA \u00a7 503;\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) a breach of fiduciary duty claim seeking prospective declaratory and injunctive relief under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3)(A) barring United from pursuing future overpayment recovery;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) a breach of fiduciary duty claim based upon United's alleged failure to comply with the Plan terms, seeking equitable relief under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3)(B) compelling United to return \"all funds received from [Omega and the ERISA class]\" and \"all funds recouped or withheld from [them].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Omega asserts two claims under Louisiana law. In count\n   five, Omega asserts a negligent misrepresentation and fraud claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in count six, Omega asserts a new breach of contract claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   United now seeks dismissal of Omega's\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   on the following grounds: (1) Omega lacks standing to bring this case; (2) Omega has failed to exhaust administrative remedies; (3) Omega fails to state plausible ERISA claims; (4) the Court lacks supplemental jurisdiction over Omega's state law claims; and, (5) in the alternative, Omega's state law claims are implausible, and Omega's breach of contract claim is preempted as to the ERISA plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   United argues that Omega lacks standing as an assignee for four reasons. United contends that the relevant Plans contain anti-assignment clauses that specifically prohibit plan members from assigning their benefits; Omega's assignment form is \"inherently contradictory\" because it cannot \"simultaneously\" be an assignee of a plan member's rights and an authorized representative as to those same rights; Omega has, once again, failed to provide United with an actual copy of the assignments and the only form in United's possession for LL confers authorized representative status and not assignee status; and none of Omega's assignment forms allow it to seek prospective fiduciary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In response, Omega argues that Judge Brady's prior\n   <em>\n    Ruling\n   </em>\n   in this case, where he determined that Omega had standing to sue, forecloses any consideration of United's standing challenges raised in the instant\n   <em>\n    Motion.\n   </em>\n   Notably, Omega offers no legal support for its position. And, in spite of its argument, Omega addresses what it characterizes as the \"lone novel\" standing argument made by United, concerning the validity of the assignments in light of the Plans' anti-assignment language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aside from that, however, Omega fails to offer any opposition to United's standing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court disagrees with Omega's position. Importantly, United's prior\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   involved only facial attacks to standing, which limited the Court's analysis to the well-plead factual allegations of the\n   <em>\n    Complaint.\n   </em>\n   In the pending\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   , however, United has submitted evidence in support of its standing arguments. Hence, United's standing argument is no longer limited to facial attacks-it involves factual attacks, which alters the Court's analysis as well as the Plaintiff's burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To the extent Omega may be relying on the law-of-the-case doctrine to support its position, the Court finds the doctrine is not an impediment to considering United's standing arguments. The real significance of the law-of-the-case doctrine is that it \"preclude[s] a reexamination of issues of law decided on appeal, explicitly or by necessary implication, either by the district court on remand or by the appellate court in a subsequent appeal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Considering\n   that this case has yet to be examined on appeal, the law of the case doctrine does not preclude the Court from considering United's standing arguments. Accordingly, the Court shall address each of United's challenges to standing in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1. Validity of Omega's Assignments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), a civil enforcement action may be brought only by a plan participant, beneficiary, fiduciary, or the Secretary of Labor. The statutory provision provides no independent right for a provider, such as Omega, to seek redress under ERISA. However, the Fifth Circuit recognizes \"derivative standing\" for a plan participant who assigns plan benefits or rights to a non-enumerated party, such as a health care service provider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although Omega has alleged that it holds valid assignments executed by the representative patients that confer derivative standing on Omega to assert the ERISA claims in this lawsuit, United contends the assignments are invalid. In particular, United asserts that the relevant Plans contain anti-assignment clauses that expressly prohibit plan members from assigning their benefits to an out-of-network provider like Omega; therefore, Omega's assignments are invalid. In response, Omega contends, as United anticipated, that La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 (\"Louisiana's assignment statute\") and related jurisprudence, saves its assignments in the face of the Plans' anti-assignment provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court first turns its attention to the Plans' anti-assignment language. As previously explained, because this is a factual attack on standing, and the anti-assignment provisions are central to the claims at issue, the Court shall consider these provisions in evaluating United's\n   <em>\n    Motion.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the Summary Plan Description for representative patient \"SJ,\" the anti-assignment provision provides as follows: \"You may not assign your Benefits under the Plan to a non-Network provider without our consent. The Claims Administrator may, however, in their discretion, pay a non-Network provider directly for services rendered to you.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similar language also appears in representative patient \"LL's\" UnitedHealthcare Certificate of Coverage (\"COC\"): \"You may not assign your Benefits under the Policy to a non-Network provider without our consent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the COC for representative patient \"DB\" states: \"You may not assign your Benefits under the Policy to a non-Network provider without our consent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although the foregoing language appears to prohibit assignments, Omega contends that Louisiana's assignment statute invalidates the anti-assignment provisions. La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 provides in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   No insurance company, employee benefit trust, self-insurance plan, or other entity which is obligated to reimburse the individual or to pay for him or on his behalf the charges for the services rendered by the hospital shall pay those benefits to the individual when the itemized statement submitted to such entity clearly indicates that the individual's rights to those benefits have been assigned to the hospital. When any insurance company, employee benefit trust, self-insurance plan, or other entity has notice of such assignment prior to such payment, any payment to the insured shall not release said entity from liability to the hospital to which the benefits have been assigned, nor shall such payment be a defense to any action by the hospital against that entity to collect the assigned benefits. However, an interim statement shall be provided when requested by the patient or his authorized agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is undisputed that United complied with representative patients' assignments, insofar as they requested that United make direct payments as required by La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 to their provider, or Omega.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Omega was paid directly, United contends that La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 has been fully satisfied and cannot be invoked \"to do the further, far more intrusive work of invalidating ERISA plan terms that prohibit the transfer of contractual rights under the plan to non-participants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, United points out that the express language of the assignment statute neither \"purports to invalidate contractual restrictions on a member's right to assign his or her benefits,\" \"[n]or does it forbid plans from including anti-assignment clauses, render such clauses inoperable, or otherwise confer standing on providers like Omega.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, United contends that the representative patients are prohibited from assigning their legal rights under the Plans to Omega.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At first blush, United's argument appears logical. In response, however, Omega asserts that the Fifth Circuit's decision,\n   <em>\n    La. Health Serv. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Rapides Healthcare Sys.\n   </em>\n   (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   \"), has closed the door on United's argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   After considering\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds itself in agreement with Omega.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   , the plan administrator, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana (\"BCBSLA\"), filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 was preempted by ERISA to the extent that it applied to ERISA employee welfare benefit plans insured or administered by BCBSLA. Prior to filing suit, two hospitals had complained to the Louisiana Department of Insurance that BCBSLA failed to comply with the assignment statute after the hospitals terminated their participating provider agreements with BCBSLA. On the issue of preemption, BCBSLA advanced two arguments. First, BCBSLA asserted that La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 conflicted with ERISA's enforcement\n   scheme. Second, it argued that the assignment statute was expressly preempted because it was a law that \" 'relate[s] to' employee benefit plans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit was not persuaded by either argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As for the first argument, the\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   court found that ERISA was silent on the assignability of employee welfare benefits. The court further concluded that the assignment statute did not create an additional means to enforce payment of the benefits under an ERISA plan. Notably, the court explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The assignment of benefits from the patient to the hospital results solely in the transfer of the cause of action provided by \u00a7 502(a) from the patient to the hospital. The assignee takes what the assignor had; no more, no less. The assignment statute merely passes the sole enforcement mechanism-ERISA \u00a7 502-from patient to hospital; it does not impose any additional obligation on the ERISA plan administrator, nor does it create additional or separate means of enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   court held that La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 was not in conflict with ERISA's exclusive enforcement mechanism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As for its second argument, the\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   court disagreed with BCBSLA's contention that the \"application of the assignment statute will impermissibly interfere with nationally uniform plan administration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, the court found that the burden on the plan administrators would be minimal because La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 did not create any additional obligations; rather, the court suggested, the assignment statute might actually lessen BCBSLA's administrative responsibilities. \"With or without assignment, [BCBSLA] will pay benefits only one time, and payment is triggered upon submission of a claim form.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the court reasoned that it should not matter to BCBSLA \"whether the claim form comes from the plan participant, as provided in the plan documents, or from the hospital, as assignee of the participant's benefits claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Due to the \"intricacies of coverages, deductibles, and retentions of most health care plans,\" the burden on the plan seemed \"greater\" to the court when many individual plan participants individually filed their claims with BCBSLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, \"[b]y consolidating many different individual claims,\" the court reasoned that, \"hospitals [could] channel expertise in the benefits process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   court held that Louisiana's assignment statute was not preempted by ERISA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As discussed in\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   , the assignment of benefits under La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 also results in the transfer of the cause of action provided by ERISA \u00a7 502(a)-the sole enforcement mechanism-from the patient to the hospital. Therefore, contrary to United's position otherwise, when the representative patients' assigned direct payment of their benefits to Omega under La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010, this also inherently resulted in\n   the transfer of their legal rights to assert a Section 502(a) ERISA enforcement action to their provider. Accordingly, the Court finds that United's anti-assignment provisions are invalidated by La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In anticipation of such a finding, United argues that \"if the text of La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 could be construed to invalidate the plans' anti-assignment language, the statute would be preempted by ERISA,\" based upon the United States Supreme Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found that ERISA preempted a Vermont statute that imposed certain reporting, disclosure, and recordkeeping requirements upon health insurers, health care providers, health care facilities, and governmental agencies. According to the\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   Court, \"Vermont's reporting regime, which compel[led] plans to report detailed information about claims and plan members, both intrud[ed] upon 'a central matter of plan administration' and 'interfer[ed] with nationally uniform plan administration.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court explained that the matters that Vermont's law and regulations governed-plan reporting, disclosure, and recordkeeping-\"are fundamental components of ERISA's regulation of plan administration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, \"[d]iffering, or even parallel, regulations from multiple jurisdictions could create wasteful administrative costs and threaten to subject plans to wide-raging liability;\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   therefore; \"[p]re-emption is necessary to prevent the States from imposing novel, inconsistent and burdensome reporting requirements on plans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   Court held that ERISA preempted Vermont's statute as applied to ERISA plans because it \"impose[d] duties that are inconsistent with the central design of ERISA, which is to provide a single uniform national scheme for the administration of ERISA plans without interference from the laws of the several States even when those laws, to a large extent, impose parallel requirements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   According to United,\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   \"eviscerated the very reasoning upon which the Fifth Circuit relied on in [\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   ] in declining to hold La. R.S. 40:2010 was preempted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   United's challenge to the\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   decision, however, is not an original one. In fact a similar argument was made in and rejected by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc. v. Community Health Systems Trust Health Plan\n   </em>\n   (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the plan sponsor and administrator argued that the provider, CHS, lacked standing to sue because the plan's anti-assignment clause voided the provider's assignment. In response, the plaintiff-provider argued that Tennessee law, which governed the plan, prohibited anti-assignment clauses in insurance contracts; therefore, the plan's anti-assignment clause was invalid. After determining\n   that Tennessee law applied to the plan, the district court considered whether Tennessee's assignment statute was preempted by ERISA. In particular, the court considered whether Tennessee's statute had a connection with an ERISA plan because the law \" 'interferes with nationally uniform plan administration.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Fifth Circuit had never considered Tennessee's assignment statute, and due to its similarities with La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010, the\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   court referred to and relied on the\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   decision in rejecting the defendants' preemption argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, for the same reasons as in [\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   ], the Court finds that Tennessee's assignment statute does not govern a central matter of plan administration or interfere with uniform plan administration. It does not create additional obligations on the CHS Plan. The healthcare provider takes what the participant had-no more, no less. And it makes the administrative process easier by allowing the CHS Plan to deal with experienced healthcare providers instead of individual participants. Under the statute, CHS remains free to forbid assignments to non-medical third parties who lack this expertise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Like United attempts to do in this case, the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   argued that the legal framework underlying\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   was dismissed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Gobeille.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   court flatly rejected the defendants' argument stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Recognizing [\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare's\n   </em>\n   ] controlling strength, Defendants seek to weaken its pull by arguing that its framework was brushed aside by\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court found that ERISA preempted a Vermont law. Their argument is unconvincing.\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   did not modify the framework used in\n   <em>\n    Louisiana Health Service.\n   </em>\n   The results differed because the state laws touched different subjects. In\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   , Vermont required ERISA plans to report information about claims and plan members. The Supreme Court found preemption necessary because ERISA has extensive reporting and disclosure requirements that are fundamental to its operation. Differing, or even parallel, regulations touching upon recordkeeping, such as Vermont's reporting regime, intrude upon this crucial component of ERISA and subject ERISA plans to new and wide-ranging liability. In contrast, the Tennessee statute does not intrude upon any fundamental part of ERISA because ERISA says precisely nothing about assignments. And unlike Vermont's requirements, the Tennessee statute does not expose plans to any additional liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Subsequent to\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   , two other district courts within the Fifth Circuit have reaffirmed the analysis and holding of\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Gobeille.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Like the\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Newco Inc.\n   </em>\n   , this Court too finds that\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   did not modify the\n   <em>\n    Rapides Healthcare\n   </em>\n   framework. The outcomes varied due to the nature of the state laws at issue. Unlike Louisiana's assignment statute, the contested Vermont statute in\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   imposed recordkeeping and reporting requirements on ERISA plans in addition to those already imposed by ERISA. La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010, which deals expressly with assignments \"does not intrude upon any fundamental part of ERISA,\" because ERISA is silent with respect to the assignability of benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010\"expose plans to any additional liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court hereby rejects United's argument that La. R.S. \u00a7 40:2010 has been preempted under\n   <em>\n    Gobeille.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2. Validity of Assignment Language as Matter of Contract Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As an alternative argument, United asserts that, in spite of the validity of the anti-assignment clauses, the assignment forms Omega claims to obtain from its patients are ambiguous, \"inherently contradictory[,] and therefore invalid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   United has provided copies of the patient-signed \"Assignment of Benefit\" forms for SJ and DB, and further concedes that the language cited by Omega in the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   corresponds to the actual Assignment language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   The undisputed language of Omega's Assignment of Benefits form is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS IS A DIRECT ASSIGNMENT OF MY RIGHTS AND BENEFITS UNDER THIS POLICY TO OMEGA HOSPITAL, L.L.C., AND DIRECT PAYMENT OF THESE BENEFITS AND OTHER AMOUNTS TO OMEGA, L.L.C. AS REQUIRED BY LA. R.S. SECTION 40:2010. I ALSO HEREBY APPOINT THE ABOVE DESIGNATED PROVIDER TO ACT AS MY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE FOR ANY HEALTH BENEFIT CLAIM FILED ON MY BEHALF FOR SERVICES RENDERED OR REQUESTED BY THIS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   I hereby assign to Omega Hospital, L.L.C. (\"Omega\"), all of my rights to benefits from\n   <em>\n    UHC\n   </em>\n   Insurance Company (the \"Insurance Company\") and all other insurance companies, employee benefit trusts, self-insurance plans, or other entities that are obligated to reimburse me or to pay benefits or other amounts for me or on my behalf for services rendered by Omega, as well as all of my rights to proceed against and file suits and claims against the Insurance Company with respect to these reimbursements, benefits, or other amounts, including, without limitation, my right to contest the amount of any payments made by the Insurance Company or to\n   compel the payment of any amount. I further hereby instruct and direct Insurance Company to pay directly to Omega all such reimbursement, professional or medical expense benefits, and other amounts allowable and otherwise payable under my current insurance policy by reason of services rendered by Omega, as payment toward Omega's total charges, by check made out and mailed to....\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is United's position that Omega's Assignment of Benefits form is unenforceable as a matter of law, because Omega cannot simultaneously serve as an assignee of a plan member's rights and an authorized representative as to those same rights. According to United, this is because \"[a]n 'authorized representative' ... works on behalf of the patient with respect to a benefit decision or appeal, and an assignee ... acts on its own behalf as if it was the assignor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While it is true that authorized representatives must sue \"on behalf of\" patients, and only assignees may file suit in their own names, United has not adequately explained to the Court why an assignment cannot do both. When faced with a similar argument, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in\n   <em>\n    Outpatient Specialty Surgery Partners, Ltd. v. Unitedhealthcare Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   explained how it actually \"makes sense that healthcare provider would ask patients to convey both statuses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court reasoned that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   While healthcare providers must be assignees of participants or beneficiaries to have standing under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, ERISA regulations require that an employee benefit plan's 'claims procedures do not preclude an authorized representative of a claimant from acting on behalf of such claimant in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal of an adverse benefit determination.'\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Ultimately, the\n   <em>\n    Outpatient\n   </em>\n   court concluded that a healthcare provider might want the authority to proceed in both capacities on behalf of a patient in order to pursue a full range of legal and administrative remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court finds the\n   <em>\n    Outpatient's\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning to be persuasive and similarly concludes that an assignment may confer both authorized representative and assignee status to a provider. Accordingly, the Court denies United's\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   3. Assignment for Patient LL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   United argues that it is no longer plausible that Omega is an assignee of\n   patient LL, and, therefore, those claims should be dismissed. As previously discussed, United has come forward with the \"Assignment of Benefit\" forms for SJ and DB that were in its possession. However, United claims that it has no such form for LL in its files, and the form that it does have for LL bears no similarity to either the language in the Assignment of Benefit forms for SJ and DB, or as alleged in the pleadings. United argues that LL's form only conferred authorized representative status to Omega. Additionally, LL's form expired in April of 2015, more than sixteen months before Omega filed the instant lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Omega fails to address United's argument head-on. Instead, Omega suggests in a footnote that \"United could not have and would not have reimbursed Omega in the first instance had Omega failed to submit to it the proper from assigning 'LL's claims to Omega.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reply, United has also provided LL's Certificate of Coverage, which is considered part of LL's Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides that regardless of any assignment, United may, in its discretion, \"pay a non-Network provider directly for services rendered to you.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As this is a factual challenge to standing, and the assignments are central to the claims asserted in the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , the Court shall consider the form submitted by Omega on behalf of LL. The form, which was signed and dated by LL on April 2, 2014, is captioned as a \"Member Authorization Form for a Designated Representative to Appeal a Determination,\" (\"Authorization Form\") and provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   I hereby authorize Omega Hospital, L.L.C. to appeal United Healthcare's Determination concerning [L.L.], on my behalf, as my Designated Representative, and, as part of the appeal, I hereby authorize United Healthcare in its decision letter and in connection with the processing of my appeal, to communicate with my Designated Representative in all aspects of the appeal. I understand that these communications may contain the following: All medical and financial information contained in my insurance file ... I understand this information is privileged and confidential and will only be released as specified in this Authorization, or as required or permitted by law. This authorization is valid for a period of one year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Omega has alleged that LL executed an Assignment of Benefits from on November, 27, 2013, which contains the same language as the Assignment of Benefits forms for SJ and DB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   After comparing the language of LL's Authorization Form produced by United with the actual language of the Assignment of Benefits forms for SJ and DB, it is clear to the Court that the former does not confer any assignment of benefits or rights to Omega.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For instance, not only is the Authorization Form captioned differently than the Assignment of Benefits forms, but the Authorization Form is devoid of any language assigning to Omega the benefits or right to sue or bring claims for services rendered on behalf of patient LL. Instead, the Authorization Form allows Omega to serve in the limited capacity as LL's authorized representative for one year, or until April 2, 2015, for the sole purpose of appealing United's decision regarding payment for medical services. LL's Authorization Form actually corresponds with Omega's allegations that it filed a \"second level appeal\" on behalf of LL on April 2, 2014 \"through the enclosed Authorization and/or Assignment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Omega has repeatedly argued, however, the benefits sought through the initial appeals process, which includes the second level appeal, are not at issue in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While it was Omega's burden to submit facts through some evidentiary method to establish that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over its claims, Omega failed to do so. Instead, Omega suggests that the Court infer that an Assignment of Benefits form for LL exists. Initially, the Court finds that an inference, without more, will not carry Omega's evidentiary burden on this factual challenge to standing. Furthermore, the Court finds that such an inference is unwarranted, because LL's Plan documents allow United to pay providers directly at its discretion, regardless of any Assignment. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds Omega has failed to demonstrate that it is an assignee of patient LL. Accordingly, the Court further finds that Omega lacks standing to assert any ERISA claims on LL's behalf, and those claims shall be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   4. Breach of Fiduciary Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In Count III of its\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Omega reurges what purports to be a Section 502(a)(3)(A) breach of fiduciary duty claim seeking prospective equitable relief. Omega seeks declaratory and injunctive relief that would prohibit United from recovering future or prospective overpayments in a manner that Omega claims violates the terms of its patients' Plans. Relying on the language of the Assignment of Benefits form, United argues that because Omega's assignments are narrow in scope, Omega lacks standing to pursue claims seeking prospective relief, such as its claims for breach of fiduciary duties. In response, Omega asserts that the Court resolved this issue in its prior\n   <em>\n    Ruling\n   </em>\n   when it found that Omega had Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As an initial matter, and for those reasons previously discussed, the Court finds that Omega's argument lacks merit because United has now raised a factual attack to standing by submitting the Assignment of Benefits forms for SJ and DB. Because Omega refers to the assignments in its\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , and these assignments are central to the predicate question of whether Omega has standing to bring its claims, the Court deems it appropriate to consider the Assignment of Benefits forms in determining whether Omega has standing to assert its Section 502(a)(3) breach of fiduciary duty claim seeking prospective relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court finds the New Jersey District Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Premier Health Center, P.C. v. Unitedhealth Group\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Premier Health\n   </em>\n   \") to be instructive on this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   One of the issues raised in the\n   <em>\n    Premier Health\n   </em>\n   decision was whether a medical care provider, who receives an assignment of benefits from a patient, is a beneficiary under ERISA with standing to pursue all of the remedies afforded under ERISA, including prospective injunctive relief. The relevant patient assignments provided that the patient:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   assign[s] directly to Dr. Rodgers all insurance benefits, if any, otherwise payable to me for the services rendered. I understand that I am financially responsible for all charges whether or not paid by insurance. I hereby authorize the doctor to release all information necessary to secure payment of benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In its reasoning, the court acknowledged its prior holdings where it found that \"an assignment of benefits to a provider logically gives the provider standing to bring claims under ERISA for the benefits it was assigned.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, the\n   <em>\n    Premier Health\n   </em>\n   court explained how such an \"assignment of benefits from a patient for services by a given healthcare provider cannot logically imply the right to assert ERISA claims for injunctive relief on behalf of that patient for services that he or she may receive from other providers in the future.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   To allow a healthcare provider to assert such claims \"would unknowingly deprive the subscriber of standing to assert those claims in the future.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Premier Health\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the patient assignments which assigned to the provider \"all insurance benefits ... otherwise payable to [the patient] for the services rendered\" was not sufficient to provide standing to assert ERISA claims to enjoin the plan's future application of its utilization review procedures, because those claims exceeded the scope of the assignments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Relying on the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Premier Health\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that Omega's assignments fail to encompass prospective claims for injunctive relief. In this case, Omega's \"Assignment of Benefits and Designation\" forms provide in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS IS A DIRECT ASSIGNMENT OF MY RIGHTS AND BENEFITS UNDER THIS POLICY TO OMEGA HOSPITAL, L.L.C., AND DIRECT PAYMENT OF THESE BENEFITS AND OTHER AMOUNTS TO OMEGA, L.L.C.

Here, the assignments clearly assign to Omega the right to file suits and pursue claims against the patient-assignee's insurance company to seek reimbursements, benefits, and recover other amounts for \"services rendered\" by Omega. Importantly, however, this assignment does not give Omega the right to pursue prospective injunctive or declaratory relief for its patients on future claims for reimbursement and benefits. The assignment specifically qualifies the assignment of rights to those for past services provided by Omega (i.e., \"services rendered\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   United also correctly argues that within the Fifth Circuit, a health care provider can obtain derivative standing to assert an ERISA claim for a breach of fiduciary duty under Section 502(a)(3), if the claim is expressly and knowingly assigned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Assignments that do not refer specifically to fiduciary duty or other non-benefits ERISA claims do not assign non-benefits claims to the plaintiff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Texas Life, Accident, Health &amp; Hospital Service Insurance Guaranty Association v.

The assignments stated that the assignor\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   does hereby sell, transfer, convey, grant and irrevocably and forever assign to [Victory] all known and unknown, past, present, and\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   rights, title and interest in all claims,\n   <em>\n    causes of action\n   </em>\n   (i.e., pursuant to common law, statute, or in\n   equity and whether based upon tort, breach of contract,\n   <em>\n    breach of fiduciary duty\n   </em>\n   , or otherwise), insurance benefits, health care benefits and all other legal rights or recovery from/against ...

As previously discussed, without \"an express and knowing assignment of an ERISA fiduciary breach claim,\" all of Omega's breach of fiduciary claims must fail for lack of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's finding affects all of Omega's breach of fiduciary claims. In other words, Count 4 of the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   -Omega's claim that United breached its fiduciary duty by failing to comply with terms of the Plans by engaging in cross-plan offsetting-must also be dismissed due to a lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Omega lacks derivative standing to assert its Section 502(a)(3)(A) breach of fiduciary duty claim seeking prospective relief, and Section 502(a)(3)(B) breach of fiduciary duty claim seeking unjust enrichment due to United's failure to comply with the terms of the Plans. Accordingly, Count III and Count IV of Omega's\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   shall be dismissed for lack of derivative standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   United argues that even if the Court were to find that Omega had plead a plausible violation of plan terms or ERISA, it forfeited the right to bring suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. United contends that because it is clear from the face of the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   that Omega failed to exhaust administrative remedies by conceding that it failed to pursue an ERISA member appeal of United's overpayment determinations for SJ and LL, dismissal is appropriate. United asserts that Omega should not be afforded any equitable relief excusing it from proving exhaustion at this juncture because Omega had admittedly taken advantage of United's administrative remedies in the past. United further argues that Omega's informal attempt to appeal the reimbursements sought or Audit Findings/Overpayment Notification via letter in November 2013, is not a substitute for the formal ERISA appeals process necessary for purposes of exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In response, Omega makes two arguments. Omega contends that it exhausted the only administrative remedies made available for challenging United's audit and recoupment process. To the extent it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, Omega asserts that because United\n   failed to furnish Omega with notice of the ERISA appeals procedures, it was denied of meaningful access to pursue an ERISA appeal. In the alternative, Omega asserts that any failure to appeal United's overpayment determinations should be excused as being futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"Generally, a claimant seeking to recover plan benefits under ERISA must first exhaust available remedies under the plan before bringing suit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The primary purposes of the exhaustion requirement are to: (1) uphold Congress' desire that ERISA trustees be responsible for their actions, not the federal courts; (2) provide a sufficiently clear record of administrative action if litigation should ensue; and (3) assure that any judicial review of fiduciary action (or inaction) is made under the arbitrary and capricious standard, not\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, \"[t]he Fifth Circuit has held that exceptions to the exhaustion requirement are appropriate where the available administrative remedies either are unavailable or wholly inappropriate to the relief sought, or where the attempt to exhaust administrative remedies would be a patently futile course of action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \"[U]nder\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), an ERISA benefit plan must 'establish and maintain reasonable procedures governing the filing of benefit claims, notification of benefit determinations, and appeal of adverse benefit determinations....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In the case of the failure of a plan to establish or follow claims procedures consistent with the requirements of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] ... a claimant shall be deemed to have exhausted administrative remedies available under the plan and shall be entitled to pursue any available remedies under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ] [.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As for its first argument, Omega has alleged that it contested United's unilateral cross-plan offsetting and recoupment practices through the only remedy made available to it during the audit process. For patient SJ, upon receipt of the \"Audit Findings/Overpayment Notification,\" Omega allegedly, through written correspondence, expressed its disagreement with the audit findings within 30 days of the notification and requested that United \"disclose the sources of [its] alleged information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, United notified Omega that its request for overpayment refund remained valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the notification contained a summary of adjustments that supported a reduced reimbursement, Omega claims that the notification failed to identify or reference the operative Plan terms that permitted such recoupment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, Omega submitted another letter objecting to United's determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   For patient LL, Omega also alleged that there was no citation to any Plan terms that supported the decision or any detailed explanation\n   for the alleged overpayment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n   Omega further claimed that \"[t]he internal rules, protocols, and supporting material data relied on for the decision were not furnished, and the United insured was not copied with the letter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   For both patients LL and DB, Omega has also plead that it objected to United's recoupment notification by letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Based upon the foregoing allegations, the Court finds that Omega has plead facts indicating that that it was denied meaningful access to administrative remedies. In particular, Omega has sufficiently alleged that it pursued the only available administrative remedy that United made available in order to challenge the overpayment determinations as to SJ, LL, and DB-through the submission of correspondence objecting to United's audit determination. Omega has also plead that it did not enjoy meaningful access to administrative remedies because United failed to reference the specific Plan provisions on which the overpayment determinations were made and which set forth the applicable procedures for Omega to pursue an administrative review of United's overpayment determinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Omega has sufficiently alleged that exhaustion should be excused due to United's failure to provide meaningful access to administrative remedies. In light of this finding, the Court need not reach Omega's second argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Nevertheless, the Court finds that Omega's claim must fail because it has not plausibly plead that it is entitled to the benefits at issue-those recouped by cross-plan offsetting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Even accepting the well-plead factual allegations as true, the Court finds that Omega has failed to allege that United directly recouped any overpayments from the ERISA Plans of SJ or LL as a result of the unilateral post-payment audits. Nor has Omega alleged that the representative Plans at issue in this case-SJ's Plan, LL's Plan, or DB's Plan, for that matter-ever executed cross-plan offsets in making their payments to Omega. Rather, the allegations provide that after payments for Covered Services were initially made to Omega under the three\n   Plans, United determined that Omega had been overpaid and requested reimbursement via audit. Critically, the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   alleges that the overpayments pertaining to these three Plans were recouped by \"reducing payment for services rendered by Omega to\n   <strong>\n    unrelated patient accounts\n   </strong>\n   , none of which patient accounts and services were covered under the same United Group plan\" as SJ, LL, or DB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   More simply put, Omega has alleged that the Plans of other, unrelated patients, executed offsets to Omega, that allowed United to recover for the overpayments made to Omega on behalf of SJ, LL, and DB. While such allegations may create the inference that \"unrelated patients\" are entitled to those benefits recouped through cross-plan offsetting, they fail to state a plausible claim that the patients on whose behalf Omega brings this lawsuit-SJ and LL-are entitled to such benefits under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Moreover, as correctly argued by United, in order for Omega to challenge the legality of the cross-plan offsets, it must sue using the rights of patients who are participants in the Plans that executed the offsets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based upon the well-plead allegations of the\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , however, it is clear that Omega has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Omega and ERISA Plan class representative SJ has failed to allege a plausible claim for benefits under ERISA. Accordingly, Omega's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(1)(B) claim must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   2.

Omega has failed to respond to either argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Omega appears to concede that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201133\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not provide an independent basis for a claim because it fails to oppose United's contention. In conducting its own review of jurisprudence within the Fifth Circuit, the Court has determined that district courts have found that while Section 1133 does not create a private right of action for compensatory relief, it does allow for equitable relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   Omega seeks relief in the form of exhaustion of its administrative remedies due to United's alleged failure to provide full and fair review, reasonable claims procedures, and necessary notices and disclosures. In the alternative, Omega claims that exhaustion should be excused as futile, and \"all benefits diverted or retained by the Defendants should be returned to the putative ERISA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Class member.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that the relief sought by Omega is clearly equitable in nature. Accordingly, the Court further finds that United's argument fails on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As for United's second argument, Omega again appears to concede United's point for failure to oppose it. Within the Fifth Circuit, district courts have found that the ERISA Plan, itself, is the only proper defendant in a Section 503 claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, Omega has not alleged that United is the \"Plan.\" Instead, Omega has alleged that United is the \"Plan Administrator\" and ERISA fiduciary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, dismissal of Omega's Section 503 claim is warranted on this on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    D. State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court now turns its attention to Omega's remaining state law breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation claims. Omega has not alleged any independent basis for federal jurisdiction over these claims. While district courts have supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims that are \"so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy,\" the court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Court has dismissed all of Omega's ERISA claims over which it had original jurisdiction, it declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Omega's state law claims.
