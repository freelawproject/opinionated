Over the past decade, Deerpoint has enjoyed explosive demand for its precision-fed patented fertilizers at custom irrigation sites. Deerpoint custom builds each chemical feed system for each site. Deerpoint sells its products and services within California and Arizona. Deerpoint utilizes integrated systems of fertilizers, which are custom-blended through proprietary methods, and applied to crops through data-controlled mechanical delivery systems. Proprietary blends of fertilizers and foliar products\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are the backbone of Deerpoint's product line. Deerpoint's fertilizers are tailored to a variety of crops and conditions. Further, at the heart of Deerpoint's fertigation\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   program is patented precision feeding equipment, which has been nicknamed the \"White Box\" by Deerpoint's customers. Deerpoint has invested millions of dollars customizing its fertilizers, foliar products, and equipment to a wide range of crops and environments, and archives its products and services for the growers that use its services. The confidential, proprietary, and trade secret nature of Deerpoint's fertilizer and foliar blends is essential to Deerpoint's business, and is the source of much business goodwill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Deerpoint puts a premium on its employees to maintain strict confidentiality over its proprietary formulations, practices, methods, insights, intellectual property, and other information. Since Deerpoint's founding in 1993, it has required its employees and executives to execute a detailed confidentiality agreement, the Employees Invention and Secrecy Agreement (the \"EIS\"). Deerpoint steadfastly enforces the EIS. Since at least 2000, every employee signs the EIS. Deerpoint's employee handbook also contains policies relating to confidentiality, and in 2016, Deerpoint implemented a new-hire training program that highlighted its policies, including the confidentiality policies. Deerpoint also regulates the access and exchange of information within the company, restricts access to certain information, and ensures that its confidential information is confined to company-owned computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Until October 4, 2017, Mahoney was the Chief Executive Officer of Deerpoint. Mahoney signed the EIS and an updated EIS in 2016. Despite the EIS, Mahoney acted to gain access to, and download from, a central computer Deerpoint's confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information. Further, prior to his departure, Mahoney was seen removing files and documents relating to formulation manufacturers, vendors, and suppliers. Mahoney and Deerpoint mutually agreed to terminate his employment on October 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 3, 2017, Mahoney filed a lawsuit in the Fresno County Superior Court against Deerpoint (\"the Lawsuit\"). On October 7, 2017, Mahoney filed an administrative\n   complaint with the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment against Deerpoint. These matters were stayed pending settlement negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sometime in October 2017, Mahoney launched a direct competitor to Deerpoint, Agrigenix. Mahoney is the president and chief executive officer of Agrigenix. Agrigenix promotes itself as an alternative to Deerpoint by feeding crops the precise nutrients need, in exactly the right amounts, at the right time for optimum growth. Agrigenix states that it provides a full line of nutrients and fertilizer blends formulated with proprietary chemistries. However, the blends are pirated from Deerpoint. Agrigenix also has foliar blends that mimic Deerpoint. Mahoney and Agrigenix possessed Deerpoint's confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information, and Mahoney founded Agrigenix on trade secrets misappropriated from Deerpoint. Agrigenix has told Deerpoint's customers that it is \"the same as Deerpoint with a twist.\" Four large clients of Deerpoint have switched to Agrigenix. Further, circumstances suggest that Agrigenix/Mahoney may have taken steps to steal and copy Deerpoint's White Box technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 8, 2018, Mahoney and Deerpoint signed a Settlement Agreement (\"the Settlement\"). The Settlement resolved the Lawsuit and all other claims that the Mahoney and Deerpoint had against each other. The Settlement included a provision that Paragraph 3 of the EIS remained in full force, a provision in which Mahoney acknowledged the confidential and proprietary nature of Deerpoint's trade secret information, a provision in which Mahoney agreed not to divulge or use Deerpoint's trade secrets and to take steps to protect such information from disclosure, and to return Deerpoint's property that was in Mahoney's possession. Around March 2018, Agrigenix installed at least four devices that approximate Deerpoint's White Boxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     SETTLEMENT BAR\n    </strong>\n    -\n    <strong>\n     1st, 2nd, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Causes of Action\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Argument\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants argue that the Settlement bars all claims based on conduct that occurred up to and including January 8, 2018. The language of the Settlement is broad and settles all claims between Deerpoint and Defendants, regardless of whether the claims were known or unknown, that existed before and at the time the settlement was executed. Although Agrigenix was not a signatory to the settlement, its conduct is encompassed by the Settlement as a third-party beneficiary because it was a person acting under, by, through, or in concert with Mahoney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In reply, Defendants argue that Deerpoint has judicially admitted through the allegations in the complaint that Agrigenix acted together and in concert with Mahoney. That judicial admission shows that Deerpoint's claims against Agrigenix were covered by the Settlement. Defendants also argue that a claim under CUTSA arises against a given defendant only once, at the time of the initial misappropriation, and that all other wrongful uses of the particular trade secret augments the single claim. Since the Settlement resolved Deerpoint's trade secret cause of action, and there is only one misappropriation claim possible against any one person, Deerpoint's trade secret misappropriation claims that are based on post-Settlement conduct are barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Opposition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Deerpoint argues that the Settlement does not bar claims that accrued after the Settlement was signed, and that the Complaint\n   contains many such claims. For example, the Settlement reaffirmed the confidential relationship between Mahoney and Deerpoint with respect to its trade secrets and obligated Mahoney to return Deerpoint's property/confidential information. These provisions preserved the ability of Deerpoint to bring a post-Settlement CUTSA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to claims that accrued pre-Settlement, the Settlement does not bar such claims as to Agrigenix. First, Defendants' argument is based on the inferential facts that Deerpoint knew that Agrigenix was up and running by January 8, 2018, and that the Settlement's release included any pre-existing-yet-unknown claims it had against Agrigenix. This logic leads to the absurd result that Deerpoint released each and every former employee who went to work at Agrigenix simply because Deerpoint knew of the new employment on January 8, 2018. Second, Agrigenix has not shown that the signatories intended for it to be a third-party beneficiary. Agrigenix does not provide an ordinary interpretation of the isolated term \"acting in concert,\" nor does it account for other portions of the settlement agreement. For example, the Settlement defines its scope by reference to the lawsuit brought by Mahoney and the potential cross claims that could have been brought by Deerpoint, but Agrigenix was not a party to that lawsuit. The Settlement's release defines the subject matter released in the same way. At best, there is ambiguity in the Settlement, and that ambiguity is a question of fact that cannot be resolved in this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Relevant Contractual Provisions\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under the \"Recitals\" portion of the Settlement, the Settlement explains that Mahoney filed an administrative complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, on October 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement \u00b6 B. A lawsuit was filed by Mahoney in the Fresno County Superior Court on October 3, 2017, known as \"the Lawsuit,\" which included the October 6 DFEH complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337446\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/837/#p842\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 C.

However, a review of the remainder of the\n   Agreement muddies the water;\n   <em>\n    it is not clear that Junction intended to release claims arising from defendants' future use of the trade secrets at issue.\n   </em>\n   For example, Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Settlement Agreement require defendants to return all of Junction's confidential information relating to the trade secrets at issue, renounce ownership of any of the work they did for Junction, reaffirm their confidentiality obligations under their employment agreements with Junction, and agree that the \"Junction Developments and Axapta Developments ... are the property of [Junction].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants insist that Junction is alleging one continuous claim rather than a new claim because a claim for misappropriation of a trade secret can arise only once, when the confidential relationship between the parties is initially breached.

LEXIS 86958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Deerpoint is correct that \u00a7 14 of the Settlement in part addresses and reaffirms confidentiality/trade secret provisions of the EIS and requires Mahoney to return \"trade secret properties.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14.3-14.5. However, the Court is not convinced that these aspects of the Settlement are sufficient to preserve/create post-Settlement CUTSA claims. First, CUTSA does not create any affirmative obligations to return trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That obligation is created by the Settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A failure to return misappropriated trade secrets alone violates only the obligations of the Settlement; it violates no provision of CUTSA. Second, the Court is unaware of any place in the Settlement that addresses either obligations or causes of action under CUTSA. The Settlement reaffirms prior contractual obligations and provides for injunctive relief. However, there is no mention of CUTSA or an express attempt within the Settlement to resurrect or create a future CUTSA claim based on previously misappropriated trade secrets. It is unknown why a reaffirmation of a prior contractual obligation, without any reference to CUTSA, should be read as creating new CUTSA claims that would otherwise be contrary to CUTSA itself/\n   <em>\n    Cadence Design\n   </em>\n   's recognition that there is only one misappropriation claim against a single defendant for misappropriation of a particular trade secret.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Court agrees that the Settlement does not prohibit future actions under \"California law\" regarding the misappropriated secrets, in the absence of any reference to CUTSA, that\n   law would likely be the California law of contracts, not CUTSA. Under California law, as explained by\n   <em>\n    Cadence Design\n   </em>\n   , the parties have resolved Deerpoint's CUTSA claim. If the parties truly intended to create what would be a claim previously unknown to CUTSA through the Settlement, then language that deals with CUTSA specifically should have been used. As it stands, the Court sees future contract related claims implicated by the Settlement, but not CUTSA claims for previously misappropriated trade secrets. Third, while\n   <em>\n    Cadence Design\n   </em>\n   held that parties to a release could make it as broad or as narrow as they like, no explanations or examples were given as to what the California Supreme Court envisioned. It seems to the Court that a release may exclude CUTSA claims, or expressly incorporate CUTSA remedies for a breach of the release, or estop a party from raising certain defenses to a CUTSA claim based on the further use of a previously misappropriated trade secret. Such provisions would affect the breadth of the release, prevent the misappropriator from obtaining a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   license, and, at least with respect to the first and third examples, may give an indication that parties intended for a CUTSA claim to persist. However,\n   <em>\n    Cadence Design\n   </em>\n   did not hold that merely reaffirming a prior existing contractual obligation in a release would have the effect of creating a new CUTSA cause of action where none would otherwise exist. The Court is unaware of any California case that has interpreted the relevant language of\n   <em>\n    Cadence Design\n   </em>\n   consistent with Deerpoint's position, and Deerpoint has cited none. Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that the mere fact that prior contractual obligations were reaffirmed, or that Mahoney was obligated to return or destroy Deerpoint property, would create a totally new and heretofore legally unrecognized CUTSA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Cadence Design\n   </em>\n   , dismissal of Deerpoint's post-Settlement based CUTSA claims without leave to amend is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    (2)\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DTSA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The DTSA is largely modelled after the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"UTSA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

The plain language of the release is not limited to claims by or against Mahoney or Agrigenix, nor is limited to claims that arise from Mahoney's employment or to claims that relate to the Lawsuit. The release applies to every possible claim the parties could have against each other, and it identifies numerous other persons and entities as being \"released\" from those possible claims, including \"employees,\" \"agents,\" and \"subsidiaries.\" If the release were intended to only cover Agrigenix and Mahoney, listing the numerous \"third parties\" would be unnecessary. Based on the plain language of the release, Agrigenix is arguably an \"affiliate\" or a \"related company\" because it was founded and run by Mahoney, or a \"person acting under, by, through, or in concert with [Mahoney],\" because it used the trade secrets acquired by Mahoney. Settlement \u00b6 7. Through any one of these categories, Agrigenix would be a third-party beneficiary and, as discussed above with respect to Mahoney, all CUTSA claims against it would be barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On the other hand, while Deerpoint does not provide alternative interpretations with respect to creating ambiguous meanings, Deerpoint does address the context of the Settlement, which is consistent with the \"Recitals\" section of the Settlement, and argues that Agrigenix's arguments depend on Deerpoint knowing that Agrigenix was up and running on January 8, 2018. The Court takes the latter argument as indicating that Deerpoint did not know of Agrigenix's existence. As indicated above, the Recitals explain that Mahoney is a former employee of Deerpoint who filed administrative complaints and the Lawsuit, the Lawsuit was stayed for settlement negotiations, Deerpoint threatened cross-complaints and counterclaims regarding trade secrets, and that the parties \"settled, fully and finally, all claims the Parties [i.e. Mahoney and Deerpoint] might have against each other up to and including the date of execution of this Agreement including, but not limited to, those claims which have been or could have been made in the Lawsuit.\" Settlement at \u00b6\u00b6 A-E. The context of the Settlement therefore centers around the Lawsuit and the claims that could have been made as part of the Lawsuit, even if the Lawsuit was removed to federal court. The Lawsuit involved claims by and against Deerpoint and Mahoney only, it would not involve claims against Agrigenix. Although the language of the Settlement and its release are broader than the Lawsuit, the Lawsuit was nevertheless the impetus of the Settlement. It is not clear that Mahoney and Deerpoint would resolve the Lawsuit as well as potential claims against Agrigenix that would not be at issue during the Lawsuit. Further, Agrigenix is not named in the Settlement\n   , nor do there appear to be any obligations under the Settlement that would clearly apply to Agrigenix. The Court understands that Mahoney and Agrigenix are separate entities. Given the zealousness with which Deerpoint appears to protect its trade secrets, it seems unlikely that Deerpoint would fail to mention Agrigenix or fail to include any provisions that would expressly prohibit Agrigenix from using or disclosing Deerpoint's trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1103398\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/27/516/#p524\">\n    27 Cal.4th at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20220\">\n    117 Cal.Rptr.2d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20P.3d%2046\">\n    41 P.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the small amount of the settlement, along with the failure to mention a third party company despite counsel for both signatories knowing of the plaintiff's claims against the third party company, indicated a lack of intent to bestow a benefit upon the third party company).

CUTSA is a comprehensive statute that is intended to occupy the field of common law trade secret misappropriation law. To that end, CUTSA will preempt civil, non-contractual\n   claims that if there is no material distinction between the wrongdoing alleged under CUTSA and wrongdoing alleged under the civil claim. The fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action all arise from the nucleus of operative facts as Deerpoint's CUTSA claim.

The fifth and seventh causes of action (breaches of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing) are contract based, and CUTSA expressly does not preempt contractual claims. The eighth cause of action (IIPEA) is based on Defendants' disparagement of Deerpoint to four former Deerpoint clients. Since disparagement is conduct that is different from the acts supporting the CUTSA claim, the eighth cause of action is not preempted. Further, the ninth claim (UCL) is properly pled and has a nucleus of fact that is separate from the CUTSA claims. Therefore, it also represents \"wrongful conduct\" that supports the IIPEA claim. Finally, the ninth cause of action (UCL) includes allegations that track the IIPEA claim, namely that Defendants disparaged Deerpoint. Because the UCL is grounded on disparagement, it has a nucleus of operative fact that is separate from the CUTSA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   CUTSA enjoys a comprehensive structure and breadth.\n   <em>\n    Angelica Textile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3800902\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/220/495/#p508\">\n    220 Cal.App.4th at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20192\">\n    163 Cal.Rptr.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    K.C.

Therefore, the allegations in the Complaint show that the remaining basis of the IIPEA claim is trade secret misappropriation in violation of CUTSA. It goes without saying that wholesale reliance on a violation of CUTSA necessarily means that the IIPEA and CUTSA misappropriation claims share a common nucleus of operative facts. Therefore, CUTSA preempts Deerpoint's IIPEA claim to the extent it is based on the misappropriation of trade secrets.

First, with respect to the fifth cause of action, the Complaint alleges that Mahoney unfairly interfered with its expectation that its employees would uphold the confidentiality and secrecy of its trade secrets. This expectation flows from Deerpoint's corporate culture. Mahoney breached the covenant/expectation by disclosing protected materials to Agrigenix and by failing to take steps as an Agrigenix executive from publishing portions of Deerpoint's trade secrets. Second, with respect to the seventh cause of action, the Complaint alleges that Mahoney unfairly interfered with its expectation that he would uphold the confidentiality and secrecy of its trade secrets. Mahoney breached that expectation by disclosing trade secrets to Agrigenix and by failing to take steps as an Agrigenix executive to prevent Agrigenix from publishing portions of Deerpoint's trade secrets. Deerpoint argues that, although both the fifth and the seventh causes of actions have facts that overlap with the fourth and sixth causes of action (for breach of contract), two claims can be distinguished, one for breach of contract and one for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \"The covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied by law in every contract, exists merely to prevent one contracting party from unfairly frustrating the other party's right to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.\"\n   <em>\n    Guz v.

The Complaint alleges that, through the EIS, Mahoney \"understood that [his] employment at Deerpoint may give him access to Deerpoint's confidential information, and that [he] was not to disclose, use, or publish any confidential information belonging to Deerpoint, either during or after employment with the Company.\" Complaint \u00b6 115.

Both claims are premised on failing to return property and not using, misappropriating, or divulging Deerpoint's confidential trade secrets. The \"expectation\" that trade secret information would stay secret is clearly encompassed within the third and fourth paragraphs of the EIS. That expectation is nothing more than the assumption that Mahoney (and all other employees) would follow the contract and not commit a breach of an express contractual term. Because the fifth cause of action does not contain any conduct that is different or separate from the breaches alleged in the fourth cause of action, the fifth cause of action is redundant and will be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trombley Enters., LLC v.

Conduct is \"unfair\" either when it \"threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition,\" or when it \" 'offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517150\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/857/#p866\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    UCL claims that are based on \"fraudulent\" conduct must meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard, meaning that the \"who, what, when, where, and how\" of the fraudulent conduct, as well as what conduct/statement is misleading and why it is false, must be expressly alleged.\n    <em>\n     Davidson v.

Although the allegations under the UCL indicate that Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct, the allegations do not meet Rule 9(b)'s pleading standards. Indeed, the allegations under the UCL do not attempt to identify any \"fraudulent\" conduct. Although other paragraphs in the Complaint may indicate \"fraudulent\" conduct, the shotgun incorporation by reference of literally every prior allegation that preceded the UCL claim is improper and does not meet Rule 8 standards, let alone Rule 9 standards.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/#p1321\">\n     792 F.3d at 1321-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    Again, other allegations in the Complaint may indicate \"unfair\" conduct.
