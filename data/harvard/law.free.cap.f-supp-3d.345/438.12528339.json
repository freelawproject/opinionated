The Second Circuit has held that Title III requires operators of public accommodations to grant disabled people more than just equal physical access; operators must also ensure disabled people have full and equal access to the services provided.

It held instead that Title III also prohibited the company-which operated a brick-and-mortar insurance office-from discriminating against disabled people\n   by refusing to sell them insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33.\n   <em>\n    Pallozzi\n   </em>\n   suggests that Title III also regulates the website of a defendant who operates a place of public accommodation, insofar as the website is a service provided by the defendant. Indeed, multiple district courts in the Second Circuit have so held.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Del-Orden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206547902\">\n    2017 WL 6547902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (collecting cases). Because the parties do not dispute that Title III prohibits Jensen-Lewis from having a website that discriminates against disabled people, the Court assumes without deciding that Title III applies to the private commercial websites of retail outlets with brick-and-mortar stores, like Jensen-Lewis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Wu alleges that Jensen-Lewis discriminated against her in violation of the ADA by having features on its website that posed accessibility barriers to the blind, thereby denying her equal access. Though Jensen-Lewis changed its website after Wu filed her complaint, Wu argues that the accessibility barriers she alleged still apply. In her complaint, Wu cites four such barriers. First, Wu alleges that graphical images on Jensen-Lewis's website lack alternative text (\"alt-text\") or a text equivalent. Compl. \u00b6 26a. Alt-text enables screen-reading software to vocalize a description of an image to users. Second, Wu alleges that Jensen-Lewis's website has empty links that contain no text. Compl. \u00b6 26b. These empty links' functionality is confusing to screen-reader users. Third, Wu alleges that the website contains redundant, adjacent links. Compl. \u00b6 26c. Redundant, adjacent links go to the same URL address, resulting in additional, unnecessary navigation efforts for screen-reader users. Fourth, Wu alleges that linked images on the website lack alt-text. Compl. \u00b6 26d. Without alt-text, a user would not know what function a linked image has when he or she clicks on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court finds that these allegations, taken as true, plausibly show that Jensen-Lewis discriminated against Wu by denying her a full and equal opportunity to use its website. They are specific facts concerning Jensen-Lewis's website. Consequently, Wu has made a plausible claim under Title III of the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Jensen-Lewis does not argue that Wu failed to adequately plead any of\n   the state law claims. Instead, Jensen-Lewis argues that, because Wu's ADA claim is moot, there remains no federal question for the Court to adjudicate and the Court thus has no supplemental jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   over the state law claims. Because the Court finds that Wu's ADA claim is not moot, however, supplemental jurisdiction, and Wu's state law claims, remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Court is permitted to do so because the website is incorporated by reference in Wu's complaint and is thus cognizable on a motion to dismiss,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Atl.

The Court found that images and image links consistently contained alt-text and did not identify any redundant links. The Court could neither verify nor contradict Wu's allegations that Jensen-Lewis's website contained empty links. Because the results of the Court's review are not \"clearly inconsistent\" with Wu's allegations, the Court instead bases its conclusion, as stated above, on the fact that Wu plausibly pled a Title III violation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
