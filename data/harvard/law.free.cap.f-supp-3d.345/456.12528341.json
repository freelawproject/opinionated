(\"MedImmune\"), the manufacturer of a drug called Synagis, which is prescribed to prevent lung infections in premature infants. Vierczhalek alleges that MedImmune violated federal and state law in its effort to increase sales of the drug. Now before the Court is MedImmune's motion to dismiss Vierczhalek's amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\"). (Doc. No. 126.) For the reasons discussed below, that motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Vierczhalek is a licensed pediatrician and attending physician at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. (Amended Compl. \u00b6 44.) She is also the Medical Director of the Bellevue Newborn Nursery and the Bellevue Breastfeeding Program and co-director of Bellevue's premature infant follow-up clinic (the \"PINK Clinic\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) The PINK Clinic provides care\n   to medically fragile infants, including those born extremely prematurely, after they are discharged from Bellevue's neonatal intensive care unit (\"NICU\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MedImmune, an American drug manufacturer and wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, manufactures Synagis (palivizumab ), which is used to reduce the severity of lung infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (\"RSV\") in at-risk children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 120.) Synagis - which costs approximately $5,000 per treatment - received FDA approval in 1998; by 2006, Synagis represented over 87% of MedImmune's total sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trinity Homecare LLC (\"Trinity\") operates a home health care service throughout New York, New Jersey, and Florida. (Amended Compl. \u00b6 52.) Part of Trinity's services include dispensing home delivered drugs, such as Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) OptionCare, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreen Company, Inc., operates treatment sites, respiratory therapy locations, and \"home infusion\" locations, all of which are authorized to dispense Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 17, 2009, Vierczhalek filed a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   complaint (the \"Original Complaint\") seeking to recover damages and civil penalties on behalf of the United States and 19 states (the \"States\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for violating the federal False Claims Act (\"FCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the States' FCA equivalents. (Original Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-23.) Specifically, Vierczhalek brought claims against MedImmune, Trinity, and OptionCare, alleging that each violated the FCA by promoting the \"off-label\" use of Synagis - i.e., \"the use of [the] drug for any purpose, or in any manner, other than what is approved by FDA as described in the drug's labeling.\" (Amended Compl. \u00b6 89.) Vierczhalek claimed that these off-label promotions \"illegally influenced physicians to prescribe ...Synagis when they otherwise would not have prescribed Synagis.\" (Original Compl. \u00b6 4.) Thus, according to Vierczhalek, the \"claims ... submitted [by Trinity and OptionCare] were false because Synagis was not medically indicated and necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) Vierczhalek also alleged that Trinity \"falsified\" prescriptions for Synagis - in some cases, using Vierczhalek's name and medical license number without her authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Like many whistleblower statutes, the federal False Claims Act permits the United States to intervene in\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions such as this one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Accordingly, Vierczhalek's case was stayed for a number of years as the United States and the States weighed whether or not to intervene. On July 30, 2013, the United States notified the Court that it was declining to intervene in the action. (Doc. No. 39 at 2.) The State of New York (\"New York\"), however, continued to investigate the claims made in Vierczhalek's complaint until June 19, 2015, when it filed a notice of election to intervene as to Trinity and OptionCare.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20State%20Fin.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20190\">\n    N.Y. State Fin. Law \u00a7 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b). Concurrently with that notice, New York filed a proposed stipulation and order of dismissal, whereby Trinity and OptionCare settled for $22.4 million dollars. (Doc. No. 34 at 8.) All claims against Trinity and OptionCare were thereafter dismissed, and Vierczhalek received $4,040,808.84 as part of the settlement as the original whistleblower. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Fin.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20190\">\n    N.Y. Fin. Law \u00a7 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6)(a).) New York, nevertheless, continued its investigation of MedImmune.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nearly two years later, on March 31, 2017, New York filed a complaint-in-intervention against MedImmune, seeking to recover treble damages and civil penalties under the New York State False Claims Act (\"NYFCA\") and other New York state law. (Doc. No. 49 (\"Complaint-in-Intervention\").) New York's theory of liability differs from the theory of liability set forth Vierczhalek's Original Complaint. Instead of focusing on the off-label promotion of Synagis, New York alleges that MedImmune engaged in a kickback scheme with Trinity. (Complaint-in-Intervention \u00b6 3.) According to the Complaint-in-Intervention, MedImmune gained access to protected health information (\"PHI\") of infants in hospitals who would be candidates for Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) MedImmune then allegedly passed this information along to Trinity, which used this information as patient leads for Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 8, 2017, Vierczhalek filed the Amended Complaint on behalf of the United States and the States (other than New York). (Doc. No. 102.) Eschewing her former off-label claims, Vierczhalek now argues that by engaging in a kickback scheme with Trinity, MedImmune violated the federal False Claims Act and the States' analogs. (Amended Compl. at 101-31.) Specifically, Vierczhalek - closely tracking the Complaint-in-Intervention - now alleges that MedImmune engaged in a specialized effort to increase the sales of Synagis by coordinating with hospitals, pediatricians, and specialty pharmacies (such as Trinity and OptionCare). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) In order to curry favor with doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff, MedImmune provided \"services\" to various hospitals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) These services included \"(i) helping the staff track discharged babies that were likely candidates for Synagis ; (ii) reviewing and completing required paper work ... needed to prescribe Synagis ; (iii) providing lunches to physicians and their staff ... (iv) providing binders and forms ... and (v) paying neonatologists ... for speaking about RSV and Synagis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Vierczhalek, these services were provided with one particular goal in mind: securing PHI of babies in the NICU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7.) By cultivating relationships with NICU nurses, discharges nurses, neonatologists, and other hospital staff, MedImmune gained access to NICU logbooks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.) With information derived from the logbooks, MedImmune could identify infants who would be good candidates for Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Mostly, these were infants who were born both prematurely and in the summer months (RSV season starts in October). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) Thus, once PHI from the logbooks and patient logs was procured, MedImmune could pass the PHI to outfits like Trinity and OptionCare, which used them like referrals or sales leads. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128-29.) The PHI therefore provided specialty pharmacies with the opportunity to contact the infants' caregivers and pediatricians, all in the hope that a doctor would prescribe Synagis to the infant patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The objective, of course, was to \"boost\" the sales of Synagis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, MedImmune focused its efforts not just on premature babies, but on premature babies born to low-income families. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5-10.) To this end, MedImmune zeroed in on hospitals that served Medicaid populations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the PHI-driven patient leads were designed to facilitate prescriptions of Synagis, these Synagis treatments were ultimately \"paid for through Medicaid claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Put differently, the crux of Vierczhalek's claim is that \"MedImmune improperly obtained leads and referrals that resulted in Trinity submitting claims for Synagis paid by Medicaid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Vierczhalek alleges that this conduct spanned many states and several years, from St.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, California (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16) to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and from at least 2004 through 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15, 16, 21, 211.) Ultimately, the collaborative efforts were wildly successful: Trinity received over $108 million in Medicaid reimbursements for Synagis from 2006 through 2011. By comparison, 58 other pharmacy providers received a combined $112.9 million in reimbursements over that same five-year period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 59.) MedImmune, meanwhile, earned $7.3 million in profit from the scheme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 22, 2018, MedImmune moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), and 9(b). (Doc. No. 126.) Specifically, MedImmune argues that the Amended Complaint is precluded by the federal False Claims Act's public disclosure bar.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A). MedImmune also asserts that the Amended Complaint fails to adequately plead a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or the federal False Claims Act. After the motion was fully briefed in May 2018, the parties submitted supplemental authority on a number of topics through September 24, 2018. (Doc. Nos. 194, 195). The Court will now address the parties arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.

Original Source\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With that established, Vierczhalek's claims must be dismissed unless Vierczhalek can demonstrate that she was an \"original source\" of the allegations in the Complaint-in-Intervention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A). Under the statute, an \"original source\" is one who \"has voluntarily disclosed to the [g]overnment the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based\" or \"has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations[,] ... and who has voluntarily provided the information to the [g]overnment before filing an action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Vierczhalek states in the Amended Complaint that she \"provided to the Attorney General of the United States and to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and appropriate State regulators, prior to the filing of this Complaint, a statement of all material evidence and information related to the Complaint.\" (Amended Compl. \u00b6 42.) In fact, she asserts that she \"is the original source of the discovery of the wrongdoing alleged herein,\" and points to her Original Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    \u00b6 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Doc. No. 179 at 10.) But the Original Complaint belies this assertion. Instead, the Original Complaint centered on \"off-label\" prescriptions of Synagis. Thus, although Vierczhalek did allege that MedImmune violated the FCA, she focused on the fact that \"Defendants ... illegally influenced physicians to prescribe ...Synagis when they otherwise would not have prescribed Synagis.\" (Original Compl. \u00b6 4.) The only allegation remotely resembling the Amended Complaint appears at paragraph 64, which states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Trinity obtained access to hospital log books or surreptitiously obtained patient records located in the NICU at Bellevue in violation of [HIPAA].... With access to NICU's patient records, Trinity was then able to contact the parents of NICU patients subsequent to their child's discharge from the hospital in an effort to secure them as clients and to deliver home care services, including the administration of Synagis, to those patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Outside\n   of this one section - which discusses\n   <em>\n    Trinity's\n   </em>\n   conduct, not MedImmune's - the Original Complaint mainly alleged that MedImmune \"promoted the 'off-label' use of a prescription drug they knew was not medically necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Thus, as the State of New York observed in its opposition to a separate motion to dismiss the Complaint-in-Intervention, \"[w]hen the case was filed in 2009, Relator's initial complaint was\n   <em>\n    devoid\n   </em>\n   of any allegations of violations of the [anti-kickback statutes] against any defendant.\" (Doc. No. 181 at 23 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 62 at 3 (\"MedImmune's kickback conduct was only uncovered by [New York's] office during its expansion of the investigation.\"),)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Significantly, even Vierczhalek's counsel conceded that the \"allegation about the PHI does not distinguish\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   Trinity was getting that information because at the time the relator wasn't aware. She was working in one hospital. She had a limited perspective.\" (Tr. of Dec. 8, 2017 Pre-Motion Conference, Doc. No. 116 at 22:4-7 (emphasis added).) And in later filings in this Court, Vierczhalek again acknowledged that the Original Complaint focused on \"when babies did not meet [the] conditions for which Synagis is indicated\" and cited cases involving off-label marketing. (Doc. No. 74 at 2.) Vierczhalek's own briefing concedes that she \"did not then know specifically that Trinity was conspiring with MedImmune for Bellevue NICU access.\" (Doc. No. 179 at 10 n.11.) Thus, while Vierczhalek may have been cognizant of some level of PHI misappropriation, she certainly never identified MedImmune's role in the scheme, or connected the misappropriation to the FCA or the anti-kickback statutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3435970\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/437/13/#p17\">\n    437 F.

State Claims (Counts 2 - 20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As noted above, Vierczhalek also brings a number of claims under various state law false claims provisions. (Doc. No. 102 at 108-19.) As an initial matter, it bears noting that most of these state provisions also have analogous public disclosure bars.\n   <strong>\n    But\n   </strong>\n   a district court ordinarily may \"decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim [if] ... the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).

Given the dismissal of Vierczhalek's federal claim at this early stage of litigation, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her remaining state law claims and therefore dismisses them without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   There is no doubt that Dr. Vierczhalek invested a substantial amount of time and effort seeking to uncover alleged fraud perpetrated by MedImmune and Trinity. And for those efforts, she received over S4 million as part of New York's settlement with Trinity. But the public disclosure bar prevents her from potentially receiving a second payday simply by amending her complaint to mirror New York's very different theory of fraud. Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, Defendant's motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint is GRANTED. The Clerk is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at docket number 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The facts set forth in this opinion and order are taken from Vierczhalek's original complaint (Doc. No. 70) (\"Original Complaint\") and Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 102), New York's Complaint-in-Intervention (Doc. No. 49), and documents incorporated therein by reference.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p98\">\n     493 F.3d 87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 98 (2d Cir. 2007). The Court has also considered MedImmune's memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 126), Vierczhalek's memorandum of law in opposition to MedImmune's motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 179), and MedImmune's reply memorandum of law in support of its motion (Doc. No. 189).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The states were California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indian, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island. Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin, and the Commonwealths of Virginia and Massachusetts. (Original Compl.).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Vierczhalek also obliquely alleges that MedImmune encouraged doctors to prescribe the drug off-season, in greater quantities, and for a broader range of medical conditions, than specified in the FDA-approved label. (Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 325-38.) To the extent this is a standalone claim - which is generous, because Vierczhalek doesn't even cite this conduct in setting forth the contours of her FCA claim (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 341-6) - Vierczhalek offers no specifics as to how MedImmune engaged in this supposed off-label promotion. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 326.) Rule 9(b) requires plaintiffs to \"identify the speaker [and to] state where and when\" the supposedly fraudulent statements were made.\n    <em>\n     United States ex ret. Chorches for Bankr. Estate of Fabula v. Am. Med. Response, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269781,12275486\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/71/\">\n     865 F.3d 71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 81 (2d Cir. 2017). Therefore, this claim, to the extent it is a separate one, would also be dismissed because Vierczhalek fails to plead it with the requisite particularity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
