(\"Ide\"), and Anne Ide (\"Anne Ide\") (collectively \"Defendants\"), asserting causes of action under the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , (\"FLSA\") and the New York State Labor Law \u00a7 190\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"NYLL\"). (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff seeks, on behalf of himself and all similarly situated individuals, unpaid overtime compensation from Defendants under Section 207(a)(1) of the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Plaintiff individually seeks unpaid overtime under New York law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Currently before the Court are two motions. Plaintiff seeks summary judgment in his favor and final certification of the matter as a collective action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (Dkt. 57). Defendants seek reconsideration of a prior order of the Court denying their motion for summary judgment and decertification of the collective action. (Dkt. 56). For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion for reconsideration and decertification is granted, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and final certification is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The background of this case is set forth in detail in the Court's November 7, 2016 Decision and Order (Dkt. 25) (the \"November 2016 Decision\"), familiarity with which is assumed for purposes of this Decision and Order. The Court has summarized the key details below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was employed by Ide from 2002 until August 19, 2015. (Dkt. 15-5 at \u00b6 16; Dkt. 18-1 at \u00b6 16). Plaintiff's job title was \"partsman.\" (Dkt. 15-5 at \u00b6 17; Dkt. 18-1 at \u00b6 17). Plaintiff was paid the same hourly rate for each hour that he worked, including for hours in excess of forty. (Dkt. 15-5 at \u00b6 19; Dkt. 18-1 at \u00b6 19). Plaintiff's primary responsibility was requisitioning, stocking, and dispensing automotive parts in Ide's service center. (Dkt. 15-5 at \u00b6 22; Dkt. 18-1 at \u00b6 22). As a partsman at Ide, \"approximately 70% of [Plaintiff's] job duties [was] ordering, stocking, organizing and dispensing parts for mechanics to use in the course of servicing vehicles at Ide.\" (Dkt. 15-5 at \u00b6 26; Dkt. 18-1 at \u00b6 26). Plaintiff claims that he also \"unloaded trucks ..., ran errands to other company locations, packed up and shipped return items to Honda, and sometimes even performed minor janitorial duties if asked.\" (Dkt. 18-2 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff commenced the instant action on December 14, 2015. (Dkt. 1). Defendants filed their Answer on February 1, 2016. (Dkt. 6). On May 16, 2016, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 15). Plaintiff thereafter filed a cross-motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 18) and a motion to strike (Dkt. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 7, 2016, United States District Judge Michael A. Telesca decided Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment, and Plaintiff's motion to strike. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25). Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied in part and granted in part, and Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment and motion to strike were denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). In denying Defendants' motion for summary judgment in part, the Court adopted the analysis in\n   <em>\n    McBeth v. Gabrielli Truck Sales, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803639\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/768/383/\">\n    768 F.Supp.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. 2010), and determined as a matter of law that Plaintiff did not fall within the \"partsman\" statutory exemption (the \"Exemption\") for overtime compensation under the FLSA and the NYLL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court granted summary judgment to Defendants with respect to Plaintiff's NYLL spread-of-hours claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 8, 2016, this case was transferred to the undersigned. (Dkt. 26). Thereafter, on December 7, 2016, Defendants filed a motion for certification of the November 2016 Decision for interlocutory\n   appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (Dkt. 27). Plaintiff then filed, on December 21, 2016, a motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 29). On August 1, 2017, the Court entered a Decision and Order (Dkt. 47) (the \"August 2017 Decision\") denying both of these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 4, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion to preliminarily certify this matter as a collective action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and for expedited notice to all similarly situated current and former employees of Defendants. (Dkt. 35). On June 15, 2017, United States Magistrate Judge Marian W. Payson entered an order granting conditional certification and approving notice to \"all former and current employees who worked at Ide Honda in its Parts Department since December 14, 2012.\" (Dkt. 44 at 1-2). Plaintiff subsequently sought to expand the definition of the employees included in the conditionally certified collective action (Dkt. 49); Judge Payson denied this request without prejudice on December 11, 2017 (Dkt. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants' pending motion for reconsideration and to decertify the collective action and Plaintiffs' pending motion for summary judgment and final certification were both filed on May 23, 2018. (Dkt. 56; Dkt. 57). Opposition papers were filed on June 21, 2018 (Dkt. 59; Dkt. 60), and replies were filed on July 5, 2018 (Dkt. 62; Dkt. 63). Oral argument was held before the undersigned on December 5, 2018. (Dkt. 67). On December 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed a request for additional briefing (Dkt. 69), which Defendants opposed (Dkt. 68). The Court denied the request for additional briefing on December 13, 2018. (Dkt. 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court first considers Defendants' request for reconsideration of the November 2016 Decision. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), this Court has inherent power to reconsider its own decisions prior to the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (\"[A]ny order or other decision ... that adjudicates fewer than all the claims ... does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.\"). However, the Second Circuit has \"limited district courts' reconsideration of earlier decisions under Rule 54(b) by treating those decisions as law of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of the Color Tile, Inc. v.

Under the law of the case doctrine, \"when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197411\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/605/#p618\">\n    460 U.S. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197411\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/605/#p618\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197411\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/605/#p618\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). The doctrine of law of the case is discretionary and \"merely expresses the practice of the courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Devilla v.

In particular, the Court remains free to revisit its earlier determinations in cases of \"an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Reconsideration of the November 2016 Decision is Warranted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants seek reconsideration of that portion of the November 2016 Decision denying their motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claims for unpaid\n   overtime compensation, arguing that the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) represents an intervening change in controlling law that undermines the Court's earlier determination. For the reasons set forth below, the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's overtime claims, the November 2016 Decision considered the dispositive issue of whether Plaintiff's employment with Defendants fell within the scope of the Exemption.\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   directly conflicts with the analysis set forth in the November 2016 Decision (and reiterated in the August 2017 Decision) as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered whether the Exemption \"applies to service advisors-employees at car dealerships who consult with customers about their servicing needs and sell them servicing solutions,\" and concluded that it did.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   Court made two findings that are relevant to the instant matter, and contrary to the November 2016 Decision. First, the Court rejected the long-standing rule that exemptions to the FLSA are to be construed narrowly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n    at 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting \"the principle that exemptions to the FLSA should be construed narrowly ... as a useful guidepost for interpreting the FLSA\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flood v. Just Energy Mktg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518649\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/219/#p228\">\n    904 F.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (2d Cir. 2018) (\"Until recently, it was a rule of statutory interpretation that a court should narrowly construe an exemption to the FLSA in order to effectuate the statute's remedial purpose. But that is not the rule anymore. The Supreme Court has now reject[ed] this principle as a useful guidepost for interpreting the FLSA.\") (quotations and citations omitted and alteration in original). Second, the Court interpreted the word \"servicing\" as used in the Exemption and concluded that it was not limited to individuals who spend their time \"physically repairing automobiles,\" but also encompassed those \"who do not physically repair automobiles themselves but who are integrally involved in the servicing process.\"\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1140-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court particularly identified \"partsmen\" who \"obtain the vehicle parts ... and provide those parts to the mechanics\" as an example of individuals who are integrally involved in the servicing process without personally performing vehicle repairs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   is in direct conflict with the November 2016 Decision, which found as a matter of law that the term \"servicing,\" as used in the Exemption, did not include \"being involved in or integral to the service process,\" and that Plaintiff did not fall within the purview of the Exemption because he \"did not actually work on vehicles.\" (Dkt. 25 at 10-11 (quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 47 at 9 (describing the November 2016 Decision as having found that \"a partsman must have actually worked on vehicles in order to fall within the purview of the Exemption\") (quotation omitted) ). Moreover, because\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   is a decision of the Supreme Court, this Court is bound by it.\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   therefore represents an intervening change in the controlling law and warrants reconsideration of the November 2016 Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants are Entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Unpaid Overtime Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   necessitates revisiting the Court's prior finding that Plaintiff's work for Defendants was not subject to the Exemption. On reconsideration, the Court finds that, applying the definition of \"servicing\" established in\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , Defendants have demonstrated that Plaintiff's work was within the scope of the Exemption and he was therefore not entitled to the payment of overtime compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the Court explained in the November 2016 Decision, the Exemption \"has three requirements\": (1) an individual must fall within the regulatory definition of partsman; (2) an individual must have been primarily engaged in selling or servicing vehicles; and (3) the individual must have been employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling vehicles. (Dkt 25 at 5-14). Turning to the first of these requirements, the Court previously found that the parties \"agree that Plaintiff was a 'partsman' as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20779.372\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). The Court finds no reason to revisit that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The next requirement-that Plaintiff must have been primarily engaged in selling or servicing vehicles-is where the Court previously found in favor of Plaintiff. In particular, and as previously discussed, the Court found that Plaintiff was not primarily engaged in servicing vehicles because, while his work was \"integral to the service process,\" he \"did not actually work on vehicles.\" (Dkt. 25 at 10-11) (quotations omitted).\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   now compels a contrary conclusion. As set forth above,\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   makes clear that work that is \"integral to the service process\" falls within the definition of \"servicing\" as that term is used in the Exemption. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   specifically identifies a partsman who \"obtain[s] the vehicle parts ... and provide[s] those parts to the mechanics\" as an individual who is \"integrally involved in the servicing process.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610439\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1134/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1140-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In connection with Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff admitted that, as a partsman at Ide, approximately 70% of his job duties consisted of \"ordering, stocking, organizing and dispensing parts for mechanics to use in the course of servicing vehicles at Ide.\" (Dkt. 15-5 at \u00b6 26; Dkt. 18-1 at \u00b6 26). On these facts, and applying the definition of \"servicing\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , a reasonable jury would be compelled to conclude that, while employed by Defendants, Plaintiff was primarily engaged in servicing vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, with respect to the requirement that Plaintiff be employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling vehicles, the applicable regulations provide that, \"[a]s applied to the establishment, primarily engaged means that over half of the establishment[']s annual dollar volume of sales made or business done must come from sales of the enumerated vehicles.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20779.372\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Defendants have demonstrated that Ide meets this definition. In connection with their motion for summary judgment, Defendants submitted a declaration, made under penalty of perjury, from defendant Anne Ide, Ide's Corporate Secretary, stating that between 2010 and 2015 (the years at issue in the instant matter),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"at least 80% of Ide's annual dollar volume of sales made or business done came from sales of vehicles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Dkt. 20-1 at \u00b6 3). Although Plaintiff argued at the time that additional documentary evidence was required to support these representations, Plaintiff's counsel conceded at oral argument that Plaintiff was no longer contesting that Ide satisfied the relevant statutory requirements with respect to the source of its sales. Indeed, a declaration by an individual with personal knowledge is sufficient to support a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williams v. City of New Haven\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:10CV1164 DJS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201246551\">\n    2014 WL 1246551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Conn. Mar. 21, 2014) (declining to strike affidavit submitted in support of motion for summary judgment on the basis that it was \"absent of evidentiary support\" where it was based on the affiant's \"own personal knowledge\") (quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) (an affidavit or declaration may be used to support a motion for summary judgment so long as it is \"made on personal knowledge, set[s] out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show[s] that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated\"). Anne Ide's declaration is sufficient to establish that, for purposes of the Exemption, Ide is a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, under the standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , Defendants have demonstrated as a matter of law that, during his employment at Ide, Plaintiff was a partsman primarily engaged in servicing automobiles while employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles to ultimate purchasers. Accordingly, Plaintiff was exempt from the overtime payment requirements of both the FLSA and the NYLL, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to his claims for unpaid overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court's conclusion that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment in their favor on Plaintiff's claims for unpaid overtime also necessarily means that Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to those claims must be denied. Plaintiff's motion is premised entirely on the Court's prior determination that Plaintiff was not subject to the Exemption because his work did not involve servicing automobiles. Because the Court has, for the reasons discussed at length above, reconsidered and reversed that determination based on\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that he is entitled to summary judgment in his favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendants' Motion for Decertification and Plaintiffs' Motion for Final Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Decertification is Appropriate in this Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In this case, considering the factors identified above, the Court finds that decertification is warranted. Other than Plaintiff, two individuals have opted into this action-Heather Stanwix and Jonathan Pensgen (collectively the \"Opt-In Plaintiffs\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 46; Dkt. 48). Ms. Stanwix and Mr. Pensgen each submitted brief declarations to the Court stating that they were employed in the parts departments of various Ide automotive dealerships and that their duties consisted \"primarily\n   of selling automotive parts directly to members of the public[.]\" (Dkt. 49-4 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (Ms. Stanwix); Dkt. 53-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2 (Mr. Pensgen) ). Apart from these brief declarations, the record contains no information regarding the work performed by the Opt-In Plaintiffs, or regarding the percentages of their time spent on various job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on the record before the Court, it appears that Plaintiff's employment setting and the Opt-In Plaintiffs' employment settings varied in material ways. In particular, the Court notes that Plaintiff and the Opt-In Plaintiffs, at various times, worked for different automotive dealerships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201287512\">\n    2017 WL 1287512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9 (finding decertification appropriate where opt-in plaintiffs worked in different locations with different managers). Moreover, because the applicability of the Exemption hinges on the proportion of time an employee spent servicing automobiles, the Court agrees with Defendants that \"whether each of the [Opt-In Plaintiffs] qualify for the [Exemption] will require an individual, fact-specific analysis.\" (Dkt. 56-2 at 12). Under these circumstances, decertification is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zivali v.
