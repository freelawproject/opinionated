(\"CRX\") with respect to construction defect and other claims against CRX in arbitration. Because the Underlying Arbitration involves claims for which the possibility of coverage exists, due to the operative Revised Occurrence Endorsement, the Court DENIES Gemini's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and GRANTS CRX's Counter-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment with respect to the duty to defend. Because Gemini's Motion also seeks a ruling regarding its duty to indemnify CRX, and under the circumstances, such a determination is premature pending resolution of the Underlying Arbitration, the Court denies the request without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Underlying Arbitration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2012, CRX contracted with The Association of Apartment Owners of The Palm Villas at Mauna Lani Resort (\"AOAO\") to perform remedial construction repairs to condominium buildings and apartment units (\"Construction Contract\" or the \"Project\"). Under the Construction Contract, the AOAO was to pay CRX for its work on a Cost Plus Fee Basis, with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\"GMP\") of $3,827,760. According to CRX, additive and deductive change orders were requested and approved by the AOAO during the course of the Project, which modified the total contract price/GMP to $4,314,700. By August 14, 2013, CRX asserts that it completed all work, including change orders and punchlist items, and by September 14, 2013, it had demobilized from the site. CRX contends that the AOAO paid it only $3,677,625 of the $4,314,700 it is owed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CRX Arbitration Demand, Ex. A, Dkt.

Under the Policies' definitions then, the claims involve at least some \"property damage\" that CRX and/or its subcontractors allegedly caused, but for which they performed no \"work or operations,\" and did not furnish \"material, parts, or equipment.\" Accordingly, because the Policies apply to \"`property damage' [that] is caused by an `occurrence' that takes place in the `coverage territory,\" Policies \u00a7 I.1.b, the possibility of coverage exists based upon the claims in the PBA Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For its part, Gemini asserts that all of the claims made in the PBA Report describe \"corrective work\" and \"punchlist\" items that reflect repairs or outstanding matters relating to CRX and/or its subcontractors' actual \"work.\" While Gemini\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   ultimately be correct about the cause of the damage, the AOAO's claims asserted in the Underlying Arbitration are not so clear and create the potential for coverage.

Indeed, the Court has already determined that the Revised Occurrence Endorsement, when appropriately \"construed in accord with the reasonable expectations of a layperson,\" means that the possibility of coverage exists even for contract-based \"faulty workmanship\" claims so long as the damage is to property other than CRX's work. In the event the coverage provision and the exclusion conflict, or create an ambiguity, the Policies as a whole \"must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and any ambiguities must be resolved against the insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    Tri-S Corp.,\n   </em>\n   110 Hawai`i at 489,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262558\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/473/#p488\">\n    135 P.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dairy Rd.

However, these exclusions do not apply under the circumstances alleged because, at the time of tender, the AOAO's claims in the Underlying Arbitration were not limited to those arising from damage to the \"particular part of\n   <em>\n    real property\n   </em>\n   on which you ... are performing operations,\" or the \"property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because `[CRX's] work' was incorrectly performed on it.\" As detailed above, the AOAO's claims include damage to tangible property beyond the scope of CRX's work, the cause of which is unknown based upon the allegations in the PBA Report, and claims for damage to property beyond merely those that require repair due to CRX incorrectly performing work. To the extent Gemini relies on the \"ongoing operations\" exclusion, that portion of subsection j.5 does not apply to defeat coverage - instead, that exclusion applies only to the \"particular part\" and not the entirety of the property. Nor is it necessarily the case that all claims arose from damage that occurred while CRX was on site performing operations, in light of the PBA Report's assertion that CRX \"demobilized from the site as of August 15, 2013 ... and abandoned the Project prior to completing the corrective work.\" Ex. B at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Likewise, the \"Damage To Impaired Property Or Property Not Physically Injured\" exclusion cannot apply here to damage to impaired property, or property that has not been physically injured, arising out of a defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous condition in CRX's work. Policies \u00a7 I.2.m. Contrary to Gemini's characterization of the AOAO's arbitration claims, the PBA Report asserts claims for damage to more than \"corrective work\" and \"punchlist\" items that were the result of CRX's work. Damaged property claims are not limited in scope to CRX's \"work.\" Therefore, the \"Damage to Property\" exclusions relied upon by Gemini do not categorically eliminate the possibility of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Moreover, as discussed above with respect to the Revised Occurrence Endorsement, the claims here create coverage for property damage other than to CRX and/or its subcontractors' \"work.\" The exclusion for \"Damage To Your Work\" does not apply where the claims transcend those for property damage \"to `your work' arising out of it or any part of it and included in the `products completed operations hazard.'\" The AOAO's claims arise, at least in part, from \"property damage\" other than to the \"work\" of CRX and its subcontractors. Further, the AOAO's claims in the Underlying Arbitration appear to include instances in which \"damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on [CRX's] behalf by a subcontractor,\" which is expressly exempted from the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In short, Gemini has not carried its burden of establishing that any of these exclusions apply to preclude the possibility of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Professional Liability Exclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Policies preclude coverage for \"any error or omission, malpractice or mistake of a professional nature committed or alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of any insured in the conduct of any of the insured's business activities.\" Ex. J. CRX did not perform professional services on the Project - rather its work as a general contractor involved primarily physical or manual labor and skills, and the AOAO brings no claims in the Underlying Arbitration against KHA, the Project architect. Knox Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7. The \"Professional Liability\" exclusion therefore does not apply to claims solely against CRX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Punitive Damages Exclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Although Gemini correctly asserts that the Policies preclude coverage for \"punitive or exemplary damages awarded against the insured,\" and that such damages are not generally provided for under Hawaii law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the exclusion does not defeat the possibility of coverage based upon the asserted claims for relief in the Underlying Arbitration, which seek remedies beyond punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    C. CRX Is Entitled to Summary Judgment on the Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Because the AOAO's claims in the Underlying Arbitration arise from CRX's own faulty workmanship as well as from damage to property that was not within the scope of CRX's \"work,\" the Revised Occurrence Endorsement creates the possibility of coverage. Additionally, the Court is unpersuaded that any identified exclusion so clearly applies that Gemini is relieved of the duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See Finley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258578\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/90/25/\">\n    975 P.2d at 1149-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where a complaint alleges grounds that are both within and without the scope of insurance coverage, the insurer is required to defend the entire action.\") (citation omitted). The possibility for coverage under the Policies remains, and correspondingly, Gemini has a duty to defend CRX in the Underlying Arbitration.
