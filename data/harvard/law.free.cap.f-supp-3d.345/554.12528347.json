Although the FTC's apparent forum shopping may warrant sanctions, the law does not allow Plaintiffs to challenge the Commission's enforcement decisions by way of declaratory judgment when they can do so in defending against the California enforcement action itself.

Advancing the same arguments made in their Motions to Dismiss the FTC's enforcement action, Plaintiffs sought a declaration \"that Section 13(b) of the FTC Act does not authorize the FTC to file an action in federal court against [them]\"-or in the alternative, that it does not \"authorize the FTC to seek disgorgement or restitution\"-involving claims based on the Lidoderm and Opana agreements.

In light of Endo's settlement and the FTC's initiation of an administrative proceeding against Impax, all parties stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the Endo-Impax declaratory judgment suit, and Endo voluntarily dismissed its claims against the FTC in the Endo-Watson declaratory judgment suit.

I consolidated the two suits, and on February 14, 2017, Watson and Allergan filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint. (Am. Compl., Doc.

Although the Commission's California enforcement action is pending, \"requir[ing] Declaratory Judgment Plaintiffs to brief-and a different federal court to decide-new motions to dismiss raising the same threshold issues already briefed to this Court ... would be the height of inefficiency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.)

Yet, \"[n]either the Original Action nor the California Action involve(d) ongoing or imminent future conduct\" and instead \"focus on the Lidoderm Settlement Agreement, which was signed in 2012.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16.)
