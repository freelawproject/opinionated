Dkt. # 20. Since 2008, all three Plaintiffs have been accredited to help families navigate the legal and logistical requirements for international adoption. Plaintiffs have renewed their accreditation multiple times and applied in 2017 to do so again. However, the Council on Accreditation (COA), the entity tasked with processing accreditation applications, deferred its final decision past March 31, 2018, the expiration date of Plaintiffs' most recent accreditation. When COA informed State of this, State instructed COA that it could not continue to process the applications after expiration and that Plaintiffs' renewals would effectively be refused. COA reluctantly complied with this directive, causing Plaintiffs to lose accreditation and face the prospect of re-applying as new applicants, a process that could take over a year to complete. Instead of taking this route, Plaintiffs now seek an injunction suspending the effect of State's directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Faith argues that it is likely to succeed in its claims because State's directive was unlawful on several grounds. First, Faith contends that State's directive COA constituted an arbitrary and capricious shift in policy in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Second, Faith also argues that the directive amounts to a substantive rule that required notice-and-comment procedures, which State did not implement. Finally, Faith asserts that State's directive violated the Intercountry Adoption Act (IAA) because State did not follow the required procedures for cancelling, debarring, or refusing to renew an agency's accreditation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Boiled down, State's response is that it did nothing at all. State contends that it was COA that refused to renew Faith, and that State's directive was not a \"final agency action\" under the APA because it merely served to clarify existing regulations. State also denies that it ever had knowledge of COA's practice of deferring some renewal decisions past the date of expiration, so there was no arbitrary and capricious policy change. Finally, State argues that its directive did not violate the IAA because State's interpretation of the regulations merely tracked the plain text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Faith also contends that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the Court does not grant an injunction because, without accreditation, Faith will continue to lose money and may soon face bankruptcy. Furthermore, Faith argues that the equities tip sharply in its favor and an injunction would be in the public interest. State contests these assertions largely on the basis that Faith declined the opportunity to re-apply as a new applicant and has not demonstrated that its loss of accreditation has had an appreciable effect on adoptees or prospective families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This is a time sensitive matter. At the end of the year, COA will cease to operate as an accrediting entity, rendering it incapable of reaching a final decision on Plaintiffs' renewal applications. Whether an injunction is granted or not, this case will soon become moot either because COA will have finished processing the renewal applications or will lack sufficient time to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Intercountry Adoption Act Regulatory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption standardized adoptions between signatory nations. Congress passed the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 to implement those standards domestically.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2014901\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 14901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 954. The IAA imposes requirements and grants authority\n   to several different parties, including the U.S. Department of State, private \"accrediting entities\" (AEs), and adoption agencies themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   State has some direct obligations under the IAA. For example, State is required to monitor the performance of AEs and may suspend or cancel an AE's designation for noncompliance. \u00a7 14924(a). State is also charged with promulgating regulations prescribing rules that AEs must follow when determining whether an agency should be accredited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14923. State may also suspend, cancel, or debar an adoption agency itself if it is substantially out of compliance with applicable standards. \u00a7 14924(b) &amp; (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, the IAA also grants some authority to AEs. Once State has entered into an agreement with an AE, the AE is charged with processing the accreditation of agencies, overseeing their compliance, and taking adverse action when an agency is out of compliance. \u00a7 14922(a) &amp; (b). An agency may appeal to have an adverse action set aside by the AE or petition a U.S. District Court for such relief. \u00a7 14922(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to its authority under \u00a7 14923, State has promulgated regulations governing the activities of AEs and adoption agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22. C.F.R. \u00a7 96. Section 96.63, which governs renewal of an agency's accreditation, is the main focus of this case. The relevant portions read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (a) The accrediting entity must advise accredited agencies and approved persons that it monitors of the date by which they should seek renewal of their accreditation or approval so that the renewal process can reasonably be completed prior to the expiration of the agency's or person's current accreditation or approval....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (b) ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (c) The accrediting entity must process the request for renewal in a timely fashion. Before deciding whether to renew the accreditation or approval of an agency or person, the accrediting entity may, in its discretion, advise the agency or person of any deficiencies that may hinder or prevent its renewal and defer a decision to allow the agency or person to correct the deficiencies. The accrediting entity must notify the accredited agency, approved person, and the Secretary in writing when it renews or refuses to renew an agency's or person's accreditation or approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (d) Sections 96.24, 96.25, and 96.26, which relate to evaluation procedures and to requests for and use of information, and \u00a7 96.27, which relates to the substantive criteria for evaluating applicants for accreditation or approval, other than \u00a7 96.27(e), will govern determinations about whether to renew accreditation or approval....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Under the Regulations and COA's Policies and Procedures, which the Department approved, and as you acknowledge below, at that point the ASP becomes a new applicant for accreditation.

Faith presents some persuasive evidence that State's interpretation does amount to such a shift. In an April 11, 2016, email, COA provided a detailed explanation of its accreditation renewal process to State's Office of Children's Issues. Schmidt Decl., Dkt. # 47, Ex. A. That email clearly describes COA's practice of granting deferrals extending the review process past an agency's accreditation expiration date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/#p2123\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   State responded to this email a day later with a brief acknowledgement and thank you.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/#p2123\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is also a March 30, 2016, email from State specifically recognizing that one adoption agency would experience a two week lapse in accreditation before COA could make a final decision regarding renewal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/#p2123\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

These communications indicate that State formerly interpreted its regulations to allow AEs to defer decision on renewal past an agency's accreditation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   State's March 30, 2018, correspondence with COA mark a distinct change. In several emails, State definitively asserts that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2096.63\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 96.63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and 96.77(c) prohibit an accrediting entity from processing renewals past the expiration of accreditation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Olson Decl., Dkt. # 51, Ex.

Consequently, the only evidence of State's previous position on this issue comes from COA's 2016 emails. This casts doubt on State's insistence that it had no knowledge of COA's practice of reviewing applications past expiration.

In\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation v. U.S. Dep't of Interior\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit found the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   satisfied where the Park Service issued an \"informal opinion\" via email and letter to the Navajo Nation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253692,12173085\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/1084/\">\n    819 F.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1090 (9th Cir. 2016).

The same reasoning likely applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The second prong of\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   also seems to weigh in Faith's favor. If State's March 30 emails do amount to an interpretive shift, they clearly have legal consequences for Faith. While COA's deferral gave Faith a right to a final decision on the merits of its application, State's directive converting COA's deferral into a refusal robbed Faith of this right and forced them to apply all over again. This, in turn, has prohibited Faith from legally carrying out adoptions for the lengthy duration of the re-application process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   State's argument that its interpretation did not have any legal consequences because it was merely clarifying the existing law puts the cart before the horse. Regardless of whether State believes its interpretation tracks the \"plain text\" of the regulation (Dkt. # 51, at 19), the fact remains that COA did not share this interpretation and State had not asserted it previously. COA Response, Dkt. # 46, at 3-4.

In\n   <em>\n    Fairbanks\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit concluded that the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   was not satisfied because the agency's decision that the plaintiff's land fell within federal jurisdiction did not affect the federal statute's underlying requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824055\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/586/#p593\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824055\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/586/#p593\">\n    at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, State's interpretation of the IAA regulations determines Faith's right to a decision on the merits under those very regulations. Furthermore, even if this was a jurisdictional question, the Court has held that an agency's jurisdictional determination can satisfy the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   because it \"both narrows the field of potential plaintiffs and limits the potential liability a landowner faces.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawkes Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597316\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1807/#p1815\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The second prong of\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   is thus likely satisfied here as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The APA also requires that a challenger has no other adequate remedy in court, and State argues that this requirement is not met because the IAA provides specific procedures for judicial review of adverse actions by AEs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014922\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). However, if State's emails to COA likely constitute a final agency action, it follows that Faith is not actually challenging an adverse action by COA at all. Rather, Faith is challenging the directive by State that transformed COA's deferral\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   an adverse action. Indeed, Faith and COA argue that a deferral cannot lawfully be considered an adverse action because it does not meet any of the definitions in the IAA or its implementing regulations. Motion, Dkt. # 20, at 13; COA Response, Dkt. # 46, at 6.

Consequently, State's citations to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2096.63\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 96.63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and 96.77(c) in its email to COA may be more satisfactory as explanations than they would be in other situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nonetheless, despite State's protestations to the contrary, its prior acknowledgements of COA's practices must have been based on a different interpretation of its regulations than the agency now presents. State's 2018 emails provide almost no textual justification for its new interpretation, much less explain why the agency decided to depart from its former position. Instead, State attempted to treat its interpretation as self-evident and consistent with past procedures, but such a nonchalant dismissal does not satisfy the APA when an agency is actually making a change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Furthermore, because State did not engage in rulemaking, it was also impossible for COA, Faith, or any other private party to guess at the interpretations State may rely on.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Encino\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2126-27 (explaining that the Department relied on the interpretation from one of the comments in its final rule).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This case also involves significant reliance interests, which were a major focus of the Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Encino\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2126. While State's new position may not \"necessitate systemic, significant changes\" to AEs' procedures on the same scale as the changes to dealers' compensation plans in\n   <em>\n    Encino\n   </em>\n   , State issued its interpretation at such a time that COA was already unable to salvage Plaintiffs' applications. Consequently, COA's good-faith reliance on State's former position has already had serious costs for the agencies that rely on COA. Faith has thus shown that it is likely to succeed on its claim that State's directive was arbitrary and capricious, and has at least raised \"serious questions\" that go to the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088053\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1127/#p1131\">\n    632 F.3d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Also similar to\n   <em>\n    Linoz\n   </em>\n   , State's directive changed the general regulatory structure by adding expiration of accreditation as a never-before-applied basis for refusing renewal.

As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the prior practices of both COA and State relied on a different interpretation of the relevant regulations, suggesting that State's new interpretation was not a mere clarification. Indeed, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , State's interpretation is not an obvious description of the regulations' plain text. Faith is thus likely to succeed on its claim that State's directive was a substantive rule requiring notice-and-comment procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    4.

State first relies on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2096.7\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 96.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6), which states that accrediting entities are responsible for \"[d]etermining whether accredited agencies and approved persons are eligible for renewal of their accreditation or approval\n   <em>\n    on a cycle consistent with \u00a7 96.60\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). Section 96.60, in turn, requires that accreditation shall last for a period of four years, and may be extended for \"no more than one year...[i]n order to stagger the renewal requests from agencies...and to prevent the renewal requests from coming due at the same time.\" State also contends that \u00a7 96.63(c)'s statement that \"[t]he accrediting entity must notify the\n   <em>\n    accredited\n   </em>\n   agency...in writing when it renews or refuses to renew an agency's or person's accreditation\" implicitly requires that renewal cannot be granted after accreditation expires. \u00a7 96.63(c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   However, as Faith argues, none of the provisions cited by State speak to whether an AE can continue\n   <em>\n    processing\n   </em>\n   a renewal application after accreditation expires. Section 96.63(c) likely provides the strongest support for State's position, but even this is indirect support at best. The sentence quoted by State mainly concerns notice procedures when an AE grants renewal; it only incidentally mentions that an \"accredited agency\" is among the parties to be notified. The use of \"accredited agency\" in this context was likely not intended to identify an essential requirement for receiving renewal, but rather to describe a relevant party and differentiate them from agencies applying for the first time. Indeed, \u00a7 96.63(c) does not contain language that would indicate an exclusive list of who can receive renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   While \u00a7 96.7(a)(6) states that renewal applications must be handled consistent with \u00a7 96.60(b), that subsection does not say anything about when an AE may or may not continue processing an application. Rather, \u00a7 96.60(b) establishes that an agency's accreditation may only be extended to a total period of five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   COA's\n   procedures do not violate this requirement because, when an application is still being processed after accreditation expires, the agency's accreditation lapses until a final decision is reached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 47, Ex. A, at 3 (2016 email from COA to State explaining, \"COA has confirmed with the Department that the regulations do not provide COA with the authority to extend an ASP's expiration if they have not completed the renewal process...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Section 96.63(c)'s statement that an AE \"must process the request for renewal in a timely fashion\" likewise does not dictate State's interpretation. \"Timely\" is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as \"coming early or at the right time,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"Occurring, done, or made at a fitting, suitable, or favourable time; opportune, well-timed, seasonable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Timely completion of a task thus involves obtaining a positive outcome, but this only implies a strict deadline if one has been established elsewhere. Here, that is not the case. Section 96.63(a) states, \"The accrediting entity must advise accredited agencies ...of the date by which they should seek renewal of their accreditation...so that the renewal process can reasonably be completed prior to the expiration of the agency's or person's current accreditation.\" However, this is intended to ensure that AEs help agencies avoid a period of non-accreditation; it does not mandate a date by which AEs must finish processing. Consequently, the word \"timely\" should be read to require AEs to process applications expeditiously to avoid a period of non-accreditation. It does not limit AEs' discretion to defer decisions when necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 96.63(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Even if the word 96.63(a) and (c) do mandate a deadline for processing applications, this by no means suggests that AEs must abruptly refuse to renew an agency's accreditation. The section on adverse actions makes no reference to accreditation expiration as a possible basis for refusal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2096.63\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 96.63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). In contrast, \u00a7 96.10(a) requires that State \"will suspend or cancel the designation of an [AE] if...it is substantially out of compliance with...the regulations implementing the IAA.\" Section 96.10(b) also lists timely processing as one of the \"performance criteria\" for designation as an AE. Given that \u00a7 96.63 describes timely processing as the AE's duty, both the plain text and common sense dictate that the AE should suffer any consequences for tardiness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In addition to having little textual support, State's interpretation conflicts with several aspects of the IAA's overall scheme. The IAA, its implementing regulations, and the COA handbook give AEs the authority to refuse renewal and limit the grounds upon which they may do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014922\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (stating that AEs have a duty to refuse renewal \"for noncompliance with applicable requirements\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2096.63\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 96.63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (identifying four sub-sections related to evaluation procedures and substantive criteria that will \"govern determinations\" about renewal); COA State Department-Approved Handbook, Dkt. # 51, Ex. A, at IX(C)(2)(a) (tracking\n   \u00a7 96.63(d) by providing four reasons that an AE may refuse to renew an application). No authority identifies accreditation expiration as a reason for refusal, and while it is possible that an agency may be in non-compliance at the date of expiration, this also may not be the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AE's slow processing could just as easily explain the delay past expiration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   but to issue a refusal for this reason would contradict the IAA's indication that a refusal be based on the\n   <em>\n    agency's\n   </em>\n   noncompliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014922\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Hemming AEs in with a strict time limit would thus inevitably lead to AEs being both unable to grant a renewal but also unable to refuse for an acceptable reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   State's interpretation also causes tension with the provisions of the IAA governing review of adverse actions. The IAA provides that an agency subject to an adverse action may attempt to get the decision set aside by the AE or a federal court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014922\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) &amp; (3). However, if the AE is not permitted to continue processing the application but also lacks sufficient information to grant a renewal (as is likely the case if the AE deferred the decision), the refusal effectively cannot be set aside. Again, State's interpretation appears inconsistent with the IAA's assumption that refusals should be issued for substantive reasons determined by the AE, not procedural reasons dictated by State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, in addition to conflicting with the overall scheme of the IAA, State's interpretation is simply illogical. It make no sense to require AEs and agencies to start all over from square one when they are mere weeks away from completing the renewal process. The Court can identify no good reason why the drafters of the IAA or its regulations would have intended such an unnecessary waste of resources. It certainly does not benefit the children whose adoptions have apparently been frustrated by State's directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tutterrow Decl., Dkt. # 24; Garrett Decl., Dkt. # 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   State's interpretation is unpersuasive and the traditional tools of interpretation indicate that processing a renewal past the\n   date the expiration of accreditation does not require the AE to refuse the application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/#p140\">\n    323 U.S. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229682\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/323/134/#p140\">\n    65 S.Ct. 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Christopher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p156\">\n    567 U.S. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p156\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When Faith moved for an injunction, IAAME's website indicated that it had not yet \"be[gun] to accredit and approve agencies and person [sic].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harvard Law School Amicus Brief, Dkt. # 32-1, at 4. State contests this, asserting that IAAME began accepting new applications on March 1, 2018, has accepted a total of 11 applications to date, and plans to finish processing renewals for agencies with accreditation expiring in 2019 early in that year. Olson Decl., Dkt. # 51, at 8, 19. However, even if IAAME is working on this \"shorter schedule\" than COA, Plaintiffs' three additional applications would presumably start at the back of the line and delay IAAME's overall schedule. In addition, given that COA took between nine and eighteen months to process new and renewal applicants, it is hard to believe that a brand-new entity with no experience will be able to greatly improve on the timetable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   State's argument that Faith's delay in filing suit implies a lack of urgency is also unpersuasive. Faith delayed for only 48 days, whereas the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Lydo Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Las Vegas\n   </em>\n   , cited by State, delayed for five years.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"592963\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1211/#p1213\">\n    745 F.2d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1213 (9th Cir. 1984). These situations are hardly comparable. Indeed, State's delay in responding to Faith's motion takes much of the blame for the lengthy period since Faith filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 28. Consequently, Faith is likely to suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Balance of Equities and the Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The final factors in the preliminary injunction analysis require considering\n   the effects of an injunction on both parties and the public.\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the government is a party, these factors merge because the government represents the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Nken v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    556 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Faith argues that the equities tip sharply in its favor because an injunction would disproportionately benefit both Faith and the public, while State's interest in enforcing its directive is negligible. According to Faith, its inability to continue facilitating adoptions will diminish the resources available to prospective parents and increase the waiting line for adoptions. Further, Faith asserts that the refusal to renew its accreditation has already had consequences for families, who have had their cases put on hold for administrative review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tutterrow Decl., Dkt. # 24, at 3; Garrett Decl., Dkt. # 25, at 3-4. Faith hopes renewing its accreditation may help these families complete their adoptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In opposition, State argues that its directive is in the public interest because it protects children and families by minimizing fraud and other misconduct during the adoption process. The IAA regulations are designed to ensure that AEs are \"thorough and meticulous\" when reviewing renewals, and State contends that an injunction would amount to \"relax[ing]\" these regulations by giving additional time to agencies that had failed to demonstrate compliance. Dkt. # 51, at 29-30. This, in turn, would \"encourage [agencies] to take less seriously their compliance obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   State's position is quite unconvincing. As previously discussed, an agency's accreditation expiring before renewal may well be the result of delays by the AE and says little about whether or not the agency is actually compliant. Indeed, all three Plaintiffs in this case had been accredited since 2008 and had never been refused renewal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meske Decl., Dkt. # 21, at 3; Kinley-Albers Decl., Dkt. # 22, at 3; Kinton Decl., Dkt. # 23, at 2-3. Furthermore, allowing AEs the necessary time to process renewals prevents hasty decisions, thus\n   <em>\n    lowering\n   </em>\n   the risk of agency misconduct. State's argument that agencies are scoffing at compliance standards because AEs sometimes defer renewal decisions is both unsupported and unintuitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   State is correct that the exact impact of Faith's loss of accreditation on adoptees and prospective families is unclear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tutterrow Decl., Dkt. # 24, at 3; Garrett Decl., Dkt. # 25, at 3-4. One family previously served by Faith indicate that their case was delayed for uncertain reasons after Faith lost its accreditation (Garrett Decl., Dkt. # 25, at 4) and another family asserts that officials told them their case was delayed partly because Faith's accreditation had lapsed. Tutterrow Decl., Dkt. # 24, at 3. There is no guarantee that renewing Faith's accreditation would resolve these situations. However, it seems likely that letting Plaintiffs resume operations could only improve the situation of adoptee families that may have come under scrutiny. Further, reinstating Faith's accreditation would allow Plaintiffs to avoid bankruptcy, ensuring that the expertise, resources, and connections they have built up over decades would not be wasted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   While it is true that the public has an interest in the government enforcing its laws, that interest is only served if the government acts properly and justly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    556 U.S. at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing wrongful removal of aliens from proper removal orders). Here, it is far from clear that State acted in such a way. Indeed, Faith has shown that State likely acted unlawfully in several respects by issuing its directive. As a result, the balance of equities tips sharply in favor of\n   granting the injunction, as does the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Faith has demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims and has also raised serious questions that go to the merits. Faith has also shown that it stands to suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted, that the balance of equities tips sharply in its favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. Consequently, Faith's motion is GRANTED and the Court enjoins and suspends the effect of State's directive to COA ordering it to stop processing Plaintiffs' renewal applications and treat them as refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    U.S. Dep't of State - Bureau of Consular Affairs,\n    <em>\n     Adoption Notice: FAQ: Newly Designated Accreditting Entity, IAAME\n    </em>\n    , (Aug. 25, 2017), https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/Intercountry-Adoption-News/faq-on-the-accrediting-entity-transition.html (last visited Oct. 26, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p435\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    U.S. Dep't of State - Bureau of Consular Affairs,\n    <em>\n     Adoption Notice: Accreditation Renewal Refusal for Amazing Grace Adoptions, Adopt Abroad International, and Faith International Adoption, Inc.\n    </em>\n    (Apr. 2, 2018), https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/Intercountry-Adoption-News/adoption-notice--accreditation-renewal-refusal-for-amazing-grace.html (last visited Oct. 26, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The Court stated that a procedural challenge to a regulation may be foreclosed in some instances, such as where an agency failed to amend a rule in light of changed circumstances.\n    <em>\n     Encino\n    </em>\n    , 136 S.Ct. at 2125 (citing\n    <em>\n     Auer v.
