Engelmayer, United States District Judge\n   This case involves claims by a public school principal in New York City that she was retaliated against for her constitutionally protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment. Plaintiff Shadia Alvarez, former Interim Acting Principal of the Collegiate Institute for Math and Science (\"CIMS\"), brings this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Carron Staple, a superintendent of the Department of Education of the City of New York (\"DOE\") assigned to CIMS. Alvarez claims that Staple retaliated against her because of complaints Alvarez had made to the New York Police Department (\"NYPD\") and other agencies regarding safety at CIMS, and that this retaliation culminated in DOE's termination of Alvarez's tenure as Interim Acting Principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   With discovery complete, Staple has moved on multiple grounds for summary judgment. For the following reasons, the Court grants that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By way of overview, Alvarez, who had tenure as an assistant principal, was appointed Interim Acting Principal of CIMS on January 1, 2012, serving on a probationary basis. Staple became the DOE superintendent assigned to supervise CIMS in October 2012. Both before and after Staple's appointment, Alvarez complained about school safety, often speaking in tandem with principals from four sister schools. These complaints culminated in a meeting on April 12, 2013 called by Staple to discuss safety problems at these schools. In the following months, Staple was advised of discrepancies in Alvarez's timesheets to DOE, resulting in a formal investigation into alleged theft of services which was undertaken by DOE's Office of Special Investigations (\"OSI\"). In March 2014, with OSI's investigation ongoing, Staple recommended that Alvarez's probationary status, which had been scheduled to end on July 2014, be continued. In June 2014, after OSI issued a report finding material falsehoods on her timesheets, Staple changed her recommendation. Consistent with Staple's now-unfavorable recommendation, DOE thereafter denied Alvarez's certificate of completion of probation. Alvarez reverted to her underlying tenured position as an assistant principal, and later voluntarily resigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this lawsuit, Alvarez alleges: (1) that the complaints she made were protected speech under the First Amendment and (2) that Staple's actions referring Alvarez's timesheets for investigation and later recommending the termination of her probationary status were acts of retaliation for that speech. Staple counters that Alvarez's complaints were not protected speech, but instead were employee speech within the scope of her job responsibilities. Independently, Staple argues that the evidence does not permit a finding that Alvarez's speech caused these adverse actions. She contends that she reported Alvarez to OSI in good faith and not as a result of Alvarez's safety complaints, and that OSI's findings of theft of services were the sole, and a proper, basis for her decision to change her recommendation as to Alvarez's probationary status.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

She argues that the facts not materially in dispute demonstrate: (1) Alvarez's speech was not constitutionally protected because she spoke as a public employee, not as a citizen; (2) Alvarez's speech was not protected because her speech regarded personal matters, not matters of public concern; (3) even if Alvarez's speech were protected, the facts do not permit a jury to find, non-speculatively, a causal connection between her speech and the adverse action she alleges (denial of completion of her probation and consequent loss of her position as an acting interim principal); and (4) in any case, Staple is entitled to qualified immunity. To grant summary judgment, the Court need resolve only the first argument. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Alvarez, her speech-which centered on matters of school safety-fell squarely within her official duties as an acting school principal and therefore was not protected under the First Amendment. Because this holding is fatal to Alvarez's claim, the Court need not reach Staple's alternative arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

Where an employee complains about her ability to \"properly execute [her] duties,\" this speech falls within her official responsibilities.\n    <em>\n     Weintraub\n    </em>\n    , 593 F.3d at 203 (quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Here, Alvarez's job as Assistant Principal was very broad: By her own words, she was \"responsible for having a 360 view of everything that happens in the building or in [her] school.\" Alvarez Dep. at 43. Particularly relevant to the speech at issue here, she also held the title \"security liaison\" for the Columbus Campus.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 34. And, as part of her responsibilities, Alvarez sat on the building safety committee, responsible for submitting periodic reports on the state of school safety. These were not mere on-paper duties: Alvarez attended weekly building principal meetings, Alvarez Dep. at 43, and submitted at least one safety report. Alvarez's job also involved routinely interacting with her school's safety personnel. These personnel had been trained and selected by the NYPD's specialized School Safety Division. Alvarez and these safety personnel regularly interacted regarding serious safety issues affecting students.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Alvarez Dep. at 40-42 (Q: \"Were there ever NYPD officers of any type in the CIMS school? A: In the building, yes. In the Columbus complex building, yes. Q: When would that happen, is that a daily occurrence? A: Daily occurrence,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 41).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In light of these responsibilities, Alvarez's various expressions of concern about school safety reviewed above-whether those expressed in 2012, in her April 2013 letter to the DOE Chancellor, in the April 12, 2013 meeting that she and the other Columbus Campus principals held with Staple, or in March 2014 to the NYPD-all fell squarely within her job duties. And, contrary to Alvarez's claim, the Second Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    does not avail her. Analogizing to\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    , she urges that she \"acted as a private citizen\" when she spoke to the Chancellor and Staple about school safety because there \"is no manual, no document listing, pinpointing that the specific issues complained about were part of the Principal's\n    job responsibilities.\" Pl. Mem. at 12.\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    , however, is far afield. There, Matthews, a line-level NYPD police officer, repeatedly reported an alleged quota system for stop-and-frisks and arrests to higher level officers.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011695\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/167/#p172\">\n     779 F.3d at 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Second Circuit held that Matthews' reports fell outside his official responsibilities because Matthews \"was not reporting suspected violations of law that might have required him to exercise his authority to arrest a fellow police officer [but instead] was voicing concerns about broad policy issues.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011695\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/167/#p172\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011695\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/167/#p172\">\n     at 174-75\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because Matthews' job was as a line officer rather than an NYPD policy-maker, his complaints regarding \"broad policy issues\" were not an integral part of his day-to-day job.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011695\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/167/#p172\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    By contrast, Alvarez's job as an acting principal was by definition broader and policy-centered. It included both policies and practices regarding safety on her campus. The weekly committee on which Alvarez sat was tasked with policy reports. And the complaints she made squarely concerned the safety of those (whether students or staff) within her school and the companion Columbus Campus schools. Indeed, Alvarez so characterizes the grievances she expressed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Mem. at 11 (describing her complaints as having involved \"students being arrested on campus without due process, arsons in the stairwell, death threats to Plaintiff's staff, and internal entities of the school not working together and putting student [sic] in danger etc.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Further evidence that Alvarez's speech fell within her official responsibilities is that, by Alvarez's own account, her complaints arose from regular meetings of the Columbus Campus principals that covered safety concerns.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Alvarez Dep. at 144 (\"Q: So were there any allegations or complaints that you made that these other four principals had no part in making? A: No.\"). This strongly indicates that the complaints by these public employees were \"pursuant to [their] official duties\" as opposed to individual acts of citizen expression, and that the five principals' in-tandem complaints were \"part-and-parcel of [their] concerns about [their] ability to properly execute [their] duties.\"\n    <em>\n     Weintraub\n    </em>\n    , 593 F.3d at 203 (quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Alvarez has not pointed to any material facts-whether or not disputed-that support a different outcome. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Alvarez, it uniformly demonstrates that Alvarez's complaints about safety were made pursuant to her responsibility as a school principal for maintaining security at her school and the broader Columbus Campus.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Civilian Analogue\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    When a public employee speaks through \"a form or channel of discourse available to non-employee citizens,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 204, her speech has a civilian analogue. Like an employee's job responsibilities, whether a civilian analogue exists bears on the role the speaker occupied when speaking: employee or citizen.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 203-4. An employee's speech may be protected when made through a channel available to non-employee citizens even when the speech covered matters within her official responsibilities. The Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Garcetti\n    </em>\n    illustrated this point with two examples: a schoolteacher writing a letter to a newspaper, and co-workers talking about political issues.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p418\">\n     547 U.S. at 422-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p418\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1951\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In each instance, although the content of the employee's communications might pertain to an employee's duties, she could be reasonably held, on account of the channel in which she chose to speak, to have spoken primarily as a concerned citizen. In the same vein, when a public employee speaks \"to an independent state agency responsible for entertaining complaints by\n    any citizen in a democratic society regardless of his status as a public employee,\" that may indicate civilian speech.\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011695\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/167/#p172\">\n     779 F.3d at 175\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Alvarez, she voiced her complaints about safety issues affecting CIMS and the other Columbus Campus schools to NYPD school-safety officials with responsibility for the area covered by the Columbus Campus; to the DOE deputy chancellor; and to her supervisor, Staple. Like Alvarez's job responsibilities, the internal administrative channels through which Alvarez and her fellow DOE principals chose to voice their coordinated complaints about Columbus Campus school safety strongly suggest employee, rather than citizen, speech.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Alvarez counters with two arguments. First, she claims that her speech was made to \"outside agencies.\" Pl. Mem. at 14. Second, she again analogizes to\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    , claiming that she spoke through \"channels available to citizens generally.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15. Neither argument prevails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    As to the first argument, Alvarez's speech within the NYPD and DOE was directed at internal components of these agencies with which she and the other principals interacted as part of her job. Within the NYPD, Alvarez and her fellow Columbus Campus principals complained variously to members of the NYPD Department of Internal Affairs and the NYPD School Safety Division (Sgt. Albino, Lt. Silitides, XO Tally, Commanding Officer Quinn, and Ramon Garcia).\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    Within the DOE, she spoke to the Deputy Chancellor. Alvarez additionally claims that, within the DOE, she complained to the Office of Youth Development, the Office of Space and Planning, and the Office of Facilities. Alvarez, however, does not make any showing that these internal NYPD or DOE components were common outside fora for citizen grievances, i.e., available to citizens generally, or that ordinary citizens commonly banded with school principals to articulate such grievances. Alvarez separately states that she made complaints about campus safety to CSA and New Visions for Public Schools \"New Visions.\" Pl. Mem. at 13.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Alvarez Dep. at 152. However, New Visions, too, was effectively an internal DOE forum, as it had a contractual agreement to provide support to the DOE.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 153. And as for CSA, Alvarez admits that she complained to CSA, her union, only after she had already been removed from her post as an acting principal.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 152-53.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    As to the second argument, the channels utilized by Alvarez to air grievances are far afield from those used by Matthews. In\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    , the Second Circuit rejected the claim that Matthews had\n    greater access to the commanding officers to whom he complained than an ordinary citizen. Those officers, the Circuit noted, regularly attended monthly community meetings at which any citizen could have aired grievances.\n    <em>\n     Matthews\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011695\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/167/#p172\">\n     779 F.3d at 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Matthews met with and complained to his superior officers much like any member of the public.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011695\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/167/#p172\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Alvarez, in contrast, utilized fora that were disproportionately available to her on account of her status as a DOE acting principal. She drafted letters to DOE officials that were co-authored by four other principals from her campus. That was not an avenue available to members of the public. It was, however, available to Alvarez, because each principal in the group of five was responsible for the policies of her or his individual school, and met weekly with all Columbus Campus principals to discuss them. Alvarez adduces no evidence that the opportunity to band with other school principals to air common complaints was available to citizens who were not themselves DOE supervisors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Alvarez's deposition testimony underscored that the grievance platforms that she chose derived from her status as an acting principal. She testified that the five principals copied Staple on most of their complaints, copying other DOE stakeholders, because \"[w]e tried to be as transparent as possible because we wanted to make sure, I'll speak for myself, I wanted to make sure that people understood that I just wanted to run a good school, a healthy school.\" Alvarez Dep. at 135. She thus tethered her choice of grievance method to her employment status within DOE. Her account also underscored the deliberate stratagem of acting collectively with other DOE principals. The principals' meeting with and letter to DOE's Deputy Chancellor was classically an internal grievance method. Alvarez does not identify any civilian analogue to this unusual mode of approach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    To be sure, as in\n    <em>\n     Weintraub\n    </em>\n    , \"the lack of a citizen analogue is not dispositive in this case, [but] it does bear on the perspective of the speaker.\" 593 F.3d at 204. But here, the internal and stylized grievance procedure chosen by Alvarez reinforces the conclusion drawn from analysis of her job responsibilities. Both factors indicate that Alvarez complained about campus security in her capacity as an employee-an acting principal-rather than as a citizen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Alvarez's case therefore resembles the many in which courts have held that teachers and school district personnel who complained about school district policies and procedures did so as employees performing professional duties.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Agyeman v.

In her memorandum of law opposing the instant motion, Alvarez states that Staple was upset \"particularly [by Alvarez] complaining to the New York City Police Department,\" Pl. Mem. at 5, but also states that Staple acted in retaliation for Alvarez's role in the five principals' outreach to Suransky,\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 5-6. In Alvarez's deposition, she stated that Staple was mainly upset about the communication to Suransky. Alvarez Dep. at 135 (\"Q: So which communication, which complaint do you think that Superintendent Staple was upset about? A: The April 1st when we went to Deputy Chancellor Suransky.... Q: You think she was upset about other complaints or mainly that one? A: I think the other one's [sic] did not directly impact her. I think that one directly impacted her. He was her superior.\");\n     <em>\n      see also id.\n     </em>\n     at 154 (\"Q: Do you think [Staple] would have reason to be upset about that May 2014 complaint [to the NYPD]?

A: So no.\").\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-94\">\n     Elsewhere in her deposition, Alvarez testified that other people told her Staple was \"extremely upset\" about police department complaints. However, it is unclear whether Alvarez believes Staple was upset about the complaints themselves or the fact that they led to the April 2013 meeting.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 159. In any case, Alvarez does not point to any non-hearsay evidence of Staple's ostensible discontent.\n     <em>\n      See id.\n     </em>\n     at 159-60 (\"Q: Other than other people's hearsay statements, do you have any other evidence that Superintendent Staple was extremely upset about police department complaints?
