They are challenging the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services' (\"USCIS\") denial of the plaintiff-investors' I-526 petitions for visas under the \"EB-5\" immigrant investor program, which provides visas for individuals who make qualifying investments in American companies. The main issue before the Court is whether USCIS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by denying the plaintiff-investors' visas on the grounds that their investments in Mirror Lake were not \"at risk\" as required by the applicable regulations. The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment. [ECF Nos. 18 and 21].\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   I.

Reply at 5 [ECF No. 23]. USCIS's total analysis of the investment spanned a few brief paragraphs and focused entirely on the put option. However, the agency conducted a satisfactory analysis of the risks the plaintiffs raised. After examining the put option provisions of the Agreement and Offering Memorandum, USCIS considered the plaintiff-investors' argument that their right to exercise the option was contingent on the availability of cash flow. The agency concluded that, despite that condition, the option was a debt arrangement because if Mirror Lake was \"profitable and ha[d] sufficient cash flow, the Put Option was clearly written as an exit strategy for the investor to compel [Mirror Lake] to purchase the member's interest.\" J.A. at 70. Further, the agency considered the plaintiffs-investors' argument that Mirror Lake might not return the investment in light of high failure rates of new businesses, and concluded that it \"neglects to contemplate [Mirror Lake's] potential success and consequent obligation to return the capital to the petitioner on demand.\" J.A. at 91;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Izummi\n   </em>\n   , 22.I. &amp; N.

The agency also found that the plaintiff-investors' contention that the company has the discretion to control the availability of capital-and thus, whether it repays investors-would constitute an illusory promise that the agency does not recognize.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204207299\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Izummi\n   </em>\n   , 22.

In fact,\n   <em>\n    Matter of Izummi\n   </em>\n   determined that apparently similar factors were not relevant to determining whether an agreement qualifies as a debt arrangement. The agency considered a 1997 opinion from its Office of General Council which \"engaged in a lengthy discussion of the factors evidencing debt and equity in the context of tax law,\" and found that \"[a] discussion of the numerous debt and equity factors set forth in the tax cases unnecessarily complicates the attempt to ascertain the true substance of the transaction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Izummi\n   </em>\n   , 22.
