In the Amended Complaint (Docket No. 17), Plaintiff asserts eleven counts against the City: wrongful death claims under Mass. Gen.

It did not expire until April 23, 2015. On November 16, 2014 around 2:10 A.M., McMahon called 911 and stated that Tremblay was \"trying to hit [her] over the head with a stick,\" and that she had an active restraining order against him. Officers Robert C. Boyle and William Hubbard were dispatched to McMahon's apartment to respond to the call. Before\n   responding to the disturbance, the officers did not log into the record management system inside their vehicle, and therefore did not see the details of the 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the officers entered the apartment building, they saw a man in the hallway in front of McMahon's unit. McMahon, who was inside, opened the door to tell the officers repeatedly that she had a restraining order against the man in the hallway. At the time, the officers did not know the man's name. They did not check the record system in their vehicle in order to determine whether McMahon in fact had an active restraining order. The officers also did not request additional information from the 911 dispatcher, nor did they speak to a supervisor to confirm either the identity of the man in the hallway or the existence of a restraining order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Boston Police Department procedure requires officers to \"arrest any person that the officer observes, or has probable cause to believe, has committed a violation of a court order.\" Officers Boyle and Hubbard did not arrest the man, later identified as Tremblay, but instead escorted him out of McMahon's apartment building and transported him to Shattuck Hospital. Tremblay also had an outstanding warrant at the time for failing to register as a sex offender. When they arrived at Shattuck Hospital, Officers Boyle and Hubbard left Tremblay outside the facility. They did not seek to admit Tremblay to Shattuck, nor did they ask any staff at Shattuck to identify the man. At some point later, Tremblay returned to McMahon's apartment and killed her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During an internal affairs investigation, Officers Boyle and Hubbard indicated \"that they did not have the training or knowledge of the City of Boston's police department rules and regulations with respect to the handling of domestic violence cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In\n   <em>\n    Okin\n   </em>\n   , there was an \"escalating series of incidents that followed the officers' response to [the victim's] first complaint of domestic violence,\n   where the officers and [the accused] had discussed sports, and the officers openly expressed camaraderie with [the accused] and contempt for [the victim].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043449\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/415/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043449\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/415/#p429\">\n    at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence suggested that the officers' conduct \"ratchet[ed] up the threat of danger to [the victim]\" by, for example, failing to arrest the accused even when he admitted to officers that he could not \"help it\" if he \"smack[ed]\" the victim around.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043449\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/415/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043449\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/415/#p429\">\n    at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On these facts, the Second Circuit held the Due Process Clause prohibits police officers \"from affirmatively contributing to the vulnerability of a known victim by engaging in conduct, whether explicit or implicit, that encourages intentional violence against the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043449\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/415/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043449\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/415/#p429\">\n    at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While the Supreme Court has held that a State's failure to arrest does not implicate substantive due process rights, the above case law supports a state created danger theory when a police officer increases the risk of harm to a domestic violence victim by some affirmative conduct beyond mere failure to arrest. Plaintiff in this case, however, fails to allege any facts that plausibly demonstrate that Officers Boyle and Hubbard's actions \"emboldened\" Tremblay to murder McMahon. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Irish\n   </em>\n   , the police did not increase the risk of harm by enraging the abuser by telling him about a victim's allegations without protecting her despite a request not to tell him. In this case, the man in the hallway already knew that McMahon was attempting to enforce the restraining order against him because he heard her tell the police officers about the order. Also in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Okin\n   </em>\n   , there are no allegations that Officers Boyle and Hubbard engaged in a that-a-boy attitude with the abuser. It is not alleged that the officers conveyed to Tremblay, either explicitly or implicitly, that they condoned his actions or that he would not be disciplined. Instead, they removed Tremblay from the premises and drove him to a homeless shelter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This case is so troubling because the police officers failed to make even a minimal effort of checking whether McMahon had an active restraining order. If the officers had done so, they would have discovered that there was an active order and that, according to Boston Police Department Policy, they were required to arrest Tremblay. While the enforcement of the order via an arrest might have prevented the murder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has not alleged more than the officers' failure to arrest Tremblay.
