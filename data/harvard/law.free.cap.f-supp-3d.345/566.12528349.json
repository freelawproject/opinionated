(collectively \"Janssen\") (\"J &amp; J\") Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (Doc. No. 67-1), Indirect and Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Joint Opposition thereto (Doc. No. 73), and Defendants' Reply in Support thereof (Doc. No. 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises from an antitrust action brought by Direct and Indirect Purchasers of Defendants' drug Remicade, against Johnson &amp; Johnson, along with its wholly owned subsidiary, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, \"J &amp; J\"), alleging artificially inflated prices and monopolization of the pharmaceutical market for biologic infliximab drugs. The Direct and Indirect Purchasers' principle claim is that J &amp; J undertook an anticompetitive scheme, consisting of exclusive agreements and coercive bundled rebates, to foreclose competition posed by biosimilar versions of Remicade, specifically Pfizer's Inflectra and Merck's Renflexis. The scheme allegedly caused providers and insurers to pay overcharges for infliximab products that they would not have paid absent J &amp; J's anticompetitive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under consideration is J &amp; J's Motion to Dismiss the Indirect Purchasers' Consolidated Amended Complaint and to Dismiss\n   the Amended Direct Purchaser Class Action Complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (Doc. No. 67-1). This Motion is fully briefed and ripe for the Court's adjudication. The Court has considered the parties' submissions and decides this matter without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78 ; Loc. R. Civ. P. 7.1(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Alleged Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case arises from essentially the same facts that have been described in detail in this Court's related decision denying Defendants J &amp; J's motion to dismiss Pfizer's complaint alleging federal antitrust violations.\n   <em>\n    Pfizer Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527317\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/494/\">\n    333 F.Supp.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. 2018) ; Doc. No. 58). For the purposes of considering Defendants' motion, we will summarize facts relevant to Indirect and Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The medications at the center of this litigation are biologic infliximab products, used as treatment for maintaining chronic auto-immune inflammatory conditions. Dir. AC \u00b6 2, \u00b6 41. Infliximab products cannot be taken orally and are only administered intravenously, generally by an in-office health care provider.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. J &amp; J's drug Remicade was the first biologic infliximab to enter the market in 1998. Ind. CAC \u00b6 21. In 2009, Congress enacted the Biologic Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), an analog to the shortcut for FDA approval that the Hatch-Waxman amendments provide for chemically synthesized medications. Dir. AC \u00b6 8-9. To attain approval as a \"biosimilar\" under the BPCIA, a manufacturer must demonstrate that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency.\" Ind. CAC \u00b6 38. Once J &amp; J's patent on Remicade expired in 2016, the FDA approved three other medications including Pfizer's Inflectra and Merck's Renflexis. Dir. AC \u00b6 16-19, Ind. CAC \u00b6 4. Competition from the introduction of biosimilars into the infliximab market was expected to lower prices for potentially lifesaving biologic medications that otherwise might have been unaffordable for some patients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dir. AC \u00b6 14, \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Direct and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs argue that insurance coverage is key to biologic infusion products like infliximab because treatment is so expensive that most patients will not be able to pay out of pocket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. Therefore, infliximab products are either reimbursed by insurance companies, or they are paid for by health care providers who administer the drug through a \"buy and bill\" system where they pay upfront for the drug then bill an insurer or third-party payor for reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. Plaintiffs argue that this system incentivizes providers to choose a biologic that is \"widely covered by insurance\" to avoid the risk that their reimbursement claim could be denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58, \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Biosimilar Readiness Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1. Exclusive agreements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' exclusive contracts with insurers block biosimilar\n   competition in more than one way. Ind. CAC \u00b6 47, 48. Some contracts require insurers to deny coverage for biosimilars altogether. Other contractual preconditions effectively preclude biosimilar competition. For example, the \"fail first\" exception, under which providers cannot choose a biosimilar unless a patient has first failed to respond to treatment with Remicade. Dir. AC \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Bundled rebates\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   J &amp; J allegedly uses bundled rebates as leverage over insurers by threatening a rebate penalty in \"many millions of dollar[s] annually\" if insurers do not enter contracts that foreclose them from reimbursing competitor biosimilars. Dir. AC \u00b6 76. First, J &amp; J engages in multi-product bundling, linking rebates for Remicade to other J &amp; J drugs and medical devices that their competitors do not offer. Through this \"portfolio approach,\" \"insurers and providers that refuse to grant exclusivity to Remicade would be forced to pay higher prices or forego enhanced rebates on multiple J &amp; J products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, J &amp; J also bundles demand from \"contestable\" patients (new users of infliximab or those who have switched to a biosimilar product) and \"incontestable\" patients (those \"already controlling their chronic conditions with Remicade are less likely to switch to a lower-priced biosimilar.\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. J &amp; J's contracts threaten to deny rebates \"on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Remicade prescriptions if\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   infliximab biosimilar prescriptions are reimbursed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. Plaintiffs call this the \"rebate trap.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80, \u00b6 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   3. Anticompetitive Effects\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Pricing data, insurance coverage, and overpayment are among the anticompetitive effects of Defendants' plan. Although Pfizer's Inflectra and Merck's Renflexis entered the market with WAC's (Wholesale Acquisition Cost or list price) at up to a 35% discount to Remicade, Remicade's WAC has increased since Pfizer and Renflexis entered the market in 2016 and 2017. Notably, J &amp; J \"still has over a 90% market share.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs show evidence that \"between 2007 and 2017, Remicade's Average Sales Price (\"ASP\") increased more than 62 percent. Despite Remicade's price hikes, unit sales of Remicade have actually grown 15 percent...from 2012 to 2016.\" Ind. CAC. \u00b6 109. Providers, seeking to avoid rebate penalties, allegedly choose not to stock Inflectra even when it is covered by Medicare and other government programs,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 105, shifting costs to the government, which is \"forced to continue reimbursing for Remicade, the more expensive product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both Direct and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs allege they have paid artificially inflated prices that are \"substantially greater than the prices they would have paid absent the unlawful conduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 146; Ind. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 131-132, 137.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs are required only to plead \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, and ... this standard does not require detailed factual allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.
