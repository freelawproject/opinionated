FURMAN, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In these consolidated cases, Plaintiffs bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment challenging the decision of Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. to reinstate a question concerning citizenship status on the 2020 census questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/\">\n    315 F.Supp.3d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2018). In an oral ruling on July 3, 2018, the Court found that Plaintiffs had made a \"strong showing\" of pretext or bad faith on the part of agency decision-makers and, applying well-established precedent, thus authorized discovery beyond the administrative record. (Docket No. 207 (\"July 3rd Tr.\"), at 76-89). Significantly, however, the Court did not rule, and has not yet ruled, on whether or to what extent any such extra-record materials can or should be considered in making a final ruling on Plaintiffs' claims. That is largely because the parties have not yet asked the Court to do so. Defendants were given the opportunity to file a summary judgment motion arguing that the Court's review should be limited to the administrative record and that trial was therefore unnecessary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 363). But they elected not to file such a motion - thereby conceding, as a procedural matter, that a trial is appropriate. That trial is scheduled to begin in six business days, on November 5, 2018 - a date that the Court set, in no small part, because Defendants themselves insist that resolution of Plaintiffs' claims \"is a matter of some urgency\" given the need to finalize the census preparations. (Docket No. 397 (\"Gov't Stay Mot.\"), at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Remarkably, despite the foregoing, Defendants now seek a stay of the trial and related pre-trial submissions (most of which are due today and therefore presumably done already) pending resolution of a forthcoming petition to the Supreme Court for writs of mandamus and certiorari. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Even more remarkably, although they filed their motion for a stay only three nights ago and this Court made clear less than two days ago that it would issue a written ruling in short order (Oct. 24, 2018 Pretrial Conf. Tr. (\"Oct. 24th Tr.\") 19), Defendants are already seeking the very same relief from the Second Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (Docket No. 402). Their request is based primarily on an October 22, 2018 Order from the Supreme Court, denying Defendants' application to stay two of this Court's prior Orders (namely, its July 3, 2018 Order authorizing extra-record discovery, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   July 3rd Tr. 76-89) and its August 17, 2018 Order authorizing a deposition of Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 261) ) and staying, at least temporarily, a third Order (namely, the Court's September 21, 2018 Order authorizing a deposition of Secretary Ross,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v. United States Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527303\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/282/\">\n    333 F.Supp.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2018) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2018). \"Any order granting the government's petition,\" Defendants argue, \"would substantially affect the further proceedings in this Court, including whether extra-record discovery would be permissible or whether review would take place on the administrative record.\" (Gov't Stay Mot. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In other circumstances, the Court might well agree - albeit, only as an exercise of its discretion over case management - that the Supreme Court's Order warrants hitting the pause button and postponing trial, as the Supreme Court's resolution of Defendants' forthcoming petition could bear on this Court's analysis of the merits. But Defendants' own \"urgen[t]\" need for finality calls for sticking with the trial date. (Gov't Stay Mot. 4). And, in light of the all-too-familiar factors relevant to the question whether a stay should be granted pending mandamus,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v. United States Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527825\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/339/144/#p147\">\n    339 F.Supp.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204279467\">\n    2018 WL 4279467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), Defendants are certainly not entitled to a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants Fail to Show the Likelihood of Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First and foremost, Defendants fall far short of establishing a \"likelihood that irreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay.\"\n   <em>\n    Hollingsworth v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639179\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/183/#p190\">\n    558 U.S. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639179\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/183/#p190\">\n    130 S.Ct. 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639179\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/183/#p190\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (per curiam). Significantly, Defendants do not claim harm here from the Court's decision to allow extra-record discovery, and for good reason: Putting aside the possible deposition of Secretary Ross, discovery will end before Defendants file their petition with the Supreme Court. (Docket No. 401).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor do they claim that, absent a stay, the argument they seek to press before the Supreme Court - that Plaintiffs' claims should be resolved on the administrative record alone - would become moot. That too is for good reason, as Defendants remain free to argue at trial that the Court should disregard all evidence outside the administrative record and, if unsuccessful, can argue on appeal that the Court erred in considering extra-record evidence. Moreover, the Court has directed the parties to differentiate in their pre- and post-trial briefing between arguments based solely on the administrative record and arguments based on materials outside the record. (Oct. 24th Tr. 16). The Court anticipates differentiating along similar lines in any findings of fact and conclusions of law that it enters. It follows that, if the Court rules against Defendants on the basis of extra-record materials and a higher court holds that the Court should not have considered those materials, Defendants would be able to get complete relief. Put simply, a stay is not necessary\n   \"to protect\" Supreme Court review.\n   <em>\n    In re Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Supreme Court can conduct that review, as in the usual case, after final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   So what do Defendants cite as their irreparable harm in the absence of a stay? They complain that, without a stay, they \"will be forced to expend enormous resources engaging in pretrial and trial activities that may ultimately prove to be unnecessary.\" (Gov't Stay Mot. 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it is black-letter law that \"[m]ere litigation expense, even substantial and unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irreparable injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Renegotiation Bd. v.

In other words, spending resources on trial first and seeking appellate review later is the overwhelming norm, not the exception - \"even though the entry of an erroneous order may require additional expense and effort on the part of both litigants and the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Parkinson v.

Far from a nationwide epidemic of irreparable harm, that is precisely how the federal court system is supposed to work.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.

But that novel theory of harm fails for several reasons. First, the decisions of executive branch agencies are not immune from scrutiny by the federal courts; indeed, the APA expressly invites such scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 702, 705 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Sackett v.

But this anomaly does not exist ....\"). Second, whether these cases proceed to trial or not, there is no dispute that Defendants' decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census will be subject to \"scrutiny\" by this Court and others; the only disputes between the parties concern the scope of evidence the Court may consider in applying that scrutiny and the degree of deference owed by the Court to Defendants' decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   And third, although trials in APA cases are - as Defendants emphasize - \"unusual\" (Oct. 24th Tr. 13), they are far from unprecedented.

(denying certiorari), if the Supreme Court allows a deposition of Secretary Ross before this Court enters final judgment, the transcript of that deposition can presumably be added to the trial record. In any event, it is Plaintiffs who bear the burden of proof in these cases,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schaffer v. Weast\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881663\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/49/#p56\">\n    546 U.S. 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56-57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881663\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/49/#p56\">\n    126 S.Ct. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881663\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/49/#p56\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), and Plaintiffs who seek to secure Secretary Ross's deposition to meet that burden. Despite that, Plaintiffs are content to take their chances and proceed to trial knowing that, even if the Supreme Court ultimately lifts the stay and allows a deposition of Secretary Ross, it may be too late for them to benefit in these cases. Thus, while the likelihood of success on the merits of Defendants' challenge to this Court's September 21, 2018 Order justifies the already existing stay of\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   Order, it does not justify a stay of\n   <em>\n    trial.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Perhaps recognizing that, Defendants confidently predict that the Supreme Court is likely to opine that this Court erred in authorizing extra-record discovery in the first place. (Gov't Stay Mot. 2-3). But they base that prediction almost exclusively on the\n   <em>\n    dissent\n   </em>\n   from the Supreme Court's Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3). It should go without saying that the dissent did not carry the day in the Supreme Court; instead, it represents the views of only two Justices. More to the point, there is nothing in the Supreme Court's Order itself that supports Defendants' confident prediction. Admittedly, the Supreme Court's Order states that \"[t]he denial of the stay with respect to\" the July 3, 2018 Order \"\n   <em>\n    does not preclude\n   </em>\n   the applicants from making arguments with respect to\" that Order.\n   <em>\n    In re Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But it is rather aggressive to read that language as an \"invit[ation],\" as Defendants do. (Gov't Stay Mot. 3). After all, if one person says to another \"you are not precluded from attending my party,\" the latter would be hard pressed to describe the expression as an \"invitation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, even if the Supreme Court's language could reasonably be read as an invitation, it is rank speculation to infer from that invitation that the Supreme Court is likely to hold, in the present interlocutory posture no less, that this Court erred in authorizing extra-record discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In fact, for several reasons, the Court concludes that the Supreme Court is\n   <em>\n    unlikely\n   </em>\n   to disturb the July 3, 2018 Order in advance of this Court's consideration of\n   the merits. First, that Order pertained to discovery, which - apart from the possible deposition of Secretary Ross - will be complete when Defendants file their petition with the Supreme Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 401).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Defendants' suggestion that this Court's July 3, 2018 Order somehow licensed a burdensome intrusion into the workings of the Executive Branch is overblown. The Court was careful to observe \"that discovery in an APA action, when permitted, should not transform the litigation into one involving all the liberal discovery available under the federal rules\" and should instead be limited to what is \"necessary to effectuate the Court's judicial review.\" (July 3rd Tr. 85 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). On that basis, the Court sharply curtailed the discovery Plaintiffs could conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n    at 85-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (limiting Plaintiffs to ten depositions and limiting discovery, absent agreement or leave of Court, to the Departments of Commerce and Justice) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Defendants' cries of intrusion and burden ring hollow in light of their own conduct. Rather than seek immediate review of the Court's July 3, 2018 Order authorizing extra-record discovery, they waited\n   <em>\n    nearly two full months\n   </em>\n   - until extra-record discovery was substantially complete - before seeking a stay and any form of appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527825\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/339/144/#p147\">\n    339 F.Supp.3d at 148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204279467\">\n    2018 WL 4279467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the Court's decision to authorize extra-record discovery was, and remains, well founded. In fact, if anything, it is on firmer ground today than it was on July 3, 2018, as the Court has since held that Plaintiffs allege a plausible claim that Defendants violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/\">\n    315 F.Supp.3d at 806-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under longstanding\n   Supreme Court precedent, that claim turns on whether Plaintiffs can prove that Defendants acted with a \"racially discriminatory intent or purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Arlington Heights v.

Having survived Defendants' motion to dismiss that claim, Plaintiffs were surely entitled to seek evidence to support their claim through at least limited discovery, including discovery probative of the decisionmakers' true \"intent\" and \"purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p265\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it would be perverse - and risk undermining decades of equal protection jurisprudence - to suggest that litigants and courts evaluating whether government actors have engaged in invidious discrimination cannot look beyond the record that those very decisionmakers may have carefully curated to exclude evidence of their true \"intent\" and \"purpose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Even without the equal protection claim, however, the Court's decision to authorize extra-record discovery was sound. For starters, although judicial review of agency action is generally limited to the administrative record,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v.

The \"bad faith\" exception \"is logical because once there is a showing of bad faith by the agency, the reviewing court has lost its reason to trust the agency.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 194, at 4 (conceding that there is a \"bad faith\" exception to the \"record rule\") ). And nothing in the Supreme Court's October 22, 2018 Order casts doubt on the well-established exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Notably, even the Justices who dissented from the Supreme Court's Order seem to accept that there is a \"bad faith\" exception\n   to the record rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 16-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Instead, they take issue with this Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs made a sufficient preliminary showing to trigger that exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court respectfully disagrees. This Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs had made such a showing was not based on a finding that Secretary Ross \"c[ame] to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, solicit[ed] support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagree[d] with staff, or cut[ ] through red tape.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619666,12619667\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/16/\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such circumstances, even taken together, would not be exceptional. Instead, the Court's conclusion was based on a combination of circumstances that were, taken together, most exceptional: (1) Secretary Ross's own admission that he had \"already decided to add the citizenship question before he reached out to the Justice Department\" to request the question; (2) evidence that he had \"overruled senior Census Bureau career staff, who had concluded ... that reinstating the citizenship question would be very costly and harm the quality of the census count\"; (3) indications that the Census Bureau had \"\n   <em>\n    deviated significantly\n   </em>\n   from standard operating procedures in adding the citizenship question\"; and (4) Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that Secretary Ross's stated justification was pre-textual. (July 3rd Tr. 82-83 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) ). Most significant, the Court found reason to believe that Secretary Ross had provided false explanations of his reasons for, and the genesis of, the citizenship question - in both his decision memorandum and in testimony under oath before Congress. (July 3rd Tr. 79-80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   If those circumstances, taken together, are not sufficient to make a preliminary finding of bad faith that would warrant extra-record investigation, it is hard to know what circumstances would - short of an agency head's outright confession that his reasons were pretextual (in which case, of course, there would be no need for discovery). In fact, circumstances far short of those present in these cases have been found by other courts to justify discovery beyond the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pub.

Those interests weigh heavily against any delay and in favor of making an adequate record for this Court to render an initial decision - and for higher courts to then review that decision without any risk that those courts would conclude that a remand to develop the record would be in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In their pending motion before the Second Circuit, Defendants contend that a stay of trial would not prevent resolution of Plaintiffs' claims before the census questionnaires have to be printed. (Motion for Stay (\"2d Cir. Stay Mot.\"), at 9, Docket No. 68, No. 18-2856 (2d Cir. Oct. 25, 2018);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oct. 24th Tr. 11-12). The Court does not share their confidence. There is no telling when the Supreme Court will issue a decision on Defendants' forthcoming petition. It could do so in days; or it could take months. If the Supreme Court's decision does not affect this Court's plan to proceed with a trial, the Court would then have to reschedule trial - no small task given the upcoming holidays, the parties' schedules (including two trials in parallel cases pending in other districts scheduled in January), and the Court's own congested calendar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Supreme Court's decision makes clear that Plaintiffs' claims should be resolved by summary judgment rather than trial, the parties will need to prepare extensive motion papers. In either case, it will take time for this Court to issue a written ruling and enter final judgment. And whatever this Court decides, the losing parties will almost certainly appeal to the Second Circuit and, in turn, to the Supreme Court. It would be hard enough for that normally lengthy process to run its course by next May or June - when the census questionnaires are apparently scheduled to be printed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket\n   No. 103, at 4-5; Oct. 24th Tr. 11) - if these cases proceed to trial on November 5, 2018. Granting a stay of indefinite duration could make a timely final decision next to impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, as prudent as it might be under other circumstances to await further guidance from the Supreme Court, there are good reasons not to do so here and instead to proceed to trial as scheduled. Time is of the essence. At bottom, Defendants are seeking a preemptive ruling from the Supreme Court on a decision that this Court has not yet even made - namely, what evidence the Court may consider in ruling on the merits - thereby seeking to disrupt \"the appropriate relationship between the respective courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181447\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/463/#p476\">\n    437 U.S. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 476,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181447\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/463/#p476\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181447\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/463/#p476\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). Making matters worse, Defendants have not yet even formally asked the Court to make a decision on that issue. They elected not to do so in the form of a summary judgment motion, and thus conceded, as a procedural matter, that trial is appropriate. And, perhaps most importantly, Defendants suffer no substantive, cognizable harm whatsoever in proceeding to trial as scheduled. They can make, and thus preserve, any argument they want about the scope of what this Court may consider in rendering a decision. And if they are unsuccessful before this Court, they can seek review of this Court's final judgment from the Second Circuit and, if necessary, the Supreme Court - as they could in any other case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Put simply, the pending challenge to this Court's Order authorizing a deposition of Secretary Ross notwithstanding, Defendants provide no basis to deviate from the well-established and well-justified procedures that have generally been applied in federal courts for generations - whereby district courts decide cases in the first instance, followed by an appeal by the losing party, on a full record, to the court of appeals and, thereafter, a petition to the Supreme Court. Defendants may yet have their day to argue the merits in the Supreme Court. But for many salutary reasons, that day should not come before this Court has decided the merits in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

That is an extraordinary complaint separate and apart from the fact that such costs do not constitute irreparable harm for the reasons discussed in the text. There are dozens of highly qualified lawyers and professional staff in the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York - the office that normally represents the Government in this District. The Court can only speculate why the lawyers from that Office withdrew from their representation of Defendants in these cases. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket Nos. 227, 233). Whatever the reasons for that withdrawal, however, a party should not be heard to complain about harms of its own creation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Defendants also cite the prospect of three current or former \"high-level agency officials\" being called as witnesses at trial as a form of potentially irreparable harm.

(Docket No. 403).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In the Court's view, that result would be regrettable, as Secretary Ross's testimony is essential to fill gaps in, and clarify, the existing record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     New York\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527303\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/282/\">\n     333 F.Supp.3d at 286-89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In fact, one might have thought that Secretary Ross himself would have been\n    <em>\n     eager\n    </em>\n    to testify, if only to clear up the record.
