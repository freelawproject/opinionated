Invoking Florida's public records laws, Plaintiffs sought to compel FDOT to produce certain records related to a bridge collapse that occurred in Miami-Dade County on March 15, 2018, killing and injuring a number of people. Although not a party to the case, the United States of America, on behalf of the National Transportation Safety Board (\"NTSB\" or the \"Board\"), filed a Statement of Interest with the state court, explaining-among other things-that FDOT is temporarily prohibited by federal regulation and by NTSB directive from producing the records sought by Plaintiffs. On August 21, the state court ordered FDOT to produce the requested records, effectively overturning the NTSB's directive to FDOT not to disclose the requested investigative information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 23, the United States of America (\"United States\" or the \"Government\") removed the action to this court, alleging that, \"because Plaintiffs were indirectly challenging the NTSB's administrative decision, the NTSB is an indispensable party that, under state law, could not be joined because of sovereign immunity.\" ECF 2 \u00b6 3. With its notice of removal, the United States filed an emergency motion to stay the state court's production order \"pending ruling on forthcoming motion to quash.\" ECF 3. After hearing argument from the parties by telephone, the undersigned granted the Government's motion to stay. ECF 6. Plaintiffs have since filed a motion (ECF 8) to remand the action to state court, and the United States has filed a motion (ECF 7) to quash the state court's production order and to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint. Plaintiffs and the United States have filed their respective responses (ECF 9 &amp; ECF 12) and replies (ECF 15 &amp; 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

We remain concerned that a premature release of information during an investigation could result in the release of incorrect or incomplete information requiring additional effort to correct, possibly impeding the progress of an investigation, and eroding public confidence in the credibility of an investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29681-29682.

The NTSB explained its rejection of the commenter's suggestion as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In defining investigat[ive] information, the NTSB is not limiting the scope of information the agency may obtain or consider under its statutory authority. The NTSB has broad authority to require the production of evidence it deems necessary for the investigation. 49 U.S.C. 1113(a)(1). The regulatory definition of investigative information limits the scope of information that may be released outside the investigation. The scope of investigative information depends on the nature of the accident or incident. An accident may be the result of a series of events or actions, and is not defined exclusively by the time of impact. For example, if the NTSB is conducting a limited investigation, the investigative information may be limited to information created or originating immediately prior to impact. If the NTSB, however, is conducting a major investigation in which it is examining potential causes of the accident that include a number of complex safety issues, investigative information could include documents and data leading up to the accident. Crewmember training records and maintenance records may be critical to such an investigation, even though they pre-date the accident or incident. Determining the probable cause of an accident or incident, in lieu of simply describing what happened, expands what the NTSB\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   considers investigative information. The NTSB has determined the definition of investigative information must therefore be flexible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528332\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/16/568/#p573\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 2-30 \u00b6 4 (Molloy Decl.)

ECF 2-30 \u00b6 8 (Molloy Decl.). Because the bridge was newly designed and built, the NTSB did not know during the initial stages of the investigation what factors may have led to the bridge collapse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, \"all information related to the design, construction techniques, materials used and the process of moving the bridge into position was potentially relevant and critically important to the investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Normal NTSB procedure is to restrict release of investigative information until late in the investigation to ensure the integrity of the evidence received and to keep the parties focused on assisting the investigation. ECF 12-2 \u00b6 8 (Second Molloy Decl.). Given the intense public and media interest in the bridge collapse, the NTSB decided that it was \"important to provide the public with as much information as possible while ensuring the integrity of [the] ongoing investigation.\" ECF 2-30 \u00b6 9 (Molloy Decl.). The NTSB determined that parties, including FDOT, could release information that existed up to and including February 19, 2018, but not information that existed on February 20 or after.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The NTSB communicated the revised restrictions to all parties to the investigation, including FDOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The NTSB also advised all parties that any outside requests they received for information that existed on February 20 or after would have to be submitted to the NTSB for approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.

We have also found that premature public disclosure results in reduced cooperation by the parties to our investigation because suddenly they are focused on public relations concerns and responding to often erroneous information in the press, rather than diligently assisting our investigation to understand the causes of the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ECF 2-12, Attach. A. A second letter to the court from NTSB's assistant general counsel, dated June 1, 2018, explained that \"[t]he erroneous interpretation that a party to an NTSB investigation is free to release any information it possessed before the accident is contrary to the express language of the regulation and relevant rulemaking history, and as explained below, would negate the entire purpose of the regulation.\" ECF 8-1, Ex. 1 at 1. The June 1 letter further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If ... the regulation [ \u00a7 831.13 ] permitted each party to release all relevant factual information in its own possession prior to the accident (i.e. information not originally obtained\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   an investigation), the overall purpose for the regulation would be lost. Each party could release its portion of the information, and the resulting combination of information from all parties, collectively, would be the entirety of the investigative information the regulation is designed to protect. A media outlet or any member of the public, unable to obtain all the information from a single source, would merely have to obtain discrete portions of the information from multiple sources, then reassemble the portions into a complete whole. It would be nothing more than an exercise in collating stacks of information, and the bulk of the NTSB's investigation file would be laid bare prematurely.

FDOT also moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim, asserting that federal law, which purportedly prohibits disclosure of the responsive documents, preempts Florida's public records law, to the extent the state law mandates disclosure of investigative information collected by the NTSB before the NTSB authorizes release of the documents.

The focus of these arguments was on five words in the first sentence in \u00a7 831.13(c), namely, \"information obtained during an investigation.\" Counsel for Plaintiffs contended that subsection (c)'s release prohibition applies to \"information obtained [\n   <em>\n    by FDOT\n   </em>\n   ] during an investigation.\" According to Plaintiffs' counsel, \u00a7 831.13(c) does not apply to records that pre-dated FDOT's designation as a \"party\" to the NTSB investigation because those records were not obtained by FDOT during an investigation. In contrast, counsel\n   for FDOT asserted that subsection (c)'s prohibition applies to \"information obtained [\n   <em>\n    by the NTSB\n   </em>\n   ] during an investigation.\" Because the records in question were obtained by the NTSB during its investigation, FDOT's counsel argued that the release prohibition set forth in \u00a7 831.13(c) applies to the records sought by Plaintiffs, obliging FDOT to withhold the records until the NTSB authorizes their release notwithstanding the state public records law. Echoing FDOT's arguments, counsel for the United States stressed that, if the regulation is viewed as a whole, as it should be, it is clear that the word \"information\" as used in subsection (c) encompasses all three categories of information defined in subsection (a), including \"[a]ny information collected or compiled by the NTSB as part of its investigation.\" Counsel for the United States also urged the court to defer to the NTSB's interpretation of the regulation as set out during the NSTB's 2017 rulemaking process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While acknowledging that the parties interpreted \u00a7 831.13(c) in opposing ways, the state court judge found that (1) there was no reason to defer to the NTSB's interpretation of \u00a7 831.13(c) because the regulation unambiguously supports Plaintiffs' interpretation; and (2) the requested records do not constitute \"information obtained during an investigation\" and, therefore, \u00a7 831.13(c) does not apply, making inapplicable the doctrine of federal preemption. In an order dated August 21, 2018, the state court denied FDOT's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, denied FDOT's motion to dismiss for failure to name an indispensable party as moot, and directed FDOT to produce to Plaintiffs the requested records from February 20 to March 15.

R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1). The record here makes clear that the United States, on behalf of the NTSB, has a material interest in this case, the outcome of which could potentially (1) undermine the validity of the NTSB's non-disclosure directives issued consistent with the NTSB's interpretation of its relevant regulations, (2) interfere with the administration and operation of the NTSB's congressionally mandated investigation; and (3) expose the FDOT to conflicting orders from two different sovereigns.

In\n   <em>\n    Florida Wildlife\n   </em>\n   , a case filed in federal court, the plaintiffs sued the Army Corps of Engineers (the \"Corps\"), alleging that certain decisions made by the Corps negatively affected the quality of certain Florida waters in violation of the Clean Water Act and Florida law. The Corps moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis of sovereign immunity. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\") and the South Florida Water Management District (the \"Water District\"), both agencies of the State of Florida, were also named as defendants. Independently of the Corps, DEP and the Water District moved to dismiss the complaint, invoking their Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in federal court and arguing that the entire case should be dismissed under Rule 19.

The United States, on behalf of the NTSB, is a required-entity sovereign that claims it could suffer serious harm to its substantial federal interests if the case proceeds in its absence. Like the claims of sovereign immunity in\n   <em>\n    Pimentel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Florida Wildlife\n   </em>\n   , the Government's claim of sovereign immunity is compelling and more than sufficient to satisfy the first Rule 19(b) factor-\"the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b)(1). The first factor suggests that dismissal is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The remaining three factors confirm the outcome suggested by the first factor. The second factor (\"the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided\"), Fed. R. Civ. P. (19(b)(2), favors the United States: Given the relief sought by Plaintiffs, there are no alternative forms of relief that could either lessen or avoid prejudice to the United States. The Supreme Court has explained that \"adequacy\" as used in the third factor (\"whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate\"), Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b)(3), refers to the \"public stake in settling disputes by wholes, whenever possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Pimentel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673863\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/851/#p865\">\n    553 U.S. at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673863\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/851/#p865\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Ordinarily, this factor takes into account additional litigation that might be initiated by an absent party who is not bound by the judgment. While it is unclear whether such additional litigation can be anticipated here, it is not difficult to imagine that, if Plaintiffs obtain the relief they are seeking, the same or other litigants may also seek the release of NTSB-protected documents\n   from the same or other parties to an NTSB investigation. The public interest would not be served by having additional litigation interrupting and interfering with the NTSB's investigative work. In addition, as the Government points out, FDOT may not find the judgment adequate, for it would require FDOT to violate an NTSB directive that FDOT is obliged to obey. The third factor also favors the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As to the fourth factor (\"whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder\"), Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b)(4), there is an alternative administrative remedy available that may or may not be adequate-namely, Plaintiffs may request the documents from the NTSB directly.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20837.1\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 837.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 837.4.

Indeed, a similar situation arose in\n   <em>\n    Florida Wildlife.\n   </em>\n   In that case, the district court allowed the sovereign state entity to present its arguments as amicus curiae, yet dismissal under Rule 19 was nonetheless the outcome.
