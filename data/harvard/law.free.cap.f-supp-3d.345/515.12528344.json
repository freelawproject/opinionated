Feuer a/k/a Mark Feuer, Scott A. Taylor, David I. Levy, Dhruv Narain, and John Does 1-10. Now before the Court is the partial motion of most of the defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to dismiss SHIP's complaint. For the reasons discussed below, and as explained in more detail herein, defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In evaluating defendants' partial motion to dismiss, the following allegations are taken as true: SHIP is an insurance company that provides long-term care coverage. Complaint \u00b6 5 (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1. In 2003, SHIP stopped writing new business and developed a \"run-off strategy\" with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Although SHIP is technically a for-profit entity, it is managed only for its policyholders' benefit, and any assets remaining after the satisfaction of SHIP's policies and obligations are paid out to charities that focus on senior health issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Of central importance to this action is non-party Platinum Partners, L.P., a Manhattan-based hedge fund founded by non-parties Mark Nordlicht, Murray Huberfeld, and David Bodner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. For over a decade, Platinum falsely inflated the reports of its performance, and as of 2012, the hedge fund was \"suffering severe liquidity problems and needed constant cash infusions to prop up its funds and support redemptions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. To meet these shortfalls, Platinum partnered with defendants Mark Feuer, Scott Taylor, and David Levy (Huberfeld's nephew) to form defendant Beechwood Re and its affiliates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The purpose of creating Beechwood Re was to \"present the false appearance of being unrelated to Nordlicht, Huberfeld, or Bodner in order [to] attract institutional investors that Platinum itself could not attract directly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2013, SHIP was introduced to Beechwood Re, and in 2014 and 2015, SHIP's CEO and CFO met with Feuer, Taylor, and Levy to discuss SHIP's investment challenges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Feuer, Taylor, and Levy advised that Beechwood Re would not be able to provide reinsurance to SHIP, but that Beechwood Re could provide SHIP with access to the same investments that Beechwood Re used for policies that it reinsured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Over the course of several meetings and presentations, defendants pitched SHIP on Beechwood's record of outperformance and conservative investment strategy. They \"recommended a strategy of investing in assets that were highly collateralized and well protected,\" and they \"represented to SHIP that the investments were over-secured by collateral that Beechwood could seize in the event that a loan or other investment was not repaid, which would enable Beechwood to recover the value of any investment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014 and 2015, SHIP invested $270 million through three Investment Management Agreements (IMAs), one with defendant Beechwood Re,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98, one with defendant Beechwood Bermuda International, Ltd. (\"BBIL\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82, and one with defendants B Asset Manager, LP (\"BAM\") and Beechwood Re Investors, LLC (\"BRILLC\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114, 118. Each of these IMAs had the same basic structure: the IMAs guaranteed SHIP a 5.85% annual return, with the defendants required to make up any shortfall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86, 102, 118. Any returns in excess of 5.85% would go to defendants as a performance fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88, 104, 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rather than investing in highly collateralized credit instruments, defendants almost immediately began moving SHIP's assets through a series of complicated transactions that ultimately served to enrich Platinum and Beechwood. Two weeks after SHIP made its investment with BAM, for example, BAM used SHIP funds to acquire an unsecured $35,500,000 note issued by an entity owned by one of Platinum's funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141. Although the note purchase agreement had a collateralization requirement, this requirement was deferred nine times in three months, and when collateral was ultimately posted, it was a small amount that \"simultaneously served as collateral for the debt to be collected under two other defaulted investments in which Beechwood had invested SHIP policy reserves.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complaint describes several similar transactions that funded Platinum and Beechwood at SHIP's expense. In February 2015, BBIL wired BRILLC $50 million of SHIP assets to fund a 6% note, but to date BRILLC has repaid neither interest nor principal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 157, 160, 162. And between 2015 and 2016, defendants used SHIP's assets to buy themselves out of a risky loan to an energy company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146. In doing so, defendants - particularly defendant Dhruv Narain,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was then BAM's CIO - also renegotiated the loan to subordinate SHIP's interest to that of other\n   Beechwood entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 151-53. Finally, the most egregious example - also allegedly orchestrated by Narain - involved a complicated series of transactions in which SHIP was made to repeatedly resell itself an interest in a convertible note that one Platinum entity held in another Platinum entity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 166-90. The result is that SHIP now has $70 million tied up in an illiquid investment of questionable value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While defendants were using SHIP's assets to fund themselves, they were also paying themselves tens of millions of dollars of performance fees out of SHIP's accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89, 105, 121. SHIP alleges that defendants justified these fees by falsely overstating the value of SHIP's assets under management.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132. In particular, defendants paid advisors and consultants to submit \"reports that contained inflated, and in some cases entirely falsified, valuations that purported to show that the Platinum-related investments were performing well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a specific example, SHIP points to an April 9, 2015 Duff &amp; Phelps report that Elliot Feit at Beechwood emailed SHIP's then-CFO on April 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136; ECF No. 63, Ex. G. SHIP alleges that this report significantly overstated the value of certain Platinum-related assets that Beechwood had purchased with SHIP funds. Compl. \u00b6 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 25, 2016, the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   published an article about Beechwood's ties to Platinum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 197. This was the first time that SHIP became aware of the connection, and Beechwood sent a letter the next day to SHIP's CEO, in which Beechwood reassured SHIP there was \"no reason to believe that either Beechwood or any of [SHIP's] related portfolios suffered financial harm\" from investments involving Platinum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198. Beechwood \"continued to tout its 'appropriate risk management' and 'strong safeguards' for SHIP's investments,\" and it \"represented to SHIP that it was in the process of, and was capable of, severing all ties with Platinum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Beechwood continued to withdraw millions in fees from SHIP's accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 199.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around November 2016, Beechwood proposed terminating SHIP's IMAs, but SHIP refused, instead requiring Beechwood to transfer assets out of the IMA accounts and into SHIP's custodial accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 201-02. SHIP also revoked Beechwood's authority to act without SHIP's express permission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 202. Over the following months, SHIP \"gradually began to uncover misrepresentations and omissions by Beechwood and the pervasive cover-up of Beechwood's ... investment of SHIP assets and its favoring of its own interests and those of its affiliates over the interests of its client.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203. SHIP alleges that \"Beechwood's cooperation and release of information to assist SHIP's damage-control efforts has been, and remains, intermittent and incomplete.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 24, 2018, SHIP filed a 13-count complaint against Beechwood Re, BAM, BBIL, BRILLC, and Illumin (together, the \"Beechwood Advisors\"); Feuer, Taylor, Levy, and Narain (together, the \"Individual Defendants\"); and John Does 1-10, who \"are unnamed and unknown individuals or entities who directly or indirectly acted in furtherance of and benefited from Beechwood's scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. The complaint alleges breach of contract as to Beechwood Re, BBIL, BAM, and BRILLC, as well as the following non-contract claims: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) fraudulent inducement; (3) fraud; (4) constructive fraud; (5) violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"); (6) civil conspiracy; (7) gross negligence; and (8) unjust enrichment. Each of the non-contract claims is brought against both the Beechwood Advisors and the Individual Defendants. The civil conspiracy\n   and unjust enrichment claims are brought against John Does 1-10 as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   All named defendants except for Levy move to dismiss SHIP's non-contract claims. ECF No. 61.

SHIP alleges that Taylor falsely represented in his April 10 email \"that Beechwood's 'focus for SHIP will be in the Asset Backed Senior Secured Credit class of investments,' \" Compl. \u00b6 57, and that Beechwood \"employs a '[c]redit-focused investment strategy which focuses on capital preservation,' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.

SHIP alleges that defendants never intended to manage SHIP's assets as represented, but that they planned all along to divert SHIP's funds to the benefit of Platinum and themselves.

MTD 17. The gravamen of SHIP'S fraudulent inducement allegation is not that defendants engaged in riskier investments than they had promised SHIP. It is that defendants intended from the outset to use SHIP's assets to enrich themselves and their affiliates.

Two of these meet the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) : First, SHIP alleges that Beechwood used reports with inflated valuations to extract unearned performance fees from SHIP's accounts, and it cites as an example an April 9, 2015 Duff &amp; Phelps Report that Elliot Feit at Beechwood emailed to SHIP's then-CFO on April 20, 2015. Compl. \u00b6 136; ECF No. 63, Ex. G.

In the case of the Duff &amp; Phelps Report, SHIP does not explain how the allegedly inflated valuations translated into unearned\n   performance fees. Pleading such a connection should be straightforward. Under the IMAs, defendants guaranteed SHIP a 5.85% annual return, and defendants kept any excess return as performance fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88, 104, 119. If defendants falsely overstated SHIP'S returns (e.g., by misrepresenting that SHIP'S funds had earned a 6.85% return in a given year), and if SHIP relied on this misrepresentation in paying defendants an (e.g., 1%) unearned performance fee, then SHIP should not have difficulty pleading the elements of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Similarly, while SHIP alleges with specificity that Beechwood made various misrepresentations in its July 26 letter, SHIP does not explain how it relied on these communications, or how it was injured by that reliance.

However, the Court will grant defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice, as SHIP may be able to amend its complaint (on the schedule set below) to adequately plead reliance and injury with respect to the misrepresentations above, or to satisfy Rule 9 (b)'s pleading requirements with respect to other misrepresentations that are \"collateral to the [IMAs] ... and therefore involve[ ] a separate breach of duty.\"\n   <em>\n    First Bank of Americas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234885,172654\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/690/17/\">\n    690 N.Y.S.2d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Huberfeld pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud by bribing a union leader to invest millions of dollars in Platinum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Nordlicht et al\n    </em>\n    , 16-cr-640 (E.D.N.Y.), ECF No. 1. Of note, the indictment alleges that Nordlicht and Levy \"devised a scheme to use the significant liquid assets held by Beechwood ... to address [Platinum's] liquidity problems, which included [Platinum's] inability to timely satisfy redemptions by [Platinum's] investors.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 54.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Narain formed defendant Illumin Capital Management, LP (\"Illumin\") in January 2017.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 194.

SHIP does not contest this argument, and the Court does not see any ground on which it could. As such, SHIP's breach of fiduciary duty claim against Illumin is dismissed with prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The claim is dismissed with prejudice as to Illumin for the reasons discussed above.
