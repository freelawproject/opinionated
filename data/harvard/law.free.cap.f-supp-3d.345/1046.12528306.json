Plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed this lawsuit under Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) et seq., contending that defendants failed to provide Reina with a reasonable accommodation and terminated his employment because of his disabilities. Now before the court is defendants' motion for summary judgment. Dkt. # 21. For the reasons explained below, I am denying the motion because I conclude that disputed issues of material fact remain that must be resolved by a jury. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   From the parties' proposed findings of fact, I find the following facts to be material and undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   UNDISPUTED FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Paul Reina is 40 years old and deaf with developmental, visual and intellectual impairments. He spent the first six years of his life in an institution, after which Rose Slaght and her husband became his foster parents. Slaght is Reina's legal guardian. Reina is nonverbal, but his family and job coaches communicate with him using different forms of sign language. His receptive skills are better than his expressive skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Reina's first job during high school was working in a laundromat, and he later worked in a delicatessen. In October 1998, Reina's high school program helped him become a cart pusher (also sometimes referred to as a \"cart attendant\" or \"courtesy associate\") at the Wal-Mart store in Beloit, Wisconsin, where he worked until June 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While Reina was working at the Beloit store, defendants had policies in place to\n   foster equal employment opportunities, provide accommodations in employment for people with disabilities, prevent unlawful discrimination on the basis of a protected characteristic (including disability) and provide for prompt investigation and documentation of reported violations of the policies. Defendants train their employees on the Americans with Disabilities Act and disability rights, including issues of accommodation and accessibility. Between January 6, 2014 and June 12, 2015, defendants also had a policy prohibiting any form of violence in the workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants' policies provide that reasonable accommodation requests should be acted upon and communicated to the employee as soon as possible and that managers should determine whether the employee can continue to perform his job while the request is pending. Although managers generally make accommodations at the store level, defendants have an Accommodations Services Center, which is a corporate division devoted to requests for accommodation. Defendants' policies instruct managers to inform the center if they decide to deny an accommodation request for any reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Employees and managers had access to defendants' policies through the company's intranet, which is referred to as \"the Wire.\" In 2015, employees could access the Wire only from computers located inside Wal-Mart facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Reina's Accommodations and Job Duties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In February 1999, the store agreed to provide Reina the following accommodations: (1) he could work with his job aide; (2) he would not have to handle fragile merchandise; and (3) he would not be assigned to do tasks that he was incapable of handling. While employed with defendants, Reina always worked with a job coach, including Slaght, Matt Coppernoll, Margie Polizzi and Mike Fallon. Coppernoll was Reina's primary job coach from 2005 to 2015, and the other individuals filled in for Coppernoll on a substitute basis. (Defendants point out that there is no evidence that any of these individuals were professionally trained as job coaches or that they provided job training or placement services, but for ease of reference, I will continue to refer to them as job coaches, as the parties do.) Reina's family arranged for the job coaches, who were paid through the Medicaid waiver program. One job coach, Polizzi, submitted to a background check and fingerprinting. (The parties do not say whether defendants requested these things.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The primary purpose and function of a cart pusher or cart attendant has remained the same during Reina's employment with defendants. The job description for a cart attendant, as revised on July 31, 2007, identifies the following as essential functions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Maintains availability of and organizes carts and flatbeds, assists customers with transporting items, loads merchandise into customer vehicles and properly and safely utilizes cart retrieval equipment (or the \"cart caddy\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Provides customer service by acknowledging the customer, identifying customer needs, assisting with purchasing decisions, locating merchandise, resolving customer issues and concerns and promoting products and services, while maintaining a safe shopping environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Employees working in other positions at the store provide customer assistance, such as stockers who load and unload items for customers, and greeters who direct and assist customers. Defendants do not require cart attendants to use the cart\n   caddy unless they are pushing more than 10 carts at a time. Managers can direct cart attendants to use the cart caddy, but one is not always available. (Although Reina's job coaches say that Reina was as efficient or more efficient at clearing carts manually than other cart pushers who used the cart caddy, defendants question the basis of their knowledge.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the parties dispute whether all of the functions of a cart attendant were considered essential for Reina's position and whether and to what extent his job coaches may have performed his job for him, they do not dispute the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Coppernoll watched for oncoming cars when Reina was retrieving carts and directed Reina's attention to the location of carts as needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Coppernoll and Polizzi tried to make sure Reina stayed focused on his job duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 When Reina was pushing a long line of carts, Polizzi would steer the front with one finger. Fallon grabbed the front cart to keep it in line. (It is unclear from the job coaches' testimony whether Reina could have steered a lesser number of carts on his own.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 When a cart caddy was used, Reina collected and loaded the carts onto the caddy and his job coach operated the mechanism to drive the machine. (The parties dispute to what extent and how safely Reina was able to operate the cart caddy by himself.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 When Reina was collecting carts, Coppernoll held the lead cart for Reina to prevent it from rolling away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Reina picked up trash in the parking lot, wiped down carts if they were wet and broke down boxes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Reina waved and smiled at customers on occasion and helped them load items into their cars. Slaght alerted Reina if a customer said hello or needed help. Polizzi encouraged Reina to interact with customers. About once a week, Coppernoll would coach Reina to carry a customer's groceries to his or her car, and Reina loaded and unloaded the cart. Polizzi noted that other cart pushers had walkie talkies to alert them when a customer needed assistance but that Reina was not provided a walkie talkie.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Polizzi worked alongside Reina as he collected carts or picked up trash either to model the job for Reina or to remain active while Reina worked. Defendants never told Polizzi that this was not acceptable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants never told Slaght that they did not want Reina's job coach to operate the cart caddy, steer carts or hold the lead cart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Several different managers rated Reina's performance between 1998 and 2014, and their evaluations were generally positive and complimentary, noting that Reina was a \"solid performer\" and was meeting expectations. The following are examples of the comments that managers made about Reina on his evaluations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 According to Reina's 1999 evaluation, he took \"direction very well from job coach,\" \"does his job to the best of his abilities,\" \"works very well with fellow associates.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Reina's 2000 evaluation states that \"Paul brightens everyone's day with his endearing personality,\" \"finds enjoyment in all he does\" and \"every person here finds Paul a very special young man.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Reina's 2001 evaluation notes that he is \"always prompt with good attendance,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"steadily pushes carts\" and \"keeps up well.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 Reina's 2002 evaluation states that \"Paul has been a great cart pusher\" and his \"job coach has kept him more active which he seems to like-works steady always.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Reina's 2003 evaluation notes that \"Paul is very dependable and hard working. Constantly maintaining carts in corrals\" and \"[l]oved to keep busy.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Reina's 2004 evaluation states that he \"worked to the best of his ability\" but advised him to \"remember to push under 10 carts at a time\" and to \"constantly monitor carts.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 Reina's 2013 evaluation states that \"Paul does well with making sure carts are full in the bay. Paul is good at making sure that there are no stray carts all over and makes sure that all the carts are cleaned up around the building.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 Reina's 2014 evaluation stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Paul is a pleasure to work with. Paul knows his expectations and does his job. Paul gets along with his fellow associates as well is friendly to the customers. Paul's attendance is decent having not missed any of his shifts, which shows his dedication to the job. Paul is good about making sure the carts are cleaned out of garbage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Development for Paul would be to communicate with management when he is taking his break and to watch his tardies. Paul also needs to be aware that when he is not using the cart caddy, only 10 carts to be pushed at a time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On some evaluations, \"N/A\" was written next to a task for which Reina did not receive a rating or evaluation. For example, Reina's 2008 evaluation did not evaluate him on helping customers find what they needed. Some of Reina's evaluations listed or noted \"areas of improvement,\" but none of them stated that Reina was not meeting expectations or was performing a function incorrectly. In 2001, the evaluation identified as a goal, that Reina \"will continue to work to [the] best of ability and improve if possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (The parties dispute whether Reina successfully performed the essential functions of his job on his own. Two of Reina's former Wal-Mart managers, Amanda Fellows and Sheila Rae Martin, aver that their evaluations of Reina's performance in 2013 and 2014 were based on what he and his job coach \"collectively were able to achieve\" and that they did not believe that Reina could perform the essential functions of his position on his own. The 2013 and 2014 evaluations do not state anything about \"collective\" performance or mention Reina's job coach. In addition, because defendants did not identify Fellows and Martin as witnesses until just before they filed their motion for summary judgment, plaintiff did not have the opportunity to depose them.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Alleged Incidents Between Reina and Coppernoll\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On December 26, 2012, a shift manager, Leah Wampole (who later changed her last name to Stroh), reported an incident between Coppernoll and Reina in an email to James Ford, the market human resources manager:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I have a serious situation that I need help handling. I have a mentally handicap [sic] associate that [sic] is a cart pusher. He has a job aid[e] that assists him everyday. The job aid[e] is hired through his parents, not a company. Today I had three customer[s] complain that the job aid[e] was physically abusing the associate in the parking lot. I viewed video with the APA and was able\n   to see Matt (the job a[e] ) putting his hands on cart pusher Paul. The altercation goes on for 10-15 minutes. Matt restrains him, pushes him, grabs him. At one point, although not completely clear in the video, Paul is on the ground and you can see Matt raise his hand like he was hitting him which matches to what the customer said. Matt then puts the associate into a vehicle where they sit for about 5 minutes with the car running. Paul is unable to communicate because of his disability. Can you please advise me in what steps I need to take to ensure that my associates and customers remain safe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Wampole called the police who investigated and classified the report as \"unfounded\" because even though an altercation occurred, there were no injuries to either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In late May or early June 2015, Jeff Scheuerell became the manager (the highest level of management) of the Beloit store. During a meeting on June 10, 2015, Stroh (formerly Wampole and now the co-manager of the Beloit store) told Scheuerell and Human Resources Manager Julie Repka about the 2012 incident between Coppernoll and Reina and the outcome of the police investigation. She also forwarded them the emails she had sent about the incident in 2012. (The parties dispute whether on or about June 9, 2015, a customer made a report to the store about observing Coppernoll sitting on Reina's chest and punching Reina in the face. Scheuerell avers that he learned about the report on June 9, but he fails to say how he learned about it or what he was told. Stroh also generally avers that she had become aware of a second incident in June 2015, but she fails to provide any details. For its part, plaintiff points out that: (1) the Beloit Police Department does not have a police report associated with such an incident and defendants have not produced or identified any witness statements, videos or internal interview reports concerning it; (2) Slaght and Coppernoll both testified that they were not told about an incident occurring in 2015; (3) Stroh had forwarded her email about the 2012 incident around this time, suggesting that this is the incident that Scheuerell was concerned about; and (4) Stroh testified that her only recollection of a 2015 incident was a general discussion in the June 10, 2015 meeting that \"this has happened before\" and that she did not \"specifically remember\" the 2015 incident, dkt. # 45 at 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Reina Asked to Complete Accommodation Paperwork and Does Not Return to Work\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Scheuerell and Repka decided to \"delve deeper\" into the work relationship between Reina and Coppernoll. Scheuerell learned from Stroh that Reina was \"deaf, blind and mute\" and that Stroh thought Reina's job coach was performing the majority of the functions of Reina's job. (Plaintiff disputes the truth of Stroh's statement on the ground that Stroh testified at her deposition that her only personal observation of a job coach performing work was running the cart caddy for Reina.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On June 11, 2015, Scheuerell called defendants' global ethics hotline to express concerns about the potential wage and hour issues related to work performed by Reina's job coach, whom defendants did not pay or employ. He reported that Coppernoll \"is doing all of Paul Reina's work\" and had \"assaulted Paul.\" Dkt. # 27, exh. 3 at 2-3. (It is not clear from the record of the call whether Scheuerell identified the assault as taking place in 2015 or in the past. In addition, Scheuerell and Repka testified that they had observed from a parked car in the parking lot that Coppernoll was performing work for Reina, who\n   was not doing anything and seemed incapable of doing the work related to his job. However, plaintiff disputes this account with testimony from Coppernoll and other job coaches and points out that the report to the hotline did not mention Scheuerell's observations of Reina's work.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Scheuerell and Repka decided that Reina should provide current, medically-supported information about his physical condition and what, if any, reasonable accommodations existed that could allow him to perform the essential duties of his job. On the afternoon of June 11, 2015, Scheuerell contacted Slaght to request a meeting, which Scheuerell, Slaght, Coppernoll and Reina attended on June 12, 2015. At the meeting, Scheuerell expressed his concern that Reina's job coach was performing the majority of Reina's work. He gave Slaght a new hire packet that included an \"Accommodation Medical Questionnaire\" and the cart attendant job description. Scheuerell told Slaght that a physician had to complete the form. (The parties dispute exactly what was said during this meeting, including whether Scheuerell said that he believed that Coppernoll had assaulted Reina or whether Scheuerell told Reina not to return to work until he had been \"deemed fit to work\" by his doctor.) Also on June 12, 2015, but after the meeting occurred, the global ethics hotline responded to Scheuerell in writing, suggesting that he contact Repka, the human resource manager for the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Slaght asked a physician at Reina's health care clinic to complete the accommodation form. Dr. Susan Lewinski listed Reina's diagnoses as \"deaf mutism, developmental delay, visual loss and anxiety state.\" Dkt. # 27, exh. 2. She recommended \"job coach-to do seeing &amp; hearing\" as an accommodation and noted that he was limited in the areas of hearing, seeing, speaking, lifting more than 50 pounds, learning, reading, thinking and sleeping.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On July 9, 2015, Slaght returned the form to Scheuerell at the store and asked him when Reina could return to work. (The parties dispute what happened next. Scheuerell says he asked Slaght for more information about the requested accommodation. Slaght says that Scheuerell did not ask for anything and stated, \"don't call me. I'll call you,\" but Scheuerell does not recall saying this. Slaght also testified that defendants never asked for clarification from her or Reina's physician about the July 2015 form, and it was her understanding from two of Reina's service team members that they had attempted to reach Scheuerell, but he did not speak with them or return their calls.) Slaght did not hear from Scheuerell again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In early August 2015, Slaght sought help for Reina from defendants by emailing a complaint using a link on an online portal for employees. When Slaght attempted to access the portal again in early August, she found that defendants had terminated Reina's access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Reina was not placed on the Beloit store's schedule and did not return to work after the June 12, 2015 meeting. (The parties dispute the status of Reina's employment. Plaintiff says Reina was constructively discharged because 1) he was sent home on June 12 and denied access to the company's online portal; 2) no one asked Slaght about the July 2015 request for accommodation and Scheuerell told her not to call about it; and 3) Scheuerell stated that Reina could not return to work until he had been deemed fit to work. Defendants deny terminating Reina and say that he was placed on leave and inactive status because he failed to provide updated and more specific medical information; Reina posed a danger to himself and customers while working in parking lot (which defendants\n   say is based on Slaght's deposition testimony that Reina almost got hit by a bus in the store parking lot on one occasion); and the non-employee job coach presented a potential (unidentified) risk to the company. The record contains no evidence showing when Reina was placed on leave or who made the decision to place him on leave or what the particular reason was for doing so. Sheuerell does not recall making the decision.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Reina filed a charge of discrimination in September 2015, alleging that defendants failed to accommodate his disabilities and effectively discharged him from his employment. Reina and defendants participated in a mediation sponsored by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on March 18, 2016, but it was not successful. (Plaintiff seeks to introduce a statement concerning the status of Reina's employment that defendants' representative allegedly made during this mediation. However, Fed. R. Evid. 408 provides that statements made in settlement negotiations are inadmissible to prove liability on the underlying claim or to impeach a prior inconsistent statement. Although plaintiff says that defendants waived their objection under this rule by their own reliance on Slaght's understanding of statements Scheuerell made during the mediation, I am not persuaded that such a waiver occurred. In any event, because neither defendants' alleged statement nor Slaght's understanding of Scheuerell's statements is dispositive of the issues in this case, I have not considered this evidence for purposes of resolving defendants' motion for summary judgment.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In a letter to Reina dated March 25, 2016, Wal-Mart's Accommodation Service Center stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   We are reaching out in an effort to continue the interactive process.

Generally, undue hardship means \"an action requiring significant difficulty or expense\" when considered in light of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (i) the nature and cost of the accommodation needed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (ii) the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at such facility; the effect on expenses and resources, or the impact otherwise of such accommodation upon the operation of the facility;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (iii) the overall financial resources of the covered entity; the overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees; the number, type, and location of its facilities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (iv) the type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; the geographic separateness, administrative, or fiscal\n   relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012111\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vande Zande v.

In support of its position that legal or safety risks can also can create an undue hardship for an employer, defendants cite two unpublished district court opinions involving religious accommodation claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which defines undue hardship as imposing more than a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   cost on the employer.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Ind. Aug. 27, 2001) (undue hardship can exist if proposed accommodation would \"either cause or increase safety risks or the risk of legal liability for the employer\") (internal citations omitted). However, defendants have not cited any legal authority for their position that the Title VII standard for religious accommodations should apply to disability accommodation claims under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In any event, defendants have not shown that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to whether Reina's requested accommodation would pose an undue burden on them. Defendants contend that they could \"arguably be party to negligence and other tort claims should Mr. Reina's helper, while performing tasks for Walmart, damage customer property or hurt someone.\" Dkt. # 22 at 28. Although defendants argue that the potential risks are \"significant,\" they present no evidence in support of their contention and fail to describe with any particularity what risks they face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants cite the alleged reports of Coppernoll's \"beating\" of Reina as a safety risk. However, the police investigated the report of abuse, including reviewing video footage of the incident in 2012 and determined that it was \"unfounded.\" There is little evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that another incident occurred in 2015, but even if the event did occur, it is not clear that allowing Reina to have a job coach poses a significant safety risk to Reina or defendants' customers. A reasonable jury could conclude that the incidents were limited to the relationship between Reina and Coppernoll and are unlikely to recur, particularly if Coppernoll did not continue to serve as Reina's job coach. Accordingly, defendants' motion for summary judgment will be denied on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Interactive Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Once an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer must meet the employee half way and engage in a \"flexible, interactive process\" to identify the necessary accommodations.\n   <em>\n    Basden v.

If the jury were to believe plaintiff's version of events, it could conclude that defendants failed to meet Reina half way and engage in an interactive process to identify possible accommodations for him. On the present record, I conclude that defendants are not entitled to summary judgment with respect to plaintiff's claim that they failed to engage in an interactive process with Reina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Disability Discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiff cannot prove its discriminatory termination claim because Reina was not able to perform the essential functions of his position with a reasonable accommodation and there is no evidence that he was actually terminated. However, as discussed above, questions of fact remain with respect to what tasks made up the essential functions of Reina's position, how Reina performed those tasks and what assistance he required from his job coach. Also in dispute is whether Reina was terminated in July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Although defendants contend that Reina \"went on leave/inactive status while Walmart waited for information it requested,\" dkt. # 23 at 39, they have not explained or submitted any evidence showing who made the decision to place Reina on leave, when the decision was made or how the decision was made or communicated to Reina. Scheuerell testified that he was waiting for information from Slaght about Reina's requested accommodation, but he also stated he did not recall making the decision to place Reina on leave. For its part, plaintiff argues that defendants terminated Reina because they did not want to continue accommodating his disability by allowing him to have a job coach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Under plaintiff's version of the events, Scheuerell sent Reina home on June 12, told him he could not return to work until he had been deemed fit to work by his physician, did not ask about the July 2015 request for accommodation that Slaght submitted for Reina and told Slaght not to call him about the accommodation. There also is evidence that defendants did not attempt to contact Reina or Slaght again until almost a year later, after Reina filed a charge of discrimination and the parties made an unsuccessful attempt to mediate his claim. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, a reasonable jury could conclude that defendants constructively terminated Reina because they did not want to accommodate his disability, and that instead of allowing Reina to return to work, they strung him along while purportedly waiting for what they considered acceptable paperwork. Accordingly, I conclude that plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to withstand summary judgment with respect to the discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \"Punitive damages are available for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act if the defendant discriminated 'with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.' \"\n   <em>\n    Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

However, factual disputes remain concerning defendants' reasons for requesting new paperwork from Reina, how defendants approached Reina and how Reina responded that could raise questions about defendants' intent. In addition, some question remains about whether defendants followed their policies in this case, particularly to the extent that the policies required accommodation requests to be acted upon and communicated to the employee as soon as possible and that managers should determine whether the employee can continue to perform his job while the request is pending. Under plaintiff's version of the events, neither of these things occurred, and defendants' accommodations center did not become involved until March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In sum, until the facts are further developed at trial, it is not possible to determine as a matter of law whether punitive damages would be appropriate in this case in the event that defendants are found liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, dkt. # 21, is DENIED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
