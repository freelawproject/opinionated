BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I accept as true the facts, but not the conclusions, set forth in Plaintiff's Complaint. (Doc. 1 (\"Compl.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 3, 2009, Defendants Cromwell Towers Apartments, Limited Partnership (\"Cromwell\"); Metropolitan Realty Group, LLC; and GPJ Cromwell LLC (together, the \"Corporate Defendants\"), hired Plaintiff to work as a porter at an apartment building they owned in Yonkers, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 25.) In connection with his employment, Plaintiff joined the Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ (\"SEIU 32BJ\" or the \"Union\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 37, 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's direct supervisor was Defendant John Carrollo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Carrollo is white and Plaintiff is black. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Plaintiff alleges that beginning in or around the spring of 2010, Carrollo \"tried to familiarize himself with Plaintiff by using slang words and stereotypical African American vernacular, such as 'hook a brother up' and 'do a brother a favor.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Carrollo did not speak this way to Plaintiff's white counterparts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around December 2011, Plaintiff met with two Union delegates at SEIU 32BJ's New Rochelle office regarding Carrollo's conduct, but Plaintiff did not file a grievance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) After that meeting, Carrollo \"began harassing and threatening Plaintiff[,] saying [that] Plaintiff 'opened a can of worms' by going to the union,\" and that \"he would retaliate against Plaintiff by writing him up because 'we settle issues in house.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Carrollo also began \"using the word 'nigger' almost every time he saw Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the winter or spring of 2012, Plaintiff contacted his new Union delegate and complained about Carrollo's constant use of the word \"nigger,\" but the delegate told Plaintiff that nothing could be done unless Plaintiff had an audio recording of Carrollo saying the word. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Throughout 2013 and 2014, Carrollo continued to regularly use the words \"nigger\" and \"nigga.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The abuse worsened beginning in late 2015, with Carrollo's \"usage of 'nigger' toward Plaintiff bec[oming] combative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) On December 21, 2015, Carrollo told Plaintiff, \"[D]on't be a nigger, don't stay in the trash room for 20 years, go find another job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the spring of 2016, Carrollo allegedly showed Plaintiff an app on his phone that simulated the noise of a person being whipped and said, \"I thought of you[ ] when I got this.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) When Plaintiff asked Carrollo to stop, Carrollo played the whipping noise two more times and, from then on, used it regularly when assigning Plaintiff work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) On June 2, 2016, Carrollo called Plaintiff \"Kunta,\" referencing Kunta Kinte, the character from the novel\n   <em>\n    Roots\n   </em>\n   who is an\n   enslaved African and is beaten into submission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54 &amp; n.2.) On July 5, 2016, while Plaintiff was eating, Carrollo allegedly told him, \"[D]amn a nigger eating good.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Whenever Plaintiff objected to Carrollo's use of derogatory and discriminatory language, Carrollo \"curs[ed] Plaintiff out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Carrollo \"short chang[ed] Plaintiff as to his pay under his contract\" and deducted Plaintiff's pay \"for uniform maintenance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 46.) Plaintiff emailed Scott Jaffee, \"Defendants' [o]wner,\" about discrepancies in his pay and spoke with the payroll department numerous times about issues with his missing wages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45, 46.) On many occasions, the issues with Plaintiff's pay were corrected by either Jaffee or the payroll department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46). Plaintiff also alleges he was not properly paid for two vacation days, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49), and was not properly paid for his overtime and other side jobs done for Defendants, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). On or around July 12, 2016, Plaintiff was suspended for three days after \"protesting working overtime, when he was not being paid for it,\" and complaining about being verbally discriminated against by Carrollo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    se id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 17, 2016, Plaintiff filed a charge of race discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) On September 13, 2016, the EEOC mailed Defendant a \"Notice of the Charge of Discrimination,\" along with Plaintiff's charge particulars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) On September 19, Carrollo showed Plaintiff a copy of the charge and \"scolded Plaintiff\" for filing an EEOC complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 27, 2016, Plaintiff was terminated \"under the guise of his failure to properly perform his duties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) On November 3, 2016, Plaintiff filed another EEOC charge, this time for retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) The EEOC issued Notices of Right to Sue on November 3, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Collective Bargaining Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pursuant to Plaintiff's membership in SEIU 32BJ, his employment was subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") between the Union and Cromwell. (Doc. 31 (\"Weinberger Decl.\") Ex. C (\"CBA\").) Under the CBA, the Union is the \"sole and exclusive bargaining representative for the purpose of bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and all other terms and conditions pertaining to employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Article Six of the CBA includes a \"no-discrimination\" clause that prohibits discrimination\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   against any present or future employee by reason of race, creed, color, age, disability, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, union membership, or any characteristic protected by law, including but not limited to, claims made pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, ... 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, ... the New York State Human Rights Law, ... or any other similar laws, rules and regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) The CBA mandates that \"[a]ll such claims shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure as the sole and e[x]clusive remedy for violations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The CBA also adopts a \"[p]rotoc[o]l in the collective bargaining agreement between the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations ('RAB') and the Union,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Weinberger Decl. Ex. D at 107-10), which authorizes employees to arbitrate their own claims in \"those circumstances in which the Union has declined to take an individual employee's employment discrimination claim under the no discrimination\n   clause of the CBA (including statutory claims) to arbitration and the employee is desirous of litigating the claim,\" (Weinberger Decl. Ex. D at 113). Even though this protocol allows employees to arbitrate their claims when the Union does not bring them on the employee's behalf, the Union and the RAB disagree as to whether the employee\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   arbitrate. \"The Union contends that the CBAs do not make provision for arbitration of any claims that the Union does not choose to take to arbitration, including statutory discrimination claims, and therefore, individual employees are not barred from pursuing their discrimination claims in court where the Union has declined to pursue them in arbitration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108.) \"The RAB contends that the CBAs provide for arbitration of all individual claims, even where the Union has declined to bring such claims to arbitration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108-09.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Arbitration Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following Plaintiff's termination, the Union brought a grievance to arbitration on his behalf, alleging that Cromwell did not have just cause to discharge Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weinberger Decl. Ex. B. (\"Arb. Award\") at 1-2.) The Union argued that \"the only explanation for the Employer's decision to discharge him ... is retaliation against Mr. Lobban for filing his [EEOC] charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 3, 2018, the arbitrator issued an arbitral award after receiving evidence and hearing from multiple witnesses. The arbitrator found that \"[t]he Employer had just cause for the September 27, 2016 termination of Anthony Lobban,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16), and that his claim that he was terminated in retaliation for his EEOC charge was unsupported, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). The arbitrator noted that Plaintiff made \"unsupported accusations ... of racial discrimination by the Employer that he did not support in his own testimony at the hearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) The arbitrator, however, did not make any findings as to whether Plaintiff was subject to discrimination while employed and noted that Carrollo \"denied recalling any of the racial comments Mr. Lobban described and testified that anything he may have ever said to Mr. Carollo [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] was in social jest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 11, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this suit by filing a complaint alleging the following claims: (1) racial discrimination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against all Defendants; (2) racial discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\"), against the Corporate Defendants; (3) retaliation under Title VII against the Corporate Defendants; (4) racial discrimination under the New York State Executive Law \u00a7 296 against all Defendants; (5) retaliation under the New York State Executive Law \u00a7 296 against all Defendants; (6) racial discrimination under the New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 8-107(1)(a) against all Defendants; (7) retaliation under the New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 8-107(7) against all Defendants; (8) aiding and abetting racial discrimination and retaliation under the New York City Administrative Code \u00a7 8-107(6) against Carrollo; (9) retaliation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all Defendants; and (10) retaliation under New York Labor Law (\"NYLL\"), \u00a7 215, against all Defendants. (Compl. at 10-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 2 and 23, 2018, respectively, the Corporate Defendants and Carrollo submitted pre-motion letters stating their intent to move to dismiss. (Docs. 12, 19.) Plaintiff responded on May 2, 2018, (Doc. 22 at 1-2), and on May 10, 2018, the Court\n   held a pre-motion conference during which Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the New York City claims against Carrollo and declined the opportunity to amend his complaint. (Minute Entry dated May 10, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 17, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss or compel arbitration, (Doc. 29), and filed a memorandum in support of their motion, (Doc. 30 (\"Mem.\") ). Plaintiff filed his opposition on July 18, 2018, (Doc. 32 (\"Opp.\") ), and Defendants replied on August 2, 2018, (Doc. 35 (\"Reply\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss on two grounds: they argue that the claims are precluded by the doctrines of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   or collateral estoppel, and must in any event be arbitrated under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. In the alternative they move to compel arbitration of any claims that are not dismissed. (Doc. 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mem. at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motions to Dismiss on Grounds of Preclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A motion to dismiss on grounds of preclusion is treated as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), not as a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Discerning what facts Plaintiff believes supports what claims is difficult, because he asserts his claims in conclusory fashion without tying them to the facts he has recited. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 10-14.) Although he does not use the term, he seems to allege that he endured a discriminatory hostile work environment. It is not clear if he claims that his termination was discriminatory or only retaliatory. His retaliation claims seem to allege adverse actions in addition to his termination following his EEOC complaint - specifically, he claims that: (1) after his January 2011 complaint to the Union, Carrollo began using the n-word, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-34); and (2) after his July 2016 complaints about overtime and discrimination, he was suspended for three days, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-58).

Indeed, the arbitrator made findings after hearing witnesses and receiving evidence. He found that \"the Union's and Mr. Lobban's assertion that the Employer terminated him in retaliation for his filing an EEOC charge in August is unsupported,\" and that \"the Employer's just cause for terminating Mr. Lobban makes clear that such was the basis for his termination, and that retaliation for filing the EEOC charge should not be found to be the basis.\" (Arb.

The Union's position at arbitration was that Plaintiff was not terminated for just cause, and \"the only explanation for the Employee's decision to discharge [Plaintiff] ... is retaliation ... for filing his [EEOC] charge.\" (Arb. Award at 10.) While the Union did not explicitly tie the claim to the statutes under which Plaintiff seeks redress here, the claim was based on a \"substantially identical\" factual predicate, and thus, \"the claims are deemed to be duplicative for purposes of\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    KIPP Acad.

Indeed, the Union did not bring discrimination claims on Plaintiff's behalf, and the arbitrator did not make any ruling on whether Plaintiff suffered discrimination. The arbitrator ruled only that Plaintiff was not retaliated against for alleging discrimination to the EEOC and was fired for just cause. And while the arbitrator made some references to Plaintiff's allegations of discrimination, he did so only in the context of assessing Plaintiff's credibility, (Arb. Award at 14-15), noted that Carrollo denied the accusations, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9), and did not resolve the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is thus far from \"quite clear\" that the arbitrator's denial of Plaintiff's retaliation claims amounts to a finding that Plaintiff was not discriminated against at all. Likewise, while the arbitrator found that Plaintiff's termination was not retaliatory, he made no findings as to whether Carrollo's use of the n-word or Plaintiff's suspension were retaliatory. Accordingly, collateral estoppel does not bar Plaintiff's discrimination claims (the first, second, fourth, and sixth causes of action), nor does it bar the retaliation claims (the third, fifth, and seventh causes of action), to the extent they are based on acts other than termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Specifically, Plaintiff relies on the portion of the protocol that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The Union contends that the CBAs do not make provision for arbitration of any claims that the Union does not choose to take to arbitration, including statutory discrimination claims, and therefore, individual employees are not barred from pursuing their discrimination claims in court where the Union has declined to pursue them in arbitration.
