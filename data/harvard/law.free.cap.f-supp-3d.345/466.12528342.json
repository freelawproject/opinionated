Before the Court are Defendants' motions to dismiss Rotberg's allegations for lack of standing pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

At issue in the present action is the Act's provision prohibiting any \"person within the United States\" from \"mak[ing] any call (other than a call made ... with the prior express consent of the called party) using any automatic telephone dialing system ... to any telephone number assigned to a ... cellular telephone service.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii). The statute provides a private right of action to any person contacted in violation of Section 227(b), and allows plaintiffs to recover statutory damages of up to $500 for each violation and up to $1500 for each knowing or willful violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(3). In enacting the TCPA, Congress directed the FCC to \"prescribe regulations to implement the [Act's] requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(2). Accordingly, the Court's analysis of the TCPA will be based in large part on the FCC's interpretations of the statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the allegations in Rotberg's First Amended Complaint, which are presumed true for the purposes of these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Tzvee Rotberg is an individual residing in the state of New York. (FAC \u00b6 8.) Defendants JAB and Vibes are business entities incorporated in Delaware with principal places of business in Maryland and Illinois, respectively. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) Acting as JAB's agent, Vibes sent Rotberg the text messages at issue in this case on JAB's behalf. (FAC \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although Rotberg alleges that he received \"several\" text messages from Defendants (FAC \u00b6 16), his TCPA claims are based on just two of those text messages (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rotberg describes the first of those text messages as the \"initial marketing text message.\" (FAC \u00b6 14.) Rotberg's First Amended Complaint does not provide the specific date or content of the initial marketing text message, but it does provide some other details regarding that message.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rotberg alleges that the initial marketing text message was sent by Defendants to his cellphone sometime prior to February 25, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rotberg avers that he had provided his phone number to the Defendants prior to receiving that message, but he does not describe when or how he did so other than to assert that in providing the number he did not consent to receiving marketing text messages. (FAC \u00b6 23.) Rotberg also alleges that the initial marketing text message referred consumers to a webpage with a set of \"Mobile Terms and Conditions\" for participation in JAB's mobile marketing program as administered by Vibes. (FAC \u00b6 23.) Rotberg attaches a screenshot of these Mobile Terms and Conditions as an Exhibit to his First Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 13-1.) Among the terms of participation required by that document is the requirement that consumers consent \"to receive autodialed messages, if any, from Jos. A. Bank at the phone number from which [the consumer] send[s] the text.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second text message on which Rotberg bases his TCPA claims is an opt-out confirmation text that Defendants sent to Rotberg after he texted the word \"stop\" to Defendants' phone number. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 25, 29.) Again, Rotberg does not identify the precise date on which he received this text, but he does allege that it was sent \"[s]ometime following February 25, 2016.\" (FAC \u00b6 25.) Furthermore, while Rotberg's First Amended Complaint also does not provide the specific language of the opt-out confirmation text, it does represent that the opt-out confirmation text included the URL \"Vibes.com/help,\" and Rotberg attaches a screenshot of that webpage as an Exhibit to his First Amended Complaint. (FAC \u00b6 25; Dkt. No. 13-2.) That webpage consists of a blank form under the header \"Consumer Text Messaging Help Desk,\" allowing users to submit requests for help with issues they experience with Vibes's text messaging program. (Dkt. No. 13-2.) Rotberg alleges that the linked-to form constitutes marketing material because the top and bottom of the webpage contain links with titles such as \"Meet Vibes,\" \"News,\" \"Events,\" and \"Our Platform,\" each of which in turn leads consumers to webpages that promote Vibes's services. (FAC \u00b6 26.) Rotberg also attaches screenshots of each of these linked-to webpages as Exhibits to his First Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. Nos. 13-3 through 13-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rotberg alleges that Defendants' text messages were sent using an automatic telephone dialing system (\"ATDS\" or \"autodialer\"). (FAC \u00b6 18.) He describes Defendants' autodialer as having \"the capacity to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator\" (FAC \u00b6 19), an allegation that reproduces verbatim the statutory definition of the term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Rotberg also alleges that Defendants' autodialer is able to \"send text messages to a cellular telephone number from a list of telephone numbers automatically and without human intervention.\" (FAC \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rotberg seeks to represent a class of all individuals who also received an initial marketing text message or an opt-out confirmation text message from Defendants within four years of the date of Rotberg's filing of his Complaint. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 29-32.) With respect to injury, Rotberg alleges that he \"and members of the Class ... were harmed by the acts of Defendants\" because the illegal text messages caused him \"and the Class members to incur certain cellular telephone charges or reduce cellular telephone time for which Plaintiff and the Class members previously paid, and invad[ed] the privacy of said Plaintiff and the Class members.\" (FAC \u00b6 34.) The First Amended Complaint seeks $500 in statutory damages for each of Defendants' negligent violations of the TCPA (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 44-45), and $1500 in statutory damages for each of Defendants' knowing and/or willful violations of the TCPA (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 48-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rotberg commenced this action by filing an Initial Complaint against JAB on April 21, 2016. (Dkt. No. 1.) The Initial Complaint alleged that all of JAB's text messages to Rotberg were unsolicited and unconsented to (Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 17-18), and it sought class certification and damages in connection with every text message sent by JAB to Rotberg (Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25, 37-38, 41-42). The Initial Complaint did not describe or specifically reference the initial marketing and opt-out confirmation text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to JAB's having answered or otherwise responded to the Initial Complaint, Rotberg filed a First Amended Complaint on June 15, 2016, which named both JAB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   and Vibes as Defendants. (Dkt. No. 13.) Defendants then filed separate motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint on August 30, 2016, moving to dismiss under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6). (Dkt. Nos. 37, 39.) In its motion, Defendant JAB asked the Court to take notice of the specific content of the initial marketing and opt-out confirmation text messages at issue, as represented in a settlement letter JAB had sent to Rotberg's counsel prior to the filing of the First Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 40 at 8 n.2; Dkt. No. 41). Additionally, Defendant Vibes moved the Court to stay Rotberg's action pending the outcome of a challenge to the Federal Communications Commission's interpretations of the statutory term \"automatic telephone dialing system,\" which was before the D.C. Circuit. (Dkt. No. 38 at 19-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 15, 2016, the Court granted Vibes' request for a stay pending the outcome of the D.C. Circuit's review of the term \"autodialer.\" (Dkt. No. 54.) After the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in March 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2018), the Court granted the parties' joint motion to lift the stay and invited the parties to submit supplemental briefing addressing the impact of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   on the Defendants' reinstated motions to dismiss (Dkt. No. 58). Supplemental briefing was concluded on June 1, 2018 (Dkt. No. 66), although since that time the parties have continued to provide notices of supplemental or recent authority regarding the issues raised by Defendants' motions (Dkt. Nos. 67-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to Defendants, because all of Rotberg's alleged injuries are traceable only to his receipt of the relevant text messages rather than to Defendants' alleged wrongful use of those texts to send marketing materials, he fails to establish that the injury he suffered is fairly traceable to the wrongful aspects of Defendants' conduct. (Dkt. No. 38 at 13-14; Dkt. No. 40 at 17.)

But Defendants' argument\n   demonstrates only that when choosing what class of unwanted phone messages to regulate, Congress did not make the scope of civil liability coextensive with all unwanted phone messages. Instead, Congress identified and targeted a subset of those injurious-in-fact messages that it found most troublesome and appropriately subject to civil liability. And that category of unwanted phone messages singled out by Congress, which had been identified by consumers as the most irksome, consisted of \"[p]hone calls from people selling things\" and \"phone calls from a computer trying to sell something.\" H.R. Rep. No. 102-317, at 9 (1991). Congress's choice to create a civil right of action for only a limited subset of invasive phone calls does not alter the conclusion that Rotberg's alleged injuries here are concrete and are directly traceable to Defendants' challenged conduct, namely their sending of unwanted text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In short, \"Second Circuit authority indicates that the Plaintiff has standing in this case to pursue his [TCPA] claim, and the Court sees no basis to conclude otherwise.

(FAC \u00b6 23). This allegation by itself appears sufficient to establish his prior express consent to receive non-telemarketing autodialed calls at that number. \"While there is a minority of courts that have found otherwise, the great weight of authority holds that an individual who knowingly provides her telephone number to another party without limiting instructions has giv[en] her prior express consent to receive calls at that number from that party.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel v.

Instead, Rotberg argues that the initial text message Defendants sent to him constituted telemarketing, and that when he gave his phone number to Defendants he did not provide the express\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   consent the TCPA requires prior to sending such telemarketing messages. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; Dkt. No. 44 at 1-5; Dkt. No. 46 at 3-7.) Accordingly, the viability of Rotberg's TCPA claim based on the initial marketing text message turns on whether Rotberg has plausibly alleged that that the initial text message constituted telemarketing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Rotberg's primary description of the initial marketing text message is as follows: \"Sometime prior to February 25, 2016, Defendants sent an initial marketing text\n   message to Rotberg's cellular telephone.\" (FAC \u00b6 14.) Rotberg asserts that Defendants \"may [ ] not properly argue on the motion to dismiss that the initial text message was not a marketing text message, for Mr. Rotberg clearly alleges in the [First Amended Complaint] that it was.\" (Dkt. No. 46 at 4.) Not so. Rotberg's tautological description of the \"initial marketing text message\" as a text that contained marketing material is nothing more than a \"formulaic recitation of [one of] the elements of [his] cause of action,\" which the Supreme Court instructs is insufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\") Rotberg cannot simply parrot a legal requirement of his cause of action to sufficiently plead a claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Furthermore, \"the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rotberg's conclusory allegation that the initial text message constituted telemarketing-a legally defined term and a required element of his TCPA claim-is precisely the kind of legal conclusion that courts must disregard. Accordingly, in assessing the plausibility of Rotberg's allegation regarding the initial text message's \"marketing\" character, the Court disregards Rotberg's conclusory descriptions of that text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Beyond Rotberg's generic references to the \"initial telemarketing text message\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21), Rotberg's only specific allegation regarding the content of that text message is that it referred recipients \"to the webpage located at 'http://bit.ly/1htG0Tu,' \" a webpage that Rotberg attaches as an exhibit to his First Amended Complaint. (FAC \u00b6 23.) That webpage consists of the terms and conditions required for participation in Defendants' automated mobile marketing program. (Dkt. No. 13-1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But a caller seeking out a consumer's express written consent to send\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   telemarketing or advertising texts is not as a matter of law already engaged in telemarketing.

Wash. Feb. 27, 2014) (\"[Plaintiff] argues that [ ] the text ... was a telemarketing text. The court has no difficult[y] concluding that he is mistaken. There is no indication that the text was intended for anything other than ... to permit [plaintiff] to complete registration.\"). Here, Plaintiff received a straightforward contract setting forth the terms and conditions by which he could consent to receive marketing materials in subsequent messages, after he had given his prior express consent to be contacted by JAB. The Court declines to construe the\n   linked-to webpage as itself constituting marketing material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because Rotberg's First Amended Complaint fails to plead facts sufficient to support his assertion that the \"initial marketing text message\" constituted telemarketing or contained advertising materials such that Rotberg's express\n   <em>\n    written\n   </em>\n   consent was required, his TCPA claims based on that initial text message must be dismissed. Given that Rotberg did not deem it necessary to include the full language of the initial text message in his First Amended Complaint despite referencing links provided by that initial text message and the precise wording of other texts (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23), it may well be that Rotberg simply cannot plausibly allege that the initial text message contained marketing material. Nevertheless, the Court will grant Rotberg's request for leave to replead his allegations based on the \"initial marketing text message\" (Dkt. No. 44 at 4), provided that he can do so in good faith in a manner consistent with this opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayden v.

The Opt-Out Confirmation Text\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The second text message that Defendants allegedly sent in violation of the TCPA is the opt-out confirmation message. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 25, 29.) Plaintiff alleges that he received this text after sending the word \"stop\" to Defendants' short code phone number. (FAC \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff again does not provide the actual content of that text message. Instead, he alleges that it illegally contained marketing material in the form of a link to a website that he attaches as an Exhibit to his First Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 13-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Both Plaintiff and Defendants rely principally on the FCC's declaratory ruling in response to a petition from SoundBite Communications, Inc. to assess whether this opt-out confirmation text violated the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (\"\n   <em>\n    SoundBite\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    27 FCC Rcd. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,391 (2012). In that ruling, the FCC \"conclude[d] that a consumer's prior express consent to receive text messages from an entity can be reasonably construed to include consent to receive a final, one-time text message confirming that such consent is being revoked at the request of that consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,394 \u00b6 7. However, the FCC held that permissible opt-out confirmation texts would be \"limited to texts that: 1) merely confirm the consumer's opt-out request and do not include any marketing or promotional information; and 2) are the only additional message sent to the consumer after receipt of the opt-out request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,397 \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The FCC acknowledged that subsequent application of its\n   <em>\n    SoundBite\n   </em>\n   ruling would require some \"review [of] questionable confirmation texts on a case-by-case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,397 \u00b6 12. The FCC provided the following guidance for conducting such a review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   On the one side, we believe that confirmation texts that include contact information or instructions as to how a consumer can opt back in fall reasonably within consumer consent. On the other, texts that clearly contain marketing or promotional materials (such as \"your request to opt-out of future messages will be honored but we are offering you a 10% discount on our products\") and texts that encourage consumers to call or otherwise contact the sender in an attempt to market, including such texts that, while neutral on their face, lead to a marketing message if the consumer contacts the sender, are likely beyond\n   the scope of the consumer's prior consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Applying that guidance to the First Amended Complaint's description of Defendants' opt-out confirmation text, the Court has no trouble concluding that the text falls into the first category of permissible opt-out confirmations. The First Amended Complaint does not reproduce the language of the opt-out confirmation, but references only a URL contained within that text. (FAC \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff alleges that the relevant URL, \"Vibes.com/help,\" led to a webpage containing a blank form under the header \"Consumer Text Messaging Help Desk,\" which invited users to submit requests for help with technical issues they experienced with Vibes's automatic text messaging program. (Dkt. No. 13-2.) This form by itself is clearly intended to do nothing more than provide consumers with a means of contacting Vibes for help, and thus is akin to providing \"instructions as to how a consumer can opt back in,\" which \"fall[s] reasonably within consumer consent.\"\n   <em>\n    SoundBite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    27 FCC Rcd. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,397 \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff disputes this characterization of the webpage located at Vibes.com/help. In doing so, he emphasizes that both the top and bottom of the help webpage contain links with titles such as \"Meet Vibes,\" \"News,\" \"Events,\" and \"Our Platform,\" each of which leads to webpages that provide information promoting Vibes's services. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) The Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiff's argument. As Vibes notes, it would be odd indeed for Vibes to employ an opt-out text message sent to an individual consumer of JAB's retail clothing as an opportunity to advertise its mass marketing services geared toward \"some of the world's biggest brands.\" (Dkt. No. 13-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 38 at 19.) Rather than evidencing Vibes's \"attempt to market,\" the presence of these links on the help page merely indicates that Vibes chose to locate its help page on its own website, which is not inconsistent with reasoning of the\n   <em>\n    SoundBite\n   </em>\n   ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    27 FCC Rcd. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,397 \u00b6 12. Vibes's permissible decision to include \"information or instructions\" in an opt-out confirmation text did not become unlawful because those instructions were housed on a web platform that peripherally contained nondescript links to other portions of Vibes's website.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That those links might lead the curious consumer to marketing material located on another webpage does not indicate that the twice-removed underlying text message was intended to convey \"marketing or promotional information\" in violation of the FCC's guidelines for such text messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2015\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,397 \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This holding does not foreclose the possibility that the language of the underlying text message itself might have contained impermissible marketing material. As it stands, because the First Amended Complaint is devoid of any reference to the specific content of the opt-out text other than the link to Vibes's help page, the Court cannot say that such a conclusion is\n   <em>\n    plausible\n   </em>\n   for purposes of Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The First Amended Complaint's claims based on the opt-out confirmation text accordingly must be dismissed.
