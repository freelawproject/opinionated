We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">On December 31, 1997, Wilkins was indicted by the Summit County Grand Jury for the rape of Shauneeka Mishauna Wilson, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). The indictment charged that the rape occurred on or about July 25, 1997. The state filed a notice of intent to use similar-act evidence with the trial court on June 18, 1998. The proffered similar-act evidence consisted of the testimony of Rita Warren, whom Wilkins had raped in December 1985. The state wished Rita Warren to testify concerning only the 1985 rape, of which Wilkins had been previously convicted. The state asserted that her testimony was admissible as previous-act evidence due to its relevance to the current charge against Wilkins. On June 29, 1998, after a hearing, the trial court granted the state approval to introduce similar-act evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">A jury trial commenced on August 31, 1998. On September 3, 1998, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Wilkins\u2019s sentencing hearing was held on September 11, 1998. He was sentenced to life in prison and found to be a sexual predator. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Wilkins asserts one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">\u201cThe trial court erroneously admitted prejudicial and improper testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s prior rape case over the objection of defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-14\">Wilkins asserts that the trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning his prior rape conviction. He contends that the testimony was not relevant to show identity, common plan or scheme, motive, opportunity, intent, or absence of mistake or accident, but rather that it had no relevance at trial but to show a propensity to commit the crime for which he was on trial. Moreover, Wilkins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>argues that evidence of prior crimes that is relevant only to show one\u2019s propensity to commit the crime charged is improper. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u201c \u2018The trial court has broad discretion in the admission * * * of evidence and unless it has clearly abused its discretion and the defendant has been materially prejudiced thereby, [an appellate] court should be slow to interfere.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 265, 15 OBR 379, 401, 473 N.E.2d 768, 791, quoting <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 302, 224 N.E.2d 126, 130. \u201c \u2018The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of. law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lowe </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 532, 634 N.E.2d 616, 620, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 172-173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 148-149. \u201cHowever, where the trial court completely misconstrues the letter and spirit of the law, it is clear that the court has been unreasonable and has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Warner v. Waste Mgt., Inc. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 91, 99, 521 N.E.2d 1091, 1098, fn. 10. Moreover, a new trial should not be granted unless the accused was prejudiced or may have been prejudiced by the evidence improperly admitted. R.C. 2945.83(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Generally, evidence of prior criminal acts, wholly independent of the crime for which- defendant is on trial, is inadmissible. <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 496, 497, 20 O.O.3d 411, 411-412, 422 N.E.2d 855. R.C. 2945.59 codifies the exceptions to this rule, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">\u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Evid.R. 404(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Evid.R. 404(B) is in accord with R.C. 2945.59. <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 281, 533 N.E.2d 682, 689. \u201cThe issue of identity, although not listed in the statute, has been held to be included within the concept of scheme, plan or system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence, it is necessary to determine whether any of the matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>enumerated in R.C. 2945.59 were relevant at trial and, if so, whether the testimony that the prosecution elicited regarding other acts of the defendant tended to prove the relevant enumerated matter. <em>State v. Curry </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 70, 72 O.O.2d 37, 39-40, 330 N.E.2d 720, 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"> \u201cBecause R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) codify an exception to the common law with respect to evidence of other acts of wrongdoing, they must be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.\u201d <em>Broom, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Moreover, evidence of other acts by a defendant is admissible only when it tends to show one of the matters enumerated in the statute and only when the evidence offered is relevant to prove that the defendant is guilty of the offense in question. <em>State v. Burson </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 158, 67 O.O.2d 174,174-175, 311 N.E.2d 526, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">At trial, Rita Warren, whom Wilkins had been previously convicted of raping, testified concerning how she met Wilkins. She continued on to describe the details of how the rape occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201cQ. What happens after he parked on the dead end street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">\u201cMS. MILLHOFF [counsel for Mr. Wilkins]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">\u201cA. Then he told me that he wanted to have sex with me and I stated no. Then we struggled and then he took it his way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. When you say you struggled, how did you struggle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-12\">\u201cA. First I tried to break through the passenger window out because the door didn\u2019t work because the car had been in a accident [sic ] previously and I didn\u2019t succeed at that, so then I tried to fight him off and then he bit me and I was screaming. He was covering my mouth up and stuff like that. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-13\">\u201cQ. Did there come a time when he threatened you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-14\">\u201cA. Yes, he did threaten me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-15\">\u201cQ. What did he say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-16\">\u201cA. He told me if I didn\u2019t give it up willingly, he would take it because he knows that [it] is still good 30 minutes after death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-17\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did you want to have sex with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-18\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-19\">\u201cQ. Did you have any desire to have sex with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-20\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-21\">\u201cQ. After he threatened you, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cA. Then after he told me that, he reminded me that he would kill me if I didn\u2019t give it to him, so then I just didn\u2019t fight anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201cQ. Okay. And what happened after you stopped fighting, what did he do to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201cMS. MILLHOFF: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201cMS. MILLHOFF: Your Honor, I would indicate for the record a continuing objection to this entire line of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: So noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">\u201cA. Then, excuse me, I forgot what you asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-12\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s fine. You indicated that at some point you stopped fighting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-14\">\u201cQ. Stopped fighting back. What happens after you stop fighting back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-15\">\u201cA. Then he had intercourse with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-16\">\u201cQ. Okay. Again, did you want to have intercourse with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-18\">\u2022 \u201cQ. After he had sexual intercourse with you, what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-19\">\u201cA. Then he put on his clothes and I put my pants back on and then he took me home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-20\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did he threaten you again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-21\">\u201cMS. MILLHOFF: Objection, leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: She may answer. Don\u2019t lead, Mr. Greven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-23\">\u201cA. He told me that the two people that he were [sic ] talking to in the bar, that they would come after me and he said that he would get me and he would leave town.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-24\">The testimony of Rita Warren did not comport with the requirements of Evid.R. 404(B) or R.C. 2945.59. The state argues that her testimony was relevant to show either identity or a common plan or scheme. Identity, however, was not a material issue in the state\u2019s case against Wilkins. Wilkins admitted driving Shauneeka to the video store and never raised a defense of mistaken identity. The issue at trial was, rather, a factual dispute concerning Wilkins\u2019s conduct when he was with Shauneeka. Moreover, the past crime and the present charge are not factually similar, except in their most general description. Hence, we conclude that identity was not a material issue properly subject to proof by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>other-acts evidence in the trial court below. See <em>Curry, </em>43 Ohio St.2d at 73, 72 O.O.2d at 41, 330 N.E.2d at 725-726.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The state\u2019s second asserted basis for admissibility, that the 1985 rape was relevant to show Wilkins\u2019s scheme, plan, or system, is also flawed. Other-acts testimony is relevant and, hence, admissible, under the scheme, plan, or system exception of R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) \u201cwhere those acts form part of the immediate background of the crime charged, and hence are \u2018inextricably related\u2019 to the act alleged in the indictment; that is, where the challenged evidence plays an integral part in explaining the sequence of events and is necessary to give a complete picture of the alleged crime.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 498, 20 O.O.3d at 412, 422 N.E.2d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">There was no evidence adduced during the proceedings below that would connect the rape of Rita Warren, some twelve years prior to the current charges, to the charge Wilkins faced at trial. Moreover, the state did not assert that the rape of Rita Warren was accomplished to further a common plan or scheme to rape Shauneeka. Hence, we conclude that the trial court erred by admitting Rita Warren\u2019s testimony. Moreover, due to the inflammatory nature of Rita Warren\u2019s testimony, we conclude that Wilkins was prejudiced by the admission of her testimony at trial. Wilkins\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-8\">Baird, P.J., and Whitmore, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">. The state asserts that the trial court's limiting instruction was sufficient to cure any error, which occurred in admitting the evidence of prior acts. However, \"[t]he existence of a prior offense is such an inflammatory fact that ordinarily it should not be revealed to the jury unless \u25a0 specifically permitted under statute or rule. The undeniable effect of such information is to incite the jury to convict based on past misconduct rather than restrict their attention to the offense at hand. For this reason, we do not consider the trial court's admonitions to the jury that [defendant\u2019s] prior convictions are immaterial to his guilt of the present charge sufficient to cure the error.\u201d <em>State v. Allen </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 53, 55, 29 OBR 436, 438, 506 N.E.2d 199, 201. Hence, we conclude that, due to the inflammatory nature of Rita Warren\u2019s testimony about the facts of the previous rape, the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction was inadequate to remedy the effect of the improperly admitted evidence on the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
