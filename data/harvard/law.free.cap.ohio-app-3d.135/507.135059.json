Appellant pled not guilty. A bench trial occurred on March 15, 1999. Eva Drake testified that she was in the process of divorcing appellant, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that both parties still lived in the marital residence. On December 30, 1998, at the marital residence, appellant and Eva Drake were putting their four-year-old daughter in Eva\u2019s car to take the daughter to the babysitter. Eva testified that the daughter \u201cwas throwing a fit because she didn\u2019t want to go to the babysitter\u2019s.\u201d Eva\u2019s niece was also present, helping put the daughter in the vehicle. Eva testified that \u201c[appellant] looked straight up at me, didn\u2019t blink [an] eye and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to burn you alive.\u2019 \u201d Eva responded, \u201cOh,\u201d and left the residence. Eva Drake testified that she felt \u201c[l]ike he would do it.\u201d When questioned why she believed him, she testified, \u201cBecause he\u2019s put my arm in a cast before and done several other things.\u201d In addition, she testified, \u201c[H]e\u2019s dug enough holes in his life he could put me in one and no one would ever know it.\u201d Eva drove to her mother\u2019s home and left her daughter with her mother. Eva called the police from her mother\u2019s residence and was told that she would need to file a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Soon after, an appraiser was scheduled to appraise equipment from appellant\u2019s business, Tombstone Sand and Gravel, as part of the divorce proceedings. Eva testified that \u201c[p]ossibly 45 minutes\u201d elapsed between the time she left her residence and went to Tombstone Sand and Gravel. The equipment that needed to be appraised was located near a river. According to Eva, \u201c[appellant] proceeded to tell me that across the street was my appraiser, that he had been ordered off the land and that if I didn\u2019t leave that I would be part of the river.\u201d On cross-examination, Eva was asked why she didn\u2019t leave Tombstone Sand and Gravel before her conversation with appellant. She testified, \u201cWell there\u2019s five people around me. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to hurt me in front of somebody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">After the testimony of Eva, the only evidence the prosecution presented, appellant moved for a directed verdict. The trial court overruled the motion. In the defense case in chief, appellant testified, denying his wife\u2019s accusations. The trial court found appellant guilty as charged. The trial court reasoned that Eva\u2019s testimony was credible and proved the charge of domestic violence. From his conviction, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and presents four assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case in chief, where there was legally insufficient evidence to establish each material element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s conviction for domestic violence is not supported by legally sufficient evidence and is contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cAppellant\u2019s conviction for domestic violence was against the manifest weight of the evidence and is contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Assignment of Error No. 4</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it permitted state\u2019s witness to testify regarding alleged prior acts of violence by appellant toward the witness, where such testimony was not properly particularized, but only general in nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We consider appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error together. These two assignments argue that the evidence supporting the conviction, Eva Drake\u2019s testimony, was legally insufficient. In determining whether a conviction is legally sufficient, the reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether any reasonable trier of fact could find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492, 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Appellant argues that harm was not sufficiently \u201cimminent\u201d in order to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed domestic violence. We are not persuaded. The first statement by appellant to Eva was \u201cI\u2019m going to burn you alive.\u201d The statement was unconditional. Even if appellant did not literally mean he would set her on fire, the statement was sufficient to put Eva in imminent concern for her physical well-being. <em>Hamilton v. Cameron </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 445, 449, 700 N.E.2d 336, 338. As the court stated in <em>Cameron, </em>\u201cThe state of mind of the victim is an essential element of this crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Eva testified that she \u201cwas petrified of him.\u201d When Eva went to the job site, she did not know appellant would be there. At the site, appellant told Eva that if she did not leave his business, she would be part of the river. This statement was conditional, but, based on the totality of the circumstances, including appellant\u2019s other threat forty-five minutes earlier, the trial court was entitled to conclude this threat was an imminent one. In any event, the threat \u201cI\u2019m going to burn you alive\u201d is sufficient to support the conviction. Accordingly, the first and second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In the third assignment of error, appellant argues that the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In determining whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of evidence, the appellate court reviews the record as a \u201cthirteenth juror.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, 546-547. The standard of review is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">\u201c \u2018The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d at 547, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 219, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720-721.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The trial court, being in the best position to evaluate the credibility and veracity of the witnesses, found the testimony of Eva credible. Her testimony supports appellant\u2019s conviction for domestic violence, and, therefore, we cannot say the jury clearly lost its way. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In the fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court improperly allowed Eva to testify about prior bad acts that are too generalized to meet the mandate of Evid.R. 404(B). Evid.R. 404(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Smith </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 551 N.E.2d 190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">This assignment concerns three statements included in Eva\u2019s testimony: (1) that appellant had previously caused her arm to be put in a cast, (2) that appellant told her that he has \u201cdug enough holes in his life and could put her in one and no one would ever know it,\u201d and (3) appellant told her that he had access to heavy equipment and access to the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">The act of previously causing Eva\u2019s arm to be put in a cast is admissible to show Eva\u2019s state of mind when appellant made the threats in this case. The second statement also goes to Eva\u2019s state of mind. The third statement is directly relevant to the threat to put Eva in the river. These two previous threatening statements and one prior act are not generalized bad acts from appellant\u2019s past. See <em>State v. Collie </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 580, 584-585, 671 N.E.2d 338, 340-341. Each of them is relevant to the specific facts of this case, and the trial court was within its discretion to admit them. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-12\">William W. Young and Valen, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-16\">. R.C. 2919.25(C) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-17\">\"No person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member to believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
