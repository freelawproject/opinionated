Arnold, appeals the decree of divorce issued by the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas naming plaintiff-appellee, Angela D. Arnold, the residential parent and legal custodian of the parties\u2019 only son, Quentin Tyler Arnold.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Kevin and Angela were married in March 1990, and Quentin was born on March 25, 1991. In August 1996, Angela filed a complaint for divorce. In her complaint, Angela requested that she be designated Quentin\u2019s residential parent and legal custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Prior to the final hearing, Angela\u2019s counsel filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting that the trial court exclude any and all evidence that Kevin might seek to introduce regarding Angela\u2019s alleged extramarital affairs. Angela contended that such evidence was not relevant to the issue of custody. On March 13, 1997, the magistrate issued an order precluding Kevin from introducing evidence of extramarital relationships unless the evidence was substantially relevant to the best interest of Quentin.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">On April 23, 1997, the magistrate held a final divorce hearing at which both parties presented witnesses. A number of friends of the family testified on Angela\u2019s behalf about recent changes in Quentin\u2019s behavior. In general, they, testified that Quentin frequently expressed a desire to stay with Angela, rather than to go with Kevin. Kevin objected to the admission of all statements made by Quentin as inadmissible hearsay. The trial court overruled the objections, stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t allow children to testify in court so the court\u2019s made the child unavailable as a witness. Go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Angela testified that she was Quentin\u2019s primary caregiver. Additionally, she testified that in an effort to be more available for Quentin, she had recently switched from the second shift at her current job to the first shift, 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Angela stated that Quentin\u2019s behavior had recently become hostile and withdrawn. She testified, over Kevin\u2019s hearsay objection, that Quentin was afraid to visit Kevin because Kevin had told Quentin that he might never see his mother again. On cross-examination, Angela admitted to suffering from bouts of depression in the past, but stated that she had sought medical treatment for her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Kevin presented testimony from several witnesses who indicated that Kevin would be the better residential and custodial parent for Quentin. Kevin presented evidence that he spent as much time as possible with Quentin and was currently coaching Quentin\u2019s T-ball team. Throughout the hearing, Kevin attempted to introduce evidence of Angela\u2019s alleged extramarital affairs. Each time the magistrate re-advised Kevin that if the evidence did not directly affect the best interest of Quentin, it would be stricken. Near the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate struck all such testimony from the record because there was no evidence that Angela\u2019s behavior had adversely affected Quentin.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On August 22, 1997, the magistrate filed a decision recommending that Angela be designated Quentin\u2019s residential parent and that Kevin be awarded extended visitation. On August 29, 1997, Kevin filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were issued by the magistrate on January 8, 1998, pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(2). Specifically, the magistrate stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u201cAlthough the mother suffers from bouts of depression, she has sought and has been under medical care for her condition. The father does not have any medical conditions which preclude him from being a proper parent. However, his testimony and demeanor reflected a strong bitterness toward his wife regarding her alleged affairs. This bitterness has and will continue to interfere with parenting decisions. The mother will be the parent who is more likely to facilitate court-ordered visitation and companionship rights * *</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">On January 21, 1998, Kevin filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Kevin contended that the magistrate\u2019s decision was not supported by the evidence, that the magistrate erred by admitting hearsay testimony by Angela\u2019s witnesses, and that the magistrate erred by refusing to admit evidence of Angela\u2019s alleged extramarital affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">On June 12, 1998, the trial court issued a decision overruling Kevin\u2019s objections and adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendations. In its entry, the trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201cSince the father did not file a counterclaim, the magistrate decided that evidence of [the] mother\u2019s alleged adultery was not relevant unless it could be shown that such misbehavior had an affect [sic ] on the mother\u2019s ability to care for the child. * * * The court finds that the magistrate\u2019s ruling was reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\u201cThe father also contends that the magistrate admitted hearsay testimony regarding the minor child. At the hearing, both parties presented hearsay testimony concerning their child. It does not appear that this hearsay evidence had any effect on the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On June 24, 1998, a decree of divorce, which incorporated the June 12, 1998 entry, was filed. Two days later, Kevin filed a motion for a new trial, alleging newly discovered evidence. Kevin asserted that Angela had concealed acts of misconduct during the divorce action, that she had plotted to have him murdered, that she had given birth to another child, and that she changed her place of employment, thereby creating a change of circumstances sufficient to warrant a new trial. On November 5, 1998, the trial court filed an entry overruling Kevin\u2019s motion. Appellant (Kevin) then brought this appeal, raising five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in excluding evidence of [appellee\u2019s] adultery and other misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">In his first assignment of error, Kevin contends that the trial court should have admitted evidence of Angela\u2019s alleged extramarital affairs because such evidence related to Quentin\u2019s best interest. Kevin asserts that Angela\u2019s alleged affairs have and will continue to take time and attention from Quentin. Kevin cites <em>Wilder v. Wilder </em>(Feb. 5, 1985), Franklin App. No. 84AP-604, unreported, 1985 WL 9844, in support of the proposition that \u201c[l]iving in a sexual relationship with an unrelated person of the opposite sex reflects adversely on a person\u2019s character and, thus, is a factor to be considered in the determination of custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">A more appropriate standard for considering the alleged moral impropriety of a parent in a custody dispute has been stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">\u201cConcern for a child\u2019s well-being or best interests does not * * * provide the court <em>carte blanche </em>to judge the rights and lifestyles of parents by nonstatutory codes of moral or social values. Although a court is not obliged to wear blinders as to a parent\u2019s lifestyle and/or morals, including sexual conduct, any state interest in competing lifestyles and accompanying moral values which affect child custody would most equitably be served if limited to a determination of the direct or probable effect of parental conduct on the physical, mental, emotional, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>social development of the child * * <em>Rowe v. Franklin </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 176, 179, 663 N.E.2d 955, 956-957.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Under the \u201cdirect impact\u201d test, as articulated in <em>Rowe, </em>the court may consider moral principles, but only in relation to the direct or probable effect of the parent\u2019s conduct on the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the trial court conducted the proper inquiry. When, prior to the hearing, appellant indicated that he planned to introduce testimony concerning appellee\u2019s alleged extramarital affairs, the court ruled that such testimony would be admissible only if \u201csubstantially relevant to the best interest of the minor child.\u201d Each time the matter was raised during the hearing, the court instructed appellant\u2019s counsel that such evidence would be admissible only if shown to have directly affected Quentin\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Appellant failed to establish a connection between appellee\u2019s alleged extramarital affairs and Quentin\u2019s well-being. Accordingly, the trial court properly struck all such testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cThe magistrate and the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements of Quentin Tyler Arnold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by admitting statements made by Quentin when Quentin was available to testify. Appellant asserts that the trial court was required to conduct a voir dire of Quentin, then six years old, to determine whether he was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">We can discern no basis under Ohio law for the magistrate\u2019s ruling on this issue. When appellant attempted to challenge the hearsay statements, the magistrate made a blanket ruling that six-year-old children were not permitted to testify in court. As a result, any statements attributable to Quentin were ruled admissible via hearsay testimony. This ruling is directly contrary to the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Evid.R. 601(A) provides that every person is competent to be a witness except \u201c[t]hose of unsound mind, and children under ten years of age, who appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\u201d Although the competency of individuals who are ten years old or older is presumed, the competency of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>under ten years old must be established. <em>State v. Clark </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 644 N.E.2d 331, 334. \u201c[I]n determining whether a child under ten is competent to testify, the trial court must * * * [consider]: the child\u2019s ability to receive accurate impressions of fact, the child\u2019s ability to recollect * * *, the child\u2019s ability to communicate what is observed, the child\u2019s understanding of truth and falsity, and the child\u2019s appreciation of his or her responsibility to tell the truth.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 574 N.E.2d 483, syllabus, certiorari denied (1992), 503 U.S. 941, 112 S.Ct. 1488, 117 L.Ed.2d 629. Therefore, where a party seeks to present testimony from a child under ten years of age, that party must be given an opportunity to establish that the child is competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In this case, the magistrate admitted hearsay statements, not because the statements fell within an exclusion or exception to the hearsay rule, but because the court found that the child was unavailable to testify. Our review of the record indicates that none of the statements falls within the hearsay exceptions listed in Evid.R. 804. Therefore, whether Quentin was \u201cunavailable\u201d is immaterial in this case. Therefore, we look to Evid.R. 803, which provides exceptions to the hearsay rule where the availability of the declarant is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Our review of the entire record reveals that a total of the twenty-four hearsay statements were admitted at the hearing. However, only two of these statements were properly admissible under the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Evid.R. 803 provides the following hearsay exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201c(3) * * * A statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">We disagree with the dissent here with respect to the second assignment of error, regarding exactly what types of statements fall within the state-of-mind exception in Evid.R. 803(3). Under the reasoning of the dissent, nearly all of the hearsay statements fall within the Evid.R. 803(3) exception because the statements \u201creflected\u201d the fact that Quentin was \u201cafraid.\u201d The dissent cites <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 21-22, 514 N.E.2d 394, 397-398, to support its reasoning. However, a close reading of <em>Apanovitch, </em>its progeny, and the clear language of Evid.R. 803(3) yield a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">First, the exception provided in Evid.R. 803(3) applies to a \u201cstatement <em>of </em>the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind\u201d not to any statement that \u201creflects\u201d on the declarant\u2019s state of mind. To be included under this exception, the statement must directly refer to the then-existing, subjective qualities of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>declarant. Including any statement that may \u201creflect\u201d on the declarant\u2019s state of mind extends the scope of the exception well beyond that which is clearly provided by the language of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Second, in <em>Apanovitch, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court followed the reasoning of <em>United States v. Cohen </em>(C.A.5, 1980), 631 F.2d 1223. In <em>Apanovitch, </em>the court explained that statements that the declarant was \u201cscared\u201d or that the declarant was \u201canxious\u201d are admissible. <em>Apanovitch </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 21-22, 514 N.E.2d 394, 397-398. However, the court clearly stated that \u201cthe state-of-mind exception does not permit witnesses to relate any of the declarant\u2019s statements as to why he held a particular state of mind. Accordingly, the witnesses were allowed to offer testimony that Cohen said, \u2018I\u2019m scared,\u2019 but not \u2018I\u2019m scared because Galkin threatened me.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 21, 514 N.E.2d at 398 citing <em>Cohen </em>at 1225.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In order to apply the <em>Apanovitch </em>rule to the current case, we will examine two specific hearsay statements that were admitted at the hearing. Jean Mitchell, a neighbor of Quentin\u2019s grandmother, testified that Quentin stated to her that he \u201cdoes not want to go with his dad\u201d and that \u201chis dad is mean to him.\u201d Under the dissent\u2019s reasoning, both of these statements would be admissible because they \u201creflect\u201d the fact that Quentin was afraid of being with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">This confusion results because, when one reads the statements, it is easy to draw an inference regarding Quentin\u2019s state of mind. One is tempted to infer that these statements actually mean: \u201cI\u2019m upset, because I don\u2019t want to go with my dad,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m afraid, because my dad is mean to me.\u201d We note that under <em>Apanovitch, </em>the first part of each statement would be admissible, namely, \u201cI\u2019m upset\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d However, the second part, explaining why Quentin held the particular state of mind, is clearly inadmissible. Simply because one may be able to infer something about Quentin\u2019s state of mind from the alleged hearsay statements does not mean the statements fall within the state-of-mind exception. In fact, a reading of <em>Apanovitch </em>demands precisely the opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">According to our count, there were twenty-four actual hearsay statements admitted at the hearing. However, many of the statements were repetitive, and, for our discussion, we have selected only those statements that represent each type of statement involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Crystal Noel, an acquaintance of appellee, testified that Quentin told her, \u201cDaddy won\u2019t let me call Mommy,\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go to Daddy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>house.\u201d Jean Mitchell, a neighbor of Quentin\u2019s grandmother, testified that Quentin begged to \u201cstay at his grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d and that \u201chis dad is mean to him and pulled his hair.\u201d Similarly, Marilyn Kirchner, Quentin\u2019s grandmother, testified that Quentin said he would \u201cnever get to see\u201d his grandmother and that he asked her about his mother\u2019s affair.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In addition, appellee testified that Quentin often begged \u201cto go somewhere so we won\u2019t be home when Daddy comes.\u201d Appellee also testified that Quentin asked her, \u201cWhy don\u2019t anybody ever love on me when I go there, Mom?\u201d As discussed above, none of these statements fits within the state-of-mind exception because none are statements of Quentin\u2019s then-existing subjective qualities.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Also presented at the hearing were several statements constituting hearsay within hearsay. Kirchner testified that Quentin said, \u201cDaddy says Mommy slept with Butch Witherspoon.\u201d Similarly, according to appellee\u2019s testimony, Quentin stated that appellant said, \u201c[H]e [Quentin] would never see Mom again, it was going to be like she was dead.\u201d Appellee also testified that Quentin stated that Kirchner had told him, \u201cYour mom is a little bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Under Evid.R. 805, to be admissible, both layers of hearsay (both Quentin\u2019s statement and the third-party\u2019s statement) must be admissible under one of the exceptions provided in the evidence rules. We find that none of Quentin\u2019s statements falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. Therefore, each of the double hearsay statements must be excluded on hearsay grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Finally, Mitchell testified that Quentin told her that he \u201cis afraid.\u201d Lorna Williams, a co-worker of appellee, stated that Quentin said he \u201cwas getting nervous.\u201d These two statements are admissible under the state-of mind exception in Evid.R. 803(3). However, our review of the record reveals that these two statements are the only statements that were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The Rules of Evidence were written to give a basic, fair trial to all litigants. Appellee, attempting to establish the child\u2019s best interest, presented hearsay statements against appellant. Appellant had a right to have Quentin testify, either in person if the child was found competent, or, if not, by proper hearsay testimony. The magistrate apparently attempted to circumvent the erroneous ruling by holding that appellant\u2019s animosity, rather than the hearsay testimony, was the crux of the decision. The trial court then adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, stating, \u201cIt does not appear that this hearsay evidence had any affect [sic ] on the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d However, this finding does not cure what occurred and does not remedy the fact that appellant did not have the complete and full hearing to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Due to the extent of hearsay evidence that was improperly admitted in this case, we find that the magistrate\u2019s ruling constituted error, and that the error cannot be deemed harmless under Civ.R. 61. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cThe findings of fact and conclusions of law failed to comply with Rule 52 in that it failed to find facts adequate to support the ruling of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">\u201cThe findings and judgment of the trial court [are] against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Assignment <em>of </em>Error No. 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Because our ruling on appellant\u2019s second assignment of error renders assignments of error three, four, and five moot, we decline to discuss those assignments of error. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). This matter is remanded to the trial court for a <em>de novo </em>hearing to determine custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-13\">Walsh, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b506-14\">William W. Young, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-13\">. Although the court\u2019s ruling was legally correct as applied to the limited evidence that was actually before it, we realize that our ruling on the second assignment of error could allow additional testimony to be received. We recognize the possibility that additional testimony may establish that appellee\u2019s alleged adultery did, in fact, have a direct, adverse impact on Quentin's well-being.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-10\">. The state-of-mind exception is intended to extend to the following type of statements: \"I am afraid\u201d; \"I like Norb\u201d; \"I am depressed\u201d; and \"I am happy.\u201d Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence (1999), Chapter 803, at 352.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b506-15\">Walsh, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ail\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">The dissent, with respect to the second assignment of error, states that \u201cappellant made no attempt to establish Quentin\u2019s competency,\u201d and that \u201c[a]t no time did appellant indicate that he wished to call Quentin as a witness, nor did he make an offer of proof as to Quentin\u2019s competence.\u201d By making these statements, it appears that the dissent has improperly shifted the burden of proof under the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">The burden of establishing that a statement falls within an exception or exclusion to the hearsay rule is upon the proponent of the evidence. See <em>State v. Riggins </em>(1986), 35 Ohio App.3d 1, 4, 519 N.E.2d 397, 402 (holding that the burden of establishing unavailability rests on the party offering the evidence). See, also, <em>State v. Rowe </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 652, 662, 637 N.E.2d 29, 36 (holding that the proponent of an elderly witness\u2019s deposition testimony bears the burden of proving her unavailability). Since appellee was the proponent of the hearsay statements and since the hearsay statements were offered against appellant, it is improper to hold that appellant bears the burden of proving Quentin\u2019s competen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>cy or availability in order to have the statements excluded. It is the proponent of the evidence, appellee, who bears the burden to prove that the statements are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In addition, I believe it is important to note the similarity of this case to <em>State v. DeMarco </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 31 OBR 390, 509 N.E.2d 1256. <em>DeMarco </em>also involved multiple hearsay statements improperly admitted via the testimony of multiple witnesses at trial. Although <em>DeMarco </em>involved the conviction of a criminal defendant, the evidentiary analysis is nonetheless applicable within this civil context. In <em>DeMarco, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cIn our view, the cumulative effect of these witnesses\u2019 hearsay testimony was prejudicial. Although violations of the Rules of Evidence during trial, singularly, may not rise to the level of prejudicial error, a conviction will be reversed where the cumulative effect of the errors deprives a defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196-197, 31 OBR at 395, 509 N.E.2d at 1261.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">An error is harmless in a civil context if it \u201cdoes not affect [the] substantial rights of the complaining party, or the court\u2019s action is not inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 159, 164, 17 O.O.3d 98, 101, 407 N.E.2d 490, 494, citing Civ.R. 61. I find that this error affected the substantial rights of appellant and that the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were not consistent with substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The most important issue here is that appellant has the right to have a fair hearing. To ensure fairness, the litigants and the court must comply with Ohio\u2019s established evidentiary rules. Therefore, this matter must be remanded to the trial court for a custody hearing in compliance with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b507-9\">William W.

Concerning appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, I agree with the majority that the ruling by the magistrate to deem Quentin unavailable, as well as the attendant attitude of the magistrate in making the ruling, should be strongly disapproved. I must respectfully dissent, though, because while such a ruling should be criticized, it was harmless in light of the substantial facts supporting the magistrate\u2019s and trial court\u2019s decisions awarding appellee residential custody of Quentin.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">The majority is correct that the magistrate\u2019s blanket ruling was contrary to the spirit of the Rules of Evidence. Nonetheless, the majority fails to properly consider those issues that are central to a proper analysis of the effects of the magistrate\u2019s ruling. In light of the final decision of the magistrate, discussion of these issues demonstrates that the magistrate\u2019s erroneous ruling did not so affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>appellant\u2019s rights as to deprive him of the \u201ccomplete and full hearing to which he was entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">First, the majority references Evid.R. 601 without providing any application of the rule to the facts of this case. Under Evid.R. 601,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the competency of a child under ten years of age must be established. The majority is correct that when a party seeks to present the testimony of a child under ten years of age, that party must be given the opportunity to establish the child\u2019s competence to testify. <em>State v. Clark </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 644 N.E.2d 331, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The magistrate\u2019s ruling deemed Quentin unavailable to testify by declaring him incompetent, but appellant made no attempt to establish Quentin\u2019s competency. In fact, the discussions between the magistrate and appellant\u2019s counsel demonstrate that appellant was not attempting to present any testimony by Quentin. At no time did appellant object to this ruling by the trial court. In his brief before this court, appellant concedes that \u201c[Quentin] Tyler would not, probably, be a competent witness, due to his age and susceptibility.\u201d Before the magistrate, appellant sought only to challenge subsequent hearsay testimony presented by appellee. At no time did appellant indicate that he wished to call Quentin as a witness, nor did he make an offer of proof to establish Quentin\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Thus, the majority\u2019s decision that the trial court\u2019s ruling prevented appellant from being able to examine Quentin regarding the hearsay testimony presented by appellee is not supported by the record. Before one could reach such a conclusion, one would have to find that appellant sought to call Quentin to testify, and there is nothing in the record to support such a conclusion. The majority\u2019s finding that a substantial right of appellant, to cross-examine hearsay testimony, was affected is predicated on its <em>assumption </em>that appellant would call Quentin as a witness. In short, even though appellant failed to assert this right in the proceedings below, the majority is now asserting this right on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The majority apparently determined that the hearsay statements admitted were central to the magistrate\u2019s final decision on custody, even though the record contradicts any such conclusion. The majority states:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">\u201cThe magistrate apparently attempted to circumvent the erroneous ruling by holding that appellant\u2019s animosity, rather than the hearsay testimony, was the crux of the decision. The trial court then adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>stating, \u2018It does not appear that this hearsay evidence had any affect [sic ] on the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Both the magistrate and the trial court issued unambiguous expressions of their decisions and the reasons for their decisions. A trial court \u201cspeaks through its entry\u201d and \u201c[w]e must accept the judgment entry as a correct and unambiguous expression of the trial court\u2019s resolution\u201d of the case. <em>Norton v. Liapis </em>(Sept. 27, 1999), Butler App. No. CA99-03-068, unreported, 1999 WL 760916.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">A proper analysis of the effect of the admitted hearsay statements upon the proceedings below demonstrates that no substantial right of appellant was so affected as to require a new hearing. The majority is correct that twenty-four hearsay statements were admitted as a result of the magistrate\u2019s declaration that Quentin was unavailable. Much of this hearsay testimony concerned statements by Quentin that reflected his then-existing state of mind or emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Hearsay statements that reflect the declarant\u2019s then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition are admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the declarant\u2019s availability being immaterial. Much of the admitted hearsay testimony concerned statements by Quentin that he was either afraid of appellant or that he did not want to visit with appellant. The majority reasons that these statements are inadmissible because they \u201creflect\u201d Quentin\u2019s state of mind, rather than being statements \u201cof\u2019 his state of mind. Such a distinction seems to go against case law and the very purposes of Evid.R. 803(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, unless a declarant uses the proper words to convey his or her state of mind, the statements are not admissible. Other courts have consistently found otherwise. In <em>State v. Awkal </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 324, 331, 667 N.E.2d 960, 967, certiorari denied (1997), 519 U.S. 1095, 117 S.Ct. 776, 136 L.Ed.2d 720, the Supreme Court of Ohio, discussing <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 514 N.E.2d 394, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u201c[In Apanoviteh], this court discussed the admissibility of evidence <em>reflecting </em>a victim\u2019s fearful state of mind. However, the court limited this type of testimony to that <em>reflecting </em>the state of mind of the victim, but not the reasons underlying that state of mind.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Awkal, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 331, 667 N.E.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>This reasoning is in accord with earlier decisions. In <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 491, 644 N.E.2d 345, 353, certiorari denied (1995), 516 U.S. 831, 116 S.Ct. 103, 133 L.Ed.2d 57, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of an appellate court that upheld admission of statements that were \u201c \u2018arguably relevant\u2019 to show that appellant was distraught and that he was following Mary Jane Johnson on the night before the shooting * * *.\u201d The court found that the admission of such evidence under Evid.R. 803(3) was \u201csupportable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This testimony included statements that the victim was scared and that she had changed her telephone number because appellant had continued to call her, even after being told to stop. <em>Id. </em>at 491, 644 N.E.2d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Even in <em>Apanovitch, </em>which the majority cites, the Supreme Court of Ohio noted that statements \u201cto the effect\u201d that the declarant was scared or apprehensive are admissible. <em>Id. </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 21, 514 N.E.2d at 398. Nothing in these cases, or in the purpose of Evid.R. 803(3) \u2014 to admit otherwise reliable and spontaneous statements reflecting the declarant\u2019s state of mind \u2014 seem to support the majority\u2019s assertion that it is the words used, not the state of mind conveyed, that governs admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">With this in mind, that hearsay testimony reflecting Quentin\u2019s then-existing mental or emotional state was admissible. The hearsay statements reflected Quentin\u2019s fear of being with appellant and his apprehension of leaving with appellant. It would seem that in a custody dispute, the child\u2019s fear of leaving to visit with his father would be a central concern of the trial court. The majority does not dispute this concern, instead, only stating that Quentin apparently used the wrong words to convey his fears and that his statements should therefore, have been excluded. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">This leaves fifteen allegedly improper hearsay statements. Of these, some were statements by Quentin that he did not feel loved, clearly an expression of his then-existing state of mind and emotion under Evid.R. 803(3). Another statement was a question by Quentin concerning appellee\u2019s alleged affairs, which was admitted for the fact that Quentin asked the question, not that appellee had affairs. This last statement was not being offered for the matter asserted and did not fall within the definition of hearsay in Evid.R. 801(C).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Pursuant to Evid.R. 403(A),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> hearsay testimony that is otherwise admissible may be excluded if its probative value is \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by its danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>of unfair prejudice. Without question, testimony that Quentin was afraid of being with appellant, or that Quentin felt unloved, would weigh against appellant because it would tend to demonstrate that giving appellant residential custody of Quentin would not be in Quentin\u2019s best interest. However, these statements go directly to Quentin\u2019s best interest, and it cannot be said that they \u201cunfairly prejudice\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The remaining hearsay statements concerned past actions, accusations, or alleged threats made by appellant that would be excluded either by Evid.R. 805<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as improper double hearsay or by the <em>Apanovitch </em>rule cited by the majority. The majority is correct in finding that the admission of these statements was error. Nonetheless, in light of the findings of the magistrate and trial court that appellant\u2019s own demeanor reflected that he would not support appellee\u2019s visitation and companionship rights, this hearsay testimony did not create such unfair prejudice as to deprive appellant of a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellant\u2019s testimony before the magistrate showed an obsession with appellee\u2019s past extra-marital affairs and open hostility toward her as a result of this obsession. It was clear to the magistrate that, based upon this testimony, appellant would not be the parent most likely to honor visitation and companionship rights. Even though the admission of some of the hearsay was erroneous, appellant\u2019s own testimony, in and of itself, supports the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Other evidence presented at the hearing before the magistrate supported the magistrate\u2019s final decision. Appellee presented testimony that she would make the better residential parent. Appellee is presently Quentin\u2019s primary caregiver. She had recently changed her work hours so that she could spend more time with Quentin. Although appellee admitted to suffering from bouts of depression, she has sought medical treatment for this condition. In addition, there was evidence that Quentin often returned from his visits with appellant feeling hostile and withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">In light of appellee\u2019s nonhearsay evidence and the hostile demeanor of appellant\u2019s testimony, the magistrate\u2019s ruling that Quentin was not available to testify was harmless. Civ.R. 61.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court reached this exact conclusion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>trial court reviewed the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision filed by appellant and considered the evidence presented before the magistrate. The trial court ruled that it was clear that the magistrate did not base the decision upon the hearsay presented, but upon appellant\u2019s own testimony and demeanor. The judgment of the magistrate and that of the trial court are both unambiguous and supported by the record. We are required to accept them as correct statements of the reasons for the decisions below. <em>Norton v. Liapis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">This court should not criticize the magistrate\u2019s decision at the expense of a proper analysis and resolution of the issues presented for our review. I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s resolution of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">I would also address appellant\u2019s third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error, rather than deeming them moot. I would hold that the findings of fact challenged in appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, those relating to appellant\u2019s hostility toward appellee, have support in the record. With regard to appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, I would find that the judgment of the magistrate and trial court were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, especially in light of the substantial evidence presented by appellee that she would make the better residential parent and the testimony of appellant demonstrating his obsessive and hostile attitude towards appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">As to appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, I would find that the trial court properly overruled appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Appellant argues that he presented evidence that appellee had engaged in misconduct after the final hearing and that she allegedly had hired someone to kill him. Appellant also raised the errors asserted in his' first four assignments of error in this appeal. The trial court found appellant\u2019s claims to be unsubstantiated or without merit, and I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to overrule appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\">.
