On December 7, 1999, verification was filed in the trial court that no hearing was held. See Sup.R. 23(1). The verification provides that the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>hold a hearing to consider the complaint within five days of the date appellant filed her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">In her appellate brief, appellant writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201cAppellant is requesting an order from this Court confirming that, per the statute, she has a constructive order which permit[s] the health care facility to perform the procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We note that R.C. 2151.85(B)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u201cIf the hearing required by this division is <em>not held </em>by the fifth business day after the complaint is filed, the <em>failure to hold </em>the hearing shall be <em>considered </em>to be a <em>constructive order of the court authorizing the complainant to consent </em>to the performance or <em>inducement of </em>an abortion <em>without </em>the <em>notification </em>of her parent, guardian, or custodian, and the complainant and any other person may <em>rely on the constructive order </em>to the same extent as if the court actually had issued an order under this section authorizing the complainant to consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion without such notification.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Thus, pursuant to the statute\u2019s clear language, appellant and any other person may rely on the constructive order to the same extent as if the court had actually issued an order permitting the parental notification bypass procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b752-10\">Harsha and Peter B.
