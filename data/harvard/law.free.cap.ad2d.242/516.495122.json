Ctr., </em>186 AD2d 539). In his opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment the plaintiff has failed to rebut this showing. Moreover, since there was only hope and speculation as to what additional discovery would uncover, the court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment <em>(see, Mazzaferro v Barterama Corp., </em>218 AD2d 643).
