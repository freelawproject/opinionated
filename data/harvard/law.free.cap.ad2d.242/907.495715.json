Memorandum: Contrary to the contention of petitioner, the determination that he violated inmate rules 113.10 (7 NYCRR 270.2 [B] [14] [i] [possession of contraband]) and 114.10 (7 NYCRR 270.2 [B] [15] [i] [smuggling]) is supported by substantial evidence <em>(see, Matter of Mabery v Coughlin, </em>168 AD2d 879, <em>lv denied </em>77 NY2d 808; <em>Matter of Shakoor v Coughlin, </em>165 AD2d 917, 918, <em>appeal dismissed </em>77 NY2d 866). Petitioner was not denied his right to present evidence in support of his defense; he failed to show that the documentary evidence and testimony he sought to present at the hearing were relevant to the charges against him <em>(see, Matter of Hendricks v Scully, </em>206 AD2d 427). Further, even assuming, arguendo, that petitioner exhausted his administrative remedies with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>spect to his contention that he was denied his right to an impartial Hearing Officer (see, <em>Matter of Nelson v Coughlin, </em>188 AD2d 1071, <em>appeal dismissed </em>81 NY2d 834), there is no evidence in the record that the Hearing Officer was biased or that the determination flowed from the alleged bias (see, <em>Matter of Rosa v Coombe, </em>238 AD2d 814; <em>Matter of Gardiner v Coughlin, </em>190 AD2d 962, 963, <em>lv denied </em>81 NY2d 710).
