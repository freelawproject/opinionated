Parties plaintiff\u2014to recover for death occasioned by negligence\u2014under the statute of Indiana. A married woman, who was a resident of this State, while traveling in the State of Indiana, was killed upon a railroad, the accident causing the death being occasioned, as was alleged, by the negligence of the railroad company. A person was appointed, in this State, administrator of the deceased, such administrator not being the husband. It was held, that under the statute of Indiana in force in 1859, the right of action to sue for and recover the damages against the company for the death was vested in the administrator, and he could be held accountable as such for money received, or which ought to have been received by him in such a suit.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b519-16\" pgmap=\"519\">2. Administrator\u2014liability for proper custody of funds. Where a right of action is by law vested in an administrator, and in that capacity he brings suit for the recovery of money, but pending the suit a settlement is made in respect thereto, it is his duty to see to it that the proceeds of such settlement are placed in the hands of the persons who are lawfully entitled to them.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b519-17\" pgmap=\"519(93) 520(65)\">3. So, where an administrator of a married woman, whose death had been occasioned by the negligence of a railroad company, had brought suit against the company to recover damages on account of such negligence, permitted the surviving husband of the deceased to receive the proceeds of a settlement of the subject matter of the suit, without lawful right on the part of the husband so to do, in a suit by the children and heirs at law of the deceased, to whom the fund belonged, against the administrator to recover the money so received by their father and not accounted for by him, it was held, the administrator was liable. The money so obtained constituted a trust fund for these children, and the administrator, whose duty it was to have received the money in the first instance, was bound to see that it reached the hands of those to whom it belonged, or their properly appointed guardian.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-6\" pgmap=\"520\">4. Same\u2014and herein, of the rights of the father as natural guardian of his children. In such-case, the mere fact that the father assumed the trust in respect to the money in behalf of his children, not having been appointed their guardian in the mode provided by law, would not operate to relieve the administrator from the duty of seeing that the fund should finally reach the persons to whom it belonged. As to the control of the person of a minor, the father is guardian by nature, but as to the estate of the minor, the father has no power except under an appointment.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-7\" pgmap=\"520\">5. Same\u2014as to marshalling equities in the interest of the administrator. In the case mentioned, the suit by the heirs was against the administrator of their mother, and also against the administrator of their father, who had in the meantime also died. It was held, although the administrator of the mother was bound to.see that the children should ultimately receive the money which he improperly permitted to go into the hands of their father, yet the father held the money in trust for his children, and the estate of the father was bound to respond to them therefor; and, as the administrator of the mother had received no pecuniary advantage from the transaction, he was entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the children in the estate of their father to the extent that he might be compelled to pay them.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-8\" pgmap=\"520\">6. Same\u2014and herein, of money held in trust as a preferred claim. To the end, then, that the children should be secured in their rights, and the administrator of their mother be required to pay no more than should be necessary for the security of those rights, it was held, the estate of the father should be charged with the money as a trust fund, and as such to be allowed in a class of preferred claims, and in default \u00f3f payment by the estate of the father, then the administrator of the mother be required to pay the same, but to be reimbursed out of the funds of the estate of the father which ought to have been applied in discharge of this claim.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-9\" pgmap=\"520\">7. Death from negligence\u2014to whom the damages may he paid\u2014under the statute of Indiana. Under the statute of the State of Indiana, in force in 1859, in case of the death of a minor from the negligence of a railroad company, the right to recover and to receive compensation for such wrong was placed in the father of such minor, if he were living. So, when the administrator of such minor permitted the father to receive the money arising from that cause, he was held to have performed his whole duty in respect to the fund.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b521-5\" pgmap=\"521\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Winnebago county; the Hon.

As to that part of the fund paid on account of the death of Lucinda M. Regan, we think the right of action, by the Indiana statute, was placed in appellant, and it is only as to this part of the fund he is charged by the decree. On this ground he has no just cause to complain.</p> <p id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">Appellant also contends that, inasmuch as he did not in fact himself receive any part of this fund, and had no active agency in the bringing of the suit, or otherwise in the procurement of the fund, he can not properly be charged with any part of the money received by Marshall H. Regan. We think otherwise. The right of action for its recovery was in him; the suit was begun and conducted in his name, and with his knowledge and consent, and the settlement was accomplished with his knowledge and approbation, and he destroyed the right of action by his own release, executed under his hand and seal, and the money, by his acquiescence, was placed in the hands of Marshall H. Regan. It was the complainants\u2019 money\u2014a trust fund\u2014and they were minors. The acts of Regan, in this regard, must be considered the acts of Perry, as between complainants and himself, and Perry thereby became bound to see to it that this portion of the fund should be placed in their hands, or in the hands of their lawful guardian. Regan evidently assumed to act as their guardian. Hot having lawful authority to act as such, the receipt of the fund by him did not discharge Perry from his responsibility. In equity he stood as security, to these children, that the trust thus assumed by Regan Avould be faithfully fulfilled. The money in Regan\u2019s hands was a trust fund, and as to the children of his deceased Avife he became, by the receipt of the money, a trustee. The mere fact that Regan assumed the trust, (not being lawfully authorized to do so,) did not relieve Perry from his responsibility.</p> <p id=\"b530-6\" pgmap=\"530\">It is insisted Regan was the natural guardian of his infant children, and as such had lawful right to the custody of their money. As to the control of the person of a minor, the father is guardian by nature. As to the estate of the minor, the father has no poiver, without an appointment, and in this way security is provided for the faithful performance of that trust. Perry, in permitting this fund to go into the hands of Regan, without his being appointed guardian in the proper way, could not relieve himself from ultimate responsibility.</p> <p id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531\">This, however, was a trust fund in the hands of Regan,\u2014 he actually took the money, and Perry did not derive any pecuniary benefit therefrom. Justice and equity demand that (while the rights of the children of Lucinda M. Regan should be protected,) care be taken to do no injustice between Perry and the legal representatives of Marshall H. Regan, deceased, so far as the same can be done without impairing the rights of the children. The fact that her heirs are also his heirs, interested iu the protection of his estate, enhances the necessity of this care.</p> <p id=\"b531-6\" pgmap=\"531\">In so far as concerns that part of the fund paid on account of the death of Mrs. Regan, we think the estate of Marshall H. Regan should be charged therewith, as trust funds in his hands at the time of his death, and the payment thereof to complainants, by his legal representatives, out of the assets of the estate in the class of preferred claims, should have been first ordered by the decree, and in default of such payment Perry ought to have been required by the decree to pay the same; and the decree should have, in such case, provided for the reimbursement of Perry, for such payment, out of the funds of the estate which ought to have been applied to the discharge of this claim. In other words, the decree ought to have declared the right of Perry to be subrogated to the rights of the complainants, in case of the payment to them by him of this claim; and the decree ought to have provided for the enforcement of such right. Perry had a right to claim, in this suit, this partial protection by a marshalling of the equities. This was not done, and for this reason the decree, as against appellant, must be reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to the circuit court to enter a decree in conformity to these views.</p> <p id=\"b531-7\" pgmap=\"531\">The order striking from the files the cross-bill is also set aside, and Perry should have leave (although not essential) to amend the same so as to state the relief sought more specifically.</p> <p id=\"b532-5\" pgmap=\"532\">Appellees insist, under cross-errors assigned, that Perry ought to be charged, also, with that part of the fund paid on account of the death 'of Marian Pegan. It is insisted, it matters not whether Perry had or had not a right of action vested in him for the recovery of that fund, that, having chosen to intervene in a fiduciary capacity, and by that mode of proceeding having obtained the fund for the use of the children of M. H. Pegan, it does not lie in his mouth to di-\u2018 vest himself of the responsibility incident to such attitude, by saying he had no lawful right to sue for or receipt for the money. Assuming this to be sound, we think his duty in that regard was fully performed. It seems plain, under the Indiana statute, that in case of the death of a minor, by the wrong of a railroad company, the right to recover and to receive compensation for such wrong is placed in the father of such minor, if the father be in esse. Perry, then, if chargeable for this part of the fund, was responsible that it should reach the hands of these complainants, or the hands of some one authorized by law to receive the same for them. The fund was created by the statute of Indiana. The same power which created the fund directed its payment to the father, to inure to the next of kin, under the law of descents in Illinois. The moment that part of the fund reached the hand of the father, the supposed liability of Perry ended, for Pegan was, by the Indiana statute, the true and lawful custodian of that fund.</p> <p id=\"b532-6\" pgmap=\"532\">Other exceptions are taken to other parts of these proceedings, but these are all we deem it necessary to notice.</p> <p id=\"b532-7\" pgmap=\"532\">Decree reversed.</p> <p id=\"b532-8\" pgmap=\"532\">Mr. Justice Craig, dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
