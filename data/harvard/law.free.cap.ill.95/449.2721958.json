But the release embraces \u201c all demands,\u201d which, Littleton says, is the best release to him to whom it is given, and \u201c all claims,\u201d which, Lord Coke says, is a stronger word than demand. A release of demands discharges all sorts of actions, real, personal and mixed, rights and titles, conditions before and after breach, appeals, rents of all kinds, covenants, annuities, contracts, etc. Litt. sec. 508; Co.

The prayer of the bill was for a conveyance.</p> <p id=\"b451-7\" pgmap=\"451\">The defendant pleaded the following release:</p> <p id=\"b451-8\" pgmap=\"451\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that I, Jane Thorp Peed, (boim Bradley, and sometimes called Moss,) of the city of Chicago, for and in consideration of the sum of $800, and all the furniture in the rooms lately occupied by me at No. 287 West Randolph street, Chicago, to me paid and delivered by Tom Moss, of said city of Chicago, (the receipt whereof I do hereby acknowledge,) have remised, released and forever discharged, and do hereby for myself, my heirs, executors, etc., remise, release and forever discharge the said Tom Moss, his heirs, executors and administrators, of and from all claims, debts, demands, actions and causes of action of every name and nature Avhich I hoav have, or Avhich may result from the existing state of things, from any and all acts, conduct, contracts, doings and omissions, from the beginning of the Avorld until this day.</p> <p id=\"b451-9\" pgmap=\"451\">In testimony Avhereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 16th day of January, A. D. 1877.</p> <p id=\"b451-10\" pgmap=\"451\">\u201cJane Thorp Peed.\u201d [seal.]</p> <p id=\"b451-11\" pgmap=\"451\">Complainant filed a replication traversing the plea, and upon this issue the cause was tried.</p> <p id=\"b451-12\" pgmap=\"451(28) 452(52)\">The evidence showed that complainant and defendant had lived and cohabited together, as husband and Avife, from 1871 to 1877. During that time defendant had received about $1700, a portion of which was lost, and the balance invested in the real estate in controversy in the name of defendant. In 1877 they separated, and at a settlement it was agreed defendant should pay complainant $800 and give her certain furniture, and she would execute the release, which was accordingly done.</p> <p id=\"b452-5\" pgmap=\"452\">Appellant\u2019s case is devoid of merit. The evidence clearly shows the parties intended, by the release, to make a full and complete settlement of all their transactions, including that in relation to the lots in question, and the release is sufficiently broad in its terms to include complainant\u2019s interest in the lots, and we hold does release the same.</p> <p id=\"b452-6\" pgmap=\"452\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b452-7\" pgmap=\"452\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
