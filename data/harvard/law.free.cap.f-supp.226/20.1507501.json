The Act also makes it unlawful for a passport officer with knowledge that an applicant is a member of such an organization to issue or renew a passport to such person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action of the Board in ordering the Communist Party of the United \u2022States to register as a Communist-action \u2022organization was upheld, after marathon litigation, in Communist Party of United States v.

The finality of the order brought \u00a7 6 of the Act, the passport provision, into play.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">The defendant Secretary of State has been granted the statutory authority to \u201cgrant, issue and verify passports\u201d, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 211a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and on April 12, 1962, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Copeland filed an application with the Secretary for a passport to travel to Europe. Because Copeland refused to execute what is commonly referred to as a non-Communist affidavit, which the Secretary pursuant to 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.135 (Supp.1963) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires of all applicants, the Secretary of State declined to process the application and refused to issue him a passport. The Secretary\u2019s justification for his inaction was based on the ground that the non-Communist statement \u201cis considered a matter of fact which is material to the determination of an applicant\u2019s entitlement to passport facilities.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Copeland\u2019s failure to supply a statement which the Secretary deemed to be a procedure essential to the implementation of his substantive power under the passport statute, rendered the application incomplete and no further action was taken by the Secretary. Thereupon, this suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The complaint herein challenges the constitutionality of Section 6 of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 785, and contests the defendant Secretary\u2019s substantive power to require a passport applicant to furnish information with respect to Communist Party membership. The complaint seeks the following forms of relief: a declaratory judgment that 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 785 is unconstitutional, an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing and executing the statute against plaintiff because of the statute\u2019s \u201crepugnance to the United States Constitution\u201d and an order directing the Secretary to issue a passport to plaintiff. Plaintiff subsequently moved for summary judgment, which was met, in due course, by the defendant\u2019s cross motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or, in the alternative, summary judgment. See-Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (6); 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s prayer for an injunction restraining the enforcement of a Federal statute necessitated the convening of a three-judge court since these-cross motions raised a substantial constitutional question as to whether the-Secretary\u2019s inquiry into applicant\u2019s Communist Party membership was relevant to the exercise of a valid substantive power upon which the Secretary could properly refuse to issue a passport.

In applying for a passport to travel to Europe Copeland executed the standard passport application on the most recent form required by the Secretary of State. See 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213; 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.14; 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u202251.134.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The passport application form, DSP-11 (Government Exhibit A) is in the form of a factual statement to be \u25a0signed by the applicant. It commences with \u201cI, (name of applicant), a citizen of the United States, do hereby apply to the Department of State for a passport\u201d on the first page and runs through to the signature on the second page. The application calls for answers to such routine questions as birthplace, birth date, occupation, residence, travel plans and means of transportation. At the end of the second page, after the routine questions are completed, there is a lengthy statement which must be sworn to by the applicant. The statement on the application, reproduced below,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> begins with \u201cI have not (and no other person to be included in the passport has) since acquir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ing United States citizenship been naturalized as a citizen of a foreign state, etc. * * * \u201d The statement goes on to describe activities which, if engaged in, may lead to loss of citizenship and the right to United States passport facilities, i. e., voting in a national election of a foreign state; claiming the benefits of the nationality of a foreign state; service in the armed forces of a foreign state; or oath or affirmation or formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state, etc. See Marks v. Esperdy, 315 F.2d 673 (2d Cir. 1963), cert. granted, 375 U.S. 810, 84 S.Ct. 66, 11 L.Ed.2d 47 (1963). But see Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963). The last clause of the declaration contains the following factual statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\">\u201c * * * and I am not and have not been at any time during the period of 12 full' calendar months preceding the date of this application (and no other person to be included in the passport is or has been at any time during the said period) a member of any organization registered or required to register as a Communist organization under Section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 786).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">This non-Communist affidavit was made part of the revised passport form subsequent to the Secretary\u2019s promulgation, on January 12, 1962, of revised passport regulations. Department of State Passport Reg. 22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.135-51.170 (Supp.1963); 27 Fed.Reg. 344 (1962). These regulations were promulgated pursuant to the Secretary\u2019s authority to grant and issue passports and his ancillary power to promulgate such regulations \u201cas may be necessary to carry out the functions * * * vested in [him] * * *\u201d 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151c; 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.77. See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.-135 \u2014 \u00a7 51.170 (Supp.1963). The most significant of the revised regulations, at least for the present action, is \u00a7 51.135, 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.135, which provides that a passport shall not be issued to or renewed \u201cfor any individual who the issuing officer knows or has reason to believe is a member of a Communist organization registered or required to be registered under Section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. Sec. 786).\u201d The precursor to Regulation \u00a7 51.135 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was invalidated by the Supreme Court in Kent v. Dulles, supra, which held that neither 22 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 211a, the passport statute, nor \u00a7 215 of the Immigration and Nationality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1185<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provided the Secretary with statutory authority to curtail in his discretion the free movement of citizens in order to satisfy himself about their Communist beliefs or associations. Hence, after Kent, the \u201cold\u201d \u00a7 51.135 was rendered obsolete. Since the Court stated that Communist membership or activities was not available as a standard for denying passport facilities the statutory underpinning was removed from beneath the regulations, and the regulations, consequently, could not be applied to control the foreign travel of Communist Party members.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">This statutory void was filled when \u00a7 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 785, became effective on October 20, 1961. Section 6 is an explicit grant of statutory authority to deny passports to those members of a Communist organization that is registered or ordered to register under the Act. The non-Communist affidavit\u2019s reference to 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 786 indicates the Secretary\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7 of the Act, the registration provision, as the statutory foundation for the employment of the passport provisions of the Act as well as for the promulgation of the oath which is authorized by \u00a7 51.142 of the Regulations,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The passport application instructions contain the following explicit warning on page 4 at paragraph 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">\u201cWARNING\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">\u201cSection 6 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 785) prohibits application for or use of a passport by and issuance or renewal of a passport to a member of an organization registered or required to register as a Communist organization under Section 7 of the Act. The following organizations are registered or required to register under Section 7:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">\u201cThe Communist Party of the United States of America.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Copeland filled in the application and made all the factual statements required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>by the application but one: he deleted<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the portion of' the affidavit relating to membership in an organization required to register under Section 7 of the Act. Mr. Copeland \u201cattached and made a part of\u201d his application, as required, an explanatory statement wherein he stated that his refusal to execute the non-Communist affidavit was not based on the fact that the condition of Communist Party membership applied to him but solely because a \u201cmatter of principle\u201d compelled him to remain silent. He declared the principles upon which he relied by stating that \u201cI believe that every American citizen has a natural right to travel, regardless of his political or economical views or associations, and because I believe that the restrictions on travel imposed by the McCarren [sic] Act are an unconstitutional interference with the Fifth [sic] amendment rights of freedom of speech and belief of association, and the Fifth Amendment protection of liberty.\u201d His reference to the McCarran Act was more accurately a reference to \u00a7 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 50 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 785. The Secretary, as stated above, declined to take further action on the application because he deemed it incomplete as to facts material to a determination of Copeland\u2019s qualification for passport facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Plaintiff has alleged in his complaint that Section 6 of the Act violates his First and Fifth Amendment rights, constitutes a bill of attainder, infringes his right to trial by jury and imposes cruel and unusual punishment. Only the First and Fifth Amendment claims and the bill of attainder contention were pressed in plaintiff\u2019s brief and on oral argument. No question has been raised as to whether the execution of the affidavit or the making of the explanatory statement would be violative of the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Because the Court is not unaware that. \u201c[t]he three judge procedure is an extraordinary one, imposing a heavy burden on federal courts, with attendant expenses and delay;\u201d and that it is a \u201cprocedure, designed for a specific class of cases, sharply defined, [which] should not be lightly extended,\u201d Oklahoma Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., 292 U.S. 386, 391, 54 S.Ct. 732, 734, 78 L.Ed. 1318 (1934); Osage Tribe of Indians v. Ickes, 45 F.Supp. 179 (D.C.D.C.1949), aff\u2019d. per curiam, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 114, 133 F.2d 47 (1943), the Court regards-it important to dispel, at this liminal, stage, any misgivings that leave unanswered the question whether the issues-raised by plaintiff\u2019s contentions make out an appropriate case for the resort to this; extraordinary adjudicatory procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The three judge court procedure is not to be invoked on a \u201ccontingent, constitutional question.\u201d International Ladies Garment Workers Union v. Donnelly, 304 U.S. 243, 251, 58 S.Ct. 875, 82 L.Ed. 1316 (1938); Bauer v. Acheson, 106 F.Supp. 445 (D.C.1952); McCain v. Davis, 217 F.Supp. 661 (E.D.La.1963). Adjudication by a three judge court is-improper if the first issue to be reached; is one of statutory construction even, though perhaps the construction may eventually lead to a constitutional question. Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, 369 U.S. 153, 82 S.Ct. 807, 7 L.Ed.2d 641 (1962). The three judge procedure is, however, properly invoked when an attack upon the validity of an; Act of Congress raises substantial constitutional questions concerning its validity. Jameson &amp; Co. v. Morgenthau, 307 U.S. 171, 173, 59 S.Ct. 804, 83 L.Ed. 1189 (1939); California Water Service Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Redding, 304 U.S. 252, 254-255, 58 S.Ct. 865, 82 L.Ed. 1323 (1938). The attack must be upon an Act of Congress \u201cor any part thereof,\u201d and not on Regulations or administrative action thereunder for \u201c[i]t does not appear to have been the intention of Congress that direct appeal should lie to [the Supreme Court] when administrative action and not the Act of Congress is assailed.\u201d Jameson &amp; Co. v. Morgenthau, supra, 307 U.S. at 173-174, 59 S.Ct. at 805, 83 L.Ed. 1189. The mere allegation in a complaint that an Act of Congress is under attack does not have the talismanic effect of requiring the convocation of the court. The plaintiff\u2019s claims must raise a substantial constitutional question that has not yet been passed upon by the Supreme Court. See Schneider v. Rusk, 372 U.S. 224-225, 83 S.Ct. 621, 9 L.Ed.2d 695 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The court finds that the prerequisites for the invocation of a three judge court are satisfied as the \u201cimportant constitutional questions\u201d not reached in Kent v. Dulles, supra, 357 U.S. at 130, 78 S.Ct. at 1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204, are properly at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Mr. Copeland, an American citizen, complains that his right to travel, which \u201cis part of the \u2018liberty\u2019 of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment,\u201d Kent v. Dulles, supra, 357 U.S. at 125, 78 S.Ct. at 1118, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204, has been denied him because of his refusal to divulge information concerning his beliefs and associations. The Secretary, in turn, has sought to inquire into the possibility of Copeland\u2019s Communist Party membership in order that he may properly exercise his statutory duty under \u00a7 6 to withhold passport privileges from Communist Party members. The significance of the constitutional question raised by the clash of these contentions was foreshadowed by the statement of the court in Kent v. Dulles: \u201cWe would be faced with important constitutional questions were we to hold that Congress * * * had given the Secretary authority to withhold passports to citizens because of their beliefs or associations.\u201d Id. 357 U.S. at 130, 78 S.Ct. at 1120, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204. And the manner in which the issue was framed in the dissent in Kent sets the stage for giving limited consideration here to the constitutional questions that were passed over there. In Kent the Secretary relied on his authority, under his regulations 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.142 and \u00a7 51.135 to require affidavits stating whether or not petitioners then were or ever had been members of the Communist Party, which affidavits petitioners refused to file. The dissenting opinion framed the issue as follows: \u201cThereupon the Secretary refused to further consider petitioners\u2019 applications until such time as they filed the required affidavits. <em>The Secretary\u2019s action clearly must be held authorized by Congress if the requested information is relevant to any ground upon which the Secretary might properly refuse to issue a passport.\u201d </em>Kent v. Dulles, supra 357 U.S. at 131, 78 S.Ct. at 1121, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 (Clark, J., dissenting opinion.) (emphasis supplied) The defendant Secretary\u2019s authority to require the non-Communist statement is inextricably bound up with the statutory authority under \u00a7 6 to deny passports and his authority is dependent on the validity of the statute from which his authority derives. Thus, in determining the validity of the affidavit requirement that the Secretary has promulgated pursuant to his Regulations, we are faced with deciding the validity of the underlying substantive provision, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 785 \u2014 a substantial constitutional question. See Schneider v. Rusk, supra. The decision in Flynn v. Rusk, 219 F.Supp. 709 (D.C.D.C.1963), prob. juris noted Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 84 U.S. 332 (1963), upholding the constitutionality of \u00a7 6 of the Act does not preclude this court from passing upon the question since the Supreme Court expressly reserved decision on the question in the <em>Communist Party </em>case and has not yet decided it.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">A second threshold problem, Copeland\u2019s standing to sue and the justiciability of certain of the contentions raised, must also be disposed of before this court embarks on a discussion of the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Copeland\u2019s claims. The Government has argued that Copeland does not have the standing to litigate the constitutionality of 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 785. The Government urges that he has not satisfied the requirement that a litigant who challenges the constitutionality of a statute must show \u201cthat he is within the class of persons with respect to whom the act is unconstitutional and that the alleged unconstitutional feature injures him.\u201d Heald v. District of Columbia, 259 U.S. 114, 123, 42 S.Ct. 434, 435, 66 L.Ed. 852 (1922). See McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 429-430, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). The Government correctly adumbrates certain other \u201cstanding\u201d principles that it claims have bearing on Copeland\u2019s status: that it will not suffice that Copeland has an interest undifferentiated from the \u201cmass of his fellow citizens,\u201d Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952) and that, in addition, Copeland must show a direct injury to a personal or property right that has been wrought by the challenged legislation. The Government contends that Copeland has no personal rights at stake here and that he possesses nothing more than a general interest in the vindication of his personal philosophy that political beliefs and associations may not be made the ground for denying the right to travel. The Government claims that Copeland, by not admitting membership in the class upon which the statute impinges \u2014 the Communist Party \u2014 may not assert the interest of that class, \u201can interest possessed by the people generally,\u201d Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 304, 64 S.Ct. 559, 568, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944); Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923), and not personal to Copeland. To be sure, the Government has correctly set forth the broad principles relating generally to a litigant\u2019s standing, but it has failed to apply them with precision in the factual frame of reference posed by Copeland\u2019s dilemma.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The \u201cstanding\u201d concept is but one doctrine within a broad category of judicial precedent that is concerned with the \u201cuses and non-uses of techniques of withholding ultimate constitutional adjudication.\u201d Bickel, Foreword: The Passive Virtues, The Supreme Court, 1960 Term, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 40 (1961). The power to review Congressional enactments, which is implicit in the adjudicatory function of the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts, includes, perforce, within its amplitude the awesome power to declare Acts of Congress void for repugnance to the Constitution. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 5 U.S. 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803); See Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, 92-95 (1953). But the duty to pass upon the validity of an Act of Congress is a function of such \u201cgreat gravity and delicacy\u201d Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 345, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1935) that the Court has circumscribed the exercise of this function by unyielding insistence that the jurisdiction of the federal courts be limited to actual \u201ccases and controversies.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And in cases within its jurisdiction, the Court has developed rules of construction in order to avoid passing on many of the constitutional questions pressed upon it. Id. 297 U.S. at 346, 56 S.Ct. at 482, 80 L.Ed. 688. The Court has recognized that it has jurisdiction to exercise only \u201cjudicial power,\u201d that is to say, adjudicatory power, and that its responsibility to maintain the delicate balance between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>separate branches of the Federal government is an important consideration that demands self-restraint against intrusions upon the Congress or the Executive through a zealous use of the power of judicial review. See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 151, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The constitutional limitation of Article III, \u201call Cases\u201d and \u201cControversies\u201d is, indeed, the touchstone concept of constitutional justiciability. Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346, 31 S.Ct. 250, 55 L.Ed. 246 (1911). But the constitutional limitation of Article III is not the sole restriction on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. To implement and carry forward the constitutional limitation in cases raising constitutional questions, the federal courts have submitted themselves to certain self-imposed doctrinal disciplines which the courts employ for their governance in cases within their jurisdiction. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 503, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961). These doctrines, referred to as \u201cstanding,\u201d \u201cripeness,\u201d \u201cmootness,\u201d \u201cadvisory opinions\u201d and \u201cpolitical question\u201d operate to contain the federal courts within the bounds of their constitutional limitations by preventing them from making abstract pronouncements which are not final because they are subject to revision by another branch of the Government. See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 161-156, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951); Hayburn\u2019s Case, 2 Dall. 408, 2 U.S. 408, 1 L.Ed. 436 (1792); The Correspondence of the Justices, Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, 75-77, 92-95 (1953). The operation of these doctrines seeks to insure that the adjudicatory process operates under the impact of a lively conflict between antagonistic demands, actively pressed, which make resolution of the controverted issue a practical necessity.\u201d Poe v. Ullman, supra 367 U.S. at 503, 81 S.Ct. at 1755, 6 L.Ed.2d 989. All of these factors, i. e., a fastidious regard for the constitutional limitations on the Federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction, the concern for the preservation of the judicial function, and the concern for the courts\u2019 role as arbiters in a system of government founded upon a delicate balance of powers has bent the Federal courts away from the exercise of judicial review unless the nature of the action, the injury inflicted, and the relationship of the parties presents to the court a concrete \u201ccase\u201d or real \u201ccontroversy\u201d in which the outcome is of significance to the litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">When Copeland\u2019s status is viewed in the context of these principles concerning constitutional justiciability it becomes readily apparent that his broadside assault raises a single justiciable issue pertaining to the validity of \u00a7 6 of the Act: whether \u00a7 6, upon which the validity of the affidavit requirement necessarily depends, is violative of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process prohibition against arbitrary and capricious legislative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Copeland has suffered an injury to a valuable personal right, inasmuch as his inability to obtain a passport is tantamount to a deprivation of his constitutional right to travel abroad. See Kent v. Dulles, supra 357 U.S. at 127-130, 78 S.Ct. at 1118-1121, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204; Worthy v. Herter, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 153, 270 F.2d 905, 909 (1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 918, 80 S.Ct. 255, 4 L.Ed.2d 186 (1959); Shachtman v. Dulles, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 225 F.2d 938 (1955); Bauer v. Acheson, supra.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This deprivation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of a valuable personal right results from the Secretary\u2019s refusal to process those applications in which the non-Communist oath has been deleted since information concerning Communist Party membership is considered material and relevant to the qualifications for passport facilities, under \u00a7 6 of the Act and the regulations thereunder, 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.135 and \u00a7 51.142. See Kent v. Dulles, supra 357 U.S. at 130, 131, 78 S.Ct. at 1120, 1121, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204. Thus, plaintiff has suffered a direct and palpable injury as a result of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the affidavit requirement and he has standing, therefore, to mount a limited constitutional attack against the passport statute which has served as the substantive basis for inflicting the injury. Cf. Tileston v. Ullman, 318 U.S. 44, 63 S.Ct. 493, 87 L.Ed. 603 (1943); Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915); Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, supra 341 U.S. at 151-156, 71 S.Ct. at 637-640, 95 L.Ed. 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">But the fact that an issue is ripe for adjudication does not confer upon Copeland the right to secure a judicial determination of all the questions and contentions that he has raised. An analysis of Copeland\u2019s First Amendment arguments \u2014 -viewed against the background of his refusal either to admit or deny Communist Party membership reveals that these contentions rely for their justiciability upon hypothetical factual situations that look only to future or prospective impairment of constitutional rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although these arguments are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>vigorously advanced, the issues, nevertheless, do not stand in a justiciable posture since Copeland is not the proper person to raise them. See Sedler, Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii in the Supreme Court, 71 Yale L.J. 599 (1962); But see N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958); Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1953). Copeland\u2019s noncommittal attitude vis-a-vis Communist Party membership perforce excludes him from that category of individuals who may possibly have standing because the consequences of a passport denial may impinge upon their associational rights by either deterring them from joining the Party or withdrawing from the association. It also deprives him of standing to raise the bill of attainder issue. Cf. United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 324, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 90 L.Ed. 1252 (1946). Copeland\u2019s failure to obtain a passport is not due to Communist Party membership. There is no admitted Party member before the court, at this juncture, who can assert the right of association of a Communist Party member, whether \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cinactive,\u201d knowledgable or so-called \u201cinnocent.\u201d Moreover, there is nothing in the record to warrant this court\u2019s finding that Communist Party members, not now before the court, have withdrawn or will withdraw from the Party because of the fear of \u00a7 6\u2019s passport denial sanction. And no one knows how many prospective members, if any, have been deterred from joining the Party or giving it their support in anticipation of the consequences of applying for a passport. To make these latter claims of Copeland the occasion for adjudication of the constitutional issues that he seeks to raise would require this court to deal with abstract questions and not with legal issues presented in an actual case. Cf. Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, supra, 367 U.S. at 70-81, 81 S.Ct. at 1396-1402, 6 L.Ed.2d 625; International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 37 v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 74 S.Ct. 447, 98 L.Ed. 650 (1954); United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 85-91, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Turning now to the merits of Copeland\u2019s claims, the frame of reference for his Fifth Amendment argument is the doctrine of Nebbia v. People of State of New York, 291 U.S. 502, 525, 54 S.Ct. 505, 510-511, 78 L.Ed. 940 (1934) that \u201cThe Fifth Amendment * * * do [es] not prohibit governmental regulation for the public welfare. [I] t merely condition [s] the exertion of the admitted power, by securing that the end shall be accomplished by methods consistent with due process. And the guaranty of due process, as has often been held, demands only that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that the means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained. * * * [T]he reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Copeland claims that \u00a7 6\u2019s proscription against granting passport facilities to Communist Party members is arbitrary and capricious because it imposes sanctions on persons because of their legitimate political activity. Copeland seeks to have the court accept the naive contention that the sanction of passport denial is unreasonable and arbitrary because the Communist Party fits within the traditional notions of American political parties and that the travel of its members need not be circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">But membership in the Communist Party is not akin to membership in one of our traditional political parties. The Communist Party has long since passed beyond the pale of partisan political activity, if, indeed, it ever restricted itself to such a limited goal. A comparison of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the functions of American political parties with the function of the Communist Party illustrates the difference and points up the need for the Party\u2019s regulation. Major political parties in the United States \u201care held together by rather casual acceptance of general principles, the influence of leaders, and sometimes by the cohesive power of patronage. Membership in the party carries with it little assurance that the member understands or believes in its principles and none at all that he will take orders from its leaders. * * * Membership in the Communist Party is totally different. The Party is a secret conclave. Members are admitted only upon acceptance as reliable and after indoctrination in its policies, to which the member is fully committed. * * * Moreover, each pledges unconditional obedience to party authority. * * * For any deviation from the party line they are purged and excluded.\u201d American Communications Ass\u2019n v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 431-432, 70 S.Ct. 674, 700-701, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1950) (Jackson, J., concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Membership in the Communist Party constitutes membership in a component arm of the world-wide Communist movement, which has been recognized by our Government to be an active international conspiracy; a world-wide revolutionary movement that seeks to attain a Communist totalitarian dictatorship throughout the world. See Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, supra, 367 U.S. at 36-69, 81 S.Ct. at 1379-1396, 6 L.Ed.2d 625; Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 125-134, 79 S.Ct. 1081, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115 (1959); Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1957); Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911 (1954); Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 72 S.Ct. 525, 96 L.Ed. 547 (1952); Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 71 S.Ct. 857, 95 L.Ed. 1137 (1951). Our courts have accepted the view, which was given formal expression by Congress in Section 2(i) of the Subversive Activities Control Act, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781(1), that the tenets of the Communist Party include the ultimate establishment of a totalitarian government in the United States by force and violence. Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, supra; Barenblatt v. United States, supra, 360 U.S. at 128, 79 S.Ct. at 1093-1094, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115; Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 229-254, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 6 L.Ed.2d 782 (1961). In upholding the registration of the Communist Party under \u00a7 7 of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 786, the Supreme Court sustained the finding of the Subversive Activities Control Board that the Communist Party of the United States was a Communist-action organization,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> one that is substantially directed, dominated or controlled by the Soviet Union, the foreign government that controls the world-wide Communist movement, and operates primarily to advance the objectives of that movement. The objective of this movement is to establish a totalitarian dictatorship through the use of \u201ctreachery, deceit, infiltration into other groups (governmental and otherwise), espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary, * * *\u201d 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781(1). Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, supra. The Supreme Court upheld the Board\u2019s determination and concluded, upon a review of the record before the Board, that the Communist Party unerringly and unwaveringly followed the dictates of the Soviet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Union \u201cnot by the exercise of independent judgment on the intrinsic appeal that those dictates carry, but for the reason that they emanate from that country or organization. No more apt term than domination or control could be used to describe such a relationship.\u201d Id., 367 U.S. at 39-40, 81 S.Ct. at 1380-1381, 6 L.Ed.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Thus, the nature of the activity that Congress, through the operation of \u00a7 6 seeks to regulate concerns a domestic organization that is committed to the goal of overthrowing our Government by the use of a wide variety of nefarious means. Although the members of this organization may be nominally American citizens, they are subject to the \u201ciron discipline\u201d of the foreign government that directs the Communist movement, subject to the command to take action against our Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Congress further found in Section 2(8) of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781(8), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201c[d]ue to the nature and scope of the world Communist movement, with the existence of affiliated constituent elements working toward common objectives in various countries of the world, travel of Communist members, representatives, and agents from country to country facilitates communication and is a prerequisite for the carrying on of activities to further the purposes of the Communist movement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">These Congressional findings concerning Soviet domination, direction and control of the Communist Party, and the finding that international travel is a necessary means for effectuating and advancing the goal of world domination ordinarily would be sufficient to supply the factual frame of reference within which the court could then determine whether the passport proscription of \u00a7 6 is a reasonable means to achieve a legitimate legislative end. In rendering this due process evaluation, the court is aided by the rule that the Congressional findings are binding on this court provided Congress has power over the subject matter and its findings, after extensive investigation, are not baseless. See Flynn v. Rusk, supra, 219 F.Supp. at 712-713; Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 223 F.2d 531, 565 (1954). Since Congress\u2019 findings concerning the nature of the Communist threat \u201c [are] the product of extensive investigation by Committees of Congress over more than a decade and a half. * * * [w]e certainly cannot dismiss them as unfounded or irrational imaginings.\u201d Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, supra, 367 U.S. at 94-95, 81 S.Ct. at 1409-1410, 6 L.Ed.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">But plaintiff would have the court intrude itself into the legislative fact-finding process and overturn the Congressional findings concerning the utilization of international travel by members of the Communist Party. Plaintiff points to the Modified Report of the Subversive Activities Control Board; Brownell v. Communist Party of the United States, No. 51-101, (December 18, 1956). He urges that the report contains no finding of significant travel by Communist Party members after 1936. 1936, it should be remembered, was the most recent date on which the Board found that members of the American Communist Party regularly attended Soviet schools for training and instruction in the strategy and tactics of the world Communist movement. The Board\u2019s report refers to four later instances of foreign travel. The report points up the fact that \u201ca correspondent of the Daily Worker is stationed in Moscow,\u201d and notes three post-1936 trips by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a party executive, to England and France in 1945, 1949, and 1950. From this catalogue of evidence, Copeland concludes that there is no legislative need to attempt to curtail travel by Communist Party members since the Communist goal of world domination is not sought to be effectuated through international travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>But the plaintiff\u2019s contention is insubstantial. While Copeland\u2019s arguments admit that travel was a much-resorted to method of advancing the Communist conspiracy in the recent past, it fails to demonstrate that either the movement\u2019s objectives or methods have changed to the extent that travel is no longer employed as an expedient. In fact, the converse is the truth. Travel by members of constituent Communist parties has been recognized by the admission of the Communist leaders to be a necessary measure to further the World Communist program. See Subversive Activities Control Board, Modified Report, p. 75 (1956). The coordination of the efforts of world Communism, the Communist leaders have declared, requires the continuation of regular contacts between Communist parties with a view to achieving mutual understanding, exchange of experience and voluntary coordination of activities of the Communist parties. <em>Id. </em>at 75. And the absence of contact between diverse components of the Communist conspiracy has been regarded as a hindrance to the effective coordination of Communist movements throughout the world. <em>Ibid. </em>The Board\u2019s Modified Report sufficiently demonstrates that Communist Party members took trips abroad to receive indoctrination and training on Communist strategy and policies; to teach or lecture at Communist schools; to serve the Soviet Union and the international Communist movement through the medium of Communist international organizations; to conduct official business on behalf of international Communism; to report to leaders of the Communist movement in the Soviet Union and to represent the party at international party functions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The fact that the findings of the Board enumerate only occasional examples of international travel by Communists after 1950 does not undermine the Congressional finding. For substantial evidence such as appears in the Board\u2019s report, that international travel has been a frequently used method of intercommunication in the recent past, lends support to the conclusion, in the absence of countervailing evidence, that the methods or objectives have not changed and that international travel continues at the present time to be an equally important tool of subversion. \u201cWhere the current character of an organization and the nature of its connections with others is at issue, of course past conduct is pertinent. Institutions, like other organisms, are predominantly what their past has made them. History provides the illuminating context within which the implication of present conduct may be known.\u201d Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, supra, 367 U.S. at 69, 81 S.Ct. at 1396, 6 L.Ed.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">This conclusion concerning the present use of international travel is entirely reasonable. The court cannot reject this conclusion, particularly in the absence of evidence to the contrary subsequent to the enactment of the 1950 Act, \u2014 which itself was pinioned on findings developed after extensive investigation by Congress \u2022 \u2014 \u2019that the \u201cleopard\u201d of international Communism has changed its spots. See Flynn v. Rusk, supra, 219 F.Supp. at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">In 1948 a House committee reporting on a predecessor bill, H.R. 5852, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., determined that legislation was necessary to \u201c * * * cut the threads which bind the international communist conspiracy together by restricting travel of members of the American section of the World Communist Movement.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.1844, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1948). The same compelling necessity for similar restrictive legislation was voiced in the debates which preceded the enactment of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 781 et seq. 94 Cong.Rec. 5850, 5851 (1950). See also H.R.Rep.No.2980, 81,st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Cong., 2d Sess. 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. p. 8886 (August 20, 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Nor can the court ignore the facts of life concerning the <em>perfervidum ingenium, </em>of the world Communist movement. Rather than present a picture of changed conditions, the recent activities of the international Communist conspiracy dictated by the Soviet Union illustrate that the Congressional findings obtain with equal force and validity today. \u201cThe present is a period of great international tension in which the principal threat derives from the international Communist conspiracy, including its domestic manifestations in the Communist Party of the United States of America. The continuing uneasy truce between the two opposed systems is called, in the absence of actual hostilities, a cold war. The fact of the cold war cannot be forgotten. It is real, it is intense, and it is dangerous.\u201d Report of the Special Committee to Study Passport Procedures of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Freedom to Travel, 41-42 (1958). Recent evidence concerning the continuation, if not intensification of Soviet espionage activity in this country, as well as throughout the world, is ample proof that Congressional concern over the spread of the Communist menace through international travel is hardly a tilt against imaginary windmills.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See Abel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Thus, our Government is faced, in reality, with defending our country against an external enemy that has formed within our borders, a closely knit organization whose members willingly submit to its \u201ciron discipline\u201d to further the Communist conspiracy. Travel abroad by members of this tightly disciplined subversive movement is obviously a facile method of communication between Communists in this country and the Communist policymakers and their agents in the Soviet Union and its satellites. Travel becomes such a prized method of communication because the facts concerning each citizen\u2019s travel intentions are by their very nature inherently subjective and flexible. To be sure, the domestic operation of this international conspiracy is combatted by the criminal processes under the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2385, but we find no difficulty in accepting the Congressional conclusion that the criminal sanction is singularly ineffective for dealing with the <em>external </em>operation of the international conspiracy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Once the bird has flown, or once a Communist with a passport has left the country, he is unhampered in his movements and is relatively free to act in a manner inimical to the interests of our country. And \u201c [i] f an avowed Communist is going abroad, it may be assumed that he will take counsel there with his fellows, will arrange for the steady and dependable flow of cash and information, and do his bit to promote the purposes of the conspiracy.\u201d Jaffe, The Right to Travel: The Passport Problem, 35 Foreign Affairs 17, 26 (1956). Cf. The Supreme Court, 1960 Term, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 110. Certainly Congress has the power to grant the Secretary the authority to prevent possible action that can result from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>allowing this potentially destructive form of communication to remain unrestricted. Section 6 attempts to do just that by inhibiting organizational communication among the constituent elements of the world Communist movement, thereby reducing the opportunity for personal contacts. In Congress\u2019 considered judgment the denial of passports to present or recent members of the Party may render the world Communist movement less effective. And hopefully, foreign training, foreign assignments and foreign activity on behalf of the world Communist movement thus would be similarly stymied. Section 6 is limited in its application to present members of the Communist movement \u2014 to individuals during the period of their participation in Party activity and during the period which they are subject to its discipline. The narrow restriction interdicts only those who are instruments of the international Communist movement while they so act. The means chosen by Congress provides a specific remedy to meet the evil, a \u201cremedy [that] bears a reasonable relation to the evil that the statute was designed to reach.\u201d American Communications Ass\u2019n v. Douds, supra, 339 U.S. at 390-391, 70 S.Ct. at 679-680, 94 L.Ed. 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Restrictions on the activities of Communist Party members or adherents are hardly novel prophylactic measures. See Beilan v. Board of Public Education, 357 U.S. 399, 78 S.Ct. 1317, 2 L.Ed.2d 1414 (1958); Lerner v. Casey, 357 U.S. 468, 78 S.Ct. 1311, 2 L.Ed.2d 1423 (1958); Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485, 72 S.Ct. 380, 96 L.Ed. 517 (1952); Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716, 71 S.Ct. 909, 95 L.Ed. 1317 (1951) (restrictions on holding of public employment by Party members); Ger-ende v. Board of Supervisors, 341 U.S. 56, 71 S.Ct. 565, 95 L.Ed. 745 (1951) (requiring loyalty oath as a precondition to having one\u2019s name on public ballot). Plaintiff urges that the court should depart from the rationale of these cases because of a significant distinction between the Governmental interest in regulating public employment and public activities and a supposed less compelling Governmental interest in restricting the exercise of a personal right \u2014 the right to travel. The court is not unaware of this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The court does not equate the considerations involved in deciding whether, on balance, the right to travel must be curbed with the considerations involved in determining whether the Government is required to grant employment or a place on the public ballot to persons whose Communist membership would render them suspect of violating the public trust. The court does not seek to upgrade or downgrade the right to travel and does not assign to it a particular position in the hierarchy, if there be such, of individual rights and liberties. Assuredly, the right to travel is a significant right. But important as it is, the right to travel is no more important than the First Amendment\u2019s rights of free speech, association, press and assembly which have often been referred to as occupying a \u201cpre-eminent\u201d position in our society. Yet even these First Amendment liberties, considered so basic to the foundation of our free society, are not absolute and have yielded when the public necessity and common good outbalanced the abridgement to the protected right. See Bickel, Foreword, The Passive Virtues, supra at 41; But see Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 865, 867 (1960). The right to travel may similarly yield to a passport restriction which bears a reasonable relation to the danger of permitting unrestricted international travel by members of the Communist conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Relying on the dissent in Briehl v. Dulles, supra, 248 F.2d at 587, Copeland points to the availability of several criminal statutes which he claims are \u201calternative remedies designed to reach the conduct forbidden here. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because these statutes require proof of criminal conduct and provide trial by jury, Copeland asserts that the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>impose \u201cmore moderate controls\u201d than the \u00a7 6 sanction of passport denial. And the availability of \u201cmore moderate controls,\u201d he continues, must be considered when the court strikes the Due Process balance and arrives at a judgment as to whether the remedy bears a reasonable relation to the evil that the statute was designed to reach. See Dennis v. United States, supra, 341 U.S. at 524, 71 S.Ct. at 874-875, 95 L.Ed. 1137 (Frankfurter, J., concurring opinion) quoting Freund, On Understanding the Supreme Court, pp. 27-28. In conclusion, he urges that when the availability of these so-called alternatives is weighed in the balance, the necessity for \u00a7 6 is not apparent and \u00a7 6 must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\">But assuming <em>arguendo </em>that these criminal statutes are \u201cmore moderate alternatives,\u201d it does not follow that they are equal to the task of meeting the special exigencies involved in the control of subversive activities. To be sure, the Government can always punish proscribed conduct after it has occurred. But the crucial distinction that Copeland fails to recognize is that these post-facto criminal remedies, which punish subversion, do not meet the special problem posed in preventing it. When the Government after extensive investigation, as here, finds that an identifiable class of persons is pledged to subvert its institutions, the public welfare requires that the Government not stand by in the hope that penal statutes may possibly deter acts of subversion by members of the class that are most likely to commit them. For once the members of the Communist conspiracy are unleashed to perform their insidious mission, the criminal prosecution of the Communist individual may be only a hollow victory when measured against the grave injury that the subversion may have caused to the public security. To attempt to use a penal statute as a substitute for a regulatory statute ignores an essential difference. A regulatory statute is calculated to remedy an evil by imposing controls gauged to prevent acts which may be inimical to the interests of the United States, as opposed to a penal statute which is keyed to a <em>fait accompli </em>of proscribed conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Still, in the Fifth Amendment Due Process context plaintiff claims that \u00a7 6 enacts a presumption of scienter and applies to all members of the Communist Party, whether or not they have knowledge concerning the illegal purposes which have been imputed to the Party by Congress. Therefore, Copeland asserts that innocent members of the Party necessarily must be denied passports without reference to the quality of their activity and knowledge. But this question, also, is not ripe for consideration at this juncture for the plaintiff has failed to make any claim whatsoever concerning his membership in the Party. Even had Mr. Copeland stated that he was an \u201cinactive and innocent\u201d member of the Party, the scienter question would not be ripe for consideration. Before the scienter question could be considered ripe and therefore justiciable, Copeland would have to demonstrate a disclosure of present membership in the Party, a tentative denial of a passport, and proof at a hearing held pursuant to the regulations<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that his membership was \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cinnocent\u201d culminated by a showing of Communist Party membership. But at this stage, absent any admission or allegation concerning his political affiliation, he does not have the standing to raise the question of whether the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause permits the denial of a passport to a hypothetical person \u2014 a so-called \u201cinnocent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>or \"passive\u201d member of the Communist Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The court is also not called upon to decide, and therefore does not, the full scope of the Secretary\u2019s constitutional power to curtail travel of Communist Party members. The court, however, is not unaware that in criminal prosecutions under the membership clause<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> of the Smith Act the Supreme Court has required a showing that the Communist be an \u201cactive member,\u201d possessing a specific intent to bring about the organization\u2019s criminal ends. See Scales v. United States, supra. But the question of whether the Secretary\u2019s substantive power to withhold passports is to be similarly limited to \u201cactive\u201d members is not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Thus we come, finally, to the narrowest issue posed in this case: Whether present membership in the Communist Party is a valid subject of inquiry which can be made a prerequisite to the issuance of a passport. Or, stated another way, the crucial question is whether the Secretary of State may decline to issue a passport to one who refuses to admit or deny that he is a member of the Communist Party. We think that the Secretary may make such an inquiry and may condition the issuance of a passport on the requirement that the information be supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Section 6 of the Act is an unequivocal declaration of Congressional intent that passports should be denied to Communist members. The affidavit requirement does no more than seek to obtain relevant information so that the Secretary may carry out the Congressional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Copeland seeks to exercise a right for which certain eligibility requirements have been promulgated but has declined to execute the affidavit which would supply material information. The Secretary, unlike the situation in the first Konigsberg case, Konigsberg v. State Bar, 353 U.S. 252, 77 S.Ct. 722, 1 L.Ed.2d 810 (1957) does not seek to draw any adverse inference from Copeland\u2019s failure to execute the affidavit or, for that matter, any inference at all. All that the Secretary is asserting is his right to have certain information which is relevant to the exercise of a valid authority. The court sees no reason why the Secretary, who is charged with the duty of passing upon the eligibility of passport applicants, must be forced to act in spite of the fact that he has not received answers to relevant questions which seek to elicit information necessary for a responsible decision. See Briehl v. Dulles, supra, 248 F.2d at 577-578 (concurring opinion). The defendant Secretary has a duty to thwart the commission of an illegal act by a Communist Party member who applies for a passport. Moreover, in view of \u00a7 6\u2019s prohibition against the issuance of a passport to a present member of the Communist Party, the defendant certainly has the right to determine whether his own conduct in issuing the passport is lawful. A governmental agency charged with the responsibility for determining the eligibility of an applicant has the authority to seek pertinent information with respect to such eligibility.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Blumenthal v.

Accord Konigsberg v. State Bar, 366 U.S. 36, 81 S.Ct. 997, 6 L.Ed.2d 105 (1961). (License to practice law.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">And as a last obstacle to the Secretary\u2019s authority to condition the issuance of a passport upon the execution of the non-Communist affidavit, plaintiff has pointed to Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). In Speiser, veterans refused to sign a loyalty oath required by the California constitution and laws as a condition precedent to the enjoyment of a veteran\u2019s property tax exemption. The Supreme Court assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the State could deny tax exemptions on the basis of a person\u2019s political beliefs. Id., 357 U.S. at 529, 78 S.Ct. at 1343-1344, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460. Nevertheless, the Court held that the statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the oath requirement placed the burden of proof on the applicant to prove his loyalty before the applicant-taxpayer could benefit by the tax exemption. The Court distinguished the cases such as Douds, since it found that the non-Communist oath in Douds was not directed at penalizing political beliefs but was promulgated to protect the public from the harm that might ensue from permitting potentially dangerous persons from occupying positions of public trust, i. e., labor union office. But the oath in Speiser, the Court concluded, could not be so substantiated, for it dealt directly with speech and the expression of political ideas and its primary purpose was not aimed at the prevention of public injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The plaintiff would have us believe that Speiser v. Randall strikes at the heart of the affidavit requirement and renders it invalid. But the rationale of Speiser is inapplicable to the non-Communist oath in the case at bar. First, it is apparent that the Government has not placed upon the applicant the burden of proving that he is not presently a member of the Communist Party. All that the oath presently requires is the applicant\u2019s cooperation in supplying to the Secretary a statement concerning his Communist membership. Copeland has failed to secure a passport because he has frustrated the operation of one of the Secretary\u2019s functions by withholding a material fact. The Secretary\u2019s refusal to process an incomplete application presupposes that the Secretary, rather than Copeland, has the burden of proving his Communist Party membership in the event that such a status is contested. In fact, the elaborate administrative regulations which provide for notice, hearing, and appeals from the denial of a passport make it clear that the Secretary has the burden of proof.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The \u201cburden of proof\u201d aspect of the Speiser ease carries no weight here.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Secondly, it is evident that like Douds, but unlike Speiser, the principal aim of the Subversive Activities Control Act and of the affidavit which seeks to implement it, is to insulate the public from the danger of the Communist menace. The Subversive Activities Control Act is a regulatory statute which, like the legislation under attack in Douds, aims at a grave evil, the\u00abgravity of which justifies a limited infringement on a person\u2019s political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">But its main objective, as well as its overriding effect, does not strike at pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>itical beliefs as such but remedies a condition that constitutes a danger to the public order. The Speiser case does not point up any infirmity in the affidavit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In sum, then, we hold that \u00a7 6 is a valid legislative basis for executive action and that the Secretary may implement his authority thereunder by requesting information, through the medium of the non-Communist affidavit, which is pertinent to the exercise of that authority. See Mayer v. Rusk, supra. We conclude that the Secretary was correct in declining to process the passport application for the reason that Copeland refused to execute the non-Communist oath which the Secretary has promulgated. Accordingly the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied. Plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive and declaratory relief is likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-5\">. \u201c\u00a7 785. <em>Denial of passports to members of Communist organizations</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAY\">\u201c(a) When a Communist organization as defined in paragraph (5) of section 782 of this title is registered, or there is in effect a final order of the Board requiring such organization to register, it shall be unlawful for any member of such organization, with knowledge or notice that such organization is so registered or that such order has become final \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">\u201c(1) to make application for a passport, or the renewal of a passport, to be issued or renewed by or under the authority of the United States; or \u201c(2) to use or attempt to use any such passport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201c(b) When an organization is registered, or there is in effect a final order \u25a0of the Board requiring an organization \u25a0to register, as a Communist-action organization, it shall be unlawful for any \u25a0officer or employee of the United States to issue a passport to, or renew the passport of, any individual knowing or having reason to believe that such individual is a member of such organization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">The regulatory portion of this statute is supplemented by the penalty provisions of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 794.

On November 22,1950, the Attorney General petitioned the Subversive Activities \u25a0Control Board for an order to require that the Communist Party register as a Communist-action organization. The order of the Board did not become final until October 20, 1961, after the decision in the Communist Party case, supra (June 5, 1961). In the intervening years the hearings on the Attorney General\u2019s petition and on the registration provisions involved the courts in the following decisions: Communist Party of United States of America v. McGrath, 96 F.Supp. 47 (D.C.1951); (three judge court); Communist Party of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 223 F.2d 531 (1954); 351 U.S. 115, 76 S.Ct. 663, 100 L.Ed. 1003 (1956); 102 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 254 F.2d 314 (1958); 107 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 277 F.2d 78 (1959).

On September 26, 1963, the plaintiff filed an affidavit explaining the reasons for his failure to execute the non-Communist affidavit. Copeland\u2019s affidavit was prompted by the Government\u2019s contention that Copeland\u2019s failure to execute the oath could be best explained by the fact that he was not a Communist Party member and simply refused to be interrogated as to his beliefs: Copeland stated in his affidavit: \u201cThe latter [defendant\u2019s attorneys] have suggested that I intended by my supplementary statement to say that I was not a member of a group required to register as a Communist organization under the * * * Act. I did not intend to say any such thing. I refuse to state my political opinions or my organizational connections for the purpose of obtaining a passport. And I believe that any ruling that requires me to do so is an unjust restriction of my right to travel * * *. But my crossing out of the relevant sentences on the application form was not motivated by my possible membership in such organization. It was motivated by my conviction that the State Department has no power to make the inquiry as a condition to my exercise of my right to travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-19\">Despite this noncommittal attitude, Copeland has advanced the following First Amendment contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-20\">(a) that \u00a7 6 denies an individual of his right to travel because of his asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ciation with an organization which engages in advocacy, (p. 6),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">(b) because \u00a7 6 acts as a discouragement of association, (p. 7),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">(c) and because it applies to \u201cinactive members\u201d, (p. 10),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">(d) and because of its application to persons who do not know or believe in the illegal purposes of the Party.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\">. 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 782(3) (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201c(3) The term \u2018Communist-action organization\u2019 means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201c(a) any organization in the United States (other than a diplomatic representative or mission of a foreign government accredited as such by the Department of State) which (i) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 781 of this title, and (ii) operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement as referred to in said section; * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b88-4\">.
