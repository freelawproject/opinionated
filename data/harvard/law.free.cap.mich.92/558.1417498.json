Thus far, however, most of the American courts seem unwilling to follow the example of the recent English decisions, and decline to extend the jurisdiction so as to restrain such torts as libels on business, slanders of title, and the like. In Massachusetts the English decisions are expressly repudiated. <em>Boston Diatite Co. v. Manufacturing Co., </em>114 Mass. 69; <em>Whitehead v. Kitson, </em>119 Id. 484. Injunctions to restrain libelous publications concerning plaintiff\u2019s business were also refused in <em>Association v. Boogher, </em>3 Mo. App. 173; <em>Mauger </em>v. <em>Dick, </em>55 How. Pr. 132; and <em>Singer Manfg. Co. v. Domestic Sew. Mach. Co., </em>49 Ga. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In the case of <em>Emack v. Kane, </em>34 Fed. Rep. 46, Judge Blodgett allowed the injunction. It appeared that Kane issued and widely distributed circulars in which he claimed that Emack\u2019s goods infringed his patent. He stated that he should not sue Emack, but should bring suits against all customers of Emack, and collect royalty and damages from all of them. Judge Blodgett said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201cThe <em>gravamen </em>of this case is the attempted intimidation by the defendant of complainant\u2019s customers by threatening them with suits which defendant did not intend to prosecute. * * * If a .court of equity cannot restrain an attack like this upon a man\u2019s business, then the party is certainly remediless, because an action at law in most cases would do no good, and ruin would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>accomplished before an adjudication could be reached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In the recent case of <em>Casey v. Typographical Union, </em>45 Fed. Rep. 135, the case of <em>Emack v. Kane, supra, </em>was cited and approved by Judge Sage. <em>It </em>appeared in the \u2018Casey case that parties had conspired together to injure the complainant in his business. Circulars were gotten out and widely distributed, containing threats of pecuniary loss and injury to those who should do business with the complainant. The claim was made in that case, as in this, that equity had no jurisdiction, because the injurious publication was merely a libel on complainant\u2019s business, and, for any loss which the union inflicted, he had a plain and adequate remedy at law. Judge Sage remarked, however, that it is idle to say that such publications are nothing more than libels, and that the only remedy for the injury inflicted is an action at law; that, while they have certain characteristics of libels, they are more than libels, and there is no plain and adequate remedy at law for such injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We think the bill in this case states a case materially different from the Massachusetts cases and the other cases holding that equity has no jurisdiction to restrain a libel. Here it is claimed and alleged in the bill that Elijah Haney and the Haney School Furniture Company entered into a conspiracy with defendant Bullard to obtain a decree in favor of Haney and against Bullard, which might and should be used by the conspirators to injure the complainant. The fact is recited that, in pursuance of such conspiracy, a bill was filed in the Hnited States court for the eastern district of Michigan, and a decree obtained by fraud and collusion, for the purpose of benefiting the trade of the Haney School Furniture Company at the expense of complainant; that the defendants well knew the patent was invalid, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>that the complainant was in possession of facts and pro.ofs sufficient to defeat any suit that might be brought for the infringement of said patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The prayer of the bill is, not that defendants be enjoined from making whatever claims they see fit concerning their patent, nor from threatening to bring suits, even though such threats be made in bad faith; but that the defendants be restrained from using a decree, fraudulently and collectively obtained, to the injury of complainant, and from claiming that such decree is an adjudication upon the merits as to the validity of such patent, or from using it in any way or form to influence or threaten any person or party against purchasing the school furniture manufactured and sold by complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The case, as stated in the bill, is certainly more than a mere claim for an injunction arising out .of a libel of complainant's<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> business. A conspiracy is claimed to have been entered into between the defendants for the very purpose of injuring the complainant, and that by such conspiracy a false and fraudulent decree was obtained, settling the rights of the Haney School Furniture Company to the patent under which the complainant was and is operating; that the defendants were publishing to the world, and especially to the customers of the complainant, that such decree was valid, the defendants well knowing it to be false and fraudulent, and that, in any court where the complainant had the right to appear and be heard, it could establish the fact that such patent was absolutely void, and that Mr. Haney and the Haney School Furniture Company had no rights under it, and that complainant was legally entitled to its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Admitting that the weight of authority in this country is against the proposition that a court of equity has jurisdiction by injunction to restrain the publication of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>libel upon one\u2019s business, it is no answer to the questions here raised. The complainant has no adequate remedy at law, under the circumstances here stated. It cannot be said that it should lie by and wait the slow and uncertain processes of a suit for damages for its redress. Under the charge in the bill, which we must take as true, the complainant is rightfully operating under such patent, and it has no remedy adequate for the fraud and wrong perpetrated upon it, except as aided by a court of equity. The facts stated make a much stronger case than those in <em>Casey v. Typographical Union, supra, </em>calling for the aid of the injunctive power of a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The decree of the court below must be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled. The defendants will have 20 days to answer the bill.</p>\n<judges id=\"b612-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\"> Act No. 229, Laws of 1887.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
