Where in a negligence case to recover for injuries received by being thrown from a horse-car, while attempting to alight, by the sudden starting of the car, the testimony tends to show that the plaintiff had reached a point where it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>difficult to turn back before the bell was rung as a signal for starting (she being about to put her foot upon the step, which was a board running along the side of the car), and that the car started at that very instant, the plaintiff cannot be held guilty of negligence in continuing her descent from the oar.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-4\">2.

This case does not come within the rule formulated in <em>Werbowlsky v. Railway Co., </em>86 Mich. 236, 239, or in <em>Britton v. Railway Co., </em>90 Id. 159, namely, that, \u201cwhen a str.eet-car is stopped for the purpose of allowing a passenger to get on or off, the stoppage must be for a sufficient interval to allow the passenger to get on or off in safety,\u201d or, in other words, that the purpose for which the car is stopped must be fulfilled. \u2022 The evidence shows that this was done in this case, the car having stopped for the purpose of allowing passengers to get on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-17\">2. It wap error to allow a witness who was a mere visitor, and who dropped in from time to time for 11 months after the accident, to make general statements as to the plaintiff\u2019s story of her injuries, when it was not shown whether such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>story was narrated at the <em>post </em>or <em>ante litem motam </em>visits (the court record shows the suit was begun in November, 1890), or what the attendant circumstances were. While exclamations of pain are admissible (1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 103; <em>Elliott v. Van Buren, </em>33 Mich. 49; <em>Reed v. Railroad Co., </em>44 N. Y. 574), and in some cases statements of present pain are admitted <em>(Railroad Co. v. Huntley, </em>38 Mich. 543), the law does not permit a person who has been injured to call in her neighbors at various times for a period of 11 months after the injury, and retail her sufferings to them; citing <em>Dundas v. Lansing, </em>75 Mich. 499; <em>Merkle v. Bennington Tp., </em>58 Id. 163; <em>Jones v. Village of Portland, </em>88 Id. 598.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-4\"><em>'William, Stacey, </em>for plaintiff, contended for the doctrine of the opinion.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-5\">Montgomery, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALEX\">This suit is brought to recover for injuries received by the plaintiff while attempting to alight from one of the defendant\u2019s horse-cars. The defendant asked that the jury be instructed that the plaintiff had not made a case by her testimony, and the refusal to give this instruction is the principal ground relied on for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The plaintiff testified that on the 11th of August, 1890, she left Dr. Brodie\u2019s house* where she had been at work during the day, and stopped and purchased some groceries, which she carried in a basket; that she got aboard the car in question, and the moment she put her basket down she noticed that there was a strange conductor on the car; that she told him that she wanted to get off, as she was on the wrong car; that he laughed at her, and she turned back, and took her basket on her arm, and took hold of the post at the side of the car to get down easy; that she took hold of the post because she did not want to fall, \u2014 took care of herself not to fall; that as she was going to put her foot on the step the bell was rung, and she fell and broke her arm. The car was an open one, and the step was a board running along its side'.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>On cross-examination she testified that she stood beside the post, and took hold of it with her right hand, holding the basket in her left hand, expecting to hold onto the post until she got down, when she thought she would let go; so the effect of getting down with her right hand holding the post would be to have her face turned towards the rear of the car. The conductor started the car before she got her foot on the ground. He rang the bell before she got her foot on the board, \u2014 before she started to get down.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Don't you know, Mrs. Lacas, that the car does not start instantly after the bell is rung?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Right instantly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The minute you ring they start right off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Don't it take some little time, \u2014 isn't there time enough for a person standing on the steps of a car when the bell rings, for that person to get down before it gets in motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>.But I was not on the step yet. ' * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Your testimony seems to be that the instant the bell rang you were thrown down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No; the time the bell rang I started to put my foot on the board; he started it himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Where were you when the bell rang?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I was taking my basket, and getting ready to get down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-14\">\u201cQ. You were in the car when the bell rang?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; of course I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-16\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>When he started up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir; I was taking hold of the post, and was getting ready to get down, and the minute I put my foot on the board the car started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-18\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>But the bell rang before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-19\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir; of course it would not go without they rang the bell.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-20\">And on redirect examination she was asked:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-21\">\u201cQ. Will you explain to the. jury just your position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-22\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I came into the car; this is the place; I came in here; this is Monroe avenue; and I put my basket down here. I said to the conductor, T am in the wrong car.' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>I turned this way, and took my basket, and was just putting my foot down. I had my foot on the platform, I had my foot just going to put it on the board. I didn't touch the board before he started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Your foot was just coming down to that board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What happened when your foot was in that position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He started the car, and it threw me off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Where were you when the bell rang?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I was right on the edge of the car to get off. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>How long a time elapsed between the time the bell rang and you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It was a pretty short time. I turned back to take my basket, and tried to get down. At the time he saw me touch the post to get down he rang the bell.''</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">1. We think the testimony was sufficient to justify the circuit judge in submitting the case to the jury. The testimony tended to show that the plaintiff had reached a point where it would be difficult to turn back before the bell was rung, and the car started at the very instant she was acting. Under these circumstances, it cannot be held that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in continuing her descent from the car. <em>Railroad Co. v. Crunk, </em>119 Ind. 548 (81 N. E. Rep. 31); <em>Railroad Co. v. Coulbourn, </em>69 Md. 360 (16 Atl. Rep. 808); <em>Wyatt v. Railway Co., </em>55 Mo. 485; <em>Strand v. Railway Co., </em>64 Mich. 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">2. The testimony of statements of present sufferings made by the plaintiff' to the witness Verd\u00f3n were competent. The court took due care to exclude relations of past sufferings, and kept within the rule. <em>Johnson v. McKee, </em>27 Mich. 471; <em>Elliott v. Van Buren, </em>33 Id. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">3. The plaintiff is a married woman, and was permitted to recover the expenses of her sickness incurred by aud charged to her, but not paid at the time of the trial. It appeared that credit had been extended to her solely. Under these circumstances, she became liable to pay for the services. <em>Meads v. Martin, </em>84 Mich. 306; <em>Hirshfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>v. Waldron, </em>83 Id. 116. The expenses having been incurred on her own account, it is, of course, immaterial that the bill had not been actually paid when suit was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">4. The defendant in oral argument also insisted that the court erred in permitting a recovery by plaintiff for the loss resulting from her inability to earn money, -on the ground that her husband was entitled to her services, and was the proper party to maintain the action. \"We cannot, however, consider this question upon this record. The defendant does not make the point in its brief. The only point made in the brief relating to the subject of damages is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cThe question is whether necessary expenses incurred by and charged to a wife, but not paid by her, are proper elements of damage here.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">This point we have considered above, and we cannot, under Eule 59 of this Court, pass upon points not made in the brief of counsel, even though additional errors may be assigned. <em>Black v. Dawson, </em>82 Mich. 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">5. The only additional question raised in the brief of counsel relates to an alleged error in permitting a physician to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>\"Would a violent fall from a street-car cause that displacement of the womb which you discovered ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I think it would, perhaps; when a lady jumps out of a wagon, alighting heavily on a pavement, a solid woman, it will displace the womb.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The witness had previously testified that the plaintiff was suffering from a displacement of the womb. The testimony given in answer to the above-quoted question was proper, as showing the character of the cause which might have produced the injury. The question did not, as was the case in <em>Jones v. Village of Portland, </em>88 Mich. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>598, call for the opinion of the witness on the whole case. The extent to which the ruling went was to permit a doctor to state whether a cause which it was alleged existed would, in his opinion as a medical man, be sufficient to produce a condition which it was claimed resulted from this cause. The question is ruled by <em>Fay v. </em>Swan, 44 Mich. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
