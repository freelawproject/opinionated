Mother and father lived with father's mother, defendant Deborah Brickhouse (Chatham) (\"grandmother\"), after D.L.B.'s birth. Mother, who has a learning disability, communication difficulties, and \"a bit of a speech impediment,\" asserted that grandmother \"took over the role of mother\" to D.L.B. after she was born and \"would not allow [mother] to assist with feeding or caring for the baby.\" On 19 December 1998, mother and father ended their relationship and mother moved out of grandmother's house. Mother did not take D.L.B. with her. After she moved out of grandmother's residence, mother asserted that grandmother would \"not allow [her] to have any contact at all with the minor child.\" Mother filed a complaint with the Johnston County District Court on 13 January 1999 seeking custody of and support for D.L.B. On 11 October 1999, the district court entered an agreement between the parties granting mother visitation with D.L.B. at grandmother's house during specified days and times. Although visitation was ordered to occur at grandmother's house, neither child support nor permanent custody were addressed in the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 14 April 2000, mother moved the court to increase visitation with D.L.B. in part because father had moved out of grandmother's house and was \"no longer residing with the minor child.\" The court granted mother's motion on 11 May 2000. On 16 August 2000, mother moved the court to increase visitation again to include Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, and Mother's Day. On 3 October 2000, the court granted \"some day visitation\" with D.L.B. on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. On 12 April 2001, mother filed a motion to relocate the site of exchange for visitation from grandmother's house to the Benson Police Department due to \"a violent altercation\" between grandmother and D.L.B.'s maternal grandmother. Mother alleged she and her own mother were \"in fear for their safety.\" On 25 July 2003, mother's motion was involuntarily dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(b) for mother's failure to appear at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 21 September 2003, mother moved the court for increased visitation and prayed that the site of exchange be moved to a public place. In this motion, mother alleged in part that grandmother relocated with D.L.B. without notifying mother of their new address or phone number and \"deliberately kept the minor child from [her].\" On 14 October 2003, grandmother moved to terminate mother's visitation with D.L.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 15 January 2004, the district court entered a Custody and Visitation Order in which it found that mother \"neglected to exercise her visitations for a period of at least two years.\" However, the court also found that this two-year \"absence\" occurred during the time when mother could not locate grandmother after she (grandmother) relocated with D.L.B. The court found that, while mother \"did make some efforts to locate [grandmother,] ... these efforts were minimal based upon the lack of visitation over the past two years with a vast number of alternatives available to have remedied this problem before two years have past [sic].\" The court did not make a specific finding regarding mother's fitness as a parent, but instead concluded that \"[t]he best interest of [D.L.B.] would be served\" by awarding custody to grandmother, \"would not be served\" by allowing visitation with mother, and concluded that grandmother was \"a fit and proper person to maintain the custody, care and control of the minor child.\" The court awarded custody of D.L.B. to grandmother and ordered that mother not have \"any form of visitation or contact with the minor child.\" Mother did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   appeal from this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 17 March 2005, mother moved to gain custody of D.L.B. due to a material and substantial change in circumstances, and moved the court to appoint a guardian ad litem for D.L.B. Mother's motion to appoint a guardian ad litem was granted on 5 May 2005. On 16 January 2007, District Court Judge Jimmy L. Love, Jr. entered an order denying mother's motion for custody and dismissing the matter with prejudice. In that order, the court found that \"[t]here is evidence from which this Court can find [mother] has experienced substantial circumstantial changes in her own personal life and environment[,] however there is no evidence put forth to show effect on the child whether positive or negative.\" On 24 January 2007, mother filed her notice of appeal to this Court from the order entered 16 January 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mother first contends that, in its 15 January 2004 order, the trial court erred by awarding custody to grandmother over mother without first finding that mother was unfit.

Love, Jr., District Court Judge Presiding at the December 22, 2006 Session of the District Court of Johnston County, and filed with the Johnston County District Court on January 16, 2007.\" The Notice of Appeal made no reference to the order entered by the district court on 15 January 2004 in which mother's grant of visitation with D.L.B. was terminated and custody was awarded to grandmother. The record indicates that, rather than file a timely notice of appeal to this Court from the 15 January 2004 order, mother instead sought to gain custody of D.L.B. by filing a motion to\n   <em>\n    modify\n   </em>\n   the 15 January 2004 order based on a material and substantial change in circumstances. However, in her Assignments of Error 1 and 3 in the record before this Court, mother attempts to direct our attention to errors arising out of the 15 January 2004 order. In other words, mother asks this Court to review errors she contends arise out of an order\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   included in the Notice of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Applying the principle stated in\n   <em>\n    Von Ramm\n   </em>\n   to the present case, we conclude that a \"[n]otice of appeal from denial of a motion to ... [modify] a judgment which\n   <em>\n    does not also specifically appeal the underlying judgment\n   </em>\n   does not properly present the underlying judgment for our review.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20S.E.2d%20422\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, we must dismiss these assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mother next contends that the trial court erred by applying the \"substantial change in circumstances\" standard when denying\n   her motion to modify custody because mother was never deemed \"unfit\" in the order that awarded custody to grandmother.

Following an audiological evaluation with an ear, nose, and throat specialist, D.L.B.'s adenoids and tonsils were removed in April 2003 to correct her diagnosed hypernasality, and speech therapy was added to her individualized education program. D.L.B.'s progress on a variety of developmental goals was evaluated on 12 February, 31 March, 26 May, and 9 September 2003, and D.L.B. was reported to have moved from \"No progress made\" to \"Little progress made\" to \"Some progress made\" for each of the goals. In addition, grandmother testified that, in February 2006, she began sending D.L.B. to see a licensed professional counselor to further assist D.L.B. with overcoming her learning deficiencies. Thus, although the court found that D.L.B. suffered from \"severe\" developmental delays, evidence was presented that D.L.B. was receiving the recommended medical and therapeutic treatments she needed to aid her development while in grandmother's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The guardian ad litem testified that D.L.B. is \"just full of energy, she's very lively. She's a very sweet child, she likes to hug.\" She also testified that D.L.B. \"loves to do things with her grandmother in the apartment complex that [sic] she lives. She enjoys bike riding and roller skating. She told me that she plays basketball and ... that she played on a real team called the Allstars ....\" During her visit at grandmother's house, the guardian ad litem observed that D.L.B. \"would go over and give [grandmother] hugs and tell her she loved her and so forth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The guardian ad litem further testified that D.L.B. \"knows that she has a biological\n   mother that is not [grandmother], but she does refer to [grandmother] as [']mama.[']\" She testified that D.L.B. told her \"that she had not seen her [biological mother] in quite some time and she really could not remember when was the last time that she had seen her.\" D.L.B. \"didn't express any fear of having a biological mom and not knowing or anything of that nature. She-she basically just didn't seem to know a whole lot about her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"In cases involving custody of children, the trial judge, who has the opportunity to see and hear the parties and the witnesses, is vested with broad discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Williamson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8552770\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/32/616/#p620\">\n    32 N.C.App. 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=233%20S.E.2d%20677\">\n    233 S.E.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680 (1977) (citing\n   <em>\n    Blackley v.

Since the effects of mother's changed circumstances on D.L.B.'s welfare were not \"self-evident,\" mother had the burden to show \"evidence\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   linking the change[s in her circumstances] to the welfare of [D.L.B.]\"\n   <em>\n    See Shipman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"491698\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/357/471/#p474\">\n    357 N.C. at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=586%20S.E.2d%20250\">\n    586 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   256 (citing 3 Suzanne Reynolds,\n   <em>\n    Lee's North Carolina Family Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.103 (5th rev. ed.2002)). We recognize that mother has not been able to demonstrate the effect that the changed circumstances \"in her own personal life and environment\"-recognized as \"substantial\" by the trial court-might have on D.L.B. largely because she has been ordered to have no contact with D.L.B. Additionally, the guardian ad litem testified that grandmother purposefully withheld gifts from D.L.B. that mother sent to her over the years while in grandmother's custody including: an Easter basket, because grandmother \"complained that it was just candy and nothing else\"; and a blouse, because grandmother \"was not particularly happy about [the blouse] being purchased at Wal-Mart.\" Nonetheless, the moving party has the burden of proving a \"nexus\" between the changed circumstances and the welfare of the child in order for the trial court to determine that a child support order may be modified.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 478,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=586%20S.E.2d%20250\">\n    586 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   255-56 (citing 3 Suzanne Reynolds,\n   <em>\n    Lee's North Carolina Family Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.103 (5th rev. ed.2002)). Therefore, since mother did not present evidence that her substantial change in circumstances affected D.L.B., we must find that the trial court did not err by denying mother's motion to modify the January 2004 custody order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Judges STEELMAN and STEPHENS concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
