Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.16, 1.3, and 8.4 in violation of the terms of a 2003 Consent Order of Discipline, we affirm the Disciplinary Hearing Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I: Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 9 December 2005, the North Carolina State Bar (\"Bar\") filed a motion for Order to Show Cause against defendant Mark Anthony Key (\"Key\"), alleging that Key had failed to comply with a 2003 Consent Order of Discipline by violating the North Carolina Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. Key is an attorney whose license to practice law in the State of North Carolina was suspended for two years in 2003. That suspension had been stayed for three years. The facts upon which the Show Cause order was based arose from Key's representation of Tammy Faircloth on a series of probation violation matters in the Superior Court of Wake County in 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This matter was heard by the Disciplinary Hearing Commission (\"DHC\" or \"Commission\") of the State Bar on 5 May 2006. On 26 June 2006, the DHC entered an Order of Discipline, lifting the stay of the suspension of Key's license for a period of ninety days. Key appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A panel of this Court heard the matter on 30 August 2007. In an opinion filed 18 December 2007, the panel affirmed the Order of Discipline. Key filed a petition for re-hearing on 22 January 2008. His petition was allowed for the limited purpose of reviewing Key's challenge to finding of fact 26 of the Order of Discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    II: Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 8 August 2005, Key appeared in the Superior Court of Wake County, representing Faircloth on two probation violations. At the time of the hearing, Faircloth was served with a third probation violation, for absconding supervision (\"the absconder violation\"). Key requested that Judge Abraham Penn Jones \"consider disposing of [all] charges in one order.\" Although Key thought that all three charges had been resolved, Judge Jones' written order did not include a disposition of the absconder violation. In late August, Faircloth's probation officer told her that a hearing had been scheduled for 12 September 2005. Faircloth relayed this information to Key, who agreed to appear on Faircloth's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Faircloth and Key appeared before Judge Stafford G. Bullock on 12 September 2005, where Key admitted the absconder violation on her behalf. Key did not in any manner limit his representation. When the court refused to provide assurances that it would follow a recommendation of the probation officer, Key moved to continue Faircloth's case. The motion was granted, and the hearing was rescheduled for 10 October 2005. Following the continuance, Faircloth agreed to pay Key an additional $200 fee to represent her on the absconder violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In preparation for the 10 October 2005 hearing, Key issued a subpoena for a probation officer from Cumberland County to be present at the hearing. On 10 October 2005, Faircloth and her probation officer were present in the courtroom for calendar call. In the common area outside the courtrooms, Faircloth told Key that she did not have the $200 for his fee. Key then released the Cumberland County probation officer from the subpoena, advising the officer that he had not been \"fully retained\" and would not be representing Faircloth. Shortly thereafter, Key left the Wake County Courthouse to attend a conference at his daughter's school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Faircloth's case was called for hearing, Key was not present. Judge Thomas D. Haigwood instructed the courtroom clerk, Sonya Clodfelter, to call Key and tell him that his presence was required in court to resolve Faircloth's absconder violation. After a series of phone calls between Clodfelter and Key, in which Key adamantly stated that he did not represent Faircloth, Judge Haigwood agreed to continue the matter until 9:30 a.m. on 11 October 2005. When Clodfelter called Key back to inform him of the continuance, he became angry and, when told that the judge may issue a show cause order or a bench warrant, stated that \"he didn't give a s____\" what the judge did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 11 October 2005, Key appeared before Judge Haigwood. Both Faircloth and her probation officer also returned to court that morning for the rescheduled hearing. Judge Haigwood continued the matter and issued an order directing Key to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. A second show cause order was subsequently issued on 31 October 2005 directing Key to show cause why he should not be subject to attorney discipline by the court for violating provisions of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On 15 November 2005, following a two-day hearing, Judge Donald W. Stephens entered two orders, one of criminal contempt and one of attorney discipline. Key appealed these matters to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

It is uncontroverted that Key never sought or obtained permission from the court to withdraw as Faircloth's attorney. It is further uncontroverted that he left the Wake County Courthouse on 10 October 2005, knowing that the probation matter was scheduled for hearing.

It is uncontroverted that Key left the Wake County Courthouse on 10 October 2005, knowing that the probation matter was scheduled for hearing. In addition, findings of fact 22, 24, 25, 27, and 34, uncontested on appeal, are evidentiary facts that support finding of fact 29, and finding of fact 26, which we have concluded is supported by adequate and substantial evidence, also supports this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    D. Finding of Fact 35\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We have reviewed the record in this case and conclude that there is adequate and substantial evidence contained therein to support this finding. It is uncontroverted that Faircloth was required to make three additional court appearances to resolve her absconder violation and was required to appear at the disciplinary hearing before Judge Stephens. The portion of finding of fact 35 stating that \"Faircloth was adversely affected by Key's refusal to appear on her behalf\" is an ultimate finding of fact, based upon the balance of finding of fact 35.\n   <em>\n    See Woodard v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   With respect to Rules 1.3 and 8.4, Key contends that: (1) this case presents a matter of first impression before this Court; (2) the comments following Rule 1.3 suggest that a violation of diligence occurs when there is a\n   <em>\n    pattern\n   </em>\n   of negligent conduct and his refusal to appear on October 10 fails to establish such a violation; (3) the sole basis for the Rule 8.4 charge is \"the unsupported allegation that he `refused to appear' in court on October 10, 2005[;]\" and (4) rather than a \"refusal to appear,\" the evidence demonstrates his diligence on Faircloth's behalf. Finally, he argues that mere refusal to appear does not constitute a violation of Rule 8.4 for three reasons: (1) these circumstances are insufficiently egregious, (2) Key had a \"good faith\" belief that no legal obligation existed, and (3) DHC failed to adduce evidence of harm to Faircloth or of a reasonable likelihood of prejudice to the administration of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Order of Discipline contained the following conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   2. Key entered a general appearance regarding the absconder violation pending against Faircloth on Sept. 12, 2005. Consequently, he could not properly refuse to appear at the Oct. 10, 2005 hearing on the grounds that she had not paid his fee, without first seeking permission to withdraw from the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   3.

By refusing to appear on Faircloth's behalf at the Oct. 10, 2005 hearing, Key neglected a client matter in violation of Rule 1.3, and engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   b. By failing to seek Court permission before effectively concluding his representation of Faircloth, Key violated Rule 1.16(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The North Carolina Revised Rules of Professional Conduct govern proper terms of an attorney's representation of clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Rule 1.16.
