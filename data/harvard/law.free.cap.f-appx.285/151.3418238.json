A certificate of appealability (COA) was granted as to whether Coleman\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary. This court also directed the parties to address whether Coleman\u2019s application was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Coleman devotes his entire appellate brief to the time bar issue and merely concludes in his reply brief that his plea was involuntary and refers this court to arguments he raised in previous district court pleadings. Even if Coleman has not waived review of this issue, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987), he has failed to demonstrate that his guilty plea was involuntary and that the district court erred in denying him habeas relief based on the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Resolution of the remaining question specified in the grant of the COA regarding the timeliness of Coleman\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application is therefore unnecessary. <em>See Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
