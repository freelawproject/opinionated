Torres-Garcia concedes that his prior convictions under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351.5, based on his possession for sale and purchase for sale of cocaine, were drug trafficking offenses within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) and that the district court did not plainly err in making a 16-level adjustment to his offense level under that Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u2022Because Torres-Garcia did not object to the characterization of the offense in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 866-67 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cPlain error exists when: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), a 16-level increase is applied if the defendant was deported after a felony conviction that is \u201ca drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d In <em>United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471, 473-76 (5th Cir.2005), the court determined that a purchase for purposes of sale of cocaine is a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Torres-Garcia admits that he pleaded guilty to that offense and that he received a sentence exceeding 13 months. Therefore, the district court did not plainly err in making the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The district court correctly calculated the guidelines range and did not abuse its discretion in imposing sentence at the bottom of the sentencing guidelines range. Therefore, the sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
