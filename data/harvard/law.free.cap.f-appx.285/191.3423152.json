The Government moves to supplement the record with copies of Scott\u2019s sentencing memorandum and his objections to the presentence report, and to seal its motion and those documents. The Government\u2019s motions are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-24\">Scott contends that the district court erred because it believed it lacked the authority to depart downward to account for the time he spent in detention on a federal writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum while serving his state sentence, although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, p.s., comment. (n.3(E)) gives district courts such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of a downward departure request unless the district court held a mistaken belief that it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 350 (5th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 2, 2008) (No. 07-1512). A defendant is not entitled to credit against his newly imposed federal sentence for time spent serving an unrelated, undischarged sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). The district court stated the law correctly at Scott\u2019s sentencing hearing. Scott has not shown that the district court believed it lacked authority to depart. We lack jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>over Scott\u2019s appeal. <em>See Lucas, </em>516 F.3d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
