Although he renews the allegations of his complaint, Malone does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that Malone did not allege the attorneys were acting under the color of state law or that the claim against the judge is barred by absolute immunity. Nor does Malone challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the abstention doctrine of <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), compelled the dismissal of Malone\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">By failing to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal, Malone has abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Malone\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Malone\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Malone has previously accumulated more than three strikes, and the \u00a7 1915(g) sanctions bar has been imposed. <em>See Malone v. Pedigo, </em>283 Fed.Appx. 203 (5th Cir.2008). Malone is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
