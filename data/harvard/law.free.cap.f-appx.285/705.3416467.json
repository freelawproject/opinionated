Arthur appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 complaint, challenging Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol, for unreasonable delay. Arthur argues that the district court erred in dismissing his challenge because it was distinguishable from his prior lethal injection challenge, <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>No. 07-0842, 2007 WL 2320069 (S.D.Ala. Aug. 10, 2007) <em>(\u201cArthur\u201d), </em>that the changes to the protocol were material, and that he could not have brought the claim before he had a set execution date.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">As we recited in our order denying Arthur\u2019s motion for stay of execution in this case, <em>Arthur v. Alabama Dep\u2019t. of Corr., </em>No. 07-15877, 2008 WL 2898212 (11th Cir. Jul. 23, 2008) <em>(\u201cArthur IV\u201d), </em>we rejected Arthur\u2019s arguments regarding his unreasonable delay in <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>248 Fed.Appx. 128 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) <em>(\u201cArthur II </em>\u201d) and in <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.) (per curiam) <em>(\u201cArthur III </em>\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 660, 169 L.Ed.2d 511 (2007). Specifically, we have observed that Arthur was on notice that a \u00a7 1983 challenge to Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol was available as early as June or August 2006. <em>Arthur II, </em>248 Fed.Appx. at 132. We have also noted that it does not appear that Aabama\u2019s 26 October 2007 minimal changes to its execution protocol materially changed the procedures that were adopted in 2002. <em>See McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2914, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">Arthur\u2019s challenge that Aabama\u2019s revised execution protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is the same challenge that he raised in <em>Arthur. </em>The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing for unreasonable delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">For the same reasons that we stated in <em>Arthur IV, </em>we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b733-25\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4L\">specially concurring in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-26\">I concur in the decision to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Athur\u2019s 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>complaint challenging Alabama\u2019s lethal injection protocol only because I believe we are bound by the precedent in <em>Baze v.
