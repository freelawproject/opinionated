He was sentenced to 105 months of imprisonment and did not appeal. After his conviction became final, he filed a motion to compel the government to move, pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 35, to reduce his sentence. That motion was denied. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-22\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>on appeal, Brown asserts that he complied with his plea-bargain obligation to provide information concerning drug trafficking. He argues that the government, in the plea agreement, bargained away its discretion to file a rule 35 motion. He further contends that the government breached the plea agreement because it neither moved for a departure for substantial assistance nor for a reduced sentence pursuant to rule 35. In his view, the government had an unconstitutional motive that consisted of \u201cabusing [its] discretionary power and [taking] advantage\u201d of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-23\">On motion of the government, a court may reduce a sentence to reflect substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another offender. Fed. R.CrimP. 35(b). Only the government has the authority to file such a motion, but it does not have the obligation to do so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>63 F.3d 381, 389 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995). Nevertheless, \u201ca prosecutor\u2019s discretion when exercising that power is subject to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840. A court can review the refusal to move for a reduction if the defendant makes \u201ca \u2018substantial threshold showing\u2019 that the refusal is based on unconstitutional motives\u201d such as race or religion. <em>Sneed, </em>63 F.3d at 389 n. 6 (quoting <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840). Brown does not make a substantial threshold showing of an unconstitutional motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The record refutes Brown\u2019s related contention\u2014that the government\u2019s conduct does not comport with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the plea agreement, which explicitly grants the government complete discretion with regard to filing a rule 35 motion. Brown expressly acknowledged the agreement\u2019s provisions at rearraignment and agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the agreement reflects all the promises, agreements, and understandings. Accordingly, and in view of the lack of any unconstitutional motive, the failure to file such a motion did not violate the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 743 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b205-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
