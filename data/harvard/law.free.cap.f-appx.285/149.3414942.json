Jackson now appeals that sentence, challenging only the reasonableness of the seven-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Because Jackson did not object to his sentence in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 805-06 (5th Cir.2008). Jackson was initially convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Section 841(b)(1)(C) provides for a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years, and Jackson\u2019s offense is thus a class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3). The statute of conviction authorizes a supervised release term of \u201cat least\u201d three years. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). However, the default supervised release statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2) limits the term of supervised release for Class C felonies to three years. In such a situation, a defendant must be sentenced to a supervised release term of \u201cnot less than nor more than three years.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>974 F.2d 22, 24 (5th Cir.1992). In the case of an additional supervised-release term following revocation, we must also subtract from that statutorily-mandated three-year term the imprisonment term imposed upon revocation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We correct overlong supervised release terms under plain error review. <em>United States v. Meshack, </em>225 F.3d 556, 578 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly Jackson\u2019s additional supervised release term of seven years is hereby modified to 21 months. As modified, Jackson\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">SENTENCE MODIFIED and, as modified, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
