Keller argues that the district court erred by unilaterally reinstating his conviction on Count 11 after the Government had moved to dismiss that count. He also argues that the district court failed to adequately explain its reasons for the sentence imposed on Count 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The district court\u2019s minute entry did not specify whether it relied on Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 or 36 to correct its dismissal of Count 11. However, under either rule, we conclude that the full record indicates that the intent of the parties was for Keller to plead guilty to and be sentenced on Counts 1 and 11; as intended, Keller pleaded guilty and was sentenced on those counts. The Government\u2019s subsequent motion to dismiss Count 11, and the district court\u2019s grant of the motion, constituted clear error subject to correction by the district court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">Keller also briefly argues that the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) by not adequately explaining its five year sentence of imprisonment for Count 11. Because Keller did not object on this basis below, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, - L.Ed.2d - (2008). In <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d This court has held the requirement of a statement of reasons for a particular sentence is satisfied when the district court indicates the applicable guideline range and how that range was chosen. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">In the instant case, Keller\u2019s firearms conviction carried a statutory minimum sentence of a consecutive term of five years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). The guidelines recommendation was the statutory minimum sentence of five years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b). At sentencing, the district court heard Keller\u2019s arguments regarding his possession of the firearm. The district court also stated that it had reviewed the sentencing memoranda, the Guidelines, the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Therefore, the district court\u2019s explanation of its reasons for the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>imposed does not rise to the level of plain error. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
