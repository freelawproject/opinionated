Lawrence was initially sentenced to ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment. We vacated Lawrence\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>196 Fed.Appx. 196 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished). On remand, the district court re-sentenced Lawrence to eighty-seven months in prison and three years of supervised release. Lawrence\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting that the district court erred in its imposition of sentence on remand. Lawrence was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Lawrence first claims that his sentence for Counts Eight and Sixteen violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the sentencing judge determined facts without either a jury verdict or Lawrence\u2019s admission, which increased Lawrence\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum provided by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(d)(1) (2000). Because Lawrence raises this issue for the first time on appeal, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1023, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). To establish plain error, Lawrence must show that an error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if these conditions are met, we will only correct an error that \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">We find no error because Lawrence pled guilty to violating \u00a7 5324 while violating another law of the United States; namely, conspiracy to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) (2000). Accordingly, the district court properly utilized \u00a7 5324(d)(2) to determine the statutory maximum for Counts Eight and Sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">We further find that Lawrence\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court appropriately treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range, and weighed the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors. <em>See. United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Lawrence\u2019s eighty-seven month sentence, which is within the applicable guideline range and below the statutory maximum, is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (approving appellate presumption of reasonableness accorded sentences within properly calculated guideline range). Nothing in the record calls, into question the reasonableness of Lawrence\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Lawrence\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
