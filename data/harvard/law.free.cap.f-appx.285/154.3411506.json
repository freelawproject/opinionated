Tisehendorf, federal prisoner # 33920-177, is serving a 33-month sentence for embezzlement by a bank employee in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656. She appeals the dismissal of her 28 TT.S.'C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the regulations used by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to determine an inmate\u2019s eligibility for transfer to a halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-21\">Tisehendorf seeks an order from. this court to the BOP to consider releasing her to a halfway house \u201cat the-point in time where she has 180 days remaining on her sentence.\u201d Because her scheduled release date is September 23, 2008, the date 180 days prior to that date passed on March 27, 2008. She also requests that we order the BOP to consider transferring her to a halfway house \u201cprior to-[June 29, 2008], with no less than 180 days left before her release.\u201d The BOP previously indicated that it would consider transferring Tisehendorf to a halfway house on June 29, 2008. On April 9, 2008, Congress amended the statutory provisions granting authority to the BOP to' determine an inmate\u2019s eligibility for halfway house placement. <em>See </em>Second Chance Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-199, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00a7 251(a), 122 Stat. 657, 692-93 (April 9, 2008), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(c). The parties have not addressed the amendment or its effect upon the instant appeal. Nor has this court previously addressed a claim such as Tischendorfs. Because her eligibility date has passed, however, no effective judicial remedy exists. Accordingly, we must DISMISS the appeal as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
