Rowell asserts that the sentence was imposed in a procedurally unreasonable manner because the district court did not make any comments at sentencing regarding the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). She maintains that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors indicate that a sentence of probation, not a sentence of imprisonment, was appropriate. She contends that probation is the only reasonable sentence because she is a middle-aged mother with no criminal record who committed the offense because of a psychological disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">When the district court exercises its \u201cdiscretion to impose a sentence within the Guideline range and states for the record that [it] is doing so, little explanation is required.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Although the district court could have given a better explanation of the reasoning for its sentencing decision, the reasoning was sufficient. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). As in <em>Rita, </em>the district court judge might have added explicitly that he had heard and considered the evidence and argument; that (as no one before him denied) he thought the Commission in the Guidelines had determined a sentence that was proper in the minerun of roughly similar ... cases; and that he found that [the defendant\u2019s] personal circumstances here were simply not different enough to warrant a different sentence. But context and the record make clear that this, or similar, reasoning, underlies the judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">Rowell acknowledges that the sentence was within the properly calculated guidelines range. Accordingly, the sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent Rowell relies upon her status as a middle-aged mother to rebut the presumption of reasonableness, this is an appeal to socioeconomic status, which is an impermissible factor for consideration. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 393 &amp; n. 13 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978). While a district court may consider a defendant\u2019s psychological condition as a reason for a below guidelines sentence, Rowell has not shown that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>district court\u2019s refusal to impose a sentence below the guidelines range for this reason was unreasonable. <em>Cf. Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2470 (rejecting claim that defendant\u2019s poor health made sentence of imprisonment within guidelines range unreasonable). Rowell has not shown that her \u201ccircumstances are special enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they require a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
