Brown, federal prisoner # 05937-010, seeks leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) as frivolous or for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-20\">The district court denied Brown leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Brown is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. RApp. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-21\">Brown argues that Romulo Armendariz acted with deliberate indifference to his safety when he transferred Brown to a prison facility in Pollock, Louisiana, because the facility contained inmates from the Leavenworth, Kansas, facility who previously had attacked him or fellow gang members of those inmates. However, Brown has not alleged the physical injury required under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1997e(e) for such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">Brown also argues that he is entitled to an injunction preventing him from being housed in facilities \u201cwhere gangs and Leavenworth prisoners are.\u201d However, a district court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a claim for injunctive relief when a plaintiff fails to show or allege a likelihood of future harm. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2005). Brown has not demonstrated or alleged that he is likely to suffer any specific future harm, and thus this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">Brown\u2019s motion fails to show error in the district court\u2019s certification decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>and fails to show that Brown will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Brown\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">This court\u2019s dismissal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint each count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Brown is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">^1 X</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
