Villa-Morales was sentenced to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">On appeal, Villa-Morales initially contends that the district court erred in sentencing him based on facts that were neither admitted nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentencing courts are still required to calculate the applicable advisory guideline range based on appropriate findings of fact. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006). We have previously noted that sentencing factors should continue to be evaluated based on the preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). Thus, we conclude the district court properly determined Villa-Morales\u2019s advisory guideline range based on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Villa-Morales also contends that his sentence is unreasonable. When determining a sentence, the district court must calculate the appropriate advisory guideline range and consider it in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). Sentences within the applicable Guidelines range may be presumed reasonable. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">The district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Villa-Morales, appropriately treating the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, properly calculating and considering the applicable Guidelines range, and weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, Villa-Morales\u2019s 27-month sentence, which is the lowest end of the Guidelines range and below the statutory maximum, may be presumed reasonable. Thus, we conclude Villa-Morales has failed to establish that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the chosen sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
