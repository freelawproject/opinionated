Bruno-Ponthier further contends that the district court erred in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">We have reviewed the record on appeal and the law applicable thereto as set forth in the appellate briefs of the parties and the rulings of the district court. As a result of our review, we are convinced that the district court properly granted UPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment on BrunoPonthier\u2019s Title VII claims. First, BrunoPonthier\u2019s sexual harassment claim fails because she has not shown that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reported conduct at UPS was sufficiently \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d to reach the level of actionable sexual harassment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, Bruno-Ponthier\u2019s retaliation claim fails because, <em>inter alia, </em>no causal connection was demonstrated between BrunoPonthier\u2019s discharge and her allegations of sexual harassment. Indeed, the supervisor who terminated Bruno-Ponthier\u2019s employment had no knowledge of her sexual harassment complaints. Bruno-Ponthier was fired because of her history of absenteeism and the fact that she had left her job without excuse during the middle of a shift. She has failed to show any signs of pretext in the asserted reasons for her firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We are also convinced that the district court did not err in declining to exercise jurisdiction over Bruno-Ponthier\u2019s state law claims. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, \u201c[t]he district courts <em>may </em>decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction ... if ... the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court clearly had the discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Bruno-Ponthier\u2019s state law claims because it dismissed all federal claims over which it had original jurisdiction, <em>viz., </em>her Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The judgment of the district court is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
