In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Munoz-Hernandez challenges the sentence imposed for his new conviction by questioning the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. As Munoz-Hernandez concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pinedar-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-24\">Munoz-Hernandez\u2019s appeal of his revocation of supervised release was consolidated with the instant appeal. He has not, however, raised any argument with respect to these proceedings. Any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>claim is thus deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Government\u2019s motions for summaryaffirmance and to waive the requirement to file an appellee\u2019s brief are GRANTED, the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file an appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
