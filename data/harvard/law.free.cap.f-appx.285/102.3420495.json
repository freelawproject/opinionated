On April 8, 2008, this court dismissed Smith\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s October 25, 2007 order. Smith\u2019s request that the district court stay the order pending appeal and her appeal from the denial of that stay are now moot. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Appeal No. 08-6436 is Smith\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying her motion for substitution of appointed counsel prior to sentencing. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Smith seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">Having determined to dismiss Smith\u2019s appeals, we deny, as moot, her motion for a stay of the district court proceedings pending appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
