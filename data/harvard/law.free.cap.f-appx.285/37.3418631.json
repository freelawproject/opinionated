The DAB affirmed the imposition of a civil monetary penalty (\u201cCMP\u201d) upon Petitioner for failure to be in substantial compliance with federal regulatory standards governing. certification as a skilled nursing facility. This court has \u201cjurisdiction over the appeal of a final DAB decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e).\u201d <em>Crestview Parke Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>373 F.3d 743, 746 (6th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 498.90(a)(1). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the DAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Petitioner is a Medicare-certified nursing facility located in Burlington, North Carolina. The certification signifies that Petitioner has met the Long Term Care Requirements of Participation (\u201cROP\u201d), allowing it to participate in the Medicare Program for Medicare and Medicaid funding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Facilities that participate in this program are subject to annual inspections by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cCMS\u201d), for the purpose of determining a facility\u2019s continued compliance with the ROPs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">On November 11, 2004, the North Carolina State Survey Agency (\u201cbSA\u201d) inspected Petitioner\u2019s facility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the inspection, the SSA cited Petitioner for a violation of 42 C.F.R. 483.25(h)(2), which is regulatory noncompliance that posed \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d to a single resident (\u201cResident\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the violation stated that Petitioner \u201cfailed to put interventions in place to prevent elopement of 1 of 1 sampled residents.\u201d (J.A. 1.) As a result of the SSA\u2019s finding, the Secretary of the DHHS imposed upon Petitioner a CMP. Petitioner applied to the DAB for a review of the imposition of the CMP. During an oral administrative hearing, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) made the following findings of fact, which we adopt in their entirety as they are not disputed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">A. Administrative Law Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b67-18\">Prior to May 2003, Petitioner operated a locked wing in its facility, referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the Special Care Unit. Resident, an 87-year-old woman with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease and osteoporosis, was housed in Petitioner\u2019s Special Care Unit from September 2000 until May 2003 due to her \u201chigh risk for elopement as the result of her numerous medical and psychological ailments.\u201d (J.A. 370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">In May 2003, Petitioner converted the Special Care Unit to a rehabilitation unit. The new unit did not provide the same level of services and security as that of the Special Care Unit. Accordingly, Petitioner advised Resident\u2019s family about the need to move Resident to another facility. The family urged Petitioner to allow Resident to remain at her current location. Despite Petitioner\u2019s concerns, Petitioner reluctantly allowed Resident to remain at the facility. During Resident\u2019s stay in the rehabilitation unit, she eloped on several occasions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Petitioner documented in writing each time Resident eloped. The first time Resident eloped was June 2, 2003, when she simply walked out of Petitioner\u2019s facility. To prevent future elopements, Petitioner placed a Wander Guard transponder on Resident\u2019s ankle that would trigger an alarm if Resident eloped through the front door. Other doors, however, were not equipped with a Wander Guard alarm. Despite this precaution, Resident managed to elope undetected through exit doors other than the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">On September 19, 2004, Petitioner became aware of the manner in which Resident eloped without detection. Another resident observed Resident flip a bypass switch that disabled an electronic door lock and allowed Resident to exit through a back door.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner located Resident on this date after she had wandered through a fence, down a grassy slope, and into a parking lot. In response to Resident\u2019s actions, Petitioner placed pieces of paper over the bypass switches in an attempt to confuse or distract her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On November 6, 2004, Resident, undeterred by the paper-covered switches, again disabled the electronic lock and eloped through the rear exit doors. The following day, Resident also attempted to elope through the front door, but her Wander Guard triggered an alarm and she was promptly retrieved by two visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">B. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Inspection</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">On November 11, 2004, the SSA conducted an annual inspection of Petitioner\u2019s facility and sent its findings to CMS. After the inspection and review of Petitioner\u2019s records and facility, termed a \u201csurvey,\u201d CMS found that Petitioner failed to comply with federal regulations governing care facilities approved for Medicare and Medicaid funding, and imposed a CMP. Specifically, CMS found that Petitioner was not operating in substantial compliance with nursing home regulations that require fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cilities to provide adequate supervision of its residents to prevent accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">CMS found that Petitioner was not in compliance because Petitioner had failed to take appropriate steps to prevent Resident from repeatedly eloping from its facility. (J.A. 5.) As a result of CMS\u2019s inspection, Petitioner decided to install squeal boxes (alarms) on the bypass switches to alert the staff when a bypass switch was activated. The squeal boxes were installed on November 16-17 and were fully operational on November 19, 2004. CMS conducted a follow-up survey on November 18, 2004, after which CMS determined that Petitioner\u2019s noncompliance constituted \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d from the date Petitioner was aware of Resident\u2019s means of elopement, September 19, 2004, until the squeal boxes were installed on November 17, 2004. Additionally, CMS found that Petitioner\u2019s noncompliance continued at a level below immediate jeopardy from the time the squeal boxes were installed until the staff was trained on how to respond to the alarms on November 18, 2004. Accordingly, Petitioner was fined $8,050 per day from September 19, 2004 through November 17, 2004, and $50 per day on November 18, 2004, resulting in a total f\u00edne of $180,000.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">C. The DAB Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Following CMS\u2019s imposition of fines, Petitioner requested an administrative review of the CMP by the DAB. As provided by statute, the DAB afforded Petitioner a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ conducted a hearing on December 15, 2005, and affirmed CMS\u2019s findings. Petitioner then appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Appellate Division of the DAB.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The DAB Appellate Division reviewed and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. This case is now before this court on appeal of the final decision of the DAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">In this case, the Secretary of DHHS (\u201cSecretary\u201d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> made findings of fact to support the conclusion that Petitioner was not in substantial compliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2), and that such noncompliance resulted in both immediate jeopardy and the potential for minimum harm. We review the Secretary\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e) (\u201cThe findings of the Secretary with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\u201d). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation and internal quotations omitted). This level of evidence is further defined as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Laws v. Celebrezze, </em>368 F.2d 640, 642 (4th Cir.1966). The Secretary\u2019s legal conclusions are subject to a highly deferential standard of review. By regulation, a determination of noncompliance must be upheld unless that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>decision is clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 498.60(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Governing Regulations: Adequate Supervision and Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">This case is governed by regulations set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, which provides standards to which nursing homes must conform in order to qualify for participation in Medicare and Medicaid funding. The regulation at issue in this case, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2), states that a facility must ensure that \u201c[e]ach resident receives adequate supervision and assistance devices to prevent accidents.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2). An \u201c \u2018accident\u2019 is defined in the State Operations Manual (SOM) issued by HCFA as \u2018an unexpected, unintended event that can cause a resident bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woodstock Care Ctr. v. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>DAB No. 1726 (May 30, 2000) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In order for a facility to be in substantial compliance with this regulation, \u201ca provider must have no deficiencies that pose a risk to resident health or safety greater than \u2018the potential for causing minimum harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In this case, the Secretary found that Petitioner failed to adequately supervise Resident in order to prevent her from eloping, in violation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2). The Secretary found that Petitioner failed to take all reasonable steps necessary to secure its exit doors after discovering Resident\u2019s ability to flip the bypass switches and exit the building undetected. Petitioner argues that its electronic door locks were state-of-the-art and were installed within parameters dictated by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">As a participant in Medicare and Medicaid funding, Petitioner is obligated to ensure that \u201c[ejach resident receives adequate supervision and assistance devices to prevent accidents.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2). The regulation directs a facility to take all reasonable precautions to prevent situations that have the potential for causing harm to a resident. <em>See Woodstock Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>363 F.3d 583, 589 (6th Cir.2003). Petitioner, as of September 19, 2004, knew that Resident could disable the electronic door locks and exit the facility undetected. Accordingly, Petitioner had no means of adequately supervising Resident'or preventing accidents once she exited the facility undetected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Petitioner challenges the Secretary\u2019s determination, contending that Resident\u2019s elopements were few and far between, and resulted in no injury. Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s assertion, however, substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s finding of a failure to adequately supervise and prevent accidents. It is uncontested that Resident was able to elope from Petitioner\u2019s facility undetected despite the fact that Petitioner knew Resident was eloping by flipping the bypass switch and exiting through the back door. This knowledge placed Petitioner on notice and obligated Petitioner to take steps necessary to adequately supervise Resident. Additionally, the fact that Resident eloped multiple times undetected after September 19, 2004, also provides substantial evidence in support of the Secretary\u2019s findings. <em>See Woodstock Care Ctr. V. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>DAB No. 1726 (May 30, 2000) (The ALJ held that \u201cevidence which shows that residents were able to escape Petitioner\u2019s facility on multiple occasions, is ample evidence of a lack of supervision of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>residents.\u201d). Substantial evidence, therefore, supports a finding that Petitioner was not in substantial compliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Petitioner further contends that Resident\u2019s lack of an injury during her elopements compels a conclusion that she was adequately supervised. The fact that no injury occurred while Resident eloped, however, is not factually dispositive on the issue of adequate supervision. The absence of an injury does not indicate whether Resident was adequately supervised or merely fortunate. In this case, the Secretary analyzed the fact that Resident was an elderly woman who ambulated using a walker and was at a high risk for experiencing falls, and came to the conclusion that her exposure to the outdoor terrain put her in immediate jeopardy of sustaining an injury. Substantial evidence supported the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Resident\u2019s ability to avoid an injury was completely fortuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Immediate Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Petitioner challenges the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s noncompliance rose to the level of immediate jeopardy. The federal regulations governing inspections of nursing facilities classifies noncompliance violations based on the severity of risk to a resident. Immediate jeopardy is defined as \u201ca situation in which the provider\u2019s noncompliance with one or more requirements of participation has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a resident.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301. The second level of noneompliance is defined as a situation where there is \u201c[n]o actual harm with a potential for more than minimal harm, but not immediate jeopardy.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.404(b)(l)(ii). The lowest level violation is found when there is \u201c[n]o actual harm with a potential for minimal harm.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.404(b)(l)(I).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The Secretary determined that Resident\u2019s ability to elope undetected resulting in unsupervised exposure to areas beyond the confines of the facility walls constituted immediate jeopardy. We are required to uphold this determination unless we find it to be clearly erroneous. <em>See Liberty Commons Nursing &amp; Rehab Ctr.\u2014Johnston v. Leavitt, </em>241 Fed.Appx. 76, 81 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (citing 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 498.60). In reviewing the facts, the ALJ determined that Resident\u2019s advanced age, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and debilitating physical condition put her at risk of, inter alia, falling down, getting lost, or being hit by a car in the parking lot. In evaluating these potential consequences, the ALJ concluded that the elopements were likely to cause serious injury or harm to Resident. The Secretary\u2019s conclusion is not clearly erroneous because patients suffering from conditions similar to Resident\u2019s have wandered from their facility and been involved in accidents. <em>See Golden Villa Nursing Home, Inc. v. Smith, </em>674 S.W.2d 343 (Tex.App.1984) (resident who eloped was hit by person on motorcycle); <em>Lincoln Manor, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health, </em>358 Ill.App.3d 1116, 295 Ill.Dec. 506, 832 N.E.2d 956 (2005) (resident eloped from facility and sustained a fractured hip as a result of a fall); <em>Ostrom v. Manorcare Health Servs., </em>2007 WL 188132, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4106 (E.D.Mich. Jan. 22, 2007) (resident with Alzheimer\u2019s disease who eloped suf-</p>\n<p id=\"A8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>fered severe head trauma after tripping over a light post). Moreover, the fact Resident eloped on multiple occasions lends more strength to the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Woodstock Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>363 F.3d 583, 590 (6th Cir.2003) (The court, in considering the frequency of the residents\u2019 elopements as well as \u201cthe vulnerable state of the residents, and the dangers of the outside world to residents in such a state,\u201d held the conclusion that the residents\u2019 \u201celopements would likely cause serious injury was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Petitioner further claims that the Secretary\u2019s conclusion is unfounded for two reasons: (1) because Petitioner undertook certain efforts to prevent Resident from eloping, and (2) because Resident never sustained any injury while outside the facility. These arguments are without merit, however, because the Secretary can make a finding of immediate jeopardy notwithstanding a facility\u2019s attempt to take remedial measures or the lack of an actual injury to a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The purpose of the regulation, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2), is to prevent not only actual harm, but also likely harm to a resident. Therefore, a facility is to take all reasonable precautions to prevent unintended events that can cause a resident bodily injury. <em>Woodstock, </em>363 F.3d at 589. \u201cThe question whether [a facility] took all reasonable precautions is highly fact-bound and can only be answered on the basis of expertise in nursing home management. As such, it is a question the resolution of which we defer to the expert administrative agency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Petitioner\u2019s Responses to Resident\u2019s Elopements</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Petitioner claims that this court should reverse the Secretary\u2019s decision to impose a CMP because Petitioner attempted to take remedial measures to prevent Resident from continuing to elope. Specifically, Petitioner challenges the Secretary\u2019s determination that Petitioner\u2019s attempts were not sufficient. In evaluating a facility\u2019s response to a risk of harm to a resident, courts focus on whether a facility \u201chad taken reasonable steps to respond to the residents\u2019 need for supervision.\u201d <em>Woodstock Care Ctr. V. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>DAB No. 1726 (May 30, 2000). This \u201cregulatory standard does not amount to strict liability or require absolute success,\u201d as there is \u201can element of reasonableness [that] is inherent in the regulation\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>Crestview Parke Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>373 F.3d 743, 754 (6th Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotations omitted). The standard does require, however, that a facility do more than simply respond to a problem, because it imposes a burden of taking \u201call reasonable precautions.\u201d <em>Woodstock, </em>363 F.3d at 589. DAB tribunals interpret this to mean that \u201ca facility is not required to do the impossible or be a guarantor against unforeseeable occurrence, but is required to do everything in its power to prevent accidents.\u201d <em>Koester Pavilion Petitioner v. Health Care Financing Administration, </em>DAB No. 1750 (Oct. 18, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">In order to determine whether Petitioner\u2019s responses were reasonable, this court looks at two factors: whether a risk of an \u201caccident\u201d was foreseeable and whether the facility\u2019s response was adequate under the circumstances. <em>See Woodstock Care Ctr. V. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>DAB No. 1726 (May 30, 2000). In this case, Petitioner learned on September 19, 2004, that Resident was flipping the bypass switches and walking out the exit doors. Despite Resident\u2019s unique ability to operate the switches, all of Resident\u2019s future elopements became foreseeable the moment Petitioner realized Resident was capable of operating the bypass switches.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s reaction to Resident\u2019s behavior was not adequate because it was not tailored to address her relatively high functional capacity. In order to prevent Resident from eloping, Petitioner placed paper covers over the switches that release the locks on the exit doors. Petitioner claimed that this would confuse and distract Resident, thus preventing her from locating the switches. The Secretary did not consider this response to be adequate under the circumstances and substantial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">When deciding to cover the bypass switches with paper, Petitioner did not consider Resident\u2019s \u201cnovel talent for operating the bypass switches.\u201d (P.B. at 43.) Though Petitioner\u2019s tactics might have worked on less functional Alzheimer\u2019s patients, Petitioner should have employed measures designed to prevent someone with Resident\u2019s level of cognitive ability from operating the bypass switches. At the very least, Petitioner could have initially combined the paper covers with a proven measure, such as one-on-one supervision to analyze whether the paper covers were effective.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Assuming such measures were not feasible, Petitioner\u2019s actions still never addressed the ultimate problem, Resident\u2019s ability to exit the facility without detection. Considering the other possible responses available and known to Petitioner at that time, including the use of the Wander Guard alarm or full-time, one-on-one supervision, Petitioner cannot claim that covering the switches with paper was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This conclusion is further supported by the fact that Resident was previously housed in a locked unit. In assessing the proper level of care required for Resident, Petitioner acknowledged that she was at a high risk for elopement. This risk did not decrease when she moved to an unlocked unit; in fact, her risk of elopement increased. Petitioner\u2019s reply brief admits that its staff \u201cknew that they could not assure the Resident\u2019s safety on an open, unlocked unit.\u201d (P.R. 15.) Furthermore, Petitioner states that it was the staffs professional judgment that Resident required greater supervision in an unlocked unit. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Petitioner cannot show that the Secretary\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence or that his legal conclusions were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Resident Suffered No Actual Harm</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that Resident never sustained any actual injury during her elopements is not a proper basis to set aside the Secretary\u2019s finding of immediate jeopardy. In fact, the DAB has \u201cheld that the regulations do not require any finding of actual harm to justify a determination that immediate jeopardy to residents exists.\u201d <em>Southridge Nursing and Rehab. Ctr. v. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>DAB No. 1778 (July 30, 2001) (citation and internal quotations omitted). According to the plain language of the regulation, a finding of immediate jeopardy only requires that a nursing facility\u2019s noncompliance is likely to cause harm to a resident. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301. As mentioned above, Resident\u2019s condition made her likely to suffer harm if unsupervised outside of Petitioner\u2019s facility. This is not a case where a resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>eloped a single time, or where the resident was retrieved immediately upon her decision to exit. Here, Resident continued to exit the facility without the staffs knowledge. Additionally, on at least two occasions, the staff was unsure how long Resident had been outside the facility. The fact that she eloped on numerous occasions increased the possibility that she would suffer an injury. <em>See Woodstock Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>368 F.3d 583, 590 (2003) (\u201cEven in the absence of \u2018actual harm,\u2019 a \u2018widespread potential for more than minimal harm\u2019 is sufficient to sustain the CMP.\u201d) (citing 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.301). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s argument that Resident always found her way back to the facility unharmed is not persuasive. <em>See Southridge, </em>DAB No. 1778 (July 30, 2001) (\u201cJust because the resident fortuitously did not suffer any actual harm does not eliminate the likelihood that harm could have befallen him in the course of his time outside.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the Secretary\u2019s determination of immediate jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Petitioner claims it was deprived of procedural rights during the hearing before the ALJ because the Secretary changed its reason for imposing a CMP and the ALJ thereafter denied Petitioner an opportunity to submit additional evidence through direct witness testimony. Because we find Petitioner\u2019s argument to lack merit, we will not upset our decision to affirm the rulings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Petitioner notes that the DAB lacks uniform rules for conducting a hearing to review the imposition of a CMP instead allowing the ALJs to use their discretion setting the procedure for a hearing. The Medicare Act at (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii)) specifically grants discretion to the Secretary to conduct CMP-related proceedings by incorporating by reference 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(c)(4). Under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 498.60, the discretion regarding hearing procedures is passed along to the ALJ. In this case, the presiding ALJ issued an initial order outlining the procedures to be used for the hearing. The order requested that the parties submit written direct testimonial evidence of all potential witnesses to be used at the hearing, and to make these witnesses available for cross-examination during the hearing. (J.A. 41-42.) Once this prehearing exchange was complete, neither party could supplement its evidence unless .it made a motion to do so. (J.A. 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">In accordance with the ALJ\u2019s directives, CMS submitted a brief and direct testimony of its surveyor in May 2005. Approximately 30 days later, Petitioner responded by submitting direct witness testimony and a prehearing brief. After Petitioner\u2019s submission, CMS moved to supplement its evidence with additional testimony of the surveyor in rebuttal to certain claims made by Petitioner\u2019s employees. The ALJ granted this motion. Petitioner did not supplement or amend its evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Petitioner claims it was prejudiced by the ALJ\u2019s procedures regarding witness testimony. Specifically, Petitioner claims that it was denied the opportunity to supplement its case with additional testimony regarding the efficacy of its electronic door-locking system because the ALJ\u2019s rules prevented witnesses from testifying at the hearing unless they were cross-examined. The record, however, shows that the only obstacle Petitioner faced in submitting additional evidence was its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>failure to organize and submit such evidence. The record shows both that the ALJ granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to supplement (J.\u00c1. 134-35), and that Petitioner failed to submit additional evidence. (J.A. 526). We fail to see how the Petitioner\u2019s procedural due process rights were prejudiced by the ALJ\u2019s procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Even assuming that Petitioner proffered the direct witness testimony it claims was wrongly omitted from the \u00c1LJ\u2019s consideration, this evidence would not have affected the ALJ\u2019s analysis. Petitioner sought to submit testimony of Randy Warden, the installer of Petitioner\u2019s door-locking system, in an attempt to show that the system Petitioner installed was the one preferred by the State of North Carolina and conformed to all the Life Safety Code requirements. Such testimony, however, was irrelevant to the determination of whether Petitioner was in substantial compliance with the regulation requiring adequate supervision of its residents. Though the electronic locking system may have been state-of-the-art at the time, the system was still unable to alert Petitioner\u2019s staff of Resident\u2019s elopements. This required Petitioner to take additional steps to monitor Resident and prevent her from eloping undetected. Accordingly, this evidence was irrelevant to the determination that Petitioner was not in substantial compliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The remainder of Petitioner\u2019s procedural due process arguments are also without merit. Petitioner\u2019s attempt to analogize its case to <em>Crestview Parke Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>373 F.3d 743, 749 (6th Cir. 2004), is unpersuasive because Petitioner was afforded an oral hearing and was given an opportunity to present its case, and the Secretary did not rely on any post hoc rationalizations to support its contention that Petitioner failed to adequately supervise Resident. Petitioner, therefore, suffered no prejudice nor injury from the ALJ\u2019s hearing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the final judgment of the DAB is</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-10\">. The substantive requirements of participation are listed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00cd-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-11\">. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is an agency of the federal Department of Health and Human Services that is in charge of administering the Medicare program. <em>See MacKenzie Med. Supply, Inc. v. Leavitt, </em>506 F.3d 341, 343 (4th Cir.2007). It operates as an agent of the Secretary of DHHS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-12\">. All participating facilities are subject to annual state surveys to determine if they comply with the Medicare and Medicaid participation requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395i-3(g)(2)(A)(iii)(I).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b67-19\">. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is permitted by statute to enter into agreements with state agencies; for example the North Carolina State Department of Health and Human Services. Such agreements allow a state agency (the SSA) to act as an agent of the Secretary. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395aa. In this case, an agreement existed that enabled the SSA to conduct surveys for the purpose of determining Petitioner\u2019s compliance with federal regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b67-20\">. Regulatory noncompliance with 42 C.F.R. 483.25(h)(2) is also commonly referred to within the DHHS as a violation of F Tag 324.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b68-6\">. According to the record before the court, Resident began to elope on June 2, 2003, less than a month after moving into the new unit. Petitioner documented five additional elopements which occurred on June 23, August 14, September 19, November 6, and November 7, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">. All of Petitioner's doors were controlled by electronic locks. No door, with the exception of the front door, was equipped with an alarm system that would alert the staff in the event that a resident exited the facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b68-13\">. Petitioner has argued that \"distraction\u201d is a common method of deterring conduct by residents with Alzheimer's disease. Although an untested technique in this context, Petitioner placed paper over the bypass switches in order to distract her from operating the bypass switches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. There is great discrepancy within the various documents before the court as to the amount of the fine. The total amount should be $180,000. This represents a fine of $3,050 each day from September 19\u2014November 17 (59 days) and a fine of $50 on November 18 (1 day): 59 x $3,050 = $179,950 and 1 x $50 = $50. $50 + $179,950 = $180,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b69-14\">. Initially, Petitioner moved to reopen the case in order to submit additional evidence, but the request was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b69-15\">.

The level of infraction determines the civil penalty. In situations deemed to constitute immediate jeopardy, \"[plenalties in the range of $3,050-$ 10,000 per day are imposed.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.438(a)(1). Likewise, \u2018\u2018[plenalties in the range of $50-$3, 000 per day are imposed for deficiencies that do not constitute immediate jeopardy, but either caused actual harm, or caused no actual harm, but have the potential for more than minimal harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 488.438(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">. The applicable regulations require Petitioner to take all reasonable precautions to prevent accidents. <em>See, </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2). Petitioner contends that one-on-one supervision as suggested by the AU and DAB Appellate Board compromises a resident's dignity, and is therefore not a preferred method of supervision. Petitioner, however, provides no authority to support a conclusion that safeguarding a resident\u2019s dignity or independence is preferred to protecting a resident against accidents. Accordingly, we find no merit in Petitioner\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. Petitioner did make a motion to submit supplemental evidence in the form of direct testimony of Randy Warden, the installer of Petitioner's alarm system. The ALJ granted this motion, but Petitioner never submitted any additional materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b75-11\">SHEDD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AiO\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Liberty Commons must comply with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h), which provides: \u201cAccidents. The facility must ensure that ... (2) each resident receives adequate supervision and assistance devices to prevent accidents.\u201d In interpreting this regulation, the DAB has held a facility is not subject to strict liability but a reasonableness standard, requiring that a facility take all \u201creasonable steps to respond to the residents\u2019 need for supervision.\u201d <em>Woodstock Care Ctr. v. Healthcare Fin. Admin., </em>DAB No. 1726 (May 30, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">Liberty Commons claims that it met the DAB\u2019s reasonableness standard by responding to Resident #2\u2019s (\u201cthe Resident\u201d) continued elopements by increasing remedial measures to prevent future elopements. The last of these remedial measures involved the covering of door lock override switches with paper, a step taken to prevent the Resident from operating the switches to unlock exit doors by diverting her attention. After Liberty Commons covered the switches with paper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the Resident did not elope for a period of approximately six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Under the DAB\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 488.25(h), Liberty Commons\u2019 actions should have been analyzed for reasonableness. The agency, however, failed to do so. The state surveyor who inspected Liberty Commons\u2019 facility testified that she did not evaluate the reasonableness of the paper covers because the resident \u201cwas still getting out of the facility. It was a non-issue.\u201d JA. 259. Likewise, the ALJ did not address this remedial measure. Only the DAB did so, and its analysis failed to comply with its own announced standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The DAB found that Liberty Commons\u2019 response was not \u201creasonable and effective\u201d because it ultimately failed to keep the Resident from eloping. However, the DAB never analyzed the reasonableness of Liberty Commons\u2019 remedial steps but focused its discussion solely on their effectiveness. In other words, the DAB failed to consider the possibility that a facility can take appropriate, reasonable steps to prevent accidents which in the end prove ineffective. Thus, the DAB engaged in no reasonableness analysis at all but simply an effectiveness analysis. Such an analysis for \u201ceffectiveness\u201d is simply an application of strict liability, in violation of the DAB\u2019s standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Because there is some evidence in the record indicating that Liberty Commons acted reasonably to prevent the Resident\u2019s elopements, I would vacate and remand for further consideration using a proper reasonableness analysis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> The DAB also interprets the regulation to mean that \"a facility is not required to do the impossible or be a guarantor against unforeseeable occurrences, but is required to do everything in its power to prevent accidents.\u201d <em>Koester Pavilion v. Healthcare Fin. Admin., </em>DAB No. 1750 (Oct. 18, 2000). Clearly, though, the DAB does not apply this interpretation literally. Doing so would result in a violation in every case because some further step to prevent accidents is always available.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
