We review Lake\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in section 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). And we evaluate the reasonableness of a sentence using a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Briefly stated, under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">We conclude that Lake\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Lake\u2019s advisory Guidelines range at 262 to 365 months and sentenced him to the high point of that range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 788 (noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). In addition, each of Lake\u2019s four counts of conviction carried a statutory maximum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment; and his 365-month sentence is less than the 40-year maximum he could have received. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(d) (1995)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, 2252A(b)(2); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the district court explained that it considered the information in the presentence investigation report and the parties\u2019 arguments and concluded that the section 3553(a) factors coincided with the Guidelines range. The court specifically considered Lake\u2019s prior history\u2014which included a prior state conviction for lewd and lascivious conduct on a child and a pending state charge for sexual abuse of an eight-year-old boy that led to the instant federal charges\u2014and the serious nature of his crimes. The district court\u2019s statement of reasons was sufficient. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (a lengthy explanation is not necessarily required when a judge decides to follow the Guidelines in a particular case, especially where a sentencing judge has listened to the arguments of the parties, considered the supporting evidence, and was aware of the special conditions of the defendant).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Based on the factors outlined in section 3553(a) and our review of the record, we conclude that Lake has not carried his burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-11\">. The district court sentenced Lake to 120 months' imprisonment on each of the two production counts and 65 months\u2019 imprisonment and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on the two possession counts, with the sentences to run consecutive to one another pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">. The government asserts that Lake did not object to the sentence as unreasonable in the district court and we should review his present challenge only for plain error. But we need not decide this issue because, even under a reasonableness standard, Lake\u2019s appeal fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">. Lake did not object to\u2014nor does he presently contest\u2014the Guidelines\u2019 calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\">. The 1995 version of the statute applies to Lake\u2019s offense because that is when he produced the pornographic images.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b764-16\">. Lake contends that his 365-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is more than 3 times the 10-year statutory maximum for each offense; but Lake fails to appreciate that he pled guilty to 4 offenses, each carrying a 10-year statutory maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b764-17\">. Lake's argument that the district court gave unreasonable weight to the Guidelines is without merit and belied by the record. The district court clearly considered the section 3553(a) factors and the court can determine the appropriate weight to give the Guidelines after considering those factors. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006) <em>cert. dismissed, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007), <em>abrogated in part on different grounds by Kimbrough v.
