The BIA determined, among other things, that the motion was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">This court cannot undertake review of an agency\u2019s discretionary determination where there is \u201cno meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). There are no guidelines directing the BIA\u2019s decision whether to reconsider on its own motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Therefore, this court has no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Kierewicz\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004) (concluding that appellate courts were precluded from reviewing an immigration judge\u2019s denial of an untimely motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Accordingly, Kierewicz\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
