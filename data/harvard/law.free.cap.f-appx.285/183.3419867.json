Samtani contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that Texas provides a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy to his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-18\">Samtani is a property owner who filed the underlying 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that the Defendants fraudulently increased his property taxes for personal gain and threatened him with foreclosure. He sought various forms of injunctive relief, including lowering and capping the appraised value of his property, preventing future increases in the property\u2019s value, and barring Defendants from making any future assessments on his property without prior authorization by the district court. He also sought money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-21\">The Defendants filed motions to dismiss, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>the Tax Injunction Act. The Act provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-22\">The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-23\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The Defendants argued that Samtani\u2019s claims challenging the County\u2019s assessment or collection of his property tax and his federal constitutional claims could both be heard in Texas courts. The district court agreed and granted the Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-24\">The Tax Injunction Act bars a federal district court from asserting jurisdiction over a taxpayer\u2019s suit unless the State fails to supply a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy for the taxpayer\u2019s claim. <em>See Smith v. Travis County Educ. Dist., </em>968 F.2d 453, 456 (5th Cir.1992). We have previously acknowledged that Texas state courts provide such a remedy for tax complaints like Samtani\u2019s. <em>See McQueen v. Bullock, </em>907 F.2d 1544, 1548 n. 9 (5th Cir.1990). Because the state courts also provide a procedural vehicle for taxpayers\u2019 federal constitutional claims, including a \u201cfull hearing and judicial determination, with ultimate review available in the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ed States Supreme Court,\u201d Texas provides an adequate remedy for Samtani\u2019s constitutional claims as well. <em>Smith, </em>968 F.2d at 456 (quotation marks omitted) (Act bars taxpayers\u2019 federal due process claim); <em>see also Clark v. Andrews County Appraisal Dist., </em>76 FedAppx. 525, 526 (5th Cir.2003) (unpublished) (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment challenges against county taxing authorities could be fully adjudicated in Texas state court).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Although a plaintiff could potentially show that such remedies were not available to him because the state courts have refused to entertain his federal claims, or the state remedy is uncertain or speculative, <em>see Smith, </em>968 F.2d at 456, that is not the case here. Samtani\u2019s claim that his state court suit was not entertained is belied by the fact that he terminated the action himself by filing a \u201cmotion to non-suit.\u201d Nor do Samtani\u2019s provocative allegations against unnamed \u201clocal judges\u201d provide a legitimate basis to question the adequacy of the state remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In light of the foregoing, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
