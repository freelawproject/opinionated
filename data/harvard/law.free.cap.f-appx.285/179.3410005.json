Vicente-Vasquez argues that the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.CrimP. 32(i)(3)(B) because the court did not resolve the factual dispute concerning whether he was entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Vicente-Vasquez did not object at sentencing regarding the district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 32. Accordingly, we will apply plain error review. <em>See United States v. Reyna, </em>358 F.3d 344, 349-50 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-24\">When a portion of the PSR is disputed or there is any other controverted matter, Rule 32(i)(3)(B) requires a district court to \u201crule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). The district court\u2019s adoption of the PSR will satisfy Rule 32 \u201cwhen the findings in the PSR are so clear that the reviewing court is not left to second-guess the basis for the sentencing decision.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.Sd 1225, 1231 (5th Cir.1994). In the instant case, the record shows that the district court\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing indicated that the court was overruling Vicente-Vasquez\u2019s objections and accepting the PSR\u2019s sentencing recommendation. Furthermore, the district court specifically adopted the PSR\u2019s factual findings and guideline application. Accordingly, the district court satisfied the requirements of Rule 32. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Vicente-Vasquez also argues that the district court erred in not adjusting his offense level downward for acceptance of responsibility. He asserts that he truthfully admitted all conduct concerning the offense of conviction and did not falsely or frivolously deny any relevant conduct in which he was involved. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that he is entitled to a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SE1.1. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>915 F.2d 947, 950 (5th Cir.1990). Consideration may be given to whether the defendant truthfully admitted or falsely denied any additional relevant conduct for which he was accountable. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(a)). We examine the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 705 (5th Cir.2003). We will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is without foundation. <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Vicente-Vasquez repeatedly disputed that he was involved in two prior instances of transporting illegal aliens. The district court determined that Vicente-Vasquez\u2019s disavowal was not credible. Because Vicente-Vasquez falsely denied engaging in the relevant conduct, he acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l). Furthermore, the record contained evidence upon which the district court could base its finding that Vicente-Vasquez falsely denied his involvement in the relevant conduct. Therefore, the district court\u2019s ruling is not without foundation. <em>See Solis, </em>299 F.3d at 458. The district court did not err in refusing to make an adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-25\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir.
