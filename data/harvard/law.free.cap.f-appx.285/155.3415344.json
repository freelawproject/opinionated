In his complaint, he alleges that Union Pacific is an agency of the United States. The Government filed a motion to dismiss contending that, among other reasons, the federal courts are without subject matter jurisdiction, because the Union Pacific is not an agency of the United States, and therefore Gaddis\u2019s claim is not cognizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The district court agreed and dismissed the case without prejudice for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-20\">\u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute ... which is not to be expanded by judicial decree.... It is to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction ... and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). We take judicial notice that Union Pacific is not a federal agency but a private corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore tort claims against Union Pacific are not cognizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act because Union Pacific is not a federal agency. <em>See Bazile v. Burge, </em>66 F.3d 321, 1995 WL 535100, at *1 (5th Cir.
