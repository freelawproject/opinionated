Glover argues that the district court erred when it denied the motion to withdraw filed by his counsel after Glover\u2019s notice of appeal and that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm Glover\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">We do not consider Glover\u2019s first argument. The denial of the motion to withdraw occurred after Glover filed his notice of appeal, and Glover did not file an amended notice of appeal. Because an appeal from a final judgment \u201cbrings up for review ... preceding nonfinal order[s]\u201d only, we lack jurisdiction to review the later denial of the motion to withdraw. <em>See Kirkland v. Nat\u2019l Mortgage Network, Inc., </em>884 F.2d 1367, 1369-70 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Our review involves an examination of the totality of the circumstances, including whether the statutory factors for sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), support the challenged sentence. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597-600. We defer to the judgment of the district court in the weight given to the factors in section 3553(a) unless the district court has made \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d and has imposed \u201ca sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">Glover has failed to establish that his sentence is unreasonable. The sentence for 114 months was near the low end of the advisory guideline range of 108 to 135 months. The district court weighed the factors in section 3553(a) and did not make any clear error of judgment. The district court reasonably determined that this sentence was not greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">Glover\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
