The only issue in the petition for review is whether Waffi\u2019s conviction under Virginia law for taking indecent liberties with a child, Va. Code. Ann. \u00a7 18.2-370 (Supp.2007), was properly considered by the Board to be sexual abuse of a minor. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-20\">Although this court typically lacks jurisdiction over petitions for review filed by criminal aliens such as Waffi, <em>'see 8 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (West 2005), we retain jurisdiction to consider constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>al claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 278 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We note the Board properly considered the question of whether Waffi\u2019s conviction could be considered sexual abuse of a minor by using the categorical approach. <em>Mbea, </em>482 F.3d at 279. Under this approach, the court \u201clook[s] only to the statutory definition of the state crime and the fact of conviction to determine whether the conduct criminalized by the statute, including the most innocent conduct, qualifies as [sexual abuse of a minor].\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Ibarra, </em>522 F.3d 343, 348 (4th Cir.2008). We agree with the Board\u2019s conclusion. We find the Virginia statute can be considered sexual abuse of a minor under the categorical approach because the statute entails \u201cthe perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual' gratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral ai\u2019gument because the facts and legal contentions are .adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
