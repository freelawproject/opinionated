He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of audita querela, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), in which he asserted that the district court wrongly found him to be a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines in light of <em>United States v. Cheramie, </em>51 F.3d 538 (5th Cir.1995). Ha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ney has not established that his <em>Cheramie </em>claim constitutes a \u201cgap\u201d in the federal postconviction structure warranting the extraordinary writ. <em>See United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.Sd 354, 356 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>945 F.2d 862, 865 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 211-14 (5th Cir.2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Haney also asks this court to recall the mandate on his direct appeal so that he may raise his <em>Cheramie </em>claim. Because Haney did not argue on direct appeal that his underlying conspiracy conviction cannot serve as a predicate offense for a career offender finding under the Guidelines, he is not entitled to a recall of the mandate. <em>See In re Kunkle, </em>398 F.3d 683, 685 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005). Haney\u2019s motion is thus DENIED. Haney\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
