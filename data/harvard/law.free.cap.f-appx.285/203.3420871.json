The jack-up rig on which Henderson worked was a \u201cvessel,\u201d <em>Demette v. Falcon Drilling Co., </em>280 F.3d 492, 498 n. 18 (5th Cir.2002), and substantial evidence supports the finding that Henderson\u2019s duties as a roustabout rendered him a member of the rig\u2019s \u201ccrew.\u201d Therefore, Henderson is excluded from coverage under the Long-shore Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3)(G), and the Benefits Review Board properly dismissed Henderson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Petition for review is DENIED.
