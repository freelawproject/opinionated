After the child did not return to Germany following a scheduled visit with Respondent in San Antonio, Petitioner filed a petition in the district court seeking return of the child under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11601-11611. The court granted the petition and ordered Respondent to return the child to Germany. The court also granted Petitioner\u2019s unopposed motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs totaling $28,162.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Despite failing to object to Petitioner\u2019s motion in the district court, Respondent appeals the order granting the motion, arguing that: (1) the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition; (2) Petitioner failed to follow the district court\u2019s local rules in filing the motion; and (3) the attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded were \u201cclearly excessive.\u201d The first argument is patently frivolous. As the district court noted in its October 30, 2007 order, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11603(a) grants \u201c[t]he courts of the States and the United States district courts ... concurrent original jurisdiction of actions arising under the Convention [on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction!.\u201d Respondent\u2019s failure to object to Petitioner\u2019s motion in the district court precludes our consideration of the second and third arguments. <em>See, e.g., LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Arguments not raised before the district court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
