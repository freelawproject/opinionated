He also argues that Amendment 505 should be applied in his case. However, Gonzalez did not raise this issue in the district court, and it will not be considered on appeal. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>915 F.2d 959, 964 (5th Cir.1990). Moreover, this court has previously addressed this argument in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-20\">Gonzalez contends that Amendment 599 should be applied in his case. He argues that the firearm enhancement he received resulted in double counting under the provisions of Amendment 599. Because Gonzalez was convicted of offenses arising under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, Amendment 599 is inapplicable to his case. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>273 F.3d 636, 643-44 (5th Cir.2001). His argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">Gonzalez argues that Amendment 591 is retroactively applicable to his case. He asserts that his sentence was improperly calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 rather than \u00a7 2D1.5. However, Gonzalez\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>tence was calculated by using \u00a7 2D1.5 to determine the base offense level, which referenced the drug quantity table of \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d at 983. Additionally, Amendment 591 is irrelevant to the determination of base offense levels within the applicable offense guidelines section or to any consideration of relevant conduct. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amendment 591 (Nov. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
