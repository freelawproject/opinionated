Stoecklin, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to vacate its order granting the government\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment in an action to set aside Stoecklin\u2019s fraudulent conveyance of property, reclaim his unpaid tax liability, and sell the property to satisfy the unpaid tax liability under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7402. On appeal, Stoecklin argues that the district court erred in denying his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to vacate because the government and the county recorder conspired to record fraudulently the federal tax liens on his property without proper certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-27\">Normally, we review a district court\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.CivP. 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Turner v. Sec\u2019y of Air Force, </em>944 F.2d 804, 807 (11th Cir.1991). Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), \u201cthe court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d because of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). \u201cThis rule does not limit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>court\u2019s power to ... set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d). \u201c[Ojnly the most egregious misconduct, such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury, or the fabrication of evidence by a party in which an attorney is implicated, will constitute a fraud on the court.\u201d <em>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1338 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cLess egregious misconduct, such as nondisclosure to the court of facts allegedly pertinent to the matter before it, will not ordinarily rise to the level of fraud on the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cit is necessary to show an unconscionable plan or scheme which is designed to improperly influence the court in its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Motions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) must be brought \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d and a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), (2), or (3) must be filed \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). An independent action for \u201cfraud on the court\u201d under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d) may be brought at any time. <em>Rozier, </em>573 F.2d at 1337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Because the record demonstrates that Stoecklin filed his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) motion nearly 12 years after the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the government, we conclude that it was not timely filed under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Stoecklin\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
