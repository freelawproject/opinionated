Borjas-Andrade argues that the district court improperly increased his offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-22\">Under the Guidelines, if a defendant possesses a dangerous weapon in relation to a drug offense, his offense level is increased by 2 levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The commentary provides that the weapon enhancement should be applied if a weapon was present, unless it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected to the offense, and gives an unloaded hunting rifle in a residential closet as an example of clear improbability. <em>Id. </em>comt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">Here, the district court properly applied the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement for the presence of dangerous weapons, because two weapons were available to protect the 4,200 pounds of cocaine onboard the subject vessel. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
