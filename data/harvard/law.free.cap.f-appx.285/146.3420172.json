Monjaraz argues that the district court abused its discretion by upwardly departing from the guidelines sentence range based upon his criminal history because his criminal history was not sufficiently egregious to justify an upward departure from criminal history category VI. He maintains that the extent of the departure was arbitrary and not supported by the record. Monjaraz additionally argues that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not consider his proffered mitigation based upon his ties to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court may impose three types of sentences: \u201c(1) a sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range; (2) a sentence that includes an upward or downward departure as allowed by the Guidelines, which sentence is also a Guideline sentence; or (3) a non-Guideline sentence w7hieh is either higher or lower than the relevant Guideline sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 525 (5th Cir.2006). The sentence in this case was a guidelines sentence with an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Monjaraz had 21 criminal history points, far more than the 13 points needed for criminal history category VI. He was also apprehended for being unlawfully present in the United States following removal on two occasions, but he was removed without being criminally charged. While Monjaraz argued that these removals were akin to an arrest record that should not be considered for purposes of making an upward departure, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3), the removals were properly considered by the district court as prior civil adjudications of similar misconduct and similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(C), (E). Given Monjaraz\u2019s long criminal record and repeated unlawful presence in the United States, the district court did not abuse its discretion by making an upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3. <em>See United States v. Pennington, </em>9 F.3d 1116, 1118 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Medina-Gutierrez, </em>980 F.2d 980, 984 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Although the district court did not discuss its reasons why intervening offense levels were inadequate, those reasons can be gleaned from the court\u2019s discussion justifying the upward departure. Monjaraz has not shown that the district court made a procedural error in applying the upward departure. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Given that the district court made no significant procedural error when it upwardly departed, we next look to whether the sentence was substantively reasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court imposed a sentence of 71 months of imprisonment, 80 months greater than the upper limit of the guidelines sentence range applicable without the upward departure. Given Monjaraz\u2019s extensive criminal record, Monjaraz has not shown that the extent of the departure was an abuse of discretion or that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 346-48; <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. McKenzie, </em>991 F.2d 203, 205 n. 7, 206 n. 8 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
