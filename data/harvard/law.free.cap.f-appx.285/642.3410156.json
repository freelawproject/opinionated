He was also convicted of three counts of use of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). Prior to the issuance of the indictment under which the instant convictions were obtained, the grand jury issued an indictment charging Branham with a sole count of conspiracy to rob a commercial business, and, upon his motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162 <em>et seq., </em>the district court dismissed the indictment without prejudice. The grand jury then re-indicted Branham for the multiple counts that lead to the convictions at issue here. At sentencing, he objected that the indictment on heightened charges had been the result of vindictive prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-21\">On appeal, Branham argues, first, that the district court erred by dismissing the original indictment without prejudice, thus allowing the government to re-indict him. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s determination of whether the dismissal of a case for a Speedy Trial Act violation should be with or without prejudice. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>183 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir.1999). We have noted that, in deciding whether to dismiss an indictment for a violation of the Speedy Trial Act with or without prejudice, \u201cthere is no preference for one type of dismissal over the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310. However, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>making the determination, the court is to consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 8162(a) of the Act: (1) \u201cthe seriousness of the offense;\u201d (2) \u201cthe facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal;\u201d and (3) \u201cthe impact of a reprosecution on the administration of [the Speedy Trial Act] and on the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">With regard to the first factor, we have noted that \u201cwhere the crime charged is serious, the court should dismiss only for a correspondingly severe delay,\u201d and noting that while the defendant\u2019s drug charge was serious, a delay of \u201cseveral months\u201d militated toward a finding that dismissal with prejudice was proper. <em>United States v. Russo, </em>741 F.2d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.1984). Regarding the second factor, in <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>835 F.2d 830, 834-35 (11th Cir.1988), we instructed the district court to dismiss an indictment without prejudice where the delay in trial had resulted from \u201cnegligence and oversight\u201d on the part of the prosecutor and the district court, rather than \u201cintentional delay.\u201d Addressing the third factor, we have recognized that the interests in the administration of justice and speedy prosecution may neutralize one another. <em>Russo, </em>741 F.2d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The delay at issue here was only four days. Importantly, there is no indication in the record that the delay was the result of any intentional delay by the government; instead, it was the result of scheduling difficulties in the district court due to the judge\u2019s illness. Because the bank robbery offenses were serious in nature, and the Speedy Trial Act violation that resulted in dismissal of the original indictment was not due to a severe delay, nor an intentional act by the government, we hold that the district court did not err by dismissing the original indictment without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Branham also argues on appeal that because the original indictment exposed him to fewer charges and less prison time than the indictment under which he ultimately was convicted, his re-indictment on heightened charges constituted prosecutorial vindictiveness. He asserts that because the first and subsequent indictments both arose out of the same conduct, the re-indictment on heightened charges was the result of prosecutorial vindictiveness. However, Branham failed to seek dismissal of the second indictment on the basis of prosecutorial vindictiveness prior to trial and only raised this challenge for the first time at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">We have noted that a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct must be raised prior to trial, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B), or it otherwise is waived. <em>See United States v. Dulcio, </em>441 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>937 F.2d 1257, 1261 (7th Cir.1991)); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B) (requiring defendants to raise \u201ca motion alleging a defect in the indictment or information\u201d prior to trial). Because Branham did not move to dismiss the second indictment on the basis of prosecutorial vindictiveness prior to his trial, he waived objection to the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Therefore, Branham\u2019s convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"AmL\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\">. Even were we to consider Branham\u2019s prosecutorial vindictiveness challenge under the plain error standard, pursuant to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>492 F.3d 1219, 1221-22 (11th Cir.2007), we note that the law is not clear that a presumption of vindictiveness would arise in a context like the instant one, where the defendant is re-indicted on heightened charges following the exercise of a right prior to trial. <em>See United States v. Barner, </em>441 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2006) (\"While a prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek heightened charges after a successful post-trial appeal is enough to invoke a presumption of vindictiveness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>proof of a prosecutorial decision to increase charges after a defendant has exercised a legal right does not alone give rise to a presumption in the pretrial context.\" (internal quotations and citations omitted)). We would not, therefore, find this to be a case of plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
