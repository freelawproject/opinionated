We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Parties \u2022 are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

The notice of appeal was filed on February 22, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Pipkin failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\">. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. Fed.

Insofar as Pipkin claims he sent letters indicating his desire to appeal to the district court and this court prior to the February 22, 2008, notice of appeal, there is nothing on either court\u2019s docket sheet showing he sent such letters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
