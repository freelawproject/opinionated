(\u201cCovenant\u201d), Mei Yong \u201cBilly\u201d Xiao, and China Buffet, L.L.C. (collectively referred to as \u201cthe Appellants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City of Monroe (\u201cMonroe\u201d or \u201cthe City\u201d) in this suit challenging the constitutionality of the City\u2019s sign ordinance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">In July and August of 2004, Covenant, a company in the business of erecting and operating advertising signs for various businesses and organizations, leased property in Monroe from Mei Yong \u201cBilly\u201d Xiao and his business the China Buffet, L.L.C., for the purpose of erecting billboards. The Appellants applied for seven advertising sign permits, and within five days of submission, the City denied the applications on grounds that the proposed billboards violated the City\u2019s sign regulations, which restrict the size, location, and spacing of billboards. Specifically, the City stated that the area of each proposed billboard totaled 672 square feet per side, in violation of the size restriction limiting the area of billboards to 250 square feet per side. (J.A. at 116.) <em>See </em>City of Monroe Land-Use Ordinance \u00a7 156.133(S)(2)(a) (J.A. at 66). Also, all but one of the proposed sign locations placed the proposed billboards within 1,000 feet of a preexisting billboard, and the site plan for the proposed China Buffet billboard placed it within 50 feet of a building, all contrary to the City\u2019s billboard location setback and spacing restrictions. <em>See </em>City of Monroe Land-Use Ordinance \u00a7 156.133(S)(2)(c)(i), (iii) (J.A. at 66, 67).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-16\">The Appellants brought suit in November 2004 on First Amendment grounds, claiming, in relevant part, that the City\u2019s ordinance unconstitutionally favors commercial speech, lacks procedural safeguards, grants City officials an impermissible level of discretion, is overbroad in its application, and contains improper time, place, and manner restrictions. They sought damages and injunctive relief <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). The City moved for summary judgment, asserting that the Appellants lacked standing to challenge any provisions of the ordinance other than those that formed the basis of the City\u2019s denial of their permit applications. The district court granted summary judgment to the City, concluding that the Appellants suffered no constitutional injury to satisfy Article III standing requirements because the \u201cpermits were denied on the content-neutral and constitutionally valid restrictions of height [size], setback and spacing.\u201d (J.A. at 289.) The district court also rejected the Appellants\u2019 over-breadth challenge for lack of injury in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standards as the district court and construing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Darveau v. Detecon, Inc., </em>515 F.3d 334, 338 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d). We also apply de novo review to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding Article III standing. <em>See Covenant Media of S.C., L.L.C. v. City of N. Charleston, </em>493 F.3d 421, 428 (4th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 914, 169 L.Ed.2d 731 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">As an initial matter, the Appellants assert that the district court impermissibly made factual findings and failed to draw inferences from the record in their favor, citing the district court\u2019s factual recitation of background material relating to other businesses owned by Covenant\u2019s owners and their litigation strategies in other states. After carefully reviewing the record in this case, we conclude that the district court did not improperly resolve any genuine issues of material fact. The disputed background material was not essential to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, and there is no dispute regarding the material facts of this case. The Appellants sought to erect billboards in Monroe that violated the ordinance\u2019s size, location, and spacing restrictions, and the City promptly rejected each application on these grounds. Any matters dealing with the business or litigation practices of Covenant\u2019s owners and their other business ventures are not material to the resolution of this dispute. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\u201cOnly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d); <em>see also Drewitt v. Pratt, </em>999 F.2d 774, 778 (4th Cir.1993) (same). The Appellants have not identified any genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The Appellants assert that the district court\u2019s standing analysis is flawed because the court addressed the merits of their constitutional claims in concluding that they lacked standing. We agree that it is inappropriate to first consider the merits of a claim when determining whether a party has standing under Article III of the Constitution. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (noting that \u201cstanding in no way depends on the merits\u201d of the claim); <em>Covenant Media of S.C., </em>493 F.3d at 429 (holding that the standing analysis must not be confused with the merits of a case because \u201c[a] plaintiffs standing to bring a case does not depend upon his ultimate success on the merits underlying his case\u201d). On the other hand, we also acknowledge the reality that, \u201cbecause standing is addressed on a claim by claim basis, an unfavorable decision on the merits of one claim may well defeat standing on another claim if it defeats the plaintiffs ability to seek redress.\u201d <em>Get Outdoors II, L.L.C. v. City of San Diego, </em>506 F.3d 886, 893 (9th Cir.2007). Despite any flaws in the district court\u2019s analysis, we \u201ccan affirm on any basis fairly supported by the record.\u201d <em>Eisenberg v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., </em>301 F.3d 220, 222 (4th Cir.2002). After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we find no reversible error, and for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court reached the correct result in granting summary judgment to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"A58\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>It is well established that standing is a threshold jurisdictional issue that must be determined first because \u201c[wjithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.\u201d <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Pye v. United States, </em>269 F.3d 459, 466 (4th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Steel Co., </em>523 U.S. at 102, 118 S.Ct. 1003). The \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of standing\u201d consists of three elements. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). First, there must be \u201can \u2018injury in fact\u2019\u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest\u201d that is both \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d as well as \u201cactual or imminent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSecond, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\u2019 such that the injury can be said \u201cto be fairly traceable\u201d to the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Third, there must be a likelihood \u201cthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Covenant Media of S.C., </em>493 F.3d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">When challenging an ordinance, even though \u201cthere is broad \u2018latitude given facial challenges in the First Amendment context,\u2019 a plaintiff must establish that he has standing to challenge each provision of an ordinance by showing that he was injured by application of those provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429-30 (quoting <em>Gonzales v. Carhart, </em>550 U.S. 124, 127 S.Ct. 1610, 1639, 167 L.Ed.2d 480 (2007)). Thus, a finding that a plaintiff has standing to bring suit challenging one provision of an ordinance \u201cdoes not provide it a passport to explore the constitutionality of every provision of [a] [s]ign [regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429. Accordingly, we must consider standing independently with regard to each provision challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We first address whether the Appellants have standing to assert an as-applied challenge to the size restriction. There is no dispute that (1) the City denied the Appellants\u2019 permit applications\u2014a concrete injury; (2) this denial was the direct result of the City applying the sign ordinance\u2019s 250-square-foot size restriction\u2014causation; and (3) there is a likelihood of redress from a favorable decision by this court if the provisions challenged are all found to be unconstitutional. <em>But cf. Maverick Media Group, Inc. v. Hillsborough County, Fla., </em>528 F.3d 817 (11th Cir.2008) (and cases cited therein indicating that a sign permit applicant lacks a redressable injury to challenge the constitutionality of a sign ordinance where the permit could have been denied on the basis of some alternate but unchallenged regulation). The Appellants challenged all three bases for the denial of their permit applications, thus there is a likelihood of re-' dressability unless one of the grounds for denial is found to be constitutional. We conclude that they have standing to challenge the size restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Billboards are subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. \u201c[W]e begin with the venerable principle that \u2018each medium of expression must be assessed for First Amendment purposes by standards suited to it, for each may present its own problems.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arlington County Republican Comm. v. Arlington County, </em>983 F.2d 587, 591 (4th Cir.1993) (alterations omitted) (quoting <em>S.E. Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 557, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975)). Billboards are large, permanent structures, designed to stand out, and thus they \u201ccreate[] a unique set of problems for land-use planning and development.\u201d <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, </em>453 U.S. 490, 502, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>800 (1981) (plurality). In this context, the Supreme Court has \u201cobserved that time, place, and manner restrictions are permissible if they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, serve a significant governmental interest, and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The sign ordinance at issue defines billboards as off-premises, outdoor structures of display, either freestanding or attached to a building, <em>see </em>City of Monroe Land-Use Ordinance \u00a7 156.14 (J.A. at 73), without any distinction based on the content of the messages displayed. The prohibition of billboards exceeding 250 square feet in area per side likewise makes no content-based distinctions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 156.133(S)(2)(a) (J.A. at 66). There is no dispute that billboards may include either commercial or noncommercial messages and that all billboards are subject to this size restriction. We conclude that the City\u2019s billboard size restriction is a content-neutral regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The Appellants assert that the ordinance is content-based due to distinctions born out of the definition of \u201con-premise\u201d and \u201coff-premise\u201d signs in section 156.133(C) of the ordinance. (J.A. at 53.) They argue that these underlying definitions result in more favorable spacing and location restrictions for on-premises commercial signs, but they point to no more favorable size restrictions to support their argument. In fact, the on-premises commercial size limitations are much more restrictive, and neither commercial on-premises signs nor any off-premises signs are permitted to exceed the 250-square-foot size restriction that applies to all billboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The Appellants assert that the size restriction is not narrowly tailored to meet a substantial government interest, but again, the record does not support their assertion. The express purpose of the ordinance is to maintain public and traffic safety and to enhance the aesthetic appearance and attractiveness of the community. <em>See </em>City of Monroe Land-Use Ordinance \u00a7 156.133(A) (J.A. at 53). Settled authority in this circuit, as well as in the Supreme Court, recognizes that, in the context of billboards, safety and aesthetics are substantial government interests, and that \u201c \u2018a city may justifiably prohibit all off-premise signs or billboards for aesthetic and safety reasons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Adver. Co. v. City of Raleigh, </em>947 F.2d 1158, 1168 (4th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Major Media of the S.E. v. City of Raleigh, </em>792 F.2d 1269, 1272 (4th Cir.1986), which cites <em>Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 508-11, 101 S.Ct. 2882), <em>cert. denied, </em>504 U.S. 931, 112 S.Ct. 1997, 118 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992); <em>see also Arlington County Republican Comm., </em>983 F.2d at 591 (noting that in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Metromedia </em>decision, \u201cwithout an impermissible preference of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, seven Justices would have upheld the prohibition on billboards as an acceptable means to promote aesthetics and traffic safety.\u201d); <em>Naegele Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. City of Durham, </em>844 F.2d 172, 173-74 (4th Cir.1988) (finding no free speech violation where the ordinance banned all commercial, off-premises billboards and avoided any preference of commercial over noncommercial speech).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The content-neutral 250-square-foot size limitation furthers the City\u2019s substantial interests in traffic safety and aesthetics by permitting billboards only in certain areas and limiting their size. The City\u2019s size restriction is \u201cnot substantially broader than necessary to protect the [CJity\u2019s interests in traffic safety and aesthetics, and directly advance[s] the [Cjity\u2019s interests\u201d; additionally, it leaves open ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>alternative avenues of communication by not banning all billboards. <em>See Get Outdoors II, </em>506 F.3d at 894. We conclude that the size restriction is constitutional, and each one of the Appellants\u2019 permit applications was properly rejected on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Our conclusion on the merits of the constitutional challenge to the size restriction defeats standing on the Appellants\u2019 remaining as-applied claims. Because the permit applications were properly denied on the basis of the independently constitutional size restriction, the Appellants lack a redressable constitutional injury to support their challenges to the location and spacing restrictions. <em>See id. </em>at 893 (finding no redressability and thus not reaching additional challenges to an ordinance after one restriction was found to be constitutionally valid); <em>Covenant Media of S.C., </em>493 F.3d at 430 (finding no constitutional injury where the permit applications could not be approved due to an unchallenged spacing violation, regardless of whether other substantive provisions are held to be unconstitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Appellants also assert a facial over-breadth claim, arguing that they should have been permitted to challenge other provisions of the ordinance. The over-breadth doctrine constitutes \u201c \u2018a departure from traditional rules of standing\u2019 \u201d by permitting an individual to challenge a regulation on the theory that it threatens the speech of others. <em>Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, </em>303 F.3d 507, 512 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)). It does not, however, eliminate the need to demonstrate an injury in fact. <em>See Peterson v. Nat\u2019l Telecomm. &amp; Info. Admin., </em>478 F.3d 626, 634 (4th Cir.2007). Only those \u201cwho have suffered some injury from the application of the contested provisions to begin with\u201d may bring an overbreadth challenge. <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, because the permit applications were timely denied on the basis of a valid size restriction, the Appellants cannot demonstrate an injury in fact or redressability under any other provision of the ordinance. <em>See Covenant Media of S.C., </em>493 F.3d at 430 (noting that because the application violated the unchallenged spacing requirement, it could not have been approved regardless of whether other provisions could be found to be unconstitutional, and thus, there was no substantive constitutional injury due to other provisions that might have been unconstitutional); <em>see also Advantage Media, L.L.C. v. City of Eden Prairie, </em>456 F.3d 793, 801 (8th Cir.2006) (finding that the plaintiff had no standing to challenge restrictions or procedures that were not factors in the denial of its own permit applications).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The Appellants argue that the prospect of a prior restraint of speech due to a lack of procedures in the permit application process and the unbridled discretion of City officials can constitute an actual injury for an overbreadth challenge. The Supreme Court has \u201clong held that when a licensing statute allegedly vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity, one who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without the necessity of first applying for, and being denied, a license.\u201d <em>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ\u2019g. Co., </em>486 U.S. 750, 755-56, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988). The injury arises in that instance from the prospect of self censorship; \u201cthe mere existence of the licensor\u2019s unfettered discretion, coupled with the power of prior restraint, intimidates parties into censoring their own speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757, 108 S.Ct. 2138; <em>see Prime Media, Inc. v. City of Brentwood, </em>485 F.3d 343, 351 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>2007) (holding that \u201cthe prospect of prior restraint and resulting self-censorship can itself constitute the required actual injury\u201d for Article III standing purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Appellants do not assert that they were intimidated into censoring their own speech. To the contrary, they submitted to the permit process, and the record establishes that the City denied their permit applications in a timely manner in part on the basis of the billboard size restriction, which we have found to be constitutional. No change in the permit procedures would result in the approval of their applications to erect oversized billboards. There is no suggestion that they intend to file future applications that would comply with the size restriction or that they are fearful to submit such an application. <em>See Get Outdoors II, </em>506 F.3d at 895 (holding plaintiff lacked standing to bring a prior restraint claim where its applications were denied on constitutionally valid grounds and the plaintiff did not show an intent to file permit applications that comply with the valid requirements). Thus, the Appellants suffer no threat of prior restraint and lack standing to bring the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-12\"> The Appellants withdrew their request for injunctive relief after the City adopted a new sign ordinance in April 2006, and they do not challenge the new ordinance in this appeal.
