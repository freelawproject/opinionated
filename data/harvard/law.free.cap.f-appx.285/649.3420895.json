King argues that (1)- the evidence seized during a search of her codefendant\u2019s residence should have' been suppressed because law enforcement lacked probable cause to arrest her, and (2) the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to support her convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">I. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b678-20\">\u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question -of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999). We accept the district court\u2019s factual findings as true unless the findings are shown to-be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>All facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts is reviewed de novo.' <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>A district court does not err when it admits evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant, and the \u201cconstitutional search and seizure requirements of the Fourth Amendment have been satisfied.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Majors, 196 F.3d 1206, 1216 (11th Cir.1999). If the evidence was obtained pursuant to a search warrant, then even if the arrest was unlawful, the evidence is admissible at trial. <em>United States v. Altizer, </em>477 F.2d 846, 846 (5th Cir.1973) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Because the evidence from the co-defendant\u2019s residence was seized pursuant to a valid search warrant, the evidence was admissible at King\u2019s trial regardless of whether she -was arrested without probable cause. Thus, the district court did not err when it denied King\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">II. - Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In order to convict a person under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), \u201cthe government [must] prove three elements: (1) knowledge; (2) possession; and (3) intent to distribute.\u201d <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam). Possession may -be shown by constructive possession. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2155, 167 L.Ed.2d 882 (2007). Constructive possession exists when a person has \u201cdominion or control over the drugs or over the premises where the dr\u00fcgs were located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, a defendant\u2019s mere presence in the area of contraband or awareness of its location is not sufficient to establish possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIntent to distribute can be proven circum\u2022stantially from, among other things, the quantity of cocaine and the existence of implements such as scales commonly used in connection with the distribution of cocaine.\u201d <em>Poole, </em>878 F.2d at 1392.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The evidence here was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that King had knowing possession of the narcotics with intent to distribute them. That evidence included (1) King\u2019s presence in the residence during the search that discovered a large amount of drugs out in the open; (2) her awareness of the presence of the narcotics before the date of the search; (3) her possession of large sums of cash; (4) indications that she and the codefendant in whose residence the drugs were discovered held themselves out as married; (5) the presence of prepackaged crack cocaine and a scale at the residence; and (6) the sale of crack cocaine by King prior to the search and arrest. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it denied King\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">After a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that the district court did not err, and affirm King\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-13\">. Although King mentions her motion for a new trial in her brief, she did not sufficiently raise the argument that the district court abused its discretion by denying her motion for a new trial because she did not argue it \"plainly and prominently.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
