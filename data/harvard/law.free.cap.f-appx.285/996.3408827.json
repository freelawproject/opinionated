Furthermore, she has raised no specific claim regarding the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, these claims are abandoned. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (holding failure to raise specific issue in opening brief constitutes abandonment of that issue under Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-23\">Liu also contends the Board and the immigration judge erred in denying her request for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n.13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>(4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2007). Based on our review of the record, we find that Liu failed to make the requisite showing. We therefore uphold the denial of her request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Accordingly, we deny Liu\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
