The BIA concluded that Nayani was deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D) and inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) because Nayani made a false claim of citizenship on an application for a loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">Nayani argues that his false claim of citizenship on the SBA form does not render him deportable or inadmissible because, although the Small Business Administration Aci (the Act) is a federal law, his false claim of citizenship was not made for a purpose or benefit thereunder. Nayani argues that recipients of SBA loans are not required to be citizens or lawful permanent residents and that he did not actually receive a benefit under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-22\">The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Brieva-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 356, 359 (5th Cir.2007). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s construction of immigration statutes, the court will defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute and if Congress has not evidenced clear and unambiguous intent concerning the question before the court. <em>White v. INS, </em>75 F.3d 213, 215 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-13, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). Under this standard, the court will not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA; we may, though, reject any BIA interpretation that is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>trary to the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844,104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The BIA concluded that there was a purpose to Nayani\u2019s false claim of citizenship because, under the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(i), SBA funds may not be used to provide any direct benefit or assistance to anyone in the United States unlawfully, as Nayani concedes he was when he signed the SBA application. Further, the BIA found that Nayani made the false claim of citizenship with the intent that he receive a benefit from signing the SBA application. This finding was supported by substantial evidence. The BIA\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cpurpose or benefits\u201d clause of Sections 1227(a)(3)(D) and 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii), an interpretation focusing on Nayani\u2019s intent rather than actual benefits received, was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to [a] statute\u201d and is therefore deserving of our deference. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Nayani\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
