Its orders of detention as to both defendants are supported by the proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order of detention as to Vernon Gaville and its order of detention as to Michael Walker.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
