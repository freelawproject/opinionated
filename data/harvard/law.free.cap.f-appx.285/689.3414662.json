After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b718-19\">Plaintiff McCray\u2019s complaint alleged that Defendant Howard struck and injured her while he resisted removal from a courtroom and later made defamatory statements about McCray during a press conference, all in violation of her due process rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-20\">A. March 31, 2006 Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b718-21\">On March 31, 2006, McCray was serving as a courtroom deputy for a F\u00falton County Superior Court Judge (\u201cthe Judge\u201d). After the jury returned a not-guilty verdict in a criminal trial, the Judge allowed the attorneys to ask the jury questions. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>fendant Howard, who was not the attorney handling the criminal case, entered the Judge\u2019s courtroom and insisted on talking to the jury. The Judge asked Howard to stop questioning the jury because he was not one of the attorneys handling the case, but Howard ignored the Judge and continued. After warning Howard at least three times, the Judge ordered that Howard be removed from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">McCray and another officer asked Howard to leave, but he again refused. According to McCray, Howard \u201cresisted being removed from the courtroom waiving his arms and attempting to fight off the Plaintiffs attempts to remove him from the courtroom and even locked his body rigid to the low rail separating the public.\u201d In the course of resisting, Howard \u201crailed that he was the District Attorney of Fulton County\u201d and struck McCray on her shoulder and chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Howard eventually was placed in handcuffs and removed from the courtroom to an adjacent detention area. When the handcuffs were removed, Howard \u201clunged aggressively toward [McCray] but was restrained by another deputy.\u201d Howard could have exited the detention area through another adjacent courtroom, but \u201cscreamed\u201d that he would only leave through the Judge\u2019s courtroom. Howard then \u201cbanged loudly\u201d on the door to the Judge\u2019s courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Howard later held a news conference in which he specifically identified McCray and stated that she was a \u201cdisgrace to the uniform,\u201d that \u201cshe did not deserve to wear the uniform,\u201d and that she \u201cdeserves to be fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">McCray\u2019s complaint alleged that her physical injuries from the altercation required her to go to the emergency room and seek further treatment from a specialist for her shoulder and rotator cuff. McCray stated that she was temporarily disabled from her injuries and missed over three months of work. McCray further alleged that she would suffer permanent impairment from her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">B. McCray\u2019s \u00a7 1983 Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">McCray filed a \u00a7 1983 complaint against Howard raising two claims. McCray\u2019s first claim was \u201cfor physical injury\u201d and alleged that Howard, under color of law as the Fulton County District Attorney, \u201cresisted, beat, and butted\u201d her, even though he knew or should have known his actions would pose a substantial risk of serious harm to McCray.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">McCray\u2019s second claim was that Howard, in retaliation against her, made slanderous statements against her in a news conference that were \u201cvindictive and untrue\u201d and damaged her reputation and ability to earn a living.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">C. Howard\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and District Court Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">Howard filed a motion to dismiss McCray\u2019s complaint and argued, <em>inter </em>alia, that McCray failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">The district court granted Howard\u2019s motion and dismissed McCray\u2019s complaint. First, the district court noted that McCray\u2019s complaint failed to identify what constitutional right Howard allegedly violated, but construed from her response to Howard\u2019s motion that she was alleging due process violations. As for McCray\u2019s \u201cphysical injur/\u2019 claim, the district court stated that conduct by a governmental actor would rise to the level of a substantive due process violation only if it could be characterized as arbitrary or conscience-shocking and determined that the facts alleged by McCray failed to rise to this level. As for McCray\u2019s slander claim, the district court determined that she failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>state a procedural due process claim because she was not discharged and thus could not show that Howard\u2019s comments deprived her of a liberty or property interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"APK\">A. Physical Injury Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">On appeal, McCray argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claim that Howard violated her substantive due process rights by striking her while he was resisting removal from the Judge\u2019s courtroom and thus injuring her. The substantive component of the Due Process Clause \u201cprotects individual liberty against \u2018certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. City of Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 1068, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992) (quoting <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 665, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986)). Substantive due process applies to \u201cthose rights that are \u2018fundamental-rights that are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skinner v. City of Miami, </em>62 F.3d 344, 347 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937)).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The Supreme Court has commented that it \u201chas always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decision-making in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended\u201d and that judicial self-restraint requires the Court \u201cto exercise the utmost care\u201d when it is asked to \u201cbreak new ground in this field.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>503 U.S. at 125, 112 S.Ct. at 1068. Specifically, state tort law \u201cremains largely outside the scope of substantive due process jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>62 F.3d at 347. Substantive due process doctrine is not a \u201cfont of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States.\u201d <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1160, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Thus, \u201ceven conduct by a government actor that would amount to an intentional tort under state law will rise to the level of a substantive due process violation only if it also \u2018shocks the conscience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waddell v. Hendry County Sheriff's Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1305 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Dacosta v. Nwachukwa, </em>304 F.3d 1045, 1048 (11th Cir.2002)). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that \u201c \u2018the measure of what is conscience-shocking is no calibrated yard stick.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 847, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1717, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998)). Negligence will not violate the Due Process Clause, and even intentional torts seldom will. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">This Court applied this standard in <em>Dacosta </em>in concluding that the plaintiff, a female student at Georgia Military College <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>(\u201cGMC\u201d), failed to state a substantive due process claim against the defendant, a male instructor at GMC. <em>Dacosta, </em>304 F.3d at 1047-49. In <em>Dacosta, </em>the plaintiff alleged that the defendant ignored her question in his class but answered similar questions from male students. <em>Id. </em>at 1047. When the plaintiff asked the same question, the defendant walked out of the classroom, and the plaintiff followed him. <em>Id. </em>After seeing that the plaintiff had left the classroom, the defendant darted back inside the classroom and slammed the door in the plaintiffs face. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff held up her arm to protect herself from the door, but her arm shattered the glass window on the door and became lodged in the cracked pane. <em>Id. </em>The defendant then violently swung the door several times in an attempt to knock the plaintiff back from the door. <em>Id. </em>After this proved unsuccessful, the defendant reached through the cracked glass pane, shoved the plaintiffs face, and tried to forcibly dislodge her arm from the window. <em>Id. </em>This Court stated that the alleged facts in <em>Dacosta </em>constituted the tort of intentional battery, but concluded that \u201csuch conduct, malicious as it may have been,\u201d did not amount to a federal constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">As in <em>Dacosta, </em>McCray\u2019s complaint alleges conduct that, if true, is unbecoming of a public official and may potentially constitute an intentional tort such as battery under state law. However, under governing precedent, this alleged conduct fails to rise to the level of \u201cconscience-shocking\u201d so as to state a claim of substantive due process. McCray\u2019s potential remedies for this conduct are in state court, but not through the federal constitution under \u00a7 1983 in this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 1049 (\u201cRemedies for batteries of this sort should be pursued in accordance with state law.\u201d). Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of McCray\u2019s claim \u201cfor physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">B. Slander Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">McCray argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claim that Howard violated her procedural due process rights by making defamatory statements about her in a press conference that were intended to disgrace her and causing her to temporarily lose her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\u201c\u2018The requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of liberty and property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Behrens v. Regier, </em>422 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colls, v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2705, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). Specifically, the Supreme Court has instructed that injury to reputation, by itself, does not constitute the deprivation of a liberty or property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Paul, </em>424 U.S. at 701-02, 712, 96 S.Ct. at 1161, 1166. In order to fall within the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause, a plaintiff must establish more than a mere defamation claim. <em>Id. </em>at 706, 96 S.Ct. at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">In <em>Paul, </em>the Supreme Court established the \u201cstigma-plus\u201d test, which requires that \u201ca plaintiff claiming a deprivation based on defamation by the government must establish the fact of the defamation \u2018plus\u2019 the violation of some more tangible interest before the plaintiff is entitled to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Cannon v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>250 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Paul, </em>424 U.S. at 701-02, 96 S.Ct. at 1161). In summarizing the requirements of the \u201cstigma-plus\u201d test, this Court has stated that \u201c \u2018[t]o establish a liberty interest sufficient to implicate the fourteenth amendment safeguards, the individual must be not only stigmatized but also stigmatized in connection with a denial of a right or status previously recognized under state law.\u2019\u201d <em>Smith ex rel. Smith v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>Siegelman, </em>322 F.3d 1290, 1296 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Cannon, </em>250 F.3d at 1302-03). \u201cIn order to establish that a deprivation of a public employee\u2019s liberty interest has occurred without due process of law, the employee must prove that: (1) a false statement (2) of a stigmatizing nature (3) attending a governmental employee\u2019s discharge (4) was made public (5) by the governmental employer (6) without a meaningful opportunity for employee name clearing.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>250 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">McCray challenges the district court\u2019s determination that she had not been discharged and had not alleged any other \u201cplus\u201d violation of a tangible interest. McCray argues the three-and-one-half months she missed work following the March 31, 2006 incident constituted a \u201cconstructive termination.\u201d Assuming, as the district court did, that McCray has a protected interest in her job, she still fails to explain how a temporary leave of absence from work constitutes a deprivation of a state-recognized liberty or property interest. <em>See Cannon, </em>250 F.3d at 1303 (\u201c[I]n this circuit a discharge or more is required in order to satisfy the \u2018plus\u2019 element of the stigma-plus test. A transfer or a missed promotion is not enough.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Further, McCray has also failed to allege: (1) that she was stigmatized \u201cin connection with\u201d a change in her employment status, because McCray alleged in her complaint that she missed work because of her physical injuries, not because of Howard\u2019s alleged defamatory statements; or (2) that Howard, the Fulton County District Attorney, was her employer. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of McCray\u2019s slander claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\">. In reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal, we accept the factual allegations in McCray\u2019s complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to her. <em>Glover v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\">. The district court also determined that McCray failed to state a substantive due process claim based on the alleged slander. On appeal, McCray makes no argument challenging this determination, and thus we decline to address it. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (stating well-settled rule that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed on appeal is deemed abandoned and will not be addressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">In addition, after dismissing McCray's federal claims, the district court stated that to the extent McCray's complaint raised state law claims, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear them. We do not address this determination by the district court because McCray has failed to challenge it on appeal as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b720-13\">.
