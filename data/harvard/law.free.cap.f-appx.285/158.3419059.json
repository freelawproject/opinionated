He served Lonnie Schmidt, a non-party, with a copy of the Receivership Order, which directed that all persons holding certain assets provide them to the receiver, but Schmidt did not adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>comply. On Warfield\u2019s petition, the court ordered Schmidt individually to turn over the assets, but he did not, nor did he appear at the show-cause hearing. The court then held him in contempt; after several years, he was finally located and taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">After an extensive period of incarceration, Schmidt agreed to comply with the court\u2019s orders and was given leave to produce relevant documents. In early January 2008, Warfield recommended that Schmidt\u2019s contempt be purged, and on June 5 the district court so ruled. Because contempt has been purged, the appeal is dismissed as moot. <em>See Port v. Heard, </em>764 F.2d 423, 426-27 (5th Cir. 1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Schmidt\u2019s \u201cMotion for Order To Show Cause Why Case Should Not Be Dismissed\u201d is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The Appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\">. In his notice of appeal, Schmidt also appeals the district court\u2019s ruling \"to keep in lull force and effect Temporary Order Placing Assets of Lonnie Schmidt and Daniel Schmidt in Receivership,\u201d a substantive challenge to the court\u2019s decision. Because Schmidt is not a party to the lawsuit, he can appeal such substantive determinations only under \u201ca rare exception to the general rule,\u201d <em>Castillo v. Cameron County, </em>238 F.3d 339, 349 (5th Cir.2001), that \"only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment,\" with \u201cthe better practice \u25a0 [being] for such a nonparty to seek intervention for purposes of appeal,\u201d <em>Marino v. Ortiz, </em>484 U.S. 301, 304, 108 S.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988). Because \"the equities weigh [against] hearing the appeal,\" <em>Castillo, </em>238 F.3d at 349 (internal citations and quotations omitted), given Schmidt\u2019s egregious conduct during the course of this suit, we do not consider this aspect of his non-party appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
