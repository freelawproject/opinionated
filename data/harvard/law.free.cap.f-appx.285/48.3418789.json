The conduct for which Lyall was convicted occurred while he was employed as a sheriff\u2019s deputy and narcotics detective. The district court sentenced Lyall to concurrent terms of 121 months\u2019 imprisonment for each count. Lyall appeals his conviction and sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">Lyall first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conspiracy convictions. Lyall alleges that his co-conspirators thought they were acting as government agents, and therefore, there was no common criminal plan. A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). \u201c[A]n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, 735 </em>F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). A verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and inquires whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">\u201cTo prove a conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the government must prove (1) an agreement between two or more persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to engage in conduct that violates a federal drug law, (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the conspiracy, and (3) the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 384-85 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 857. A defendant may be convicted of conspiracy without knowing all the conspiracy\u2019s details, as long as he joins the conspiracy understanding its unlawful nature and willfully joins in the plan on at least one occasion. <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 858. \u201cThe existence of a tacit or mutual understanding between conspirators is sufficient evidence of a conspiratorial agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Cardwell, </em>433 F.3d 378, 390 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 857 (\u201cBy its very nature, a conspiracy is clandestine and covert, thereby frequently resulting in little direct evidence of such an agreement.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">While a person cannot be convicted of conspiring with a government agent, <em>see United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 33 (4th Cir.1995), the co-conspirators in the present case were not in fact acting as government agents. Accordingly, Lyall\u2019s argument is without merit. After reviewing the evidence adduced at trial, we conclude that when the evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the Government, it is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we affirm Lyall\u2019s conspiracy convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Lyall next claims that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on findings made by the court, rather than a jury. Lyall\u2019s claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny. After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We will review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside of the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Under an advisory guidelines scheme, a district court does not violate the Sixth Amendment by making factual findings \u2018as to sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence as long as the fact-finding does not enhance the sentence beyond the maximum term specified in the substantive statute. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005) (holding \u2018that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not in the end move any decision from judge to jury, or change the burden of persuasion\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, Lyall\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Finally, Lyall challenges the factual basis of the firearm enhancement pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2005). An enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). Under the guidelines, a defendant receives a two-level increase to his base offense level under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) if. a dangerous weapon was possessed during the offense. This \u201cadjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG- \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), cmt. n. 3. \u201cUnder relevant conduct principles, the enhancement applies when the weapon was possessed in connection with drug activity that was part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of the same course of conduct or common scheme as the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>McAllister, </em>272 F.3d at 233-34 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">.Here, the evidence in the record demonstrated that Lyall had his service revolver with him during at least one occasion when he provided cocaine to a co-conspirator. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in enhancing Lyall\u2019s offense level for possession of a weapon. <em>See McAllister, </em>272 F.3d at 234 (\u201cIn order to prove that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that the weapon was possessed during the relevant illegal drug activity.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions, are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
