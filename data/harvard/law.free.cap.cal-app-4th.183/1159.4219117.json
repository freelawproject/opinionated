Upon closer examination, however, this appeal presents numerous complexities, such as how to value merchandise that was already damaged prior to the theft; whether the merchandise should be valued at its retail or wholesale price; and whether the calculation should be based on the diminution in value of the merchandise since the bulk of it was recovered by Target. The trial court grappled with these and other questions and, following a contested restitution hearing, ordered defendants to pay restitution in the amount of $278,678.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Defendants contend that (1) the court abused its discretion in calculating the amount of restitution owed and (2) the restitution order violated their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. We conclude that their first argument has merit, but the second does not. We thus reverse and remand, but not for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">1. <em>The Embezzlement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">In 2004, Yvonne<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> began employment at the Vallejo location of Target, a nationwide retail store that sells a wide range of consumer goods. Initially, she worked at night, restocking shelves and returning items to their proper locations. In April 2006, she was promoted to \u201creverse logistics,\u201d where she was responsible for seeing that damaged items and merchandise withdrawn by manufacturers were returned to the appropriate entity for credit or otherwise disposed of. Yvonne had to remove some items from the sales floor, while others were already in the stockroom. All of the items were then sorted onto pallets in the stockroom pending disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">Yvonne and Shawne Camp, an investigator in Target\u2019s assets protection department and the primary witness for Target at the restitution hearing, both testified regarding the pallet system. Although the system is not entirely clear from their testimony, this is how they described it;</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">The merchandise for which Yvonne was responsible was divided into three categories, yellow-tagged, green-tagged, and red-tagged items, with a separate pallet designated for each category. Yellow-tagged items\u2014or \u201cCRC\u2019s\u201d\u2014 were items that were damaged in transit to Target or returned by customers because they did not work when purchased. The customer was issued a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>refund or replacement, and the item, which still had a dollar value, was returned to the stockroom to be placed on the yellow pallet. Those goods were then shipped to a central location and, from there, returned to the vendors, who issued a credit to Target. Examples of items that would be yellow-tagged included televisions, videos, and DVD\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">Camp explained yellow-tagged items this way: \u201cYellow, that would be what we call CRC, so when a guest or a customer brings something back, such as an iPod to Target and they say T bought this iPod, it doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 they are given a refund or given a new iPod. That iPod still has a dollar value to it, so the disposition\u2014a disposition is given automatically by the computer by the employee that\u2019s doing the return on that iPod. A disposition would be given to that item of a yellow label, meaning that a yellow label would be placed on that iPod. That then signifies once it gets back to the stock in the back stockroom area, that that iPod is to go on a particular pallet, which is called the CRC pallet, [f] We then conduct sweeps where a trailer that brought merchandise into Target would be loaded with these pallets that are supposed to go back to CRC, which I believe is in Indianapolis. So that iPod eventually would be loaded back onto a trailer and sent to CRC in Indianapolis, where we would receive full credit back from the vendor.\u201d Yellow-tagged items were typically the most valuable of the three pallets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">Green-tagged merchandise was considered salvage, typically consisting of items or sets that were missing components when purchased, as well as clearance items that had been reduced to up to 90 percent off but still did not sell and were thus withdrawn from the sales floor. These items were \u201cdonated\u201d to a charity for 30 cents on the dollar of the last retail price. Some green-tagged items, such as vitamins and food, could not be donated for any money, and were simply given away at a total loss to Target.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Camp gave the following example of green-tagged items: \u201cAn example of that would be if somebody brought in . . . [a] toy, if somebody brought in a box of Legos that maybe retails for a hundred dollars, and they said that, you know, it was missing some of the pieces when they got it, that item then can be given a green label meaning salvage, [f] So once that item is taken from the service desk, it would be brought to the back room, and it would be placed on another pallet beside that CRC pallet that would be considered a salvage pallet. That\u2019s stuff that we then donate to like the Goodwill. But when I say \u2018donate,\u2019 it\u2019s not given free of cost.\u201d Instead, as noted, Target received 30 cents on the dollar of the last retail price. Camp further detailed the green-tagged items that Target could not dispose of for any money: \u201cThere\u2019s specific items that we are not allowed to donate for a profit where we just have to donate them free of cost. That\u2014those items would be things like vitamins and cereals, foods, pretty much any type of food, except for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>liquor\u2014we cannot donate liquor. But that would be something that we would have to set up a separate donations place, so maybe like a women\u2019s\u2014a battered women\u2019s shelter or something, and we just give them all these vitamins, and there is no 30 cents on the dollar for that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">The third pallet was for red-tagged items, which included damaged merchandise that could not be sold and no longer had any financial value to Target. These would include things such as diapers, food items, cosmetics, toiletries, toilet paper, household products, small appliances, glassware, flatware, and clothing. As another example, if a camcorder was removed from a box to be used as a display item, the box would be returned to the stockroom where Yvonne would red-tag it. When asked about more expensive items, like an electronic item missing a charger, Yvonne explained, \u201cIf something is minus 50 percent and it should go back to CRC, it\u2019s going to be overridden and red-tagged.\u201d Red-tagged items were the least valuable of the three pallets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">In addition to the yellow-, green-, and red-tagged items, the pallets also occasionally included new merchandise that nighttime employees transferred from the front of the store to the stockroom. Yvonne was responsible for removing the new merchandise from the pallets and returning it to the sales floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">In addition to seeing that yellow-tagged merchandise was shipped out to CRC for return to vendors, Yvonne\u2019s responsibilities also included disposing of green- and red-tagged goods, that is, damaged or otherwise unsellable items that could not be returned to the merchandisers. Target had an arrangement with Goodwill Industries, a nonprofit organization that would take all of the unsellable merchandise, paying Target 30 cents on the dollar for the items. At a certain point, however, the Goodwill pickups became unreliable, and when Yvonne reported this problem to her manager, he advised her to find an alternative way to dispose of the merchandise. Yvonne contacted a number of charities, but no one was willing to accept all of the merchandise, instead wanting first to look through the items and pick out just what they would like.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">To help Yvonne, Michael spoke with Thomas Clarke, an acquaintance who volunteered with the Rotary Club, a charitable organization that performs community service. Clarke agreed to accept the merchandise on behalf of the Rotary Club and distribute it to various nonprofits. Because the Rotary Club lacked the capacity to transport and store the volume of merchandise that was available for distribution, Michael would pick it up from Target in his trailer and take it home, and Clarke would retrieve it from there and distribute it. According to Yvonne, her manager was present on multiple occasions when Michael picked up the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>In June 2006, shortly after Yvonne\u2019s promotion, Target received a phone tip reporting that Yvonne was stealing merchandise. A surveillance of Yvonne failed to turn up anything out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">In May 2007, Target received a second such tip. The store began another surveillance, this time uncovering a massive theft. An investigator initially observed Michael drive a trailer onto Target property, load it with merchandise, and drive away. The trailer was traced to defendants, so investigators began watching their home in American Canyon, where they were observed loading merchandise into a sports utility vehicle. The investigators did not intercept them, however, and instead followed Yvonne as she drove the vehicle to Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Once in Oregon, Yvonne first stopped at a residence later determined to belong to her daughter. She then continued on to a second residence that belonged to her mother, Barbara Beattie. On Beattie\u2019s property, there was a main home, a second home, and a bam with an additional storage area attached. A search of the buildings uncovered a small amount of Target merchandise in the main home. In the second home, the upper floor was set up like a showroom, displaying living room and dining room merchandise. Many of the items had Target price tags or were brands carried by Target. Investigators also discovered shelves lined with toiletries, some bearing a clearance label used by Target when it reduced the price of an item.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">The bam, in which the investigators found a \u201cgarage sale\u201d sign, appeared to have been converted into a store full of Target merchandise. There was clothing displayed on hangers and merchandise laid out on long tables. Looking through the items, the investigators determined that much of the merchandise came from Target, since some of the brands were specific to Target and some of the items bore a label or logo indicating it was from a Target store.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">Adjacent to the bam was a storage area that contained \u201ctotes and totes of merchandise.\u201d In front of the bam was an area covered with tarps, under which there was more Target merchandise. Next to the bam was a tentlike area that contained larger Target items, like lawn furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">It was subsequently learned that Beattie began receiving merchandise from Yvonne in December 2006 and received it through May 2007, when the theft was discovered. During that time, she held three or four garage sales to dispose of merchandise, earning $3,000 in her estimate. Of that, she gave Yvonne approximately $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Investigators also searched defendants\u2019 home in American Canyon. There, they discovered Target merchandise in the house, garage, and a camper on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>property. They also recovered Target merchandise, including lawn furniture and bicycles, from a storage unit in Vallejo. At Yvonne\u2019s daughter\u2019s Oregon residence, they discovered Target merchandise in the house, garage, and an attached storage area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Defendants were arrested and the merchandise seized. The items recovered in California were transferred to a rented storage unit near defendants\u2019 home. The Oregon merchandise was loaded into semitrucks and transported to a Target distribution center in Oregon, where it was held until it could be inventoried. Eventually, per FBI instructions to retain the merchandise, it was consolidated at a Target distribution center outside of Sacramento and stored in rental trailers pending resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">2. <em>The Criminal Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">By amended felony complaint filed May 18, 2007, the Solano County District Attorney charged defendants with one count of conspiracy to commit grand theft, burglary, and receiving stolen property (count 1; Pen. Code, \u00a7 182);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of grand theft by embezzlement (count 2; \u00a7 487, subd. (a)); and two counts of receiving stolen property (counts 7 and 8; \u00a7 496, subd. (a)). Yvonne was additionally charged with four counts of second degree commercial burglary (counts 3-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">On November 15, 2007, Michael pleaded no contest to the conspiracy charge, and Yvonne pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and grand theft charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The remaining charges were dismissed with a Harvey<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">On April 16, 2008, the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendants on five years\u2019 probation, with Yvonne to serve 365 days and Michael 210 days in county jail under the sheriff\u2019s alternative program. Both were ordered to pay a restitution fee of $220, a probation fee of $300, and a court security fee of $20, as well as restitution to Target in an amount to be determined by the court. Following a contested restitution hearing\u2014described in detail below\u2014the court ordered defendants to pay restitution to Target in the amount of $278,678, subject to an offset should Target receive anything of value for the recovered merchandise. Defendants immediately presented a check for $5,000 to demonstrate their good faith intent to make restitution to Target.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">The court scheduled a hearing for May 15, 2008, for a progress report, but subsequently took the matter off calendar and ordered the parties to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>with the probation department to determine any offset resulting from Target\u2019s disposition of the recovered property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Defendants appealed from the April 16, 2008 order of restitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">At a September 10, 2009 hearing before the trial court, Target\u2019s investigator Camp confirmed that with the exception of wine that was thrown away, all of the merchandise was donated to charitable organizations at a total loss to Target. He also confirmed that Target neither sought nor received a tax credit for the donations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">3. <em>The Restitution Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">At the outset of the restitution hearing, the prosecutor stated that the People were seeking restitution in the amount of $616,223. This amount included merchandise valued at $554,118, which was based on an extrapolation prepared at Target headquarters that looked at shortages in Target stores comparable to the Vallejo store for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. Fifty percent of the shortages, or $554,118, was attributed to Yvonne.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">Alternatively, the prosecutor sought to establish that at a minimum Target was entitled to $278,678, which was comprised of $234,185 for the merchandise, $15,191 for inventory services and investigation expenses, and $29,302 for transporting and storing the recovered goods. Camp, the Target investigator, explained how Target arrived at these numbers. As to the value of the merchandise, he explained that Target retained RGIS, a national inventory service, to inventory the merchandise. RGIS scanned every single item that was recovered and produced an inventory listing each item and a corresponding dollar amount for it. When scanning, RGIS did not differentiate between items that were new or damaged and, if damaged, whether they would have been yellow-, green-, or red-tagged. Instead, all items were scanned at their last retail value. The total value of the recovered merchandise based on that method was $234,185, which included $72,342 in merchandise recovered from defendants\u2019 home and $161,843 recovered from Oregon. The inventory did not include the merchandise that Yvonne\u2019s mother sold at the garage sales or that had been given to the Rotary Club. However, the inventory did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>include, in Yvonne\u2019s approximation, $4,000 worth of items seized from her house that belonged to her and had not been stolen from Target.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Camp also testified that Target expended $15,191 for RGIS\u2019s services as well as investigation expenses. The latter included travel expenses for Target investigators while in Oregon, including rental cars, hotel rooms, and meals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Additionally, Camp explained that per FBI instructions, Target was required to retain the recovered merchandise until the case was resolved. After RGIS completed its inventory, the merchandise was transported to a single distribution center outside of Sacramento. Lacking the capacity to store such a large quantity of merchandise indefinitely, Target leased six semitrailers at $1,877 per month to store the merchandise pending disposition. The charges for transporting the goods and the storage trailers totaled $29,302, which included rental costs through February 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">At the time of the restitution hearing, Camp could not say with certainty what Target was going to do with the recovered merchandise. He was certain, however, that none of it was going to be returned to the sales floor, and thought it likely that Target would donate it all and take a tax writeoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Yvonne also testified at the hearing. In addition to describing her job responsibilities and the pallet system, she admitted that at the time unsellable goods were being given to the Rotary Club, she began appropriating goods from the stockroom, some of which she took to Oregon and some of which she kept at home. Most of the goods, according to Yvonne, were green- or red-tagged. She admitted, however, that some of the items were new, having been placed on the stockroom pallets by the night crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">When asked for her estimate of the value of the merchandise she stole, Yvonne responded that the full retail value was $200,000. Because much of the merchandise was unsellable, however, she estimated its actual value to Target to be $25,000 to $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Clarke from the Rotary Club also testified. When asked about the condition of the merchandise he received, he explained: \u201c[M]ost of the stuff would have a green label on it, be salvage. Some of the stuff was broken. Sometimes there would be\u2014if there was a dinner set or something, a dish would be busted |&gt;zc] in there, and it wouldn\u2019t be a full thing. Some things we got were out of date, obviously, because like when we\u2019d be putting toys together for Christmas, we\u2019d be getting\u2014Halloween stuff would come through there. . . . I\u2019d call it a grab bag. I mean, you\u2019d open a box and see what\u2019s in there. Sometimes there could be\u2014there could be some shampoo or soap, but you could tell there\u2019s something leaking.\u201d Beattie\u2019s description of the merchandise was consistent: the items were \u201cmissing things, they\u2019re broken,\u201d \u201ceverything was damaged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>Following testimony, the court heard argument. The People reiterated their request for restitution based on Target headquarters\u2019 extrapolation, this time asking for $594,611. They derived this number by deducting $4,000 for Yvonne\u2019s property that was mistakenly confiscated and $17,612 in employee payroll costs, both of which were included in the original $616,223.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In contrast, defense counsel urged the court to value the merchandise in the range of $25,000 to $50,000, based on what the merchandise was worth when it was stolen. He argued that the merchandise was worth significantly less than the $234,185 claimed by Target since much of it was damaged prior to the theft and would have been donated. While he conceded the $15,191 investigation expense, he challenged the $29,302 for transportation and trailer rental, arguing the merchandise could have been stored elsewhere or dealt with in a more reasonable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Alternatively, defense counsel argued that if the court was going to order restitution of approximately $234,000 for the merchandise, which was the full value of the goods based on the RGIS inventory, such an order necessarily meant that the recovered merchandise had no value to Target. If so, he requested that it be released to defendants to sell to help with the restitution order. The court summarily rejected that suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court rejected the prosecutor\u2019s request for $554,118 for the merchandise based on the extrapolation, labeling it \u201ctoo speculative.\u201d The court then ordered restitution as follows: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a finding that basically the storage costs in this case are reasonable as related to appropriate investigation in this case. It may not be a perfect investigation and not an austere one from the defense view, but I think it\u2019s appropriate, and I\u2019ll make a finding that the cost of reasonable and related investigative endeavors are compensable in a restitution order. I think generally the conduct of Target and its various agents were reasonable in this case and their expenses are reasonable. So, basically, I\u2019m going to award those. [][] My order is also going to be that restitution is going to be joint and several as to both defendants. And I am going to order restitution in the amount of $278,678, and I reach that as follows. The reasonable value of the seized property\u2014this is less than what was stolen\u2014but the seized property is $234,185. I\u2019m going to order that. I\u2019m also going to order in addition to that . . . $15,191, and that would be inventory services, rentals, hotels and meals and so forth. In addition to that, $29,302, which is essentially storage costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">The court also noted that the $4,000 of property seized from defendants\u2019 American Canyon home and the $3,000 Beattie made from selling Target merchandise at garage sales was \u201ca wash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>When defense counsel objected that Target\u2019s likely plan of donating the merchandise and taking a tax writeoff was at odds with the court awarding full retail value, the court responded, \u201cNot necessarily. They can do whatever they want with it. They can abandon it, for all I care. I\u2019ve made a finding that I think the reasonable amount of value of that property when your client stole it is over $200,000. ...[][] Now, if Target gets some kind of benefit from donating these things, in other words, their tax liability for 2009 is somehow reduced by a hundred thousand dollars because of donation of this stuff, I would consider reducing your clients\u2019 restitution liability by that amount. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Based on Target\u2019s representation that it would know \u201cwithin probably one week\u201d what it was going to do with the merchandise, the court set a hearing for a progress report on May 15, 2008. On that date, however, Target represented that it was still in the process of disposing of the merchandise and did not yet know if it would receive any benefit to offset the restitution amount. It was agreed that from there on out, the probation department would supervise any remaining restitution issues, and the matter was taken off calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">As previously noted, Target ultimately donated the merchandise at a total loss and did not claim a tax credit for the donations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">A. <em>The Law of Restitution and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">In <em>People v. Giordano </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 644, 652 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 51, 170 P.3d 623] <em>(Giordano), </em>our Supreme Court summarized the origin of the state\u2019s restitution scheme: \u201cIn 1982, California voters passed Proposition 8, also known as The Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights. . . . Proposition 8 established the right of crime victims to receive restitution directly \u2018from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.\u2019 [Citation.] The initiative added article I, section 28, subdivision (b) to the California Constitution: \u2018It is the unequivocal intention of the People of the State of California that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer, [f] Restitution shall be ordered from the convicted persons in every case, regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed, in which a crime victim suffers a loss, unless compelling and extraordinary reasons exist to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">The <em>Giordano </em>court further explained that \u201cCalifornia Constitution, article I, section 28, subdivision (b), which is not self-executing, directed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>Legislature to adopt implementing legislation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Giordano, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 654.) Section 1202.4 was the legislative response. In its current incarnation, it provides that \u201ca victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a)(1).) Subdivision (f) of section 1202.4 states that, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, \u201cin every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court. . . . The court shall order full restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so, and states them on the record.\u201d Restitution \u201cshall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3).) Subdivision (f)(3)(A) through (K) identifies, without limitation, examples of economic losses that are recoverable by the victim, including losses to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">(2) A defendant is entitled to a restitution hearing to \u201cdispute the determination of the amount of restitution.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(1).) As recently explained, \u201cAt a victim restitution hearing, a prima facie case for restitution is made by the People based in part on a victim\u2019s testimony on, or other claim or statement of, the amount of his or her economic loss. [Citations.] \u2018Once the victim has [i.e., the People have] made a prima facie showing of his or her loss, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of the loss is other than that claimed by the victim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

Akins, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1382; <em>People v. Baker </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 463, 467 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 871]; <em>Thygesen, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">B. <em>The Court Abused Its Discretion in Ordering Restitution in the Amount of $234,185 for the Stolen Merchandise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Defendants present numerous arguments challenging the amount of restitution the court ordered them to pay for the stolen merchandise. Some of the arguments are well-taken and warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">1. <em>The Trial Court Improperly Awarded Target a Windfall When It Ordered Restitution Based on the Last Retail Price of the Merchandise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">Section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(A) provides that a crime victim is entitled to restitution for the \u201c[f]ull or partial payment for the value of stolen or damaged property.\u201d The value \u201cshall be the replacement cost of like property, or the actual cost of repairing the property when repair is possible.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Defendants contend that here, instead of awarding Target the \u201creplacement cost of like property,\u201d the court overcompensated the store by relying on the RGIS inventory, which inflated the value of the merchandise. This is so, they reason, because all items were scanned at their last retail price when their value to Target was in fact significantly less. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">It was undisputed at the restitution hearing that the stolen merchandise included yellow-, green-, and red-tagged items, as well as some new items. According to Yvonne\u2019s testimony, most of the items that she appropriated were green- or red-tagged merchandise. Beattie described most of it as \u201cmissing things, they\u2019re broken,\u201d and noted that \u201ceverything was damaged.\u201d Target investigator Camp testified that the items recovered included some green-tagged, or salvage, merchandise. Finally, Clarke from the Rotary Club described the \u201cgrab bag\u201d of damaged goods he received for distribution. Given that the bulk of the goods were unsellable because they were either damaged merchandise or clearance items withdrawn from the sales floor, the retail price of these goods was not reflective of their value to Target.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">More specifically, as to the green-tagged items, if it was an item that had been put on clearance but still did not sell, it would have scanned at the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>clearance price. If it was a salvage item because it was missing a component\u2014as were the bulk of the green-tagged items\u2014it would have scanned at the full retail price. These items, however, had been destined for \u201cdonation\u201d at 30 cents on the dollar of the last retail price. Consequently, on all such items, Target was awarded a windfall of 70 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Other green-tagged items, such as food and vitamins, were to be given away for free, as were all red-tagged goods. These items scanned at either their full retail or clearance price, even though their value to Target was zero\u2014in effect, a 100 percent windfall.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">As a specific example, the inventory included numerous display items. While Target sells some display items (such as camcorders), it does not sell other display items (such as video game consoles). Those unsellable display items would have scanned at their full retail price, even though Target would have donated those goods for 30 cents on the dollar, giving Target a windfall of 70 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">The People present multiple arguments in opposition to this conclusion, none of which is persuasive. First and foremost, they protest that it would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to accurately calculate the value of the merchandise: \u201c[I]t would be virtually impossible for Target investigators to determine the value of the property when taken since it cannot be determined, if the property is damaged, whether the item was damaged at the time the property was stolen from Target, or damaged during the handling, transportation, or storage of the goods. Testimony established that the goods were loaded into a truck on the Target premises and transported to the Cappelone\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>residence. From there, some of the merchandise was transported to Mr. Clarke\u2019s residence, and some to co-defendant\u2019s daughter and mother\u2019s residences in Oregon. In Oregon, the goods were stored outside under tarps, in the bam, and in the garage and residence for possibly more than a year. There is no method to determine the condition of each item when it left the Target store, unless at the time of recovery, the item was in perfect condition. Even if the item was in perfect condition, it would be impossible to determine when co-defendant stole each piece of property to determine its value at the time of conversion, since products are generally marked down or put on sale over time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The trial court was clearly cognizant of these issues, expressing concern\u2014 and rightly so\u2014with not imposing a greater burden on Target than it had already suffered: \u201cI\u2019m not going to make them go through incredible hoops <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>and itemize every single thing and report to the court as to exactly what they have done with each and every one of them, because I think it would be unfair, and it would be like them getting victimized twice.\u201d We in no way begrudge the court\u2019s refusal to require Target to assess each recovered item individually in an attempt to determine if they had been yellow-, green-, or red-tagged when stolen, and what the value was at the time of theft. In the court\u2019s own words, this would have been \u201cburdensome\u201d and \u201conerous\u201d\u2014 perhaps, as the People claim, a virtual impossibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Nevertheless, courts are often confronted with restitution situations that require \u201ccomplicated calculations.\u201d <em>(Giordano, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 661 [calculation of spouse\u2019s loss of support]; <em>People v. Baumann </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 67, 74 [222 Cal.Rptr. 32] [lengthy hearing to determine extent of loss attributable to defendant\u2019s embezzlement, taking evidence from several witnesses and receiving 75 checks into evidence]; <em>People v. Baker, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 465 [calculating restitution for the theft of cattle, including whether it was appropriate to order restitution for calves that were likely bom while the cows were misappropriated].) This complexity of calculation, however, does not absolve the court from awarding restitution in a rational manner that is reasonably related to the victim\u2019s loss. And although imprecision does not necessarily amount to an abuse of discretion <em>(Giordano, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 666 [no abuse of discretion shown despite court\u2019s \u201cmethodological imprecision\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Akins, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1389 [no abuse of discretion because more than one reasonable way to calculate restitution]), it did so here did because it clearly resulted in a merchandise value that was highly inflated over the actual value of the merchandise to Target. While the RGIS inventory was a reasonable starting point, the value should have then been discounted to reflect the true nature of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">The People also dispute that most of the merchandise was damaged, suggesting instead that a large percentage was new. In support, they direct our attention to the probation report, which cites a Target loss prevention officer as stating that 90 percent of the recovered merchandise would have been sold on the sales floor prior to the theft. According to the report, \u201cYvonne was seen picking merchandise off the shelves on the sales floor \u2018as if she was shopping\u2019 and choosing items out of the warehouse which could have been sold on the sales floor. [Citation.]\u201d The report also cited Beattie as stating that a year prior to the search, Yvonne started bringing \u201cready to use items and then expanded to unopened boxes of new things.\u201d This, according to the People, establishes that Yvonne stole new merchandise from Target. While Yvonne admitted at the restitution hearing that the stolen merchandise included some new items that had been placed in the stockroom by nighttime employees, all testimony at the hearing\u2014that of Yvonne, Beattie, Clarke, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>even Camp, Target\u2019s own witness\u2014consistently described the stolen merchandise as largely damaged and unsellable. To claim that most of it was new is simply contrary to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">The People also challenge defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Thygesen, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th 988, a case we find particularly instructive. Defendant Bendix Thygesen rented a used cement mixer from a small equipment rental company. He failed to timely return the mixer, claiming it had been stolen, and ultimately pleaded guilty to theft of the mixer. The probation report estimated the mixer\u2019s replacement value at $1,400 for a new one and $500 to $700 for a used one. At a restitution hearing, the manager of the rental company testified that he did not know the age of the mixer, its original cost, or how often the mixer had been rented prior to its loss. Offering a catalog containing list and discounted prices for mixers that were similar but not identical to the stolen mixer, he then testified that the replacement cost of the mixer was $3,331. He also requested $3,822 for the loss of use of the mixer, testifying that the monthly rental cost was $294 and that the mixer had not been replaced in the 13 months since the theft. Required by the court to choose between receiving $2,098.87 for the mixer\u2019s replacement or $3,822 for the loss of use, the manager elected to receive restitution for the loss of use, which the trial court then ordered. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 990-991.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">The Court of Appeal reversed. It observed that because \u201ca victim is to be made whole\u201d and must be reimbursed for every economic loss, \u201cthere was no logical reason why the trial court made [the manager] choose between the replacement value of the mixer or the 13 months\u2019 loss of rental value.\u201d <em>(Thygesen, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 994-995.) More significantly for our purpose, the court further noted that as to the replacement value of the mixer, the \u201caward should have been predicated on the \u2018replacement cost of <em>like </em>property\u2019 \u201d in accordance with section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(A). (69 Cal.App.4th at p. 995.) In the case of the mixer, that meant \u201cwhat it would cost to replace it with a mixer of like type and age.\u201d The court explained: \u201cAs to a victim, the purpose of the restitution statute is to make that victim whole, not to give a windfall. [The rental company] is not entitled to replace a used mixer with a brand new one at appellant\u2019s expense, absent some extraordinary facts. If [the company] were a car rental agency that lost a 1995 Ford Taurus, it would be entitled to the replacement value of a similar 1995 Ford Taurus, not a 1999 model.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Likewise here. Target was entitled only to restitution equal to the value of the stolen property, and by all accounts at the hearing, the value was substantially less than the last retail price for most goods. By failing to account for the fact that a majority of the stolen merchandise was already damaged at the time of the theft\u2014and thus destined for donation\u2014the -trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>court awarded Target restitution for property that was of greater quality than that which defendants stole. This contravened section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(A)\u2019s mandate that the victim is only entitled to compensation for <em>like </em>property. As such, it was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The People claim <em>Thygesen </em>\u201cdoes not stand for the proposition that the court cannot use the value of a new item as the basis for restitution for a stolen or damaged item of the same kind.\u201d Instead, they attempt to distinguish it on the facts, explaining, \u201cThe situation here differs from that in <em>Thygesen. </em>Simply stated, Target is not in the business of renting items. Nor is it in the business of selling used or outdated goods, such as the recovered stolen merchandise. Investigator Camp testified that it was Target\u2019s policy not to reshelve for sale the recovered goods, presumably to protect the Target name and reputation. Moreover, in <em>Thygesen, </em>the stolen property was <em>one </em>cement mixer owned by a rental business. The cost of the one used mixer plus the loss of use could be easily proven and calculated. In this case Target basically lost the value of six semi-trailers containing various types of goods that had been stolen, in addition to stolen goods that were never recovered. As discussed above, it would be impossible to determine the condition of each item when it was stolen and when each item was stolen, in order to calculate the value of the item at the time it was stolen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">It is true, as the People argue, that <em>Thygesen </em>is based on a different set of facts. This does not, however, negate the point of law for which it stands: as directed by section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(A), restitution is to be based on the replacement cost of a <em>like </em>item. <em>(Thygesen, supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 995.) Here, that means Target was entitled to the replacement value of mostly damaged merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">The People suggest that instead of <em>Thygesen, </em>this case should be governed by <em>People v. Foster </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 939 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 1], in which the defendant was ordered to pay $8,000 plus a 10 percent fee for a Persian rug he stole during a residential burglary. The amount was based on the victim\u2019s statement to the probation officer that she had paid $8,000 for the rug. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 943-944.) On appeal, the defendant challenged, inter alia, the restitution order, arguing that it was improper to base the restitution award on the original cost of the rug. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 945.) The court disagreed, concluding that \u201cabsent unusual circumstances, or a showing by the defendant to the contrary, the original cost of a stolen item may be treated as evidence of replacement cost for purposes of restitution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 946.) The People seem to read <em>Foster </em>as suggesting that in certain circumstances, the court may award restitution equal to the cost of a new replacement. This is not the case, as recognized by <em>Thygesen, supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.4th 988. <em>Foster </em>merely reaffirms that the proper measure is the replacement cost, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>recognizes that in certain circumstances\u2014circumstances that have no applicability here\u2014the original cost may be evidence of the replacement cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">2. <em>The Trial Court Improperly Awarded Target a Windfall by Ordering Restitution Based on the Merchandise </em>\u20195 <em>Retail Price Instead of Wholesale Price</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Defendants also argue that the trial court erroneously awarded Target a windfall by calculating the value of the merchandise based on the retail price, or the price at which Target sells the merchandise to its customers, instead of the wholesale cost, or the price at which Target buys the goods and which it would pay to replace them. This, they argue, awarded Target profits on the merchandise when, in fact, they were only entitled to the replacement cost, which is the wholesale price.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The People disagree, claiming that \u201c[v]ictim restitution can be based on the retail value of the property stolen.\u201d This is so, they reason, because section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3) entitles Target to \u201ca dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct . . . .\u201d And, they specifically note, section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(E) expressly identifies \u201cprofits lost by the victim\u201d as a compensable item. The People\u2019s argument is flawed for one fundamental reason: the prosecutor presented no evidence that Target lost any profits as a result of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Most of the stolen merchandise was never going to be sold to customers because it was, quite simply, unsellable. The yellow-tagged items were to be returned to the vendors for credit to Target. Although never expressly stated by Camp, logic dictates that Target would only receive a credit in the amount it paid to acquire the product from the vendor; certainly the vendors do not credit Target for its potential profit. The red-tagged items were damaged goods that could not be donated for any compensation and were given away for free. There is no rational basis for awarding profit on such merchandise. Finally, while some green-tagged items were to be given away at a total loss (again not justifying an award of profit), others were to be \u201cdonated\u201d at 30 percent of the last retail price. There was no evidence offered at the restitution hearing that the 30 percent Target would have received for these goods exceeded the wholesale price. In other words, there was no evidence that Target profited when it donated the salvage goods to charities. It was the prosecutor\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of this loss. <em>(Millard, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.4th at p. 26; <em>Giordano, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 664.) This, it failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>As to the small percentage of new, sellable items, there was no evidence that there was not a comparable replacement to sell to Target\u2019s customers. These were not unique products, but were mass-produced consumer goods that Target sold in abundance. Indeed, the fact that Target is a massive, nationwide retail store with a system for tracking goods suggests the items stayed in stock and no customer was ever deprived of a purchase. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at pp. 798-799 [victim of music counterfeiting scheme was not entitled to recover for \u201c \u2018potential loss\u2019 \u201d in sales of music cassette tapes because counterfeit tapes had been recovered and therefore could not be sold by the counterfeiter].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\"><em>Thygesen, </em>this time relied upon by the People, does not change the result. As previously explained, the <em>Thygesen </em>court held in part that the trial court erred in requiring the victim to elect between compensation for the stolen cement mixer and the rental income the company lost in the absence of the mixer because the company was entitled to compensation for all losses it suffered as a consequence of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, which losses could include the stolen equipment <em>as well as </em>lost rental income. <em>(Thygesen, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pp. 994-995.) In a passage quoted by the People, the court explained: \u201cLosses to victims will vary from case to case. For example, in a situation involving a victim who has a ring or necklace stolen, there may be no economic loss other than the actual value of the ring or necklace. The same is not true of a victim who is in business. The economic loss may well include the loss of revenue the stolen item would have produced.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 994.) This, the People submit, supports their claim that Target was entitled to the profits the stolen merchandise would have generated. We agree that the victim\u2019s economic loss may include lost revenue or profit\u2014where there is evidence of such loss. Here, there was simply no such evidence, despite the People\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that \u201c[t]he record shows otherwise.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at p. 995 [\u201cabsolutely no evidence presented to the trial court from which a rational determination\u201d of lost revenue could have been made].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The People also take exception to defendants\u2019 suggestion that the court could have obtained \u201can estimate of the average percentage by which Target marks up the items that it sells\u201d and then applied that \u201caverage percentage of markup to the total in this case\u201d to arrive at an \u201capproximate calculation of the replacement value of the items in question.\u201d According to the People, it would have burdened Target to determine an average markup, and since the markup varies by product, it would not have been a rational method for calculating the replacement value of the stolen merchandise. We do not doubt that to be the case. Nevertheless, we reiterate that complexity of calculating the value of the loss to Target does not permit the court to award Target a windfall, which it did by awarding Target profit on the merchandise despite any indication that it actually suffered a profit loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>Finally, the People attempt to distinguish <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th 791, which Michael cites for the proposition that there is no right to restitution for \u201cpotential loss.\u201d In that case, the court held that a victim of a music counterfeiting scheme was not entitled to recover for a \u201c \u2018potential loss\u2019 \u201d in sales caused by the defendant\u2019s counterfeit music cassette tapes because the tapes had been recovered and therefore could not be sold by the counterfeiter. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 798-799.) In a curious argument, the People contend that despite what <em>Ortiz </em>expressly holds, a \u201cpotential loss\u201d is in fact recoverable, while a \u201ctheoretical loss\u201d\u2014which more accurately describes the loss in Ortiz\u2014is not. From this, they conclude: \u201cHere, the lost profits were not merely \u2018theoretical.\u2019 They were actual but difficult to calculate; they were \u2018estimated\u2019 or \u2018extrapolated.\u2019 \u201d In fact, there was no evidence\u2014\u201cestimated,\u201d \u201cextrapolated,\u201d or otherwise\u2014that Target lost any profit due to defendants\u2019 theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">3. <em>The Trial Court Wrongfully Awarded Target a Windfall When It Ordered Defendants to Pay Target for the Stolen Merchandise </em>and <em>Allowed Target to Retain the Recovered Merchandise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Michael also argues that because the merchandise was recovered, Target was not entitled to restitution for the value of the merchandise, but rather only for the diminution in value between when it was stolen and when it was recovered. This argument is premised on Michael\u2019s claim that the recovered items \u201cclearly had significant value,\u201d as evidenced by the fact that Beattie held three or four garage sales netting $3,000. This raises the following question: did the trial court abuse its discretion in awarding Target the retail value of the merchandise\u2014a value already inflated above the actual value of the merchandise to Target, as detailed <em>above\u2014and </em>allowing Target to retain the recovered goods for disposal at its pleasure? We conclude that it did, as a victim is not entitled to restitution for the value of property that was returned to him or her, except to the extent there is some loss of value to the property. <em>(People v. Rivera </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1153, 1162 [261 Cal.Rptr. 93].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">That being said, Michael grossly overstates his arguments in support of this claim. First, the garage sales may have evidenced that the merchandise had value to Beattie and defendants, but the value to Target may have been considerably less because it could no longer sell any of the merchandise in the store. Thus, while Michael claims that \u201c[m]eaningful value indisputably inhered in largely undamaged retail property initially worth over $200,000,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the value for which the merchandise could have been disposed would likely have been significantly lower than what Michael believed it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>Second, Michael asserts that the court\u2019s belief that mitigation would have been onerous \u201cdemonstrated a misunderstanding of both the law and the practicalities of the situation.\u201d As he explains it, \u201cThe court was, quite reasonably, sympathetic to Target\u2019s concern about any requirement that it spend days or weeks sorting through the large amount of recovered merchandise. But it would have cost only a few thousand dollars in menial labor to sort through the materials, money that would have been part of the restitution award and which [defendants] would have gladly paid to reduce their ultimate burden. If 10 percent of the merchandise was yellow tag merchandise that could have been returned to the manufacturer for its full value [citation], spending those few thousand dollars would have mitigated the losses by approximately $23,400.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Michael\u2019s computation in this regard is specious as there is no basis for his assertion that 10 percent of the merchandise equaled 10 percent of the value of the merchandise. If 10 percent of the merchandise was electronic equipment in working condition, that merchandise would be worth more than 10 percent of the value. On the other hand, if 10 percent of the merchandise consisted of toiletries, the merchandise would likely be worth less than 10 percent of the value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Mathematical deficiencies aside, nowhere is there any support for Michael\u2019s assertion that it would have only cost \u201ca few thousand dollars in menial labor\u201d to sort through the merchandise, a task that would require someone to examine each item of the six trailers full of merchandise to determine what was wrong with it and in what category it belonged. The sheer volume of merchandise suggests that such a task would have been much more burdensome, time consuming, and costly than Michael suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Alternatively, Michael suggests that \u201cTarget could have elected the effortless method of having the goods sold by an online auctioneer at eBay or a similar site or through a traditional auction, as suggested by defendant.\u201d In the succinct words of the People, \u201cIt is inconceivable how [Michael] can describe hiring personnel to list and handle the individual sales, packaging, and mailing of hundreds of items as \u2018effortless,\u2019 let alone cost efficient.\u201d We also emphasize that there were six semitrailers full of merchandise. This most definitely would not have been an effortless undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">Despite these shortcomings in Michael\u2019s argument, however, we nevertheless agree that it was an abuse of discretion to award Target the value of the merchandise <em>and </em>the merchandise. The merchandise was clearly of some value, and returning it all to Target was, in the words of defendants\u2019 counsel, \u201cat odds with the court awarding full retail value.\u201d As we see it, the court could have allowed Target to retain the goods and ordered defendants to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>for the diminution in value, or it could have ordered defendants to pay Target for the value of the goods when stolen and then given the merchandise to defendants for disposal to offset the amount they owed Target. Which course the trial court should have chosen is not for us to dictate. But it is for us to say that ordering defendants to pay for the full value of the merchandise <em>and </em>giving all of the goods back to Target\u2014to \u201cabandon,\u201d for all the court cared\u2014was an abuse of. discretion. The outcome is even more egregious in light of Camp\u2019s testimony that Target donated the merchandise but did not even seek a tax writeoff to offset the amount owed by defendants, despite its representation to the court that it would likely do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">C. <em>The Trial Court Properly Ordered Defendants to Pay for the Costs of Target\u2019s Investigation and of Transporting and Storing the Recovered Merchandise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Yvonne takes exception with inclusion in the restitution order of RGIS\u2019s fees and the costs of transporting the merchandise from Oregon and American Canyon and storing it near a Target distribution center outside of Sacramento. She notes that section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3)(A) provides for the replacement cost of stolen or damaged property, and subdivision (f)(3)(E) allows for wages or profits lost by the victim due to time spent as a witness or in assisting the police or prosecution. She submits, however, that nothing in section 1202.4 allows for reimbursement of the RGIS fees or the transportation and storage costs. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reimbursing Target for these expenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">As a preliminary matter, as to the $15,191 for the inventory services and investigation costs, Yvonne\u2019s own counsel <em>conceded </em>Target\u2019s entitlement to this expenditure: \u201cI fully agree that the cost of the investigation, the $15,000, . . . should be part of the restitution order.\u201d Since her counsel consented to the amount, Yvonne waived any objection to it now. <em>(Nevada County Office of Education v. Riles </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 767, 779 [197 Cal.Rptr. 152] [party waived right to assert an argument on appeal by having expressly consented to the trial court\u2019s action].) Waiver aside, the argument fails on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>Section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3) provides that victim restitution \u201cshall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct . . . .\u201d It then goes on to provide a list of types of loss that are compensable. (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(A)-(K).) According to Yvonne, because none of the enumerated categories specifically identify inventory, transportation, and storage expenses, those losses are not compensable. Yvonne overlooks the important fact that the provisions of section 1202.4, subdivision (f)(3) are merely examples of types of loss that are compensable, examples that are provided <em>without limitation. </em>What controls is whether the \u201ceconomic loss [was] incurred as the result of [defendants\u2019] criminal conduct\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)), and the RGIS fees as well as the costs to transport and store the recovered merchandise unquestionably were. We therefore cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in including these expenses in the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Urging a contrary result, Yvonne relies on <em>People v. Friscia </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 834 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 656]. <em>Friscia </em>addressed whether time expended by the owners of a preschool to prepare an accounting of the loss they suffered due to an employee\u2019s embezzlement constituted lost wages or profits within the meaning of the restitution statute. The court held that it did not, because there was no evidence that the owners \u201csuffered the loss of wages or ascertainable profits.\u201d <em>(People v. Friscia, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 837.) According to Yvonne, \u201cTarget\u2019s costs with respect to the inventory and with respect to the transport and storage of the recovered goods fall into the category of accounting\u201d expenses that the <em>Friscia </em>court rejected. This is, quite simply, wrong. There is no analogy between the inventory, transportation, and storage costs on the one hand and lost wages or profits on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">D. <em>The Restitution Order Did Not Violate Defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment Right to a Jury Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">In their final argument, defendants claim the court\u2019s restitution order violated their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. This is so, they reason, because the \u201crestitution order in this case constitutes punishment above and beyond that authorized by the elements of the offense,\u201d and any such punishment cannot be \u201cimposed without jury findings of fact . . . .\u201d This argument derives from <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>California </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856] and its predecessors, including <em>United States v. Booker </em>(2005) 543 U.S. 220 [160 L.Ed.2d 621, 125 S.Ct. 738], <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531], and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], in which the United States Supreme Court recognized a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial on any fact that exposes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>defendant to a potentially greater sentence than that supported by facts found by the jury to be true. In <em>Giordano, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th 644, the California Supreme Court recently observed that courts have long held that restitution hearings require fewer due process protections than civil hearings or criminal hearings of guilt, further noting, however, that these cases were decided prior to <em>Cunningham </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Giordano, </em>defendants argue that they were entitled to a jury trial on the amount of restitution they owed Target.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">While the California Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on the question of whether a restitution hearing must be tried to a jury, the Fourth District Court of Appeal most recently answered this question\u2014and not favorably for defendants. In <em>Millard, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.4th 7, 35, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he had a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial at a section 1202.4 victim restitution hearing, disagreeing with his \u201cpremise that Penal Code section 1202.4 victim restitution constitutes increased punishment for a crime.\u201d It agreed instead with the court in <em>People v. Harvest </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 641 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 135] that \u201c \u2018the primary purpose of victim restitution is to provide monetary compensation to an individual injured by crime,\u2019 \u201d a collection procedure that is civil in nature. <em>(Millard, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.4th at p. 35.) The <em>Millard </em>court explained that \u201c[t]o the extent a victim restitution order has the secondary purposes of rehabilitation of a defendant and/or deterrence of the defendant and others from committing future crimes, those purposes do not constitute increased punishment of the defendant . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 35-36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">We rejected a similar argument in <em>People v. Wilen </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 270, 288-289 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 895]. And, as in <em>Wilen, </em>we note that while defendants can cite no California authorities in support of their position, federal cases addressing the issue are to the contrary. (See <em>U.S. v. Milkiewicz </em>(1st Cir. 2006) 470 F.3d 390; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(11th Cir. 2006) 445 F.3d 1302, 1310-1311; <em>U.S. v. Reifler (2d </em>Cir. 2006) 446 F.3d 65, 118-120; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Leahy </em>(3d Cir. 2006) 438 F.3d 328, 337-338; <em>U.S. v. Miller </em>(8th Cir. 2005) 419 F.3d 791, 792-793; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Sosebee </em>(6th Cir. 2005) 419 F.3d 451, 454, 461; <em>U.S. v. Garza </em>(5th Cir. 2005) 429 F.3d 165, 170; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Bussell </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 414 F.3d 1048, 1060; <em>U.S. v. George </em>(7th Cir. 2005) 403 F.3d 470, 473; <em>U.S. v. Wooten </em>(10th Cir. 2004) 377 F.3d 1134, 1144-1145.) In light of all this, we conclude defendants\u2019 argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">One purpose of restitution is to make the victim of a crime whole, and Target undoubtedly deserved to be compensated for the significant losses it suffered as a result of defendants\u2019 criminal conduct. The trial court faced a complicated task in calculating Target\u2019s loss, a calculation that could only be a rough approximation at best. But rather than a rough approximation, the trial court awarded Target a sizable windfall, a windfall the law simply does not allow. Reversal is thus warranted, and the matter is remanded for a further hearing on the amount of restitution owed by defendants to Target in accordance with the above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">Kline, P.

The Court would therefore like you to brief whether the order appealed from is an appealable order. . . .

We therefore assume she agrees with the propriety of reimbursing Target for the travel expenses related to its investigation of defendants\u2019 theft scheme. In the event Yvonne intended to also challenge those expenses, such challenge is misplaced.
