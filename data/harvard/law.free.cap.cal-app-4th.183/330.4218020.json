A number of private parties asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>California Regional Water Quality Control Board, North Coast Region (Board), to enforce California\u2019s law governing waste discharge to several hydroelectric dam-reservoirs on the Klamath River. The Board\u2014having twice attempted to assert state law on this very subject and having twice been decisively and unanimously rejected by the United States Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2014declined, on the ground that all power on the subject belonged to the federal government by virtue of the Federal Power Act (FPA; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 791a et seq.). The trial court ultimately agreed with this view, refusing to issue a writ of mandate compelling the Board to enforce the state\u2019s law.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">But before reaching that determination, and on its own initiative, the trial court sent the matter back to the Board so that it could reconsider its initial refusal in light of two decisions by the United States Supreme Court, which the court believed deserved \u201ca more complete response\u201d by the Board than appeared in its original resolution rejecting the private parties\u2019 request. The Board again concluded that it was powerless to act. This time the court agreed with the Board that federal law did indeed preempt state power. Nevertheless, after entering a final judgment denying plaintiffs any relief, the trial court awarded them $138,250 in attorney fees, half of which was to be paid by the Board and half by the dams\u2019 owner. The court determined that this award was proper under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 (section 1021.5) because the litigation had resulted in the \u201cimportant public benefit\u201d of the Board making \u201ca thoughtful and well-reasoned determination\u201d concerning its lack of authority to enforce state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We affirm the judgment because the Board and the trial court correctly recognized that for at least half a century federal law has been supreme when it comes to the subject of regulating hydroelectric dams operating under a federal license.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We reverse the attorney fee order because three of the statutory prerequisites to an award under section 1021.5 are absent. First, the initiators of this litigation cannot qualify as the \u201csuccessful\u201d parties in that in no sense did they achieve their strategic objective. Second, this was not an action that \u201cresulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.\u201d And third, this is not a case where \u201ca significant benefit . . . has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons.\u201d (\u00a7 1021.5.) The best that can be said for the unorthodox proceedings that occurred here is that the Board, following what was in effect a remand from the trial court, augmented the reasoning behind its decision that it was without authority to grant the private parties\u2019 request that it enforce state law. Federal law was accepted as preeminent by the Board when this controversy began\u2014and by the trial court when it ended. We conclude, as a matter of law, that it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>worth $138,250 to have a state agency polish up and augment the recitals and reasoning supporting a decision that was already more than legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Klamath River is one of the most significant waterways in the far western continental United States. More than 260 miles long, it originates in Oregon but ends in California, when it joins the Pacific Ocean at Requa in Del Norte County. The river is also an important source of hydroelectric power. The Klamath Hydroelectric Project generates 161 megawatts of electricity. The project is comprised of five dams in both Oregon and California. The project is owned and operated by PacifiCorp, an Oregon corporation. On the California side, the Copco and Iron Gate reservoirs sit behind eponymous dams, both of which are located in Siskiyou County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At all relevant times, PacifiCorp\u2019s application for the project\u2019s relicensing was pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In February 2007, a petition was filed with the Board by four plaintiffs: the Karuk Tribe of Northern California, Klamath Riverkeeper, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Associations, and Institute for Fisheries Research<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (hereinafter collectively, plaintiffs). The purpose of the petition was to get the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Board to \u201corder PacifiCorp to submit a Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD) for its discharges . . . [of] pollutants from the Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs, and issue waste discharge requirements (WDR) establishing appropriate restrictions and prohibitions safeguarding the beneficial uses of the waters of the Klamath River.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The Board conducted a public hearing on the petition, and denied it with resolution No. R1-2007-0028 in April 2007. The reason for-the denial was that federal law preempted application of California law, specifically the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13000 et seq.; Porter-Cologne), which requires reports of waste discharge (ROWD\u2019s) and waste discharge requirements (WDR\u2019s). <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 13260-13273.1.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 request for review was denied by the State Water Resources Control Board in July 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>In August 2007, plaintiffs filed a petition in superior court for either administrative or traditional mandate directing the Board to set aside the resolution and reconsider the issue in light of the trial court determining that there was no federal preemption. Plaintiffs alleged that the resolution was \u201cinvalid\u201d because it was \u201cbased ... on the erroneous legal ground that [the Board\u2019s] authority to require reports of waste discharge or issue waste discharge requirements pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act is preempted by the Federal Power Act.\u201d Plaintiffs also prayed for an award of attorney fees under section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The position of the Board and PacifiCorp was that federal preemption under the FPA was conclusively established by two decisions of the United States Supreme Court, <em>First Iowa Coop. v. Power Comm\u2019n., supra, </em>328 U.S. 152 <em>(First Iowa), </em>and <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, and .a subsequent decision by the Ninth Circuit, <em>Sayles Hydro Assn. v. Maughan, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451 <em>(Sayles Hydro).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Plaintiffs contended that these decisions were not dispositive because they did not address the authorization of enforcing state power laws such as Porter-Cologne enacted by Congress in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the Clean Water Act. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 et seq.; see fn. 17 and accompanying text, <em>post; </em>see also <em>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc. </em>(2000) 528 U.S. 167, 174 [145 L.Ed.2d 610, 120 S.Ct. 693].)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Rather than issuing a flat order to the Board to enforce Porter-Cologne, as plaintiffs wanted, or denying the petition, as sought by the Board and PacifiCorp, the trial court apparently decided on a third option not suggested by any of the parties. Noting that all sides had cited a pair of United States Supreme Court decisions subsequent to <em>California v. FERC </em>that gave an expansive reading to state power under the Clean Water Act <em>(S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 370, 386 [164 L.Ed.2d 625, 126 S.Ct. 1843] <em>(S.D. Warren); PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cty. v. Washington Dept. of Ecology </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 700 [128 L.Ed.2d 716, 114 S.Ct. 1900] <em>(PUD No. 1)), </em>the court decided to return the matter to the Board in order that it could \u201cgive a more complete response to [plaintiffs] as to the reasoning involved\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision. Specifically, the court apparently thought the Board had not sufficiently considered the relationship of the Clean Water Act enunciated in these two decisions to federal authority under the FPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 trial briefs and hearing argument, the trial court issued what appears to have been an alternative writ of mandate directing the Board to revisit the issue. In its judgment of June 2008 directing issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the writ, the trial court stated that it was reserving \u201cjurisdiction over [plaintiffs\u2019] recovery of reasonable attorney fees and costs to be determined on noticed motion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In August, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting attorney fees of $218,206.98 under section 1021.5 from the Board and PacifiCorp, \u201cjointly and severally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The following month the Board responded to the writ with a 12-page \u201cSupplemental Analysis To Accompany Resolution No. Rl-2007-0028\u201d that the court treated as a return that \u201ccomplies with this court\u2019s Writ of Mandate.\u201d The gist of the analysis was that, under the FPA and the Clean Water Act as construed in <em>S.D. Warren </em>and <em>PUD No. 1, </em>the opportunity of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>state to implement its water quality law was substantial but only in the context of federal licensing procedures.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Plaintiffs attacked the Board\u2019s supplemental analysis as mere \u201cwordsmithing\u201d of a single part of resolution No. Rl-2007-0028, not the complete de novo reconsideration ordered by the court, and submitted that the Board was simply reiterating its position that it was powerless to act. Plaintiffs requested the court to amend its judgment and vacate the Board\u2019s supplemental analysis in addition to the original resolution because both were \u201cbased on the . . . Board\u2019s incorrect conclusion that the FPA preempts the field of water quality regulation.\u201d At a brief hearing conducted on November 12, 2008, plaintiffs argued that the Board\u2019s latest action \u201cteed up [the] challenge\u201d to the trial court \u201cso ... we can get Your Honor to reopen the decision . . . via the return to decide the merits\u201d of the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On December 8, 2008, the court entered a \u201cJudgment Discharging Petition For Writ Of Mandate\u201d in which it concluded: \u201cIn light of all the relevant law, including the Clean Water Act, the two recent United States Supreme Court cases upholding state water quality certification requirements for hydroelectric projects under Clean Water Act \u00a7 401 [(i.e., <em>PUD No. 1 </em>and <em>S.D. Warren)], </em>and the cases stating that the Federal Power Act preempts state water quality permitting requirements, Respondent [Board] was correct to determine that PacifiCorp is not required to submit a Report of Waste Discharge and/or issue Waste Discharge Requirements for the Copco and Iron Gate facilities.\u201d Plaintiffs appealed from the judgment (A124351).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Thereafter the court granted plaintiffs $138,250 in attorney fees under section 1021.5, with the Board and PacifiCorp each liable for half of this sum. The court concluded that the litigation had resulted in an important public benefit, in the form of \u201ca well-reasoned determination\u201d by the Board \u201cas to whether California or federal law should apply to FERC projects with regard to Reports of Waste Discharge and Water Discharge Requirements.\u201d The Board and PacifiCorp commenced separate appeals from the fee order (A124369, A124370). We ordered the three appeals consolidated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The Board Correctly Determined That It Had No Authority to Grant the Relief Sought by Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In <em>Calif. Oregon Power Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 858 [291 P.2d 455] <em>(Calif. Oregon Power), </em>the State of California instituted a nuisance action against the existing Copco facilities and the planned Iron Gate facility, then owned by PacifiCorp\u2019s predecessor in interest. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>The Supreme Court agreed with the trial court that the action did not have to be dismissed because, among other reasons, exclusive jurisdiction over the dams and their operation was vested in federal hands, specifically the Federal Power Commission (FPC) administering the FPA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After quoting extensively from <em>First Iowa, supra, </em>328 U.S. 152 and other federal decisions, our Supreme Court held: \u201cImplicit in the foregoing opinions is the concept that the field is not exclusively occupied for all purposes by the Federal Power Act or the federal commission [(i.e., the FPC)]. There is a duality of control the extent of which is not specified. While it is clear the state laws may not \u2018veto\u2019 projects licensed by the federal commission nor may the giving of a license be made contingent on the state\u2019s consent, that is, the state may not block the project completely, there is nothing therein indicating that regulatory state laws which do not achieve that end are not proper. There is nothing said about nuisances or danger to the public in the Federal Power Act.... Here we are concerned with the abatement of a nuisance, in a sense a local police measure. The federal commission has not purported to adjudicate that question or do anything about it except to have [the power company] apply for a license for its dams, Copco 1 and 2, which for many years it has maintained without any effort to obtain a license and the [FPC] has done nothing in regard to the problem. . . . The state has not even asked in the action that defendant cease operating its dams; it asks that they be so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>operated as to not create the danger to the public and the destruction of the fish.\u201d <em>(Calif. Oregon Power, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 858, 868-869.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Plaintiffs stake everything on <em>Calif. Oregon Power, </em>which they deem \u201cbinding.\u201d To them, the Board\u2019s refusal to follow this decision amounts to an \u201cabdication of its authority under State law,\u201d specifically, Porter-Cologne, which \u201cprovide[s] a mechanism for the State of California to abate nuisances resulting from water pollution\u201d and thereby \u201cregulate water quality problems.\u201d As plaintiffs see it, according to established preemption principles and <em>Calif. Oregon Power, </em>the Board, and the trial court, failed to recognize that \u201cCongress did not evince an intention, either expressly or implicitly, to occupy the field of <em>water quality regulation </em>pursuant to the FPA. . . . Congress did intend to comprehensively address water quality regulation in enacting the Clean Water Act. Although the FPA preempts some of the State\u2019s authority to regulate <em>water flow </em>through a federally-licensed hydropower facility, such preemption does not extend to the State\u2019s authority to regulate <em>pollution releases </em>to California\u2019s rivers.\u201d For plaintiffs, \u201cThere is no principled distinction between the California Supreme Court\u2019s <em>[Calif. Oregon </em>Power] ruling allowing a public nuisance action to proceed in the face of the FPA and the question before this Court as to whether the Regional Board should be allowed to proceed pursuant to its authority and duty to implement Porter-Cologne.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 emphasis upon \u201cwater flow\u201d and \u201cpollution releases\u201d is an attempt to differentiate their suit from, and break free from the gravitational pull of, two federal decisions, the one by the United States Supreme Court in <em>California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, and the one by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451. This approach does credit to their counsel\u2019s ingenuity, but it is ultimately unavailing. Understanding why requires some history.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u201cIt is no longer open to question that the Federal Government under the Commerce Clause . . . has dominion, to the exclusion of the States, over navigable waters of the United States. [(Citing, inter alia, <em>First Iowa, supra, </em>328 U.S. 152.)] Congress has elected to exercise this power under the detailed and comprehensive plan for the development of the Nation\u2019s water resources, which it prescribed in the Federal Power Act, to be administered by the Federal Power Commission. <em>First Iowa Hydro-Electric Cooperative v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(City of Tacoma </em>v. <em>Taxpayers </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 320, 334 [2 L.Ed.2d 1345, 78 S.Ct. 1209], fn. omitted, citations omited.) <em>First Iowa </em>is central to understanding the scope of federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">There, the FPC was willing to approve a pending application for development of a hydroelectric project on the Cedar River, but the State of Iowa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>intervened to demand that the applicant first secure a state permit. The United States Supreme Court held that the state demand was preempted by the FPA: \u201cTo require the [cooperative] to secure the actual grant to it of a state permit... as a condition precedent to securing a federal license for the same project . . . would vest in . . . Iowa a veto power over the federal project. Such a veto power easily could destroy the effectiveness of the Federal Act. It would subordinate to the control of the State the \u2018comprehensive\u2019 planning which the Act provides shall depend upon the judgment of the Federal Power Commission . . . .\u201d <em>(First Iowa, supra, </em>328 U.S. 152, 164.) \u201cA dual final authority, with a duplicate system of state permits and federal licenses required for each project, would be unworkable. \u2018Compliance with the requirements\u2019 of such a duplicated system of licensing would be nearly as bad. Conformity to both standards would be impossible in some cases and probably difficult in most of them.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The court then considered the scope of section 27 of the FPC, which then and now provides: \u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective States relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any vested right acquired therein.\u201d (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 821.) The court gave this provision a narrow construction: \u201cThe effect of \u00a7 27, in protecting state laws from supersedure, is limited to laws as to the control, appropriation, use or distribution of water in irrigation or for municipal or other uses of the same nature. It therefore has primary, if not exclusive, reference to such proprietary rights. The phrase \u2018any vested right acquired therein\u2019 further emphasizes the application of the section to property rights. There is nothing in the paragraph to suggest a broader scope . . . .\u201d <em>(First Iowa, supra, </em>328 U.S. 152, 175-176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">After describing the FPA as \u201ca major undertaking\u201d intended \u201cto secure a comprehensive development of natural resources,\u201d the court concluded: \u201cThe detailed provisions of the Act providing for the federal plan of regulation <em>leave no room or need for conflicting state </em>controls.\u201d <em>(First Iowa, supra, </em>328 U.S. 152, 180-181, italics added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Notwithstanding this clear language, some California commentators were reluctant to accept it at face value, while others were openly hostile to the decision.

Citing <em>First Iowa\u2019s </em>veto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>language, the FERC concluded that \u201cthe establishment of minimum flows is a matter beyond the reach of state regulation.\u201d <em>(Rock Creek Limited Partnership </em>(Mar. 11, 1987) 38 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,240, p. 61,773.) The Board took the position that it had concurrent jurisdiction with the FERC because <em>\u201cFirst Iowa did </em>not support federal preemption of this issue.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (See <em>State of California ex rel. Water Resources Bd. </em>v. <em>F.E.R.C. </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 877 F.2d 743, 745.) The Ninth Circuit rebuffed California\u2019s petition to overturn the FERC decision. And the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed, rejecting California\u2019s attempt to limit <em>First Iowa </em>by broadening the scope of state power under section 27 of the FPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">As soon as the Supreme Court began its analysis it was apparent that California would not carry the day: \u201cThe parties\u2019 dispute . . . turns principally on the meaning of \u00a7 27 of the FPA, which provides the clearest indication of how Congress intended to allocate the regulatory authority of the States and the Federal Government. . . . Were this a case of first impression, petitioner\u2019s argument based on the statute\u2019s language could be said to present a close question. . . . [f] But the meaning of \u00a7 27 and the pre-emptive effect of the FPA are not matters of first impression. Forty-four years ago, this Court in <em>First Iowa </em>construed the section and provided the understanding of the FPA that has since guided the allocation of state and federal regulatory authority over hydroelectric projects.\u201d <em>(California v.

This argument misconceives the deference this Court must accord to longstanding and well-entrenched decisions, especially those interpreting statutes that underlie complex regulatory regimes. Adherence to precedent is, in the usual case, a cardinal and guiding principle of adjudication, and \u2018[considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done.\u2019 [Citation.] There has been no sufficient intervening change in the law, or indication that <em>First Iowa </em>has proved unworkable or has fostered confusion and inconsistency in the law, that warrants our departure from established precedent. [Citation.] This Court has endorsed and applied <em>First Iowa\u2019s </em>limited reading of \u00a7 27 [citations], and has employed the decision with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>approval in a range of decisions, both addressing the FPA and in other contexts. [Citations.] By directing FERC to consider the recommendations of state wildlife and other regulatory agencies while providing FERC with final authority to establish license conditions (including those with terms inconsistent with the States\u2019 recommendations), Congress has amended the FPA to elaborate and reaffirm <em>First Iowa\u2019s </em>understanding that the FPA establishes a broad and paramount federal regulatory role.

That departure would be inconsistent with the measured and considered change that marks appropriate adjudication of such statutory issues. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The court then shot down another attempt by California to differentiate its regulatory authority from <em>First </em>Iowa: \u201cPetitioner also argues that we should disregard <em>First Iowa\u2019s </em>discussion of \u00a7 27 because it was merely dictum. It is true that our immediate concern in <em>First Iowa </em>was the interpretation of \u00a7 9(b) of the FPA,[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] which governs submission to the federal licensing agency of evidence of compliance with state law. The Court determined that \u00a7 9(b) did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>not require licensees to obtain a state permit or to demonstrate compliance with the state law prerequisites to obtaining such a permit. [Citation.] Instead, the Court construed the section merely as authorizing the federal agency to require evidence of actions consistent with the federal permit. [Citation.] <em>First Iowa\u2019s </em>limited reading of \u00a7 27 was, however, necessary for, and integral to, that conclusion. . . . The Court reasoned that, absent an express congressional command, \u00a7 9(b) could not be read to require compliance with, and thus to preserve, state laws that conflicted with and were otherwise pre-empted by the federal requirements.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] [Citations.] Only the Court\u2019s narrow reading of \u00a7 27 allowed it to sustain this interpretation of \u00a7 9(b). Had \u00a7 27 been given the broader meaning that Iowa sought, it would have \u2018saved\u2019 the state requirements at issue, made the state permit one that could be issued, and supported the interpretation of \u00a7 9(b) as requiring evidence of compliance with those state requirements, rather than compliance only with those requirements consistent with the federal license.\u201d <em>(California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 500-502, fn. omitted.) By \u201csaved,\u201d the court made explicit that it was referring to \u201can interpretation of \u00a7 9(b) that would have . . . accommodated the state permit system and its underlying requirements.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 502.) <em>First Iowa </em>had therefore \u201crejected the possibility of concurrent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The court then administered the coup de grace: \u201cAdhering to <em>First Iowa\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 27, we conclude that the California requirements for minimum in-stream flows cannot be given effect and allowed to supplement the federal flow requirements. ... As Congress directed in FPA \u00a7 10(a), FERC set the conditions of the license, including the minimum stream flow, after considering which requirements would best protect wildlife and ensure that the project would be economically feasible, and thus further power development. [Citations.] Allowing California to impose significantly higher minimum stream flow requirements would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in that considered federal agency determination. FERC has indicated that the California requirements interfere with its comprehensive planning authority, and we agree that allowing California to impose the challenged requirements would be contrary to congressional intent regarding the Commission\u2019s licensing authority and would \u2018constitute a veto of the project that was approved and licensed by the FERC.\u2019 <em>[State of California ex rel. Water Resources Bd. </em>v. <em>F.E.R.C., supra,] </em>877 F.2d, at 749; cf. <em>First Iowa, supra, </em>at 164-165.\u201d <em>(California v.

After almost a decade of controversy attending the project (see <em>LaFlamme v. F.E.R.C. </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 945 F.2d 1124), the FERC granted it a license. When the project proponents filed an application for a state water permit, the Board insisted that an environmental impact report had to be prepared before the Board would consider the application. The proponents filed suit in federal district court, and obtained a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the Board, on the ground that federal authority occupied the field of licensing and regulating hydroelectric power facilities, leaving to the state only the power to determine proprietary water rights. The Board\u2019s appeal failed before the Ninth Circuit. <em>(Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The court\u2019s analysis was brief, almost abrupt. It opened by dismissing the Board\u2019s reliance on section 27 of the ERA: \u201cWe cannot . . . construe this statute on a blank slate. The Supreme Court has read the broadest possible negative pregnant into this \u2018savings clause.\u2019 [(Citing <em>First Iowa, supra, </em>328 U.S. 152, 176.)] The rights reserved to the states in this provision are all the states get. The State Board before us in this case has litigated this very matter before the United States Supreme Court and lost. [(Citing <em>California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490.)] [][] <em>First Iowa </em>involved circumstances similar to the instant case. The Federal Power Commission wanted the project to proceed, but the State of Iowa did not, unless the power cooperative first demonstrated compliance with Iowa law regarding pollution, fish protection, construction, diversion of streams, and other requirements. The diversion of a river, prohibited by state law, was the exact means selected by the Federal Power Commission to generate a maximum amount of electricity. The Supreme Court held that the state and federal authorities do not \u2018share in the final decision of the same issue.\u2019 [(Quoting <em>First Iowa, supra, </em>at p. 168.)]\u201d <em>(Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451, 454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u201cThe language of <em>First Iowa </em>was broad, but its facts arguably left room to treat its construction of [section 27] as dictum, because that case involved a conflict between state and federal requirements. The State Board proposed this reading to the Supreme Court in <em>California v. FERC </em>.... The Court rejected it. [Citation.] The Court read the ratio decidendi of <em>First Iowa </em>as necessarily construing the savings provision \u2018to encompass only laws relating to proprietary rights.\u2019 [Citation.] The Court held that the California minimum stream flow requirement did not reflect proprietary rights in water, so, under <em>First Iowa, </em>federal preemption barred the state regulation.\u201d <em>(Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451, 455.) <em>\u201cCalifornia v. FERC </em>reaffirms <em>First Iowa\u2019s </em>narrow interpretation of the savings provision, so that the only authority states get over federal power projects relates to allocating proprietary rights in water. <em>First Iowa </em>said that the separation of authority between state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>governments \u2018does not require two agencies to share in the final decision of the same issue.\u2019 [(Quoting <em>First Iowa, supra, </em>328 U.S. 152, 167-168.)] <em>California v. FERC </em>reaffirms <em>First Iowa, </em>uses the \u2018occupy the field\u2019 characterization \u2018broad and paramount federal regulatory role,\u2019 [(quoting <em>California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 499)], and plainly states that \u2018constricting \u00a7 27 to encompass only laws relating to proprietary rights\u2019 accomplishes this \u2018no sharing\u2019 purpose. [(Quoting <em>id. </em>at pp. 502-503.)]\u201d <em>(Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>at pp. 455-56, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">And so there be no possible doubt about its reasoning, the court then reiterated: \u201cIn the case at bar, it is clear that the federal laws have occupied the field, preventing state regulation. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that most or all of the State Board\u2019s concerns were considered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in granting the license, and conditions were imposed in the license to protect these multiple values. . . . There would be no point in Congress requiring the federal agency to consider the state agency recommendations on environmental matters and make its own decisions about which to accept, if the state agencies had the power to impose the requirements themselves.\u201d <em>(Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451, 456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The court closed its opinion with a chilling warning: \u201cSayles has suggested that the appeal is frivolous and deserves sanctions. We have not gone so far as this, though the Board\u2019s unwillingness to accept the meaning of the result it obtained in <em>California v. FERC </em>gives us pause. Further litigation which appears to the District Court to be frivolous or for purposes of delay may expose the litigants or their attorneys to sanctions.\u201d <em>(Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451, 456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Thus, twice has the United States Supreme Court, followed by the Ninth Circuit, in the most expansive terms, validated expansive federal authority over the conditions governing operation of hydroelectric projects. These are the commanding heights that plaintiffs have decided to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Plaintiffs do not really discuss <em>First Iowa, California v. FERC, </em>or <em>Sayles Hydro </em>except to dismiss them. Their approach is to note these decisions but claim they are not at all controlling. Plaintiffs purport to distinguish them on the ground that none of them unambiguously holds that \u201cthe FPA preempts states\u2019 water quality laws.\u201d Plaintiffs reason that not one of the federal decisions addressed the states\u2019 role under the Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, long after <em>First Iowa </em>was decided (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 et seq.; No. Pub.L. No. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816), which has a number of provisions permitting\u2014that is, not preempting\u2014state laws devoted to preserving water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>quality.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nor do plaintiffs follow the lead of the trial court in focusing upon <em>PUD No. 1 </em>and <em>S.D. Warren, </em>which are mentioned at only three points in their opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">It is true, as plaintiffs point out, that Porter-Cologne gives the Board the authority and responsibility to abate nuisances affecting the state\u2019s water resources. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13050, subds. (h) &amp; (m), 13225, 13241, 13263, subd. (a), 13340, 13377.) But these statutes, individually or when considered with <em>Calif. Oregon Power, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 858, cannot overcome <em>First Iowa, California </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>and <em>Sayles Hydro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">It is also true that none of these federal court decisions expressly considered the federal Clean Water Act, the provisions of Porter-Cologne, or <em>Calif. Oregon Power. </em>Therefore, according to a strict application of stare decisis, they do not amount to an express refutation of plaintiffs\u2019 thesis. (E.g., <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2008) 45 Cal.4th 218, 236 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 313, 195 P.3d 588] (conc. opn. of Moreno, J.) [\u201c \u2018it is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered\u2019 \u201d].) Nevertheless, the spirit of those decisions cannot be dismissed out of hand on that basis. Nor are they without impact upon our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\"><em>Sayles Hydro </em>interpreted <em>First Iowa </em>and <em>California v. FERC </em>as \u201cfield preemption\u201d decisions, that is, with the exception of their proprietary water rights, states are excluded from interposing their law into the field of hydropower regulation. <em>(Sayles Hydro, supra, </em>985 F.2d 451, 455-456.) This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>is not literally true, because, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>California v. </em>FERC, the FPA does allow states to have input in the form of \u201crecommendations\u201d to FERC during the licensing process. <em>(California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 498-499, citing 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a)(l)-(3), (j)(1)-(2).) But that is the extent of the collaboration allowed by the language of the FPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Although, as a state court, we are not bound by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s construction of the FPA in <em>Sayles Hydro, </em>that construction may be considered. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Zapien </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 989 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704] [\u201c \u2018Decisions of the lower federal courts interpreting federal law, although persuasive, are not binding on state courts.\u2019 \u201d].) In this instance, we agree with <em>Sayles Hydro </em>and its reading of <em>First Iowa </em>and <em>California v. FERC. </em>And we <em>are </em>bound by decisions of the United States Supreme Court in the construction and application of federal law. (E.g., <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1931) 283 U.S. 209, 220-221 [75 L.Ed. 983, 51 S.Ct. 453]; <em>Stock v. Plunkett </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 193, 194-195 [183 P. 657]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 505, p. 568.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">One of the most subtle and original legal thinkers once analogized the strength of a precedent to cosmology; \u201cWe are not now, and probably never will be, able to predict the path of a precedent with absolute certainty. No more can we always, with complete assurance, predict the path of a merely physical object. But at least we know that information about the weight of the object and its direction and velocity at a given point would be relevant to our prediction. So, too, we know something about the relevant factors in plotting the path of a precedent. We know that the line of motion of any precedent is subjected to a special pull that skews it whenever it passes near a point of high value tension.\u201d (Cohen, <em>Field Theory and Judicial Logic </em>(1949-1950) 59 Yale L.J. 238, 249.) Here, we know what that tension point is\u2014and we have proof from a most unusual source.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The brief of the Attorney General on behalf of the Board contains the following extraordinary admission: \u201cIn the interests of candor, the Regional Board will admit at the outset to a certain sense of d\u00e9j\u00e1 vu when reviewing the arguments being offered here by the appellants. That is because very similar arguments, seeking a very similar result, were attempted by the State of California on behalf of the State Water Resources Control Board ... in two federal cases .... Unfortunately, the first of those cases resulted in a ruling by a unanimous United States Supreme Court rejecting California\u2019s arguments, the very contentions being attempted again by the [plaintiffs] here. The second of those cases was a later opinion by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which not only again rejected the arguments being offered by the State in support of its arguments for concurrent enforcement of state permit laws against a federally licensed dam, but also ended with the suggestion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>sanctions might be considered if any similar arguments were attempted in the future. This clear and unequivocal Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit case authority notwithstanding, the plaintiffs have now returned [sic] to this Court offering the same arguments but hoping for an opposite result.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These are unmistakable references to <em>California v. FERC </em>and <em>Sayles Hydro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">This is no ordinary concession by a party to litigation, but a considered view by an administrative agency of the statutes under which it operates. The Board\u2019s view of its lack of authority to enforce California\u2019s water laws as to hydroelectric facilities operating pursuant to federal license would in any case be entitled to at least respectful attention. (E.g., <em>Colmenares v. Braemar Country Club, Inc. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1019, 1029 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 662, 63 P.3d 220] [administrative agency\u2019s construction given \u201csubstantial weight\u201d]; <em>Harrottv.

Duncan </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 289, 304 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 507] [agency view \u201cmay be helpful\u201d].) \u201cThe amount of deference given to the administrative construction depends \u2018 \u201cupon <em>the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>if lacking power to </em>control.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hoechst Celanese Corp. v.

The Board has the scars to prove that it has been down this road already, and more than once. The interest it tried and failed to protect\u2014 regulation of California\u2019s own waters\u2014is an interest to which no state is indifferent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">California, like most Western states, has long appreciated the importance of water. \u201cThe present and future well-being and prosperity of the state depend upon the conservation of its life-giving waters. . . . The conservation of other natural resources is of importance, but the conservation of waters of the state is of transcendent importance. Its waters are the very life blood of its existence.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Gin S. Chow v. City of Santa Barbara </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 673, 701-702 [22 P.2d 5]; see <em>Ivanhoe Irr. Dist v. All Parties </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 597, 621 [306 P.2d 824] [\u201cIt was early realized that water in this semiarid region was of utmost importance to the welfare, progress and prosperity of the people of the state.\u201d], revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom.

Porter-Cologne codifies the Legislature\u2019s recognition of these interests. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13000.) More recently, recreation has become accepted as having equal importance. (See Cal. Const., art. X, \u00a7 4; <em>Marks v. Whitney </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 257, 259 [98 Cal.Rptr. 790, 491 P.2d 374]; <em>Kern River Public Access Com. v. City of Bakersfield </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1205, 1214-1216 &amp; fn. 4 [217 Cal.Rptr. 125].)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">When the matter of a state\u2019s water resources becomes the subject of a state-federal dispute, it would be hard to identify a more vital state interest. It follows that when that interest has twice been subordinated to sweeping federal authority in the form of the FPA, there is no \u201cskew\u201d because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>federal interest prevails even in the presence of the \u201chigh value tension\u201d of traditional state power. (Cohen, <em>Field Theory and Judicial Logic, supra, </em>59 Yale LJ. 238, 249.) It is hardly credible that when it decided <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC </em>the Supreme Court was unaware of the vital interest of states in regulating their water resources, particularly in regard to the most populous state in the union.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The power of the federal precedents, particularly <em>First Iowa </em>and <em>California v. FERC, </em>have a clear and undeviating potency. This explains the Board\u2019s submission and gives it unusual persuasive force. It is also corroborated by logical inference. Even the attorney for the Board who unsuccessfully argued to preserve the state\u2019s power in <em>California v. FERC, </em>although originally not reconciled to the decision, came to accept the principle that California\u2019s \u201cregulatory laws do not apply to hydropower projects.\u201d (Walston, <em>Cal. Water Law: Historical Origins to the Present </em>(2008) 29 Whittier L.Rev. 765, 788; see Walston, California v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: <em>New Roadblock to State Water Rights Administration </em>(1991) 21 Envtl. L. 89, 110 [criticizing <em>California v. FERC </em>as \u201cfailing] to consider and apply the broad historical and policy themes that have persuaded the Court in other recent federal-state water cases to recognize broad state authority\u201d].<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>In both <em>First Iowa </em>and <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>the judicial tone is emphatic in declaring the broadest scope to federal supremacy in the field of regulating hydropower projects, retaining to the states only the limited matter of \u201cproprietary rights.\u201d It is true that plaintiffs are relying on a number, of provisions in the Clean Water Act (see fn. 17, <em>ante) </em>which, considered in the abstract, might support their contention, and which were not expressly considered in either decision. But such statutory isolation is not possible. The obvious import of the Clean Water Act provisions upon which plaintiffs rely seem indistinguishable both in tone and in perceived import from the provision in the Reclamation Act that underlay California\u2019s futile attempt to breach the wall erected by <em>First Iowa. </em>(See fn. 12 and accompanying text, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The remaining arguments plaintiffs advance to avert this conclusion are unavailing. Plaintiffs invoke the principle that courts presume that Congress did not intend to preempt the states\u2019 power over traditional subjects of regulatory authority, including water quality. However, in <em>California v. FERC </em>the Supreme Court explicitly held that this principle is not operative vis-a-vis the FPA. <em>(California </em>v. <em>FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 497-498.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Nor can our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Calif. Oregon Power, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 858, be used to sustain plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u201cThere is no principled distinction between the California Supreme Court\u2019s . . . ruling allowing a public nuisance action to proceed in the face of the FPA and . . . whether the Regional Board should be allowed to proceed pursuant to its authority and duty to implement Porter-Cologne.\u201d In point of fact, there are several distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">First, <em>Calif. Oregon Power </em>did not consider Porter-Cologne because that measure was not enacted until 14 years later (Stats. 1969, ch. 482, \u00a7 18, p. 1051). So, the decision cannot qualify as binding authority concerning that measure. <em>(Goldstein v. Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th 218, 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Second, the <em>Calif. Oregon Power </em>court made a point of noting that the facilities at issue were not operating pursuant to an FPC license. <em>(Calif. Oregon Power, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 858, 861.) It is thus factually distinguishable from the situation here, where it is undisputed that at all relevant times the facilities operated by PacifiCorp have been licensed by the FERC. (See fn. 2 and accompanying text, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Third, the court read <em>First Iowa </em>as not occupying the field of hydropower regulation. <em>(Calif. Oregon Power, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 858, 868-869 [\u201cImplicit in the foregoing opinions is the concept that the field is not exclusively occupied for all purposes by the Federal Power Act or the federal commission.\u201d].) This estimation is clearly no longer tenable after <em>California v. FERC. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Calif. Oregon Power </em>cannot be viewed in isolation from consideration of subsequent federal decisions, which are either independently persuasive\u2014as in the case of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s construction of the FPA in <em>Sayles </em>Hydro\u2014or which are themselves superior to <em>Calif. Oregon </em>Power\u2014as in the case of <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC. </em>Because the point is ultimately one of how federal law is construed, the state Supreme Court\u2019s construction cannot overcome a contrary interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. <em>(Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. v. Martin, supra, </em>283 U.S. 209, 220-221; <em>Stock v. Plunkett, supra, </em>181 Cal. 193, 194-195.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Fourth, it appears that the utility of <em>Calif. Oregon Power </em>to plaintiffs may have been eroded by subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court. In <em>International Paper Co. v. Ouellette </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 481 [93 L.Ed.2d 883, 107 S.Ct. 805], Vermont property owners sued to halt pollution discharged into Lake Champlain by a paper company located in New York as an alleged nuisance under Vermont common law. The court held that the Clean Water Act preempted the action, and that the only law applicable to an interstate state discharge was \u201cthe law of the State in which the point source [of the pollution] is located.\u201d (479 U.S. at p. 487.) The court reiterated this holding in <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1992) 503 U.S. 91 [117 L.Ed.2d 239, 112 S.Ct. 1046], concluding that downsource victims of pollution could not claim the assistance of federal common law when the upstream polluter had a discharge permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, if the pollution of which plaintiffs complain has its source in Klamath facilities in Oregon, especially if they have an Environmental Protection Agency-issued permit, <em>Calif. Oregon Power </em>cannot be treated as controlling. However, neither of these possibilities is established by the record before us. We mention them simply to underscore that, with respect to a 55-year-old decision antedating enactment of the Clean Water Act, as well as <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC </em>and <em>Sayles Hydro, </em>there are legitimate and obvious grounds for questioning whether it states an eternal verity.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Fifth, the preemption of state authority under the FPA that has been accepted by the Board is in Une with the approach courts have taken subsequent to <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC </em>and <em>Sayles Hydro. </em>Our research has discovered only two subsequent decisions which resemble the general outlines of this case: <em>Hackett v. J.L.G. Properties, LLC </em>(2008) 285 Conn. 498 [940 A.2d 769] <em>(Hackett) </em>and <em>Wisconsin Valley Improvement Co. v. Meyer </em>(W.D.Wis. 1996) 910 F.Supp. 1375 <em>(Meyer). </em>In <em>Hackett, </em>the Supreme Court of Connecticut held that the FPA preempted enforcement of municipal zoning laws as to a commercial marina situated on a reservoir generating hydroelectric power pursuant to a FERC license. The court held that that the construction given section 27 of the FPA by <em>First Iowa </em>and <em>California v. FERC </em>\u201cis not limited to water flow issues, but is instructive on all matters in which states seek to impose requirements on hydroelectric power projects.\u201d <em>(Hackett, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>supra, </em>at p. <em>111.) Sayles Hydro </em>was cited for its determination of congressional intent \u201cto occupy the field and create a \u2018broad and paramount federal regulatory role ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Hackett, supra, </em>at p. 778.) And in <em>Meyer, </em>a federal district considered a claim that the FPA preempted a state statute characterized as \u201cauthoriz[ing] the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to impose fees on applicants for hydropower licenses to cover the costs of the studies the department conducts to determine the environmental impact of proposed hydroelectric projects.\u201d <em>(Meyer, supra, </em>at p. 1377.) The court concluded that the state statute was preempted: \u201cAlthough the Wisconsin statute is directed only to the payment of the cost of studies ... it adds another requirement and an additional cost to the securing of a license. Having to pay fees to the state to cover the costs of such studies may deter a hydropower company from developing its project in the state of Wisconsin. ... To that extent, [the state statute] functions as an economic deterrent to license applicants and can be construed as an implicit \u2018veto power\u2019 by the state similar to laws requiring applicants to meet more stringent state requirements than those provided by the federal licensing scheme.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1382-1383.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Plaintiffs urge us to start at square one, applying the standard preemption criteria, and determine whether Congress intended an exclusive federal occupation of the field of hydropower regulation. They contend that such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>analysis will demonstrate that the Clean Water Act was not meant to oust state power, and that the FPA was not meant to ignore what plaintiffs characterize as \u201cstate water quality protection laws.\u201d But the court in <em>California v. FERC </em>declined a similar invitation when it refused to revisit the soundness of <em>First Iowa. </em>We think this a sound precedent to follow. And we mean precedent in both its literal and figurative senses.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">It is literally true because in <em>California v. FERC </em>the Supreme Court reiterated <em>First Iowa's </em>conclusion that the FPA occupies the field of hydro-power regulation <em>(California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 499, 506), and, to reiterate once again, we are not at liberty to ignore that conclusion. <em>(Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>283 U.S. 209, 220-221; <em>Stock </em>v. <em>Plunkett, supra, </em>181 Cal. 193, 194-195.) Even were we not strictly obliged by stare decisis to follow the two decisions by the United States Supreme Court, we would still choose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Justice Brand\u00e9is famously said that <em>\u201cStare decisis </em>is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right\u201d <em>(Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co. </em>(1932) 285 U.S. 393, 406 [76 L.Ed. 815, 52 S.Ct. 443] (dis. opn. of Brandeis, J.)), a principle invoked by the court in <em>California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 500. Translated to the vernacular, this means \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d And at some point, it has to mean \u201cKnock it off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The Board eventually reached the latter conclusion, halting its efforts to get around FPA preemption. Plaintiffs have now taken up the standard for state power, bringing up the same policy and prudential arguments federal and state courts have uniformly rejected when advanced by the Board. But when the United States Supreme Court unanimously holds that \u201cthe FPA establishes <em>a broad and paramount federal. .. role\u201d (California </em>v. <em>FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 499, italics added), that conclusion should be afforded a respect that goes beyond what is strictly demanded by stare decisis. The court there noted that its earlier opinion in <em>First Iowa </em>had subsequently been \u201cemployed . . . with approval in a range of decisions, both addressing the FPA and in other contexts.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Allowing for its shorter existence, so too it has proven with <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC. </em>(See <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(2008) 552 U.S. 130, 139 [169 L.Ed.2d 591, 128 S.Ct. 750]; <em>PUD No. 1, supra, </em>511 U.S. 700, 720-722; <em>Maislin Industries, U. S. v. Primary Steel </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 116, 131, 135 [111 L.Ed.2d 94, 110 S.Ct. 2759].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">A determination of federal preemption does not automatically mean that state input is categorically prohibited and state opinion of no consequence. The Clean Water Act gives states what appears to be a very substantial role by requiring that an applicant for any federal license comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>with state water quality procedures. (See fn. 17, <em>ante; S.D. Warren, supra, </em>547 U.S. 370, 386; <em>PUD No. 1, supra, </em>511 U.S. 700, 707, 713.) But the crucial points are (1) that it is Congress that determines what is the extent of state input, and (2) that input takes place within the context of FERC licensing procedures as specified in the FPA. It is only when states attempt to act outside of this <em>federal </em>context and this <em>federal </em>statutory scheme under authority of independent state law that such collateral assertions of state power are nullified. All of these points were acknowledged by the Board in its supplemental analysis. (See fn. 6 and accompanying text, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u201cRivers mean different things to different people. Rivers are home and habitat to fish and wildlife. They are a means both of transportation and of waste disposal. They can be a source of spiritual regeneration. They can also be a source of power production. They provide life and they can take it away. [|] Given the multitude of expectations associated with rivers and the institutional structures that have developed to fulfill those expectations, conflict is inevitable.\u201d (Sherk, <em>Approaching a Gordian Knot: The Ongoing State/Federal Conflict Over Hydropower </em>(1996) 31 Land &amp; Water L.Rev. 349, 350.) So it has proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">California has long appreciated the nonpareil importance of its internal waters. (See, e.g., <em>Ivanhoe Irr. Dist v. All Parties, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d 597, 621; <em>Gin S. Chow v. City of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>217 Cal. 673, 701-702; <em>Joerger v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., supra, </em>207 Cal. 8, 22.) The state and the Board appear to have done their utmost in trying to keep as much power as possible in California\u2019s hands. But their efforts met only defeat. The FPA has established \u201ca highly complex and long-enduring regulatory regime.\u201d <em>(California v. FERC, supra, </em>495 U.S. 490, 500.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Reasonable minds might disagree as to the wisdom of entrusting the subject to federal supremacy, but the reality of that decision is no longer open to debate. <em>(Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. v. Martin, supra, </em>283 U.S. 209, 220-221; <em>Stock v. Plunkett, supra, </em>181 Cal. 193, 194-195.) The trial court correctly determined that it should not compel the Board to upset this long-settled applecart.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion in Granting the Request for Attorney Fees Pursuant to Section 1021.5</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The trial court decided to return the matter to the Board in order that it could \u201cgive a more complete response to [plaintiffs] as to the reasoning involved\u201d in the Board\u2019s decision. Specifically, the court apparently thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the Board had not sufficiently considered the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>S.D. Warren, supra, </em>547 U.S. 370, and <em>PUD No. 1, supra, </em>511 U.S. 700, which considered state power under the Clean Water Act and which were decided after <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">When it sent the matter back to the Board, the trial court told the Board: \u201cit is insufficient to refuse to grant petitioners\u2019 request based solely on the FPA\u2019s preemption of state laws; respondent [(i.e., the Board)] must also address the role of state laws through the Clean Water Act and in light of the rulings and rationale of all of the relevant authority, including the two most recent U.S. Supreme Court cases [(i.e., <em>PUD No. 1 </em>and <em>S.D. Warren)].\u201d </em>Prior to doing so, the trial court stated to counsel that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t do much harm basically.\u201d The court also inquired of counsel for the Board, \u201cI don\u2019t see much prejudice in it to the defendants/respondents, do you?\u201d Not having the gift of prescience, counsel was unable to foresee that the court\u2019s action would form the basis for its subsequent decision to award plaintiffs over $138,000 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In the order announcing the award, the trial court reasoned: \u201cBecause Respondent [Board] and Real Party in Interest [PacifiCorp] did not include any discussion or rationale for this determination in their opposition to Petitioners\u2019 Petition (or attempt to reconcile the U.S. Supreme Court cases that appeared to conflict [i.e., <em>PUD No. 1 </em>and <em>S.D. Warren]), </em>the court must assume that Respondent had not conducted a thoughtful, well-considered analysis of this issue, but simply assumed (as both Respondent and Real Party in Interest stated in their opposition) that Federal law applies because it preempts California law\u2014even though that argument is inconsistent with two recent U.S. Supreme Court cases. Thus the court assumes that it was Petitioner\u2019s action in bringing this lawsuit, and the court\u2019s granting of their petition and issuance of a writ ordering Respondent to reconsider their decision about the application of RWDs and WDRs, that caused Respondent to make a thoughtful and well-reasoned determination about this issue. Well-reasoned decisions about water quality and waste discharge are an important public benefit.\u201d \u201cThough the court understands that Respondent and Real Party In Interest may well feel they are the prevailing parties, nevertheless it is the court\u2019s intention to grant attorneys fees to the Petitioners in the amount of $138,250, half of which is to be paid by Respondent and half of which is to be paid by Real Party in Interest.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The Governing Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Section 1021.5 provides in pertinent part: \u201cUpon motion, a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u201c \u2018The Legislature adopted section 1021.5 as a codification of the private attorney general doctrine of attorney fees developed in prior judicial decisions. . . . [T]he private attorney general doctrine \u201crests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions, and that, without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees, private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.\u201d Thus, the fundamental objective of the doctrine is to encourage suits enforcing important public policies by providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in such cases.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u201cIn order to effectuate that policy, we have taken a broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a \u2018successful party.\u2019 \u2018Our prior cases uniformly explain that an attorney fee award may be justified even when the plaintiff\u2019s legal action does not result in a favorable final judgment. [Citations.] It is also clear that the procedural device by which a plaintiff seeks to enforce an important right is not determinative of his or her entitlement to attorney fees under section 1021.5. [Citation.] Similarly, a section 1021.5 award is not necessarily barred merely because the plaintiff won the case on a preliminary issue. [Citation.] In determining whether a plaintiff is a successful party for purposes of section 1021.5, \u201c[t]he critical fact is the impact of the action, not the manner of its resolution.\u201d [Citation.] ['][] The trial court in its discretion \u201cmust realistically assess the litigation and determine, from a practical perspective, whether or not the action served to vindicate an important right so as to justify an attorney fee award\u201d under section 1021.5.

Because the trial court misapplied, as a matter of law, the statutory criteria of section 1021.5, the Board and PacifiCorp argue that no informed exercise of discretion occurred, and thus no deference is due under the lenient abuse standard. We agree that, however the trial court\u2019s decision is characterized, and regardless of which standard of review is applied, the award made by the trial court is too flawed to survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u201cThe appropriate benchmarks in determining which party prevailed are (a) the situation immediately prior to the commencement of suit, and (b) the situation today, and the role, if any, played by the litigation in effecting any changes between the two.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] . . . \u2018 \u201c[P]laintiffs may be considered \u2018prevailing parties\u2019 for attorney\u2019s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Maria P., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1281, 1291-1292.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The Board and PacifiCorp hit the obvious points. The relief sought by plaintiffs was (1) a determination by the trial court that the Board was legally wrong as to the enforceability of Porter-Cologne in the face of the FPA, and (2) a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the Board to abandon its nonenforcement of Porter-Cologne. Neither objective was ever achieved. The only relief\u2014using the term in the broadest sense\u2014obtained by plaintiff was the limited remand to the Board, and that was not something sought by plaintiffs, but appears to have been the brainchild of the trial court. There is no answer to the Board\u2019s statement that plaintiffs \u201ccan point to no meaningful success whatever in this action,\u201d an absence eloquently demonstrated by plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the judgment \u201cin which they are challenging the trial court\u2019s ruling against them on all issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Plaintiffs insist they did prevail: \u201cHere, the Karuk were the successful party, having obtained a final judgment and writ of mandate in their favor requiring the Regional Board to set aside the portions of Resolution Rl-2007-0028 that the Karuk Tribe challenged and to reconsider those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>portions in light of the applicable federal law. This outcome secured essentially all of the relief sought by the Karuk Tribe .... The order obtained by the Karuk Tribe ensured that the Regional Board did not arbitrarily and without sufficient explanation forego its statutory duties to protect water quality and provided the trial court\u2014for the first time\u2014a reviewable basis of the Regional Board\u2019s decision that federal hydropower law preempts the fundamental California water quality law. Thus, the action meets the criteria of section 1021.5 in that it has \u2018contributed in a significant way\u2019 to vindicating an important public right that the Regional Board not arbitrarily disavow its duty to protect California\u2019s water quality and wildlife resources. In doing so, the Karuk Tribe conferred a substantial benefit on the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Plaintiffs characterize their litigation as intended only \u201cto cure the Regional Board\u2019s flawed preemption analysis in Resolution No. Rl-2007-0028.\u201d They see themselves as vindicating \u201cthe public\u2019s right to ensure that governmental agencies follow the letter of the law,\u201d as well as the public\u2019s \u201cimportant right to challenge arbitrary decisions by the Regional Board, including those rendered arbitrary its failure to explain its reasoning.\u201d \u201cBy forcing the Board to reconsider its Resolution, this case resulted in the enforcement of important public rights affecting the public interest and conferred significant benefits on the public by ensuring the proper review of decisions before the Board and the effectuation of fundamental statutory policy, including careful analysis by the Regional Board before disavowing its critical role under Porter-Cologne to protect the water quality of the Klamath River . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to recast the purpose, scope, and outcome of the litigation is completely unpersuasive. The cold hard reality, from a practical assessment, is that plaintiffs lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Before plaintiffs commenced this litigation, the Board declined to enforce Porter-Cologne against the Klamath River dams on the ground that, as to the matter of water quality, federal authority was supreme and exclusive. When this litigation ended, the Board was still declining to enforce Porter-Cologne. Again, to quote the Board, \u201cthe final result of [plaintiffs\u2019] efforts before the trial court were to change nothing, and those efforts had no impact on the Board\u2019s position as it existed when the action was first filed.\u201d The only difference was that the Board now had the concurrence of the trial court. If \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe critical fact is the impact of the action\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Graham, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 553, 566), that impact can only be described as nil. \u201c[I]n order to justify a fee award, there must be a causal connection between the lawsuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and the relief obtained\u201d <em>(Westside Community, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 348, 353) or \u201ca change in the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d <em>(Urbaniak </em>v. <em>Newton </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1837, 1842 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 333]). But here there was neither genuine relief obtained by plaintiffs nor change by the Board. Any realistic assessment of this litigation from a practical perspective based on the impact of the case as a whole (see <em>Graham, supra, </em>at p. 566; <em>Punsly v. Ho, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th 102, 111) can come to no other conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">California accepts that \u201c \u2018 \u201cplaintiffs may be considered \u2018prevailing parties\u2019 for attorney\u2019s fees purposes if they succeed on <em>any significant issue </em>in litigation which achieves some of the benefit <em>the parties sought </em>in bringing suit.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Maria P., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292, italics added, quoting <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 424, 433 [76 L.Ed.2d 40, 103 S.Ct. 1933]; accord, <em>Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 153 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 273].) The only relief/achievement/success from this litigation was the remand to the Board. However, it was not a significant issue\u2014indeed, it was no issue\u2014and it certainly was not sought by plaintiffs, but was engineered by the trial court for its own reasons. Nowhere in plaintiffs\u2019 petition is there a hint that they wanted a fuller explanation from the Board supporting its conclusion that it was powerless against the ERA. The Clean Water Act is mentioned, but there is no allegation that the Board had failed to give it adequate consideration. To hear plaintiffs tell it, all they sought was the Board\u2019s reconsideration with fuller examination of the Clean Water Act, or as plaintiffs otherwise recast it, their litigation merely seeking to have the Board polish up and augment its decision, crossing a few more t\u2019s and dotting a few extra i\u2019s, showing that all analytical bases were touched on the way to concluding that plaintiffs\u2019 request was barred by reason of the FPA\u2019s preemptive effect. And having received that, it satisfied the goal of their litigation. This argument borders on the preposterous.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Leaving to one side plaintiffs\u2019 understandable but questionable characterization of the writ issued as a final judgment (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>we cannot agree that it \u201csecured essentially all the relief\u2019 they sought. Their position does not account for plaintiffs renewing their attack on the Board\u2019s reconsidered decision that it was preempted by federal law. If indeed a fuller explanation was all plaintiffs sought, their appeal from the ultimate judgment is inexplicable. And a review of their petition leaves no doubt that plaintiffs\u2019 goal was not to overturn resolution No. Rl-2007-0028 because it was procedurally flawed, but because it was substantively wrong.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>admit in their respondents\u2019 brief on the appeal from the fee order, they still maintain that the Board\u2019s second denial is \u201cincorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">That plaintiffs do not qualify as successful parties can be demonstrated at a more elemental level, while also establishing that they do not satisfy two of the other criteria for an award of fees under section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The Board does admit that, at best, the trial court\u2019s remand corrected \u201c \u2018no more than a procedural defect\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018a minute blemish.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Balch Enterprises, Inc. v. New Haven Unified School Dist. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 783, 795 [268 Cal.Rptr. 543], and <em>Concerned Citizens of La Habra v. City of La Habra </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 329, 335 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 599].) PacifiCorp calls it a \u201climited procedural achievement\u201d involving only \u201ca purely technical and procedural matter.\u201d However, even these modest characterizations are overgenerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">As previously mentioned, plaintiffs\u2019 request to the Board that it enforce Porter-Cologne was denied by resolution No. Rl-2007-0028. The resolution is seven pages in length and has 27 paragraphs preceding this decision: \u201cPetitioners\u2019 request to require PacifiCorp to submit a ROWD for Copco and Iron Gate Dams is DECLINED . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>However, a careful examination of the statutes governing the state and the regional water resources control boards<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and their operations has uncovered nothing that requires such a decision by the WRCB to be in a particular form.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This encompasses the statutes concerning the WRCB\u2019s functioning either in general (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 174-188.5, 1050-1124), or in enforcing Porter-Cologne (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13200-13228.15), as well as the implementing regulations (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 647-649.6). Concerning any \u201caction or failure,\u201d the WRCB is expected to a issue only a \u201cdecision or order\u201d (Wat.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1126, 13330). There is no directive that there must be \u201cwritten findings,\u201d an obligation found in various other codes and contexts. (E.g., Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17250.20, 81702; Fish &amp; G. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 219, 2118.2; Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 14023, 33264; Gov.

If the WRCB had no obligation to explain the basis for its action, it follows that it had no obligation to provide a more detailed explanation. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, there was nothing \u201carbitrary\u201d in the WRCB\u2019s actions because the WRCB had no obligation \u201cto explain its reasoning.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Generating the additional reasoning by the WRCB addressing the Clean Water Act, <em>PUD No. 1 </em>and <em>S.D. </em>Warren\u2014all of which were already cited in resolution No. Rl-2007-0028\u2014was not a \u201c \u2018 \u201csignificant issue . . . [plaintiffs] sought in bringing suit.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Maria R., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292.) And while the subject of water quality undoubtedly amounts to \u201c \u2018an important right affecting the public interest,\u2019 \u201d in no sense did plaintiffs cause it to be \u201cenforced\u201d because there was no change in the WRCB\u2019s position. <em>(Westside Community, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 348, 352.) Providing that augmented explanation does not, as the trial court concluded, qualify as a \u201csignificant benefit\u201d worth $138,000 to the people of California. <em>(Planned Parenthood v. Aakhus, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 162, 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We have exercised our independent review because, as a matter of law, plaintiffs satisfied none of the requisites for an award of attorney fees under section 1021.5. <em>(Connerly v. State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>37 Cal.4th 1169, 1175.) From a realistic appreciation of the entirety of this litigation, plaintiffs did not prevail on a significant issue and thus do not qualify as successful parties. They also did not enforce an important public right. Finally, what plaintiffs did here did not confer a significant benefit. For each and all of these reasons, the fee award to plaintiffs was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In A124351, the judgment is affirmed.

In actuality, there are two Copco dams, each with its own reservoir, called Copco No. 1 and Copco No. 2. Copco No. 1\u2014the first on the river\u2014was constructed in 1917 and 1918 and is much the larger of the two installations. Copco No. 2, located only a quarter-mile downriver, was built in 1925, but it has greater importance in generating electricity (27 megawatts as opposed to 20 for Copco No. 1). We mention these details because it is not certain from plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and other filings whether this action is aimed at one or both Copco facilities. Although it is of no consequence to these appeals, we shall assume that plaintiffs did target both Copco facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The Iron Gate Dam is the newest of the facilities named in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Constructed in 1962, it is located several miles downriver from the Copco dams. It is by far the largest of the dams, and is authorized to generate 18 megawatts. Once past this facility, the Klamath River flows unobstructed to the sea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\"> The licensing process apparently moves at a glacial pace. PacifiCorp applied for relicensing in 2004, two years before the existing 50-year license would expire. Our record ends in December of 2008, with no indication that a final decision had been made on PacifiCorp\u2019s application. It also appears that PacifiCorp can continue to operate the project until that decision is made, and that PacifiCorp is planning to decommission parts of the facilities in the project.

Board a ROWD containing such information and data as may be required by the . . . Board, unless the . . . Board waives such requirement. Discharges from the tailrace of a dam are considered a \u2018discharge of waste\u2019 under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act. <em>(Lake Madrone Water Dist. v. [State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1989)] 209 Cal.App.3d 163 [256 Cal.Rptr. 894]. . . .)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\u201c... The Petitioners request that the Regional Water Board order PacifiCorp to file a ROWD and/or issue WDRs for Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs, pursuant to the California Water Code. These hydroelectric facilities are regulated under the Federal Power Act through a federal license by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The federal license may contain certain conditions to adequately protect, mitigate and enhance beneficial public uses. In issuing the federal license, FERC has a duty to ensure that the project is best adapted to the Basin Plan [(i.e., the Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region)]. (16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 803(a); see also 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.19 [the Basin Plan is part of California\u2019s comprehensive plan for the orderly and coordinated control, protection, conservation, development and utilization of the water resources of the state, and has been submitted for filing pursuant to . . . FERC . . . regulations].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">\u201c. . . The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal Power Act preempts state law. The state may not require a permit for a project already licensed by FERC except for proprietary rights to water. (See <em>First Iowa Hydro-Electric Cooperative </em>v. <em>FPC </em>[(1946)] 328 U.S. 152 [90 L.Ed. 1143, 66 S.Ct. 906] . . . ; <em>California v.

Accordingly, the Regional Water Board cannot effectively require PacifiCorp to submit a ROWD and/or issue WDRs for the Copco and Iron Gate facilities, as requested by Petitioners.\u201d (Board res. No. Rl-2007-0028.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">The Board\u2019s resolution also makes it clear that plaintiffs were attempting to halt discharges of an algae called <em>Microcystis aeruginosa </em>that produces a toxin called microcystin, which together are causing adverse consequences contrary to the Board\u2019s Basin Plan for the Klamath River. The resolution further recites that the Board is cooperating with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to formulate \u201cTotal Maximum Daily Loads\u201d to address these discharges. One of PacifiCorp\u2019s filings before the Board identifies three species of protected fish in the California stretches of the Klamath River.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> The operative language of the court\u2019s \u201cJudgment Granting Petition For Writ Of Mandate\u201d reads in pertinent part: \u201cA peremptory writ of mandamus shall issue commanding [Board] . . . to reconsider petitioners\u2019 February 20, 2007 petition and make a determination, consistent with this court\u2019s ruling, whether the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, Water Code \u00a7 13000 <em>et seq., </em>is preempted by the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 793a <em>et seq., </em>in light of all the relevant law, including the Clean Water Act, the recent United States Supreme Court cases applying state law to hydroelectric projects and the cases stating that the FPA preempts state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Although designated as peremptory, the writ appears more characteristic of an alternative writ. As previously mentioned, plaintiffs sought both forms of the writ of mandate, and both traditional and administrative mandate allow for the alternative writ. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1087; Cal. Civil Writ Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed. 2009) \u00a7 9.2 et seq.; Cal. Administrative Mandamus (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 2010) \u00a7 11.42 et seq.) Issuance of either form of an alternative writ can, as occurred here, follow a hearing in the trial court. (Cal. Civil Writ Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.4, pp. 216-217; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 185, p. 1090, both citing <em>Patterson v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1947) 79 Cal.App.2d 670, 672 [180 P.2d 945].) Returning the matter to the Board was very much like a remand, a step common in administrative mandate proceedings prior to entry of a final judgment (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (e); Cal. Administrative Mandamus, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.27 et seq.), and not itself appealable. <em>(Village Trailer Park, Inc. v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1139-1140 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 857].) This interpretation is consistent with the trial court deciding to grant plaintiffs\u2019 petition only \u201cin part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Moreover, the subsequent conduct of the parties, and of the trial court, indicates that they did not accept the designation of the writ as conclusive as to its nature. Neither the Board nor PacifiCorp appealed from the judgment directing issuance of the writ, which did not grant plaintiffs the ultimate form of relief they desired, namely, a judicial order to the Board directing it to apply state law, and thus did not meet the statutory definition of a final judgment. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 577, 1064.) Given the terms of the writ directing the Board to \u201creconsider\u201d its denial of plaintiffs\u2019 petition, it is not surprising that none of the parties, or the court, subsequently suggested that the Board\u2019s reconsideration of the issue was contrary to the terms of the writ or otherwise inappropriate. The court\u2019s subsequent decision to accept the Board\u2019s decision following the reconsideration ordered by the court as a \u201creturn\u201d to the writ also suggests that the writ was intended as interlocutory. (See Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1089, 1094; Cal. Civil Writ Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.48 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Finally, the subsequent judgment from which plaintiffs appealed \u201cdischarged\u201d the writ issued to the Board, which is a feature of finality in writ practice. (See <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 389, 394 [105 Cal.Rptr. 500]; Cal. Civil Writ Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.48, p. 231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">It is for these reasons that we have characterized the writ issued by the trial court as an alternative writ that was intended as merely an interim measure of relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b314-5\"> As the Board explained in the supplemental analysis: \u201cUnder section 401 of the Clean Water Act, water quality certification by the state is required for any activity requiring a federal license or permit, which may result in any discharge to surface waters. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.) .. . In issuing water quality certification, the state may impose conditions on a federal project or a project required to obtain a federal permit, in order to certify that the project protects beneficial uses and meets water quality objectives as specified in the Basin Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Elaborating, the Board reasoned that \u201csection 401 of the Clean Water Act gives the states broad powers over FERC licensed hydroelectric projects, including the power to impose additional conditions or even veto the licensing or relicensing of project subject to FERC licensing. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341(a) [\u2018No license shall be granted if certification is denied.\u2019], 1341(d) [\u2018Any certification provided under this section . . . shall become a condition on any Federal license or permit subject to the provisions of this section.\u2019].) At first blush, this might seem inconsistent with <em>California </em>v. <em>FERC </em>and <em>Sayles Hydro, </em>which held that the Federal Power Act preempts state authority to deny, impose additional conditions of operation, or even request additional information of FERC licensees based on water quality or other environmental concerns. But there are two important differences between 401 certification authority and the state permitting requirements at issue in <em>California v. FERC </em>and <em>Sayles Hydro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201cFirst, the water quality certification requirements of section 401 of the Clean Water Act are established under federal law .... [W]here a federal law incorporates state requirements, it makes those requirements federal requirements. For purposes of federal preemption analysis, the substantive requirements of state law applied through the water quality certification analysis become requirements of federal law .... [ID Second, states exercise water quality certification authority in connection with the FERC licensing process. In this regard, conditions of certification are like the recommendations a state agency may make to FERC as part of the FERC licensing process .... If a state agency recommends conditions of approval based on what state law would require if the state agency had authority to apply state law and FERC accepts those recommendations and adopts them as conditions of the FERC license, the licensing process has effectively applied state substantive law requirements to the FERC licensee. A water quality certification is similar, except that the state\u2019s conditions are not mere recommendations\u2014they are binding on FERC. With both non-binding recommendations accepted by FERC and binding certifications, the state\u2019s environmental requirements apply to the licensee through the FERC licensing process and as conditions of the FERC license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">After summarizing <em>PUD No. 1 </em>and <em>S.D. Warren, </em>the Board concluded: \u201cState water quality certification authority over FERC licensed hydroelectric projects is broad substantively but subject to relatively narrow procedural limitations governing how and when that authority may be exercised. The state has broad authority to deny or condition certification based on federal or state water quality requirements. But the state only has an opportunity to deny or condition certification in connection with the FERC licensing process, which occurs only when the original license is issued, the project is relicensed, or the licensee applies for a FERC license amendment. And the state must exercise that authority through the certification process. The initiation of a FERC relicensing proceeding provides authority for the state to apply its water quality certification requirements; it does not lift the Federal Power Act preemption that applies to independent state law permitting requirements like WDR or environmental requirements for water right permitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Moreover, the Board made clear that it fully intended to exercise this authority: \u201cAs authorized by section 401 of the Clean Water Act, the State Water Board will apply appropriate state water quality requirements as part of its decision to issue or deny water quality certification, and the State Water Board\u2019s action will be applied to the Klamath Hydroelectric Project through the [pending] FERC licensing proceeding . . . .\u201d It may be pertinent to note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>that at one point counsel for the Board advised the trial court that plaintiffs \u201care very much involved in the 401 process.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not dispute the accuracy of this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The Board also noted that, its additional analysis notwithstanding, \u201cNo amendment to the original Resolution is required.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b315-11\"> During the pendency of these appeals, the Secretary of the Interior announced a tentative agreement that looks to the closure and removal of four of the facilities comprising the Klamath Hydroelectric Project, including the dam-reservoirs that are the focus of this litigation. The signatories to this agreement include Oregon, California, the federal government, PacifiCorp, and all of the plaintiffs except Klamath Riverkeeper. However, because the dams are not set to be decommissioned until 2020, it seems unlikely that a decision on the merits of these appeals can be avoided on the theory that the controversy is moot. The matter of decommissioning the facilities is additionally pertinent because it may be plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate aim. In their petition to the Board, plaintiffs mention that one of the measures the Board could consider in enforcing Porter-Cologne was \u201cthe decommissioning and dismantling of the . . . dams.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> Effective October 1, 1977, a number of the functions of the FPC were transferred to the newly created FERC, including \u201cthe investigation, issuance, transfer, renewal, revocation, and enforcement of licenses and permits for the construction, operation, and maintenance of dams, water conduits, reservoirs, powerhouses, transmission lines, or other works for the development and improvement of navigation and for the development and utilization of power across, along, from, or in navigable waters under ... the Federal Power Act [(16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 791a et seq.)].\u201d (Pub.L.

Judge Alsup dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was preempted by the FPA, as construed in <em>First Iowa, California v.

None of those binding decisions indicated that their holdings should be limited to instances where a state agency, rather than a private individual, was attempting to impede the federal regulatory scheme. What those decisions held was that <em>any </em>state law or regulation that \u2018would be an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes of the objectives of Congress in authorizing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to license the project to proceed\u2019 should be prohibited. <em>Sayles Hydro, </em>985 F.2d at 456.

By focusing, instead, upon the relationships between evidence and findings and between findings and ultimate action, the Legislature sought to direct the reviewing court\u2019s attention to the analytic route the administrative agency traveled from evidence to action. In so doing, we believe that the Legislature must have contemplated that the agency would reveal this route. Reference, in section 1094.5, to the reviewing court\u2019s duty to compare the evidence and ultimate decision to <em>\u2018the </em>findings\u2019 (italics added) we believe leaves no room for the conclusion that the Legislature would have been content to have a reviewing court speculate as to the administrative agency\u2019s basis for decision.\u201d (11 Cal.3d at p. 515.)

Nevertheless, the context for these statements was <em>evidentiary </em>findings made during an <em>adjudicatory </em>decision. (See also <em>id. </em>at pp. 512, fn. 8, 515, 518.) The contents of resolution No. Rl-2007-0028 and the supplemental analysis give no basis for concluding that the WRCB was deciding contested evidentiary issues. Quite the contrary, the portions of both quoted throughout this opinion deal only with purely legal issues. Moreover, as noted, the WRCB expressly noted that it was not acting in an adjudicatory capacity (see fn. 27, <em>ante), </em>and therefore Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 would not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> There are occasional references in the Water Code to a \u201cdecision <em>and </em>order\" by the WRCB (Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13228.14, 13321, italics added), but there appears to be no significance to this variation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> There appear to be only two instances where an action by the WRCB must be accompanied by supporting finding of facts. The first involves the procedures for imposing civil penalties for \u201cminor violation[s]\u201d of Porter-Cologne that are \u201cwarranted or required by federal law.\u201d (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13399.2, subd. (k)); the second involves the funding of projects in the Delta Tributary Watershed Program <em>{id.., </em>\u00a7 78647.10, subd. (a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> Plaintiffs rely on two instances where a fee award was upheld after a local governmental entity did not comply with the procedural requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.) and the initial decision of the entity was reversed: <em>Bowman v. City of Berkeley </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 447] and <em>Protect Our Water v. City of Merced </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 488 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 202]. Plaintiffs mistakenly analogize to the proceedings here, asserting that \u201cthe record lacked analysis necessary to substantiate the [WRCB]\u2019s vacated determination.\u201d Because there are no comparable procedural restraints attending the WRCB\u2019s nonadjudicatory decision here, these authorities are clearly distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
