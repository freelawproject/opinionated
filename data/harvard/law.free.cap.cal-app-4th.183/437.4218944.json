J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKa\">Plaintiffs Sylvia Cotton, Janice Mitchell, Patricia Miller and Tenie Essex appeal from judgments dismissing their claims against defendants StarCare Medical Group, Inc. (StarCare), and PacifiCare of California, Inc. (PacifiCare). In case No. G040920, the court entered judgment for StarCare after sustaining its demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint without leave to amend and denying a motion to either set aside the ruling or grant reconsideration of it. In case No. G041809, the court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action against PacifiCare after sustaining its demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">We granted a request to consolidate the appeals because they arose from the same underlying lawsuit and it appeared they presented the same primary issue, whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims against these defendants are preempted by the federal Medicare Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 et seq.; Medicare Act). Upon further review, we reverse the judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action against StarCare because the trial court abused its discretion by ruling on StarCare\u2019s demurrer to the original complaint after the parties stipulated to continue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>hearing on objections to the original complaint and allow plaintiffs an opportunity to submit an amended complaint. As for the judgment dismissing the action against PacifiCare, we shall affirm the dismissal as to one cause of action but reverse as to the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">1. <em>Case No. G040920</em></p>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">a. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The original complaint identified plaintiffs as the children of T. J. Jackson, a man over 64 years of age. They alleged Jackson \u201cassigned his Medicare benefit to and enrolled as a member of \u2018Secure Horizons,\u2019 a health plan for seniors operated by PacifiCare,\u201d which \u201cagreed to provide to [Jackson] all of the services to which he was entitled under Medicare . . . .\u201d StarCare is described as a \u201cbusiness organization of unknown type\u201d in some manner related to Gateway Medical Group, Inc., an entity described \u201cas a \u2018medical group.\u2019 \u201d Plaintiffs alleged StarCare and Gateway contracted with physicians to secure the latters\u2019 services and, in turn, contracted with Secure Horizons to \u201cprovide all \u2018physician services\u2019 \u201d to enrollees plus \u201c \u2018utilization review,\u2019 a process by which requests for authorization for medical services of any kind, submitted on behalf of enrollees ... are reviewed to determine medical appropriateness . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Plaintiffs alleged that, after Jackson underwent surgery to repair a broken leg, he went to a nursing facility named St. Edna Subacute and Rehabilitation Center (St. Edna\u2019s) operated by another named defendant, Covenant Care California (Covenant). They pleaded St. Edna\u2019s failed to provide adequate care to Jackson, causing him to \u201csuffer from starvation, dehydration, and infection, as well as emotional distress,\u201d ultimately resulting in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The complaint alleged StarCare was obligated to oversee Jackson\u2019s treatment while at St. Edna\u2019s, but allowed its receipt of \u201ca fixed or periodic fee\u201d for services and its participation \u201cin a risk sharing agreement\u201d that gave it a portion of \u201cany savings resulting from the denial of reasonably necessary medical care,\u201d to affect its decisions concerning his health care. Thus, StarCare breached its duties to \u201creview requests for . . . medical service\u201d based solely on \u201cwhether the requested service was reasonably medically necessary\u201d and to \u201cconduct utilization review and quality assurance activities without regard for the cost,\u201d and also failed to inform Jackson and his family of its financial conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>StarCare and other defendants filed demurrers and motions to strike the complaint. In part StarCare\u2019s demurrer argued the causes of action alleged against it were preempted by the Medicare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The court set a hearing on the demurrers and motions to strike for May 2, 2008. On April 24, the parties submitted an executed stipulation agreeing to continue the hearing to June 6. The trial court denied the request, apparently because it failed to explain the necessity for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">On April 29, the parties filed an amended stipulation. This stipulation explained that, \u201cupon review of [defendants\u2019 demurrers and motions to strike\u201d to the original complaint, \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has determined that it would be in the interests of justice and economy for [p]laintiffs to amend the complaint to address and attempt to resolve the issues presented by [d]efendant [s],\u201d but that \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 lead counsel [was] on vacation . . . through May 6 . . . and w[ould] need until May 30 ... to prepare and file an amended complaint . . . .\u201d Based on these grounds, the parties stipulated \u201cthe hearing on all . . . demurrers and motions to strike . . . shall be continued to June <em>6 </em>(Boldface omitted.) Citing the goal of \u201cexpeditiously . . . litigating] these cases,\u201d concluding the second stipulation\u2019s extension request did not \u201cactually [contain a] stipulation for an amendment\u201d or \u201cany specific date . . . by which the amendment [would] be done,\u201d plus a disbelief that lead counsel\u2019s vacation would in \u201csome way impair the law firm[\u2019s] . . . ability to . . . amend\u201d the complaint, the trial judge refused to accept the second stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The court then sustained StarCare\u2019s demurrer to the original complaint without leave to amend on preemption grounds. Plaintiffs moved to set aside the ruling or to reconsider it, but the trial court denied this request as well and entered judgment dismissing the action against StarCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">b. <em>Denial of Continuance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first contention is a procedural one; the trial court abused its discretion by rejecting the parties\u2019 stipulation to continue the hearing on the demurrers and motions to strike. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\u201cA stipulation in proper form is binding upon the parties if it is within the authority of the attorney. [Citations.] Unless contrary to law, court rule or public policy, a stipulation is also binding upon the court. [Citations.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>(Bechtel Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 405, 411-412 [109 Cal.Rptr. 138]; see also <em>Glade v. Superior Court </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 738, 744 [143 Cal.Rptr. 119] [\u201ca stipulation in proper form is binding upon a court unless it is contrary to law, court rule, or public policy\u201d or \u201cif it purports to bind the court upon a question of law\u201d].) Since the parties sought a continuance of the hearing on the demurrers and motions to strike, they needed to show good cause for it. <em>(Lerma v. County of Orange </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 709, 716 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 609]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).) Here, plaintiffs and all defendants who filed demurrers or motions to strike the original complaint agreed to continue the hearing on their objections and allow plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, who was temporarily absent from the firm\u2019s office, the opportunity to consider filing an amended complaint that would eliminate or limit the objections. Thus, good cause existed for the stipulated one-month continuance sought by the parties. <em>(Pham v. Nguyen </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 11, 16-17 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 422]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 595.2; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(3), (d)(3) &amp; (9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The trial court\u2019s concern for avoiding undue delay in the proceedings is contradicted by the contents of the stipulation. The second stipulation provided a date, May 30, by which plaintiffs were to file an amended complaint. At the hearing, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel also explained that since filing the original complaint they had been \u201cgoing through additional medical records\u201d and other information defendants had provided that would allow them to amend the complaint and \u201caddress some of the issues with regard to the demurrers\u201d and \u201csufficiency of the pleadings ...\u201d Thus, this is not a case where the parties were dilatory in litigating the issues. If it had allowed a continuance, the court could have notified the parties of its intent to limit future delays. While the trial judge noted the second stipulation did not include an express agreement to file an amended complaint, the contrary is clear from the terms of that stipulation. Defendants were willing to afford plaintiffs the opportunity to file an amended complaint before seeking a ruling on their objections to the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The order denying the stipulated continuance request is governed by the abuse of discretion standard. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when, in light of applicable law and considering all relevant circumstances, the court\u2019s ruling exceeds the bounds of reason. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(North American Capacity Ins. Co. v. Claremont Liability Ins. Co. </em>(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 272, 285 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 225]; see also <em>Shamblin v. Brattain </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 474, 478 [243 Cal.Rptr. 902, 749 P.2d 339].) \u201c[T]rial court discretion is not unlimited. \u2018The discretion of a trial judge is not a whimsical, uncontrolled power, but a legal discretion, which is subject to the limitations of legal principles governing the subject of its action, and to reversal on appeal where no reasonable basis for the action is shown. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Westside </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Community for Independent Living, Inc. v. Obledo </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 348, 355 [188 Cal.Rptr. 873, 657 P.2d 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u201cAction that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law\u201d constitutes \u201can \u2018abuse\u2019 of discretion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento v. Drew </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1297 [255 Cal.Rptr. 704].) \u201cThe trial judge must exercise his discretion with due regard to all interests involved. The denial of a continuance which has the practical effect of denying the applicant a fair hearing is often held reversible error. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Herbert </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 488, 494 [8 Cal.Rptr. 922].) These principles apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We conclude the trial court abused its discretion by denying a continuance that effectively barred plaintiffs from responding to the demurrers and motions to strike by either filing an amended complaint or written opposition. Therefore, the judgment in case No. G040920 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">2. <em>Case No. G041809</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">a. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The primary issue here is whether plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action are preempted by title 42 United States Code section 1395w-26(b)(3) (section 1395w-26(b)(3)), part of the Medicare Act. It declares that, except for laws governing licensing and solvency, \u201c[t]he standards established under this part shall supersede any State law or regulation . . . with respect to Medicare ]A[dvantage] plans which are offered by Medicare ]A[advantage] organizations . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">PacifiCare argues plaintiffs\u2019 claims against it are either expressly or at least impliedly preempted by section 1395w-26(b)(3). It further contends the statute\u2019s licensing law exception is inapplicable because that provision only applies to the acquisition of a license, not its maintenance. Plaintiffs dispute the preemption claim and alternately contend leave to amend should have been granted because some of the causes of action could be based on state licensing laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">b. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">In an appeal from a judgment entered after the sustaining of demurrer without leave to amend \u201cwe assume the truth of all properly pleaded material allegations of the complaint [citations] and give it a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and its parts in context [citation].\u201d <em>(Phillips v. Desert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Hospital Dist. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 699, 702 [263 Cal.Rptr. 119, 780 P.2d 349].) Thus, our summary of the facts is taken from that pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The first amended complaint names nine defendants and alleges 10 causes of action. Paragraph 1 declares \u201c[t]he gravamen of this action is elder abuse, for the remedies provided in the Elder Abuse Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 15657).... This action also seeks damages for wrongful death under [Code of Civil Procedure section] 377.60 et seq. As set forth hereinafter, . . . defendants ... at various times . . . breached their duty of care, and have committed \u2018neglect\u2019 and \u2018physical abuse\u2019 as those terms are used in [Welfare and Institutions Code section] 15657.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The amended complaint describes PacifiCare as a health maintenance organization offering a \u201cvariety of health plans.\u201d Secure Horizons, one of its plans, is \u201cfinanced by the federal Medicare program,\u201d which \u201cpays Secure Horizons a prepaid or periodic fee for each . . . enrollee . . . .\u201d In turn, PacifiCare contracts with hospitals and entities such as StarCare \u201cto provide specified ranges or categories of care ... in return for a prepaid or periodic fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Plaintiffs repeat the allegations of their relationship to Jackson, his enrollment in Secure Horizons, StarCare\u2019s status as an entity obligated to provide physician services and utilization review of service requests for Secure Horizons\u2019s Orange County enrollees, Jackson\u2019s postsurgical rehabilitation placement at St. Edna\u2019s, and that entity\u2019s failure to provide him with adequate nursing care. But the amended complaint\u2019s focus is on defendants\u2019 alleged dispute concerning financial responsibility for Jackson\u2019s care and the failure to promptly provide it to him after his removal from St. Edna\u2019s and admission to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">According to the amended complaint, until April 2006 Jackson lived in Los Angeles County where PacifiCare had assigned him to an entity named La Vida Prairie Medical Group, Inc. (La Vida), for physician services and Tenet HealthSystem Medical, Inc. (Tenet), for hospital services. That month Jackson moved to Anaheim Hills. He promptly notified PacifiCare of his new residence and it informed Jackson his new plan providers would be based in Orange County. But PacifiCare failed to authorize a change in providers until mid-January 2007. At that time PacifiCare assigned StarCare and Fountain Valley Regional Medical Center (Fountain Valley) to be Jackson\u2019s local health care service providers effective as of February 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">On December 31, 2006, Jackson fell, breaking his leg. He was taken to a nearby hospital that belonged to another health care plan where medical personnel performed surgery to repair the injury. Later, Jackson was moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>St. Edna\u2019s for rehabilitation. Jackson was taken to Fountain Valley on January 31 after being found dehydrated, malnourished, suffering from an infection at the site of his surgery, and, as a result, \u201cin need of urgent care including surgery . . . .\u201d But a dispute between PacifiCare and its network providers over financial responsibility for Jackson\u2019s medical care delayed the needed treatment until February 7 or 8. At that time he experienced a sudden and uncontrolled increase in his blood pressure that caused intercranial hemorrhaging resulting in irreversible brain injury. Jackson died on February 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">PacifiCare is named in the amended complaint\u2019s fifth through 10th causes of action. The fifth, sixth, and seventh counts were for negligence-willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, and constructive fraud. Plaintiffs alleged PacifiCare \u201cknew that because [Jackson] was out of La Vida\u2019s and Tenet\u2019s network, ... it was financially responsible for [his] care,\u201d but \u201ceven though [Jackson] was . . . admitted as an emergent patient. . . and manifestly in need of urgent care including surgery\u201d it failed to promptly arrange for the needed care because of the financial responsibility dispute. This failure also resulted in a breach of PacifiCare\u2019s fiduciary duties \u201cas a health care provider ... to cover the cost of \u2018out of network\u2019 care for [Jackson] ... on and after January 31,\u201d and \u201cnot to let . . . financial considerations adversely affect [its] health care decision making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The eighth count sought recovery for bad faith, alleging PacifiCare \u201cacted as an insurer\u201d by \u201centering] into the . . . agreement with the federal Medicare plan ... to assume the risk of providing care to enrollees, . . .\u201d which it breached \u201cby unreasonably denying coverage for [Jackson\u2019s] medical care ...\u201d The ninth count alleged fraudulent concealment because PacifiCare \u201cfailed to disclose to [Jackson] and his family that [he] was not [receiving] and would not receive necessary . . . care because [PacifiCare did not] want[] to do anything which might subject [it] to liability or financial risk for the cost of his care,\u201d and they reasonably relied on PacifiCare\u2019s \u201cstatements . . . that the care [Jackson] was receiving . . . was adequate and suitable . . . .\u201d Finally, the 10th cause of action sought recovery for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">c. <em>Federal Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVe\">(1) <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Before 1997 the Medicare Act did not contain a preemption provision. <em>(McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 412, 423 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 21 P.3d 1189].) However, the Medicare Act did provide an administrative procedure allowing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review benefit claim denials that limited judicial review to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>an action in federal court only if an unsuccessful claim exceeded a specified amount. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) &amp; (h); <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Ringer </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 602, 606-607 [80 L.Ed.2d 622, 104 S.Ct. 2013].) <em>Ringer </em>held the failure to comply with this administrative procedure barred a legal action if a beneficiary sued for a remedy \u201c \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with [a] claimQ for benefits,\u201d or if \u201c \u2018both the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation\u2019 of the claim[] is the [Medicare] Act.\u201d <em>(Heckler v. Ringer, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 614, 615.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In <em>McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 412, a Medicare beneficiary enrolled with PacifiCare suffering from progressive lung disease, along with his wife, sued PacifiCare alleging causes of action for negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, and infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs claimed the beneficiary was forced to disenroll from the defendant\u2019s plan because it refused to authorize him to see a specialist concerning a lung transplant. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend, finding the plaintiffs were limited to the Medicare Act\u2019s administrative review procedure. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and the Supreme Court agreed with the appellate court\u2019s result.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">First, <em>McCall </em>held <em>Ringer\u2019s </em>standing and substantive basis tests did not apply in the context of a \u201ccomplaint seeking], on state tort law grounds, not reimbursement for an assertedly covered procedure, but, rather, damages assertedly flowing from conduct only incidentally related to the wrongful denial of a benefits claim.\u201d <em>(McCall </em>v. <em>PacifiCare of Cal., Inc., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 419.) Second, finding a \u201cclear implication . . . Congress left open a wide field for the operation of state law pertaining to standards for the practice of medicine and the manner in which medical services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 423), the court held \u201c[t]he \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 language in <em>Ringer </em>is more correctly read as sweeping within the administrative review process only those claims that, \u2018at bottom,\u2019 seek reimbursement or payment for medical services, but not a claim . . . which ... as pleaded incidentally refers to a denial of benefits under the Medicare Act . . . [citation]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 425). After individually reviewing the causes of action pleaded by the plaintiffs, <em>McCall </em>concluded \u201c[b]ecause the McCalls may be able to prove the elements of some or all of their causes of action without regard, or only incidentally, to Medicare coverage determinations, because . . . none of their causes of action seeks, at bottom, payment or reimbursement of a Medicare claim or falls within the Medicare administrative review process, and because the harm they allegedly suffered thus is not remediable within that process, it follows that the Court of Appeal correctly reversed the trial court[] . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In 1997, Congress enacted part C of the Medicare Act authorizing the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within HHS, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>contract with private managed health care organizations to provide individuals with the Medicare benefits they would be entitled to receive under part A (hospital services) and part B (outpatient services) of the Act. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-21 et seq.) Initially called the Medicare+Choice program, part C was later renamed Medicare Advantage. (70 Fed.Reg. 4588 (Jan. 28, 2005).) Part C also directed HHS to issue regulations establishing standards \u201cfor Medicare+Choice organizations and plans consistent with, and to carry out, this part.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(l).) The 1997 law contained a preemption clause barring state laws and regulations \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the standards issued by CMS and all state standards relating to four specific areas. (69 Fed.Reg. 46866, 46913 (Aug. 3, 2004).)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). (Pub.L. No. 108-173 (Dec. 8, 2003) 117 Stat. 2066.) The MMA amended section 1395w-26(b)(3) by replacing the prior limited preemption provision with the current language declaring \u201c[t]he standards established under this part shall supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or State laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to MA plans which are offered by MA organizations under this part.\u201d (\u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">(2) <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u201cArticle VI, cl. 2, of the [United States] Constitution provides that the laws of the United States \u2018shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u2019 Consistent with that command, we have long recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are \u2018without effect.\u2019 [Citation.] [f] . . . Congress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a statute\u2019s express language or through its structure and purpose. [Citation.] If a federal law contains an express pre-emption clause, it does not immediately end the inquiry because the question of the substance and scope of Congress\u2019 displacement of state law still remains.

Code, \u00a7 1340 et seq.). Noting \u201c[a]s to all four causes of action, [the plaintiff] has alleged [the defendant\u2019s] duty arose from provisions of the Health and Safety Code . . .\u201d (179 Cal.App.4th at p. 1166) and that \u201cregulations under the MA program address these same duties\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1167), <em>Yarick </em>held \u201cby the express terms of the federal preemption statute, the standards established under the Health and Safety Code are superseded\u201d <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The first amended complaint at issue here states plaintiffs are seeking \u201cremedies provided in the Elder Abuse Act . . . .\u201d (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 15600 et seq.) But unlike the act considered in <em>Yarick, </em>the elder abuse law\u2019s purpose \u201c \u2018is essentially to protect a particularly vulnerable portion of the population from gross mistreatment in the form of abuse and custodial neglect.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Benun </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 113, 123 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 26], quoting <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 33 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986].) It addresses \u201c[p]hysical\u201d or \u201cfinancial abuse,\u201d \u201cneglect, . . . abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical harm or pain or mental suffering,\u201d \u201c[t]he deprivation by a care custodian of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst.

Code, \u00a7 15610.57, subd. (a)(1)). Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the Elder Abuse Act does not support preemption of their causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Nor does the Medicare Act\u2019s legislative history support PacifiCare\u2019s express preemption claim. From the Medicare Act\u2019s very inception, section 1395 has declared: \u201cNothing in this subchapter shall be construed to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided, or over the selection, tenure, or compensation of any officer or employee of any institution, agency, or person providing health services; or to exercise any supervision or control over the administration or operation of any such institution, agency, or person.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395.) Citing this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>section, <em>McCall </em>held \u201c[b]y clear implication . . . Congress left open a wide field for the operation of state law pertaining to standards for the practice of medicine and the manner in which medical services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.\u201d <em>(McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal, Inc., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 423.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Finally, PacifiCare relies on the broad construction given to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\u2019s (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.) (ERISA) preemption statute (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)) and argues section 1395w-26(b)(3) \u201ctracks th[e] language\u201d of the ERISA provision. Not so. Section 1144(a) of title 29 of the United States Code declares ERISA\u2019s \u201cprovisions . . . shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . .\u201d A reference to \u201cany and all State laws\u201d is a far cry from \u201cany State law or regulation . . . with respect to MA plans . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3).) We conclude the first amended complaint\u2019s causes of action are not expressly preempted by the Medicare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">(4) <em>Implied Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The foregoing analysis does not end our inquiry. The next question is whether plaintiffs\u2019 action is impliedly preempted by the Medicare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Citing the CMS\u2019s own interpretation of the 2003 amendment to section 1395w-26(b)(3), plaintiffs argue \u201cit appears that state tort laws of general applicability are not to be preempted\u201d by the Medicare Act and the \u201callegations [of the first amended complaint] are actionable under [such] state tort laws ....\u201d PacifiCare disagrees. It contends Congress\u2019s amendments to section 1395w-26(b) \u201cexpanded the scope of preemption until specifically enumerated categories were replaced with a broad preemption provision excepting .. . licensing and solvency,\u201d and thus the current provision \u201c \u2018reach[es] beyond positive enactments ... to embrace common-law duties.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Under implied conflict principles, \u201c ' \u201cstate law is pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law,\u201d \u2019 either because \u2018 \u201cit is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements, [citation] or where state law \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Williamson v.

In subsequently approving the final rules implementing the MM As amendments, CMS clarified its position in response to a comment about the rule\u2019s application to state case law specifically applicable \u201cto health plans\u201d: \u201c[A]ll State standards, including those established through case law, are preempted to the extent that they specifically would regulate MA plans, with exceptions of State licensing and solvency laws. Other State health and safety standards, or generally applicable standards, that do not involve regulation of an MA plan are not pree[mp]ted.\u201d (70 Fed.Reg. 4588, 4665 (Jan. 28, 2005); see also <em>Medical Card System v. Equipo Pro Convalecencia </em>(D.P.R. 2008) 587 F.Supp.2d 384, 387 [rejecting preemption claim in contract action between Medicare Advantage organizations and health care providers, because \u201cfederal law controls to the extent that federal standards exist; state common law prevails where neither Congress nor CMS has established standards\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Common law causes of action for negligence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud apply in a broad spectrum of factual contexts. They are not limited to actions involving Medicare Advantage plans. Before the 2003 amendment to section 1395w-26(b)(3), case law had recognized generally applicable state common law actions were viable. While acknowledging the MMA broadened the scope of the Medicare Act\u2019s preemption, CMS concluded the exception for generally applicable state contract and tort law actions still exists. The only authority PacifiCare cites to support application of conflict preemption in this context is the opinion in <em>Uhm v. Humana, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2008) 540 F.3d 980. But the Ninth Circuit subsequently withdrew its prior opinion and directed it \u201cshall not be cited as precedent.\u201d <em>(Uhm v. Humana, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2009) 573 F.3d 865.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In determining what judicial deference should be accorded to a federal agency\u2019s construction of a statute, the Supreme Court has held \u201cask first whether \u2018the intent of Congress is clear\u2019 as to \u2018the precise question at issue.\u2019 [Citation.] If, by \u2018employing traditional tools of statutory construction,\u2019 [citation], we determine that Congress\u2019 intent is clear, \u2018that is the end of the matter,\u2019 [citation]. But \u2018if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u2019 [Citation.] If the agency\u2019s reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the Legislature\u2019s design, we give that reading controlling weight, even if it is not the answer \u2018the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Regions Hospital v. Shalala </em>(1998) 522 U.S. 448, 457 [139 L.Ed.2d 895, 118 S.Ct. 909].) These principles apply here. Given the language of section 1395w-26(b)(3), CMS\u2019s construction of its application to state common law causes of action based on generally applicable standards is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">(5) <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">PacifiCare further contends that, in any event, the causes of action alleged in the first amended complaint must fail because plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cstate law claims ... are requests for coverage determinations and grievances concerning .. . Jackson\u2019s plan\u201d and thus \u201csubsumed by the Medicare Act\u2019s standards and regulations governing Plan determinations and procedures for resolving disputes . . . .\u201d Plaintiffs respond that \u201cPacifiCare\u2019s failure to authorize or provide care to [Jackson] did not stem from any activity or conduct for which standards exist under the Medicare Act. . . .\u201d They explain \u201conce in the care and custody of Starcare and Fountain Valley . . . , [Jackson] was entitled to all reasonably necessary medical care,\u201d Jackson\u2019s \u201cplan with PacifiCare included these same services,\u201d but defendants declined to provide them \u201cbecause of a contract dispute between StarCare[,] . . . Fountain Valley ...[,] . .. and PacifiCare over the question who would pay for (or be \u2018at risk\u2019 for) his care.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]here is no grievance or coverage determination sought in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We agree with PacifiCare only as to the seventh cause of action. As noted, in <em>Yarick v. PacifiCare of California, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.4th 1158, the plaintiff sued PacifiCare for negligence, willful misconduct, elder abuse, and wrongful death, primarily based on the theory \u201cthe contractual structure through which [the defendant] arranges to provide medical services gives the medical care providers an undue financial incentive to deny medically reasonable services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>atp. 1162.) After concluding section 1395w-26(b)(3) expressly preempted these claims because each one was based on the defendant\u2019s alleged breach of statutory duties imposed by the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, the court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s alternative argument that \u201can independent common law duty provides a basis for viable state law claims against [the defendant].\u201d (179 Cal.App.4th at p. 1167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\"><em>Yarick </em>noted CMS regulations \u201cassure reasonable and timely access to medical services\u201d and \u201cprovide a quality assurance program to prevent . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>inappropriate medical decisions\u201d <em>(Yarick v. PacifiCare of California, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.4th at p. 1167), and concluded \u201c[i]f state common law judgments were permitted to impose damages on the basis of these federally approved contracts and quality assurance programs, the federal authorities would lose control of the regulatory authority that is at the very core of Medicare generally and the MA program specifically . . . [citation]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1167-1168). Further, acknowledging \u201cgenerally applicable common law actions\u201d are not preempted by section 1395w-26(b)(3), <em>Yarick </em>concluded \u201cin the present case, [the plaintiff] does not base her claims against [the defendant] on such common law duties. She asserts duties applicable specifically to health plans.\u201d <em>(Yarick v. PacifiCare of California, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.4th at p. 1168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Here, the seventh count pleads constructive fraud. As to PacifiCare, plaintiffs allege its contractual agreements with StarCare and Fountain Valley \u201crequired them to enter into an agreement . . . sharing] in any savings by Fountain Valley in the cost of utilization of hospital services,\u201d and that \u201cPacifiCare, by denying authorization for, or assuming the expense for [Jackson\u2019s] care and treatment at Fountain Valley\u201d \u201csave[d] substantial sums.\u201d In short, the gravamen of this cause of action is a physician incentive plan. CMS has issued a regulation governing the contents of such plans. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.208 (2009).) Thus, we agree this cause of action is preempted by section 1395w-26(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">But otherwise this case is distinguishable from <em>Yarick. </em>The fifth cause of action for negligence-willful misconduct alleges PacifiCare knew that \u201c[o]nce [Jackson] was accepted as a patient at Fountain Valley,\u201d \u201cit was financially responsible for\u201d Jackson\u2019s \u201cout of . . . network . . . care[] unless . . . [StarCare] and Fountain Valley were responsible.\u201d But, \u201c[notwithstanding the knowledge of the peril . . . and ... the high probability of injury,\u201d because of defendants\u2019 \u201cdisagreement regarding financial responsibility,\u201d each \u201cfailed to avoid the peril[] for the sake of profit and minimizing . . . financial risk.\u201d Given the life-threatening situation presented, defendants\u2019 conflict over who was financially responsible for Jackson\u2019s care could not have been remedied by CMS\u2019s administrative review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The sixth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty alleged PacifiCare \u201cacted as [a] health care provider[]\u201d for Jackson and thus owed him a fiduciary obligation concerning \u201cthe decision to cover the cost of \u2018out of network\u2019 care\u201d for him. But because it was \u201cinfluenced by adverse financial interests,\u201d PacifiCare \u201crefused to authorize payment for services on and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>January 31, 2007.\u201d Since PacifiCare allegedly made this determination with full knowledge Jackson would not be treated, this claim may also be proven without consideration of coverage determinations under CMS\u2019s standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The eighth cause of action for bad faith alleges PacifiCare \u201cacted as an insurer\u201d for Jackson and it breached its \u201cduty of good faith ... by unreasonably denying coverage for [his] medical care\u201d \u201csolely ... to save the cost of providing such care.\u201d Since the duty to act in good faith and to deal fairly with another contracting party is a generally applicable common law duty, it is not specifically targeted by the Medicare Act\u2019s regulations for Medicare Advantage organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In the ninth count, plaintiffs allege PacifiCare committed fraud by \u201cfailing] to disclose to [Jackson] and his family that [Jackson] was not [receiving] and would not receive necessary . . . care because\u201d it did not want to \u201csubject [itself] to liability or financial risk for the cost of his care,\u201d while Jackson and plaintiffs reasonably relied \u201con statements and silence\u201d to \u201cbelieveQ that the care [Jackson] was receiving . . . was adequate and suitable to meet his reasonable health care [needs] . . . .\u201d This cause of action, too, is premised on general common law tort principles and not directly aimed at medical care plans governed by the Medicare Act. As for the 10th cause of action alleging a claim for wrongful death, the same analysis applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">d. <em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The trial court sustained PacifiCare\u2019s demurrer solely on the basis of federal preemption. As an alternative basis for affirming the judgments, PacifiCare argues plaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust the administrative remedies provided under the Medicare Act bars the current action.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">As discussed above, and contrary to PacifiCare\u2019s characterization of the case, plaintiffs are not disputing an adverse determination concerning Medicare benefits. Thus, this case is governed by <em>McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc., supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th 412, which, as discussed, rejected a failure to exhaust administrative remedies claim made under the Medicare Act \u201c[bjecause the [plaintiffs] may be able to prove the elements of some or all of their causes of action without regard, or only incidentally, to Medicare coverage determinations\u201d where \u201cnone of their causes of action seeks, at bottom, payment or reimbursement of a Medicare claim or falls within the Medicare administrative review process, and because the harm they allegedly suffered thus is not remediable within that process . . . .\u201d (25 Cal.4th at p. 426, fn. omitted.) This case presents an even stronger basis for rejecting the failure to exhaust administrative remedies defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In case No. G040920, the judgment is reversed with directions to permit appellants to file an amended complaint against respondent StarCare.
