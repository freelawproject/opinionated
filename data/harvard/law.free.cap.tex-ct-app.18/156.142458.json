Miles <em>v. </em>The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-14\">1. Charge of the Court\u2014Practice in the Court of Appeals.\u2014In a trial for murder the conviction was for that offense in the second degree, and therefore this court deems it unnecessary to revise the instructions given to the jury upon murder of the first degree and express malice.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-16\">2. Charge upon Murder of the Second Degree instructed the jury that \u201cevery rash and inconsiderate killing under some sudden impulse, wherein there is no sedate mind and formed design to kill, is murder in the second degree; the law implies the malice. Every voluntary killing of a human being is murder in the second degree, unless the circumstances attending it upon the one hand show express malice, which would then be murder in the first degree, or, upon the other, such as would reduce the offense to manslaughter, or would excuse or justify the homicide.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the first clause of this charge is obviously and radically erroneous, because it is not true. The \u201csudden impulse\u201d may have resulted from adequate cause, arousing such passion as rendered the homicidal act \u201crash and inconsiderate; \u201d and then the homicide would not be murder of the second degree, but manslaughter. Nor was the error in the first clause 'of the instruction efficiently corrected by the second clause, inasmuch as the latter was not explained to the jury as a qualification or modification of the former, and may have been understood by the jury to apply to a homicide of a character different from that spoken of in the first clause.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-18\">3. Charge upon Manslaughter.\u2014In a trial for murder it was in proof that the deceased, when shot by the defendant, had just ridden or was attempting to ride against the defendant, and there was evidence of provocation of defendant by the deceased upon occasions prior to that of the homicide. The charge to the jury upon the law of manslaughter restricted them to the consideration of such provocation as may have occurred upon the immediate occasion of the homicide, ignoring all provocation prior thereto. <em>Held, </em>erroneous. The jury, in considering of the sufficiency of the provocation, and on its effect upon the passions and mind of the defendant, should not have been so restricted by the charge, but should have been allowed to look to all the evidence germane to the issue.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>4. </em>Threats as Justification \u2014 Charge of the Court.\u2014To justify homicide superinduced by threats, it must be shown that at the time of the homicide the person killed, by some act then done, manifested an intention to execute the threats. After giving this principle in charge to the jury, the trial court gave them a further instruction by which, in effect, the act manifesting an intention to execute the threats was required to be an \u201ceffort or demonstration to execute such threats.\u201d <em>Held, </em>erroneous. See the opinion in elucidation of this ruling.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b167-4\">Appeal from the District Court of Bastrop. Tried below before the Hon. L. W. Moore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">The indictment charged the appellant with the murder of Harry Taylor, in Bastrop county, Texas, on the 6th day of April, 188-1. His trial resulted in his conviction of murder in the second degree, and his punishment was affixed at a term of twenty-five years in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">Doctor J. D. Oliver was the first witness for the State. He testified that he did not know the deceased personally, but was called to see him professionally about twilight on the day he was said to have been shot. He was then lying at his father\u2019s house, mortally wounded. The ball entered at the top of the <em>lumbra </em>vertebra, to the left of the spinal column, tearing off a part of the front of the spinal column, and passed out of the body close to and a little above the navel. The deceased, when shot, must have been lying down, or in a stooping position, as the ball ranged upwards. This wound undoubtedly caused the death of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">James Brooks was the next witness for the State. He testified that he was at the house of Doctor Taylor, the father of the deceased, when the deceased was shot. He heard the reports of firearms, and the mother of the deceased asked witness to go and see what the occasion of it was, saying that she supposed it was \u201cWalter Miles trying to kill Harry.\u201d At first the witness refused to go, but Mrs. Taylor insisted, and finally witness left, going over to defendant\u2019s house. Witness first saw the defendant sitting on his horse with a Winchester in his hands. He asked who the witness was, and witness replied. Witness\u2019s horse frightened somewhat, and defendant made a movement as if to shoot witness. He said: \u201c Take care, Jim, or I will kill you.\u201d Witness replied that he was not going to try to hurt him, and he then told witness to go and see Harry, and if he was not dead to see what he could do for him, and if there was anything on the place witness could use in serving Harry, to use it. Witness found the deceased lying, back down, on the ground. He told witness that he was going along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the road when the defendant told him that he could not pass him, defendant, any more, and that defendant then drew his pistol and fired, but missed him; that he, deceased, then fell over on the right side of his horse to escape the shots of the defendant, when the defendant fired again and struck him in the back; that he then fell to the ground, and the defendant fired the third shot, as he thought, at his horse. Deceased said that when defendant fired the first shot he thought the defendant\u2019s purpose was only to frighten him. Deceased was in his shirt sleeves, and asked witness to pull off his boots, which witness attempted, but desisted at deceased\u2019s request when he found he could not stand the pain. lie then told the witness to cut them off. Witness having no knife, deceased told witness to take his, which after some trouble he seemed, and cut the boots off. Deceased asked the witness to go after his mother. lie said that his death was inevitable, and he wanted to see his mother before it happened. He also told witness that he told the defendant that he was not armed, and asked him not to shoot him. Witness knew both the deceased and the defendant well. The two were not friendly and did not speak to each other. Deceased had no arms about his person, nor did the witness see any about the place of the killing. The defendant, when witness approached him, asked if the party approaching was witness, and witness replied in the affirmative. He then told witness that he shot the deceased because the deceased ran his horse over him. Luther Smith was present. The deceased told the witness that he had no arms when he was shot; that he was passing the defendant when the defendant cursed, and said that deceased should not pass him any move, and fired before be, deceased, spoke at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">Charles Cochran was the next witness for the State. He testified that he lived in Martindale, in Caldwell county, Texas. Witness, who was at the house of Doctor Taylor when the deceased was shot, heard the shooting. He went to the deceased shortly after Brooks returned to Doctor Taylor\u2019s, and found the deceased lying on his back, in the road, about two hundred and fifty yards from his home. He told the witness that he had been shot in the back for no cause whatever. He had on an overshirt, but no coat. Witness was present when he died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">W. A. Smith was the next witness for the State.

He saw the deceased at Mr. Standifer\u2019s about an hour before he was shot, and next saw him about three quarters of an hour after he was shot, and saw him again at his father\u2019s house. He was mortally wounded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>but recognized the witness instantly on seeing him. He appeared to be rational. He told witness that he would inevitably die; that he was riding quietly along the road when the defendant shot him. Deceased died next morning about 5 o\u2019clock. He was rational until about 12 o\u2019clock, when his mind grew somewhat sluggish. The statement of the deceased was in the witness\u2019s handwriting, and was taken down about 10 o\u2019clock at night. The justice of the peace asked the witness to write it for him. Witness had known the deceased since the deceased came to the county. He did not know whether or not the relations existing between deceased and defendant were friendly, but thought he had heard the deceased say that their relations were strained; that they had had some trifling difficulty before the shooting. Harry Taylor was killed in Bastrop county, Texas, on the 6th day of April, 1884. Deceased was suffering a great deal when he made the statement which witness reduced to writing, but was rational.

He fired again and hit me in the back, and the ball came out on the side. I was riding along the road, coming to my father\u2019s house. I bad no weapon of any kind with the exception of a pocket-knife, and it was broken. I did not speak to him until he, the said Miles, spoke to me in the above mentioned words. The said Miles\u2019s wife came to me. I asked her not to let her husband, Walter Miles, come back to me, for he would kill me and I wanted to see my mother before I died. I heard him, said Miles, tell his wife that if he knew he was not dead he would go back and finish him. He shot me in cold blood, for I begged him not to shoot me at all.

He told the witness that he had killed the deceased, and the witness asked him why he did so. He replied: \u201c Oh, d\u2014n it, he rode by me in a boasting manner several times, but this time he found me out of humor. He ran his horse against mine and scared him, and that made me more angry, and I shot at him and missed him. He then leaned over on his horse as if to draw a Winchester, and I rode up and shot him. I think I know where I hit him. If he had any arms I did not see them, but I thought he was leaning over, trying to get a Winchester,, at the time I shot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">Cross-examined, the witness testified that Mr. Adams was present during the conversation, and witness\u2019s brother came up soon after.

Witness did not think that the deceased was in the habit of going armed. He saw deceased with a six-shooter once, about six months before he was shot, on Blackburn\u2019s ranch in Travis county, which was about four miles distant from Elgin. He was, in the estimation of the witness, a peaceable and not a dangerous man. He lived on Blackburn\u2019s ranch when witness saw him with the six-shooter. He wore a waistcoat while at witness\u2019s house on the evening that he was shot. He had been to pasture some horses.

Hence the investigation on appeal will be confined to an examination of the charge with a view of ascertaining its applicability to the evidence, and this, in the absence of exceptions thereto taken at the time of the trial, with the further view of ascertaining if, as a whole, it is erroneous to the extent of materially injuring the legal rights of appellant. (Code Crim. Proc., art. 685; Clark\u2019s Criminal Law, p. 522, note 208; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>The State, </em>15 Texas Ct. App., 534.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-6\">\u201cThe charge must be considered as a whole, and isolated paragraphs ought not to be selected and pointed out with a view to showing error.\u201d (Clark\u2019s Criminal Law, p. 515, note 204; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>The State, </em>10 Texas Ct. App., 215; <em>Brownlee </em>v. <em>The State, </em>13 Texas Ct. App., 255.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-7\">It will be observed that by the assignment of errors in this cause the charge is attacked, not as a whole, but in detached portions, paragraphs and parts of paragraphs, and even isolated phrases occurring in paragraphs, not in themselves liable to grave misconstruction or calculated seriously to mislead jurors trying the case, who must be presumed to have been men of some degree of intelligence, and not idiots incapable of understanding common language.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-8\">The third and fourth assignments of error are to the effect that the court erred in not plainly and sufficiently defining the expression \u201c adequate cause \u201d and the word \u201c passion.\u201d Keeping in view the facts of the case, these assignments are untenable. Objections to the charge were for the first time presented and urged in the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and after he had achieved a decided victory over the prosecution by getting from the jury a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree, instead of murder in the first degree, which the evidence would have supported. The charge, when taken and construed as a whole, is a full, fair and correct exposition and application of the law of the case. That it did not define \u201cadequate cause\u201d (and passion), in instructing upon the law of manslaughter, would be an objection which, under some circumstances, would be a valid one, <em>if emeepted to in time, </em>or in some cases, perhaps, without exceptions being taken. But in this case we find no such state of facts as imperatively demanded a specific explanation of \u201c adequate cause \u201d (or passion). There is but slight evidence of \u201c adequate cause,\u201d and the court applied the law to this in stronger terms than it could have done by a simple definition of adequate cause and passion, in that it charged the jury that \u201cif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the killing was provoked by Harry Taylor riding against the defendant, or attempting thereto, if such provocation was in fact the cause, and if it did then and there so influence the mind of this defendant as to prevent it from, exercising cool reflection, then the offense would be manslaughter.\u201d Under this instruction the jury could not have been mistaken or misled as to the meaning of \u201cadequate cause\u201d and passion, and certainly appellant has no reason to complain at the substitution of this paragraph of the charge for the definitions; and, as already seen, the complaint comes too late. <em>(Mason </em>v. <em>The State, </em>15 Texas Ct. App., 550.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-5\">Hurt, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"At1\">Appellant, Walter H. Miles, was tried and convicted for the murder of Harry Taylor. The jury found him guilty of murder of the second degree, and assessed his punishment at confinement in the penitentiary for a term of twenty-five years. From this conviction and the judgment rendered thereon Miles appeals to this court, and assigns numerous errors. We will discuss, but three of the errors assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Very clearly from the statement of facts it was the duty of the learned judge trying the case to submit to the jury the law applicable to murder of the first degree, murder of the second degree, manslaughter, and self-defense. And so viewing the case, the learned judge did instruct the jury upon each degree, and also upon self-defense. As the jury acquitted defendant of murder of the first degree, we deem it unnecessary to make any observations upon the charge of the court relative to express malice or murder of this degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The court charged the jury upon murder of the second degree as follows: \u201cEvery rash and inconsiderate killing under some sudden impulse, wherein there is no sedate mind and formed design to kill, is murder in the second degree. The law implies the malice. \u25a0 Every voluntary killing of a human being is murder in the second degree, unless the circumstances attending it upon one hand show express malice, which would then be murder in the first degree, or, upon the other, such as would reduce the offense to manslaughter, or which would excuse or justify the homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The first paragraph of this charge is evidently erroneous; yea, radically incorrect. For it is not true that any rash and inconsiderate killing tinder some sudden impulse, wherein there is no sedate mind and formed design to kill, is murder in the second degree. For does the law in such a killing imply malice. For the k.lling may be upon a sudden impulse, and the act rash and inconsiderate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and still the impulse may have been produced by adequate cause, and the passion so aroused as to render the act rash and inconsiderate.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">And again: if there be adequate cause to arouse the passion, and upon a sudden impulse a party rashly and inconsiderately kills, he would be guilty, not of murder but manslaughter. This charge takes from its legitimate location, and forces murder of the second degree within the boundary of manslaughter. But it is urged by the assistant attorney-general that the next paragraph so qualifies this objectionable charge as to render it harmless. While it is conceded that the second paragraph is a correct enunciation of the law, we are not by any means satisfied that it was understood by the jury as being a qualification or modification of the first paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In the first, a rash and inconsiderate killing is spoken of; in the second, voluntary killing is the subject-matter of the charge. Mow may not the jury have understood and believed that these were different characters of killings or homicides, and that, if the killing was upon a sudden impulse, and was rash and inconsiderate, without qualification, such killing would be murder; and that circumstances of reduction or justification applied to and qualified alone a <em>voluntary killing. </em>We are of the opinion that the first paragraph \"was such error as was calculated to injure the rights of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Upon the subject of manslaughter, the court charged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u201cIf the killing was provoked by Harry Taylor riding against the defendant, or attempting thereto, if such provocation was in fact the cause, and if it did then and there so inflame the mind of this defendant as to prevent it from exercising cool reflection, then the offense would be manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Counsel for the appellant object to this charge because, they say, the jury are restricted in the consideration of the question as to whether the killing was <em>only </em>because the deceased rode his horse against the defendant, or attempted to do so; that, in considering the adequacy of the cause to produce the passion, and the effect of such passion upon the mind of the defendant, by the charge the jury are limited to the act of riding or attempting to ride the horse against the defendant. Counsel contend, and we think justly, that in passing upon the sufficiency of the cause to arouse the passion, and the degree to which the passion was aroused, that is, was the mind incapable of cool reflection, the jury, instead of being restricted, in their investigation of these questions, to what occurred at the time of the homicide, should have been instructed to look to all the facts in the case, in passing upon these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>In <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 29 Ga., 723, Parish, the party shot, on the night before the shooting had attempted the seduction of the wife of Biggs, under circumstances of gross and direct aggravation. On the next morning he seated himself in the immediate neighborhood of Mrs. Biggs at the breakfast-table, whereupon Biggs shot him. The trial court charged the jury upon this matter,\u2014\u201cThat, whatever may have occurred on the night previous to the difficulty at the breakfast-table, it could not amount to a justification or excuse for the act of shooting, the morning after the difficulty.\u201d Upon this charge, Judge Lumpkin makes these observations: . . . \u201c and this instruction was based, no doubt, upon the idea that sufficient time had elapsed for reason to resume her sway. In many cases this doctrine is true, but we cannot think it a sound proposition under the facts and circumstances which surrounded these parties. The husband had heard and seen the personal indignity offered his wife the night before. He permitted Parish to escape, with threats of punishment should he remain in the city. The very next morning, at the breakfast-table, he unblushingly resumes his seat in the immediate neighborhood of his intended victim. Was it human to keep cool in such a situation? To see the man who had attempted to desecrate the famly altar, the night before, seat himself within two chairs of his wife! And was it not right and proper, in order to account for his violence, to give in proof to the jury the occurrences of the preceding evening? To shut out the scene which transpired in the bed-chamber is to deprive the jury of the power of appreciating the transport of passion kindled in the bosom of Biggs by the presence of 'Parish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">How, while it is true that the provocation must arise at the time of the commission of the offense, and the passion must not be the result of a former provocation, yet in passing upon the sufficiency of the provocation, and on the effects of the passion upon the mind of the defendant, the past conduct of the deceased toward defendant, his threats and bearing, in fact all the facts and circumstances in the case, should be considered by the jury. An act standing alone may not be a sufficient provocation, but may be ample when it is one of a series of similar acts, or when it has been preceded by an insolent and aggravating course of conduct, whether similar or not to the act committed at the time of the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">We are of the opinion that the charge of the court was too restrictive upon the subject, and that the attention of the jury should have been directed to all the facts of the case; not by the special enumeration of each, but they should have been told that, in pass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ing upon the sufficiency of the provocation, and the effects of the passion upon the mind of the defendant, they must look to all the facts in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">That part of the charge of the court relating to self-defense under threats is as follows: \u201cIf Harry Taylor did threaten to kill this defendant, and if at the time of the killing Harry Taylor did make such a demonstration as to induce the defendant to believe he did then intend to execute such threat, then this defendant would be justifiable in taking the life of said Taylor; and if you so believe you should acquit.\u201d This charge is qualified as follows: \u201c Or, if the defendant did shoot at Harry Taylor before the latter made any effort or demonstration to execute such threats, then there would be no justification if even Harry Taylor did subsequently manifest any such intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The law upon this subject is that, to justify under threats, \u201cit must be shown that at the time of the homicide the person killed, by some act then done, manifested an intention to execute the threats.\u201d In the qualification above cited the learned judge departs from the statute, and for \u201c some act manifesting an intention to execute the threats,\u201d he substitutes \u201c made any effort or demonstration.\u201d How, whether he intended to qualify effort by demonstration, or demonstration by effort, we know not. Demonstration has several meanings. The first given by Hr. Webster was certainly not intended by the learned judge. The second is in harmony with the meaning given by our courts to \u201c manifest.\u201d It is, \u201can expression of the feeling by outward signs; a manifestation; a show.\u201d \u201cEffort\u201d means \u201can exertion of strength; strenuous endeavors; laborious attempts; struggle directed to the accomplishment of an object; exertion, as an attempt to scale a wall; an effort to excel.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Hnabridged Dictionary.) There is no word in the English language, we think, better understood by the people generally than \u201c effort.\u201d And when told that an effort must have been made to execute the threats, the jury doubtless understood the court to mean an attempt This means something more than a demonstration or an act manifesting an intention. It means an actual attempt to execute the threats. And, as the threats were to take the life of the defendant, an effort means an attempt to kill defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">How, if there was an effort to take the life of defendant before he shot, he could stand upon this fact, without threats. The threats are of no value or benefit to him, for his right of self-defense was complete without them. We are not treating of a case of mutual combat, or a case in which the defendant provoked the difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>We are of the opinion that this charge was calculated to confuse and mislead the jury, to the prejudice of the defendant. For the errors in the charge of the court, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">[Opinion delivered May 6, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
