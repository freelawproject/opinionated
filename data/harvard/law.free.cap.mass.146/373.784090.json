The widow continued to live in the house, and the executor deducted from the gross income, applicable to the payment of the annuity, the amount paid out for repairs, taxes, water rates, insurance, and interest on a mortgage on the house. <em>Held, </em>on an appeal from a decree of the Probate Court allowing the executor\u2019s account, that the annuity was to be paid out of net income, and that the deductions were rightly made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b391-9\">General expenses of administration incurred for the benefit of the whole estate are chargeable to capital, and not to income.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b391-10\">If a master on such an appeal declines to revise the compensation allowed to the executor, his report will be recommitted if the appellant so desires.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b391-11\">A stable in the rear of the house occupied by the testator, which was used by him in connection with it, was let by the executor, and the widow claimed the rent.

When my said wife Philinda shall have deceased I authorize my said executors and empower them to sell and convey by public or private sale the part of my said real estate then remaining unsold whenever after said decease of my wife such sale can be made to advantage. And I direct my said executors on and after the decease of my said wife to pay to my son Josiah G. Bridge the income of one third of my entire estate then remaining till such time as such one third part can be set off or paid to him which I direct to be done as soon after the death of my wife as may be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">\u201c Out of the balance of said estate after my son Josiah has received one third thereof as above provided I direct that two thousand dollars shall be held in trust by my said executors and so invested as to draw a reasonable and safe income which I direct my said executors to pay yearly to my daughter Emily, and that one thousand dollars out of said balance be similarly invested and the income thereof paid yearly to my daughter Yesta by said executors and trustees thereof hereby duly appointed for the purpose. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">\u201c At the death of my said wife, excepting said trusts and said provision for the heirs of said Emily, all the rest and residue of said estate I give and bequeath to my son Josiah G. and to his heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">\u201cI also hereby make and create the said Josiah G.

This stable, with an annexed hennery, is in the rear of the block of two houses, of which one is the same mentioned in the will, for the widow. It was used by the testator, from the time of its erection to the date of his death, in connection with the house occupied by himself and the appellant. The houses front on Alder Street and the stable fronts on Beach Street, the house occupied by the appellant being the one at the corner of the two streets; the space between the rear entrance of this house and the stable and Beach Street is concreted. The other house has always been occupied by a tenant, and its lot has no entrance to the stable. The two houses have no entrance in common, and their respective grounds are separated by a high, close fence, which runs to the stable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The lot on which the buildings stand extends about one hundred feet on Alder Street and one hundred and thirty'feet on Beach Street. The executor has rented the stable, and during the time covered by his accounts has collected therefor two hundred and eleven and fifty one-hundredths dollars ($211.50). This amount the appellant claims should have been paid to her. As I do not consider that the devise of the use of the house carries with it the use of the stable, I disallowed this claim of the appellant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-4\">The master further reported, that the net income as found by the Probate Court should be revised by adding thereto the deductions made by the executor out of the gross income, and that the executor should pay to the appellant the balance due to her upon her annuity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\">Hearing upon the master\u2019s report, and exceptions of both parties thereto, before a single justice, who ordered the decree,of the Probate Court to be affirmed, and the case to be recommitted; and this appeal was taken to the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-6\"><em>E.

Bridge from a decree of the Probate Court allowing the accounts of her husband\u2019s executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">1. The first question arises under the following clause of the will: \u201c I give and bequeath to my wife Philihda four hundred dollars a year during her natural life if the income of my estate not herein bequeathed to her or to the payment of .said debts and funeral expenses shall amount to that sum.\u201d The testator also gives her the use of his house for life, or, if she should desire to live elsewhere, requests his executor to furnish her a suitable house. She has continued to live in his house, and the executor deducts from the gross income applicable to payment of the four hundred dollars the amount paid out for repairs, taxes, water rates, insurance, and interest on a mortgage on the house. This is plainly right; the gift is of four hundred dollars a year, if the net income amounts to that sum. The charges mentioned all fall on income, not on capital, unless the will directs otherwise. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>7 Met. 478,482. <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>16 Mass. 361, 368. <em>Sohier </em>v. <em>Eldredge, </em>103 Mass. 345, 354. <em>Plympton </em>v. <em>Boston Dispensary, </em>106 Mass. 544, 547. We see nothing in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>will to indicate that the usual rule is not to be applied. The case is not like <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>131 Mass. 20, where a gift of \u201c one thousand dollars per year during her lifetime, the same to be paid from the income of my property,\u201d was held to be an absolute gift of the sum named, payable out of principal if necessary, and therefore payable out 6f gross income. The gift here is payable only from income, and the income available must be ascertained in the ordinary way.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">2. The general expenses of administration should fall upon the corpus of the estate, as they are incurred for the benefit of the whole estate. See <em>Sawyer </em>v. Baldwin, 20 Pick. 378, 388; <em>Brown </em>v. Kelsey, 2 Cush. 243, 249. The decree of the Probate Court erred in charging them to income.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">3. There is no doubt that, where an executor\u2019s final account comes to this court by appeal, the compensation allowed him is subject to revision, as well as the other items. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Pegram, </em>109 Mass. 541. Pub. Sts. c. 144, \u00a7 7 ; c. 156, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 17. The master having declined to revise this matter, the report must be recommitted if the appellant desires, upon this single point. If it be true, which does not appear, that a commission is allowed the executor for collecting his own debt, the allowance is improper. But possibly, if such an allowance was made, it was considered in determining the other compensation allowed, and it may be thought proper to increase that by a corresponding amount, leaving the total compensation the same. There is nothing in the facts now appearing to indicate that the allowances for attending court and for counsel fees were improper. Pub. Sts. c. 144, \u00a7 7. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>5 Allen, 87. <em>Forward </em>v. <em>Forward, </em>6 Allen, 494. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Pegram, ubi supra. Turnbull </em>v. <em>Pomeroy, </em>140 Mass. 117, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">4. There is a stable in the rear of the house occupied by the testator, which was used by the testator in connection with the house. The executor has let it and the appellant claims the rent. The mode of use in the testator\u2019s lifetime does not necessarily establish that the stable is included in the words \u201c house in which we now live.\u201d 2 Wms. Saund. 401, n. 2. The connection between the house and stable is not set forth very clearly, nor does it appear very clearly whether the master excluded the allowance of the rent for the stable on the ground that, as matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of construction, the words could not include a stable, or on a finding that the stable was not so connected with the house as to pass with it. On the facts appearing, we cannot say that the master and judge of probate were wrong. It is unnecessary to consider whether in any case the widow would have had any other right than personally to occupy the stable if so minded.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
