Do said requests, directions, and power impose a trust not terminated by the distribution of the personal estate, or a mere power, the purpose of which was accomplished upon said distribution ? If the former, what is the duration of the trust ? 3. How long, by the terms of the will, has the executor a right to collect the rents and be paid therefor in free house rent and commissions of five per cent? 4. Has the executoi\u2019, if said requests, directions, and power impose a trust continuing after said distribution, the right to deduct and pay taxes, repairs, and insurance upon the house occupied by him rent free from the rents of the real estate devised to the residuary devisees? 5. Does any request, direction, or power conferred by the will impose any such trust as longer to necessitate the continuance of an executor ? and if so, what is that request, direction, or power? 6. Is it the intent of the testator that all the duties of the executor, and his payment for their performance in commissions and house rent, should cease upon distribution of personal assets ? If not, upon the happening of what event or events do they cease ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">The judge of probate made a decree, that no trust was created by the will of Luther Slater which was not terminated upon the distribution of the personal property, and that the duties of the executor ceased when such distribution was made.

This will uses words fully adequate to create a trust and an interest in favor of the executor. \u201c Wish and request,\u201d \u201c authorize and empower,\u201d \u201c devise and desire,\u201d not to add the word \u201c direct \u201d in especial connection with collecting rents, have all been adjudicated apt to create trusts. <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Garnet, </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Bro. C. C. 38. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Parry, </em>2 Myl. &amp; K. 138, 144. Trusts arise by implication from tbe provisions of a will, in order to carry out the testator\u2019s intention where there is no corpus given to the trustee. <em>Walker </em>v. Whiting, 23 Pick. 313. <em>Braman </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>2 Pick. 460. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>12 Cush. 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-4\">2. The evidences in this will of a confidence and duty intrusted to this executor, and that they extend at least over the period' of the wife\u2019s life, are numerous. The testator expressly directs his executor to collect the rents monthly, to pay the taxes, to deduct one twelfth from the rents to pay taxes and commissions with, and to pay over the balance to those entitled to the same under his will. The testator. \u201c requests \u201d the performance of those duties which pertain to the actual charge of the estate; and foreseeing that the trust \u2014 for he calls it a \u201ctrust\u201d \u2014 might last so long that a question of the desirability of selling might arise, he vests the executor with a power to sell. The terms of the power to sell, and the requests connected with it, import that the testator intended to place, and supposed he did place, the executor in a position of long continuing responsibility and management, and are inconsistent with the limitation of the duty to two years or less. The words \u201c in the performance of the duties of the trust it becomes necessary,\u201d &amp;c., cannot refer to the ordinary settlement of the personalty and payment of debts. The testator then proceeds to \u201c devise,\u201d as well as appoint by the expression of a \u201c desire,\u201d that his executor should have a house free and a commission on rents for his compensation, with which ordinary executors have nothing to do. This compensation is to be \u201c in full as executor of this will, and for all his services as executor.\u201d Does not this indicate that the testator had imposed two sets of duties,\u2014first, the execution of the will in the regular probate channel, and second, the charge of the real estate, of which the beneficiaries were all women ? The determination of the trust, in view of the various provisions of the will, is to take place when the widow dies and the residuary legatees come into possession of the \u201c reversion or remainder \u201d which is devised to them by the third item. Up to that time the management of the whole is in the executor. When no interest remains in any of the testator\u2019s realty, except that given to the daughters, viz. the fee, the executor\u2019s duties regarding the real estate will terminate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>0. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcM\">The question in this case is, whether under the terms of the will the executor is entitled, against the wishes of the residuary devisees, to continue in the management and care of the real estate left hy the testator, and to receive the compensation provided in the will for such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">So far as the personal estate of the testator is concerned, the executor has performed his duties and discharged his trust; unless hereafter the stolen bonds or some of them shall be recovered. There is nothing to show any probability of his receiving anything from this source. Two years have expired since the filing of his bond, and full distribution has been made of all the personal property in his hands. It is not contended in argument that the fact of the outstanding bonds furnishes any reason for his continuing in the care of the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The real estate of the testator was disposed of in this manner: certain of it was given to his wife, for her life, and all the residue, including the remainder of that given to his wife for life, to his sisters. There was a provision that his wife should keep the dwellings upon the land devised to her for life in good repair and insured, and should pay all taxes on the same. But the executor contends that the later provisions of the will have the effect by implication to vest in him an estate in trust in the whole or a part of the real estate, by conferring powers and imposing duties in respect to the same which cannot otherwise be properly executed and performed. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Taft, 12 </em>Cush. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In respect to the estate devised to the testator\u2019s wife for life, it is not to be supposed that he intended that the executor should exercise the powers and duties which are mentioned, because, in the first place, the testator imposes on her the duty of paying for repairs, insurance, and taxes, and gives to her certain personal property wherewith she may be able to do it; and, moreover, the executor would hare no means with which to pay these expenses except from the residuary estate, unless it could be supposed that the testator meant that his wife should furnish to the executor the money for these purposes. Besides, the testator authorizes the executor, upon the request in writing of his sisters, under certain circumstances, to sell the real estate; and if he intended to include in this authority the land given to his wife for life, it would seem probable that he would have required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>her consent also. It must he considered that the testator did not intend to give his executor authority over the estates devised to his wife for life, although in terms the language includes all of his real estate. This conclusion is more easily reached, because the whole will shows a considerable want of accuracy in the use of language.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In respect to the residuary estate devised to the testator\u2019s sisters, the question is certainly far from clear, and it must be conceded that it is not easy to account for the various provisions by assuming that the testator inserted them merely in order that his executor should have the charge and management of the estates during the time required for the discharge of the ordinary duties of an executor. They seem to be more extensive and permanent than would naturally be expected for such a limited purpose. But, on the other band, various considerations lead to the contrary inference. There is no express devise to him in <em>trust; </em>the devises to the testator\u2019s sisters are absolute and unqualified in their terms; their ages are not given, but at any rate it is assumed that at present they are all of age and <em>sui juris ; </em>the will discloses no reason for the creation or permanent continuance of a trust in respect to their estates, unless for the purpose of benefiting the executor; there is no language necessarily implying that the executor was to perform duties or exercise powers which implied the vesting of a trust estate in him; he was not. to sell the property unless by the written request of the testator\u2019s sisters; the other provisions were mostly in the nature of requests to the executor, and are susceptible of the construction that the testator was seeking to furnish assistance to his sisters in the care and management of the property in case they should need it: the final direction to collect rents and pay taxes may have been on the assumption that this should be done if his \u00e1ssistance should be needed, and \u25a0 not otherwise; and on the whole, and especially in view of the absolute character of the earlier provisions wherein the residue is given to the testator\u2019s sisters without qualification, we do not find in the later provisions a clear intent to cut down the estates so devised by subjecting them to a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Moreover, even assuming that a trust was created, it is plain that the trustee would take no larger estate than was necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>for the proper execution of the trust. <em>Fay </em>v. Taft, <em>ubi supra. </em>The whole beneficial interest in this portion of the estate being vested in the testator\u2019s sisters, no other person has an interest to maintain or continue the trust, unless the trustee himself, and a decree for the termination of the trust might properly be entered.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have not been referred to any case where a trust has been continued merely for the purpose of continuing the compensation of the trustee, and we should be slow to do this unless such clearly was the intention of the founder of the trust. We find no such intention in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">The result is, that, in the opinion of a majority of the court, the decree appealed from must be reversed, and the decree of the judge of probate affirmed. <em>Decree accordingly.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\">See Sears <em>v. </em>Choate, post, p. 395.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
