M. on the next day; that the petitioner came on May 25, 1887, and informed the respondent\u2019s attorney of his intention to obtain a review and <em>supersedeas </em>of the judgment and execution; that the respondent\u2019s attorney immediately informed him that the execution would be placed in an officer\u2019s hands for levy on his property ; that during this conversation an officer came into the attorney\u2019s office to receive the execution for that purpose, the petitioner was so informed, and payment of the execution was demanded; that thereupon the petitioner paid to the respondent\u2019s attorney the sum of twenty-five dollars in part payment of the execution, and promised to come to the attorney\u2019s office and pay the balance upon the following Tuesday, and also paid the officer one dollar for his trouble, whereupon the attorney agreed to refrain from enforcing the execution till that day; and that the petition was sworn to by the petitioner the same day that he made the part payment of twenty-five dollars, and that it was filed and <em>supersedeas </em>issued the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">The respondent asked the judge to rule: \u201c If the court is satisfied, from the record and from the petitioner\u2019s own testimony or other evidence in the case, that the petitioner paid a part of the judgment sought to be reviewed on May 25, 1887, the same day on which he made oath to his petition, and before the same was filed, and before a <em>supersedeas </em>was issued, and at the same time promised to pay the balance of the judgment the following week, then the court must rule that in law and by statute the petitioner has waived his right to a review, and is not entitled thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">The judge declined so to rule, and granted the petition; and the respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-7\"><em>S. H. Dudley, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-8\"><em>I. R. Clark, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Knowlton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADTJ\">Assuming that the petitioner could have maintained a petition for a writ of review when he entered the office of the respondent\u2019s attorney on May 25, 1887, he there made an agreement for a valuable consideration, which was inconsistent with the continuance of his right to have a <em>supersedeas </em>and set aside the judgment upon a review. As soon as he informed the attorney that he intended to obtain a <em>supersedeas </em>and a review, he was told that the execution would be immediately enforced by a levy upon his property, and upon the officer\u2019s coming to get it for service, he gave the attorney twenty-five dollars in part payment of the judgment, paid the officer one dollar for his trouble, and made an oral contract with the attorney to pay the balance of the execution the following Tuesday, upon the attorney\u2019s agreeing to refrain from enforcing it until that time. By this arrangement the respondent\u2019s right to secure his execution by an immediate levy upon property was released, and the petitioner\u2019s right to treat the judgment as voidable was waived and given up.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The respondent\u2019s first prayer for a ruling must be considered in connection with the fact that his attorney, as a part of the transaction referred to in the prayer, agreed with the petitioner to refrain from enforcing the execution until the following Tuesday, and the court should have ruled as therein requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
