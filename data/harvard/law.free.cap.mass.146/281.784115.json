Trial in the Superior Court, before Blodgett, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-11\">Louisa Constantinides, the plaintiff\u2019s wife and the defendant\u2019s testatrix, died on October 28, 1884, possessed of separate estate, all of which she gave to her son, the step-son of the plaintiff, by her will admitted to probate on November 17,1884. The plaintiff had no knowledge of the will until three weeks after her death, before which time he had contracted, and on October 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>1884, had paid a bill for her necessary funeral expenses, which it was agreed was reasonable. It was not contended that the defendant had, prior to or after his appointment, made any promise of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff could not recover, and the judge so ruled, and ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-5\"><em>J. A. Maxwell, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-6\"><em>G. A.

Pub. Sts. c. 135, \u00a7 3; c. 137, \u00a7 1. St. 1882, c. 141. Under these statutes, and those establishing the independent position of married women with regard to their property, we think that, as between the estate of a married woman leaving property and her husband, the liability of the estate must be regarded as primary, and that it would be unreasonable to charge the husband for the funeral expenses, in all events, as necessaries, irrespective of any fault on his part. If then it was still, as formerly, the plaintiff\u2019s legal duty to see that his wife was buried, but her estate was primarily liable, he is entitled to recover his reasonable expenditures, as in other cases when a person has paid in pursuance of a legal duty what, as between himself and another, that other was bound to pay. There is no technical difficulty in a husband\u2019s imposing a liability upon his wife\u2019s executor after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">If it was not the plaintiff\u2019s legal duty to do what he did, nevertheless we are of opinion that he stood on no worse ground than a stranger would have done. A stranger could have recovered against the estate of a man, if he was justified in intermeddling. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Muldoon, </em>139 Mass. 304, 306. And formerly, in the case of a married woman, he could have recovered against her husband. <em>Lakin </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>10 Cush. 198, 221. <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>130 Mass. 422, 423. <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>12 C. B. (N. S.) 344. Undoubtedly he could now recover against her estate. If so, the husband can. In such a matter, it is not to be presumed that the husband waives his legal rights, and makes a gift to the estate of his wife, in the absence of any expression or other evidence to that effect. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
