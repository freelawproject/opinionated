Lemuel Clark was appointed his administrator, and on Ruth\u2019s petition was ordered to retain the money remaining in his hands, namely, $710.45, for her support, unless bond was given to expend the same in support of her if necessary. Lydia Holbrook, guardian of Joel\u2019s only child, Flora, thereupon gave bond. The sum was expended for the purpose mentioned, but was not sufficient. Ruth died, Clark was appointed her administrator, and the question which is intended to be presented, and which counsel desire us to consider, is whether, as such administrator, he can reach the real estate of Joel in a suit against Joel\u2019s heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The fact that Clark, when appointed administrator of Ruth, the obligee, was already the administrator of Joel, the obligor, did not extinguish the bond, nor prevent a suit by Clark against Joel\u2019s heir for whatever sums Clark could not have appropriated to Ruth\u2019s support as Joel\u2019s administrator. Y. B. 12 Hen. IV. 21, pl. 11. <em>Woodward </em>v. Darcy, Plowd. 184, 185. <em>Wankford </em>v. Wankford, 1 Salk. 299, 304. See <em>Cock </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>2 Lev. 73; <em>S. G. </em>3 Keb. 116, and 1 Freem. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We are of opinion that Clark\u2019s right to proceed against Joel\u2019s heir was not extinguished by what took place in the Probate Court. Assuming that \u00a7 8 of the Gen. Sts. c. 97, (Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 13,) applies to such a case as this, that section looks to the executor\u2019s retaining assets already in his hands. It does not contemplate the court\u2019s ordering him to sell real estate to meet the liability when it shall accrue. Still less does it contemplate such a sale to meet the chance of a liability which may never be incurred. Therefore it is not intended to bar a resort to the real estate in case the personal estate is retained and exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Turning to the sections which regulate the liability of heirs, the right to recover against them is given by the Gen. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7 32, to \u201c a creditor whose right of action accrues after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the expiration of said time of limitation, and whose claim has not been presented to the Probate Court, or if presented has not been allowed.\u201d (\u00a7 27 of the Pub. Sts. c. 136, reads \u201c whose claim could not legally be presented.\u201d <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Lamson, </em>128 Mass. 528.) It is plain that a claim which could not. be allowed or provided for in full, as it turns out, for the reasons which we have mentioned, is within the spirit, if not within the letter, of this section, and it is within the letter of \u00a7 31 (Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a726), which expresses the general intent of the following provisions. By that section the heirs \u201cshall be liable, in the manner provided in the following sections, for all debts which could not have been sued for against the executor or administrator, and for which provision is not made in chapter ninety-seven,\u201d which we have just considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Whatever might have been the effect if a bond had been given for the payment of the demand, as provided in Gen. Sts. c. 97, \u00a7 8, in this case, according to the bill, the bond was only to expend the $710.45 for Ruth\u2019s support. That has been done, the condition of the bond has been satisfied, and whether or not a claim the existence of which is contingent on the claimant\u2019s remaining alive is within the provisions of \u00a7 8, and whether, if that section applied, it was followed or not by giving such a bond as is alleged to have been given, the parties now stand exactly as if no bond had been given, and the money had been retained and spent.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">There are some defects in the proceedings which will make it necessary to sustain the demurrer; but as they seem to be only formal, they may be cured by amendment. The plaintiffs and their several causes of action are improperly joined; and Clark, the principal plaintiff, has no standing in equity. Clark\u2019s claim is a right to sue at law upon the bond. The liability of heirs is now governed wholly by statute. <em>Grow </em>v. <em>Dobbins, </em>128 Mass. 271. <em>Grow </em>v. <em>Dobbins, </em>124 Mass. 560. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Bumstead, </em>20 Pick. 2. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Burrill, </em>12 Mass. 395. But, as at common law, it is a liability upon the contract of their ancestor. <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>21 Pick. 176. <em>Russ </em>v. <em>Alpaugh, </em>118 Mass. 369, 379. Gen. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 31 <em>et seq. </em>Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 26 <em>et seq. </em>See <em>Noreross </em>v. <em>James, </em>140 Mass. 188, 189. In this case there is only one person liable for the debt, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>fore the jurisdiction in equity given by the Gen. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7 34, (Pub. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 29,) does not exist. On the other hand, the other plaintiffs have no right of action on the bond, or otherwise directly against the heir. Their only rights, if any, are severally to charge the heir as trustee in a proceeding against Clark. &gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Again, Clark\u2019s right is only to recover the amount reasonably necessary for the \u201c convenience, comfort, and necessity \u201d of Ruth so long as she lived, in excess of what has been paid by Joel\u2019s estate. The bill does not allege in terms that any sum above what was paid was necessary. The debts incurred by Ruth, and alleged to be due, may or may not be evidence of the amount necessary for her support, but they are nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
