Trial in the Superior Court before Sherman, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, which, so far as material, was as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-9\">The evidence tended to prove that the defendant resided with his wife in the same building where there was an eating saloon, and at the date mentioned in the complaint police officers visited the place with a warrant to search for intoxicating liquors; that in the saloon there was a bar or counter, bottles and glasses, &amp;c.; that in a closet back of the counter, under the stairs, after removing a board or trap door, they found twenty-five bottles of lager beer; and that while they were making the search, the defendant and his wife being present, she said, speaking of a bottle of whiskey upon her person, \u201cWe will sell liquor in spite of all the officers of Station 1.\u201d This declaration of the wife was admitted, against the objection of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-10\">The defendant requested the judge to rule \u201c that declarations or statements of the wife are not sufficient to warrant a conviction of the husband,\u201d and the judge said, \u201c That is so, gentlemen, and her declarations in his presence are only competent as bearing upon the question of his approval or non-approval of the language used by her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-11\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>W.

Having been uttered in the presence of her husband, and he not having been under arrest or duress at the time, it was some evidence of an admission on his part, if the declaration was understood by him in the sense first mentioned, and if the circumstances were such that according to human experience he naturally would have repudiated it, if the implied assertions were not true. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brailey, </em>134 Mass. 527, 530. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
