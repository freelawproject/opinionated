Sts. c. 91, \u00a7 27, alleging that the defendant, on December 23, 1885, at North Andover, \u201cin a certain pond called the Great Pond, otherwise known as Lake Cochickewick, said pond being a body of water of more than twenty acres in area, and being wholly situated in said North Andover, the whole of said pond being then and there a place where useful fishes were then and there lawfully artificially cultivated and maintained, unlawfully did fish without the permission or consent of the inhabitants of the said North Andover, the said inhabitants being then and there the lessees and proprietors of said pond, and proprietors of all the fishes therein contained, under and by virtue of a lease of said pond, made to said inhabitants,\u201d by the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">Trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, before Hammond, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">The government put in evidence a lease of said pond from the board of commissioners on inland fisheries to the inhabitants of North Andover, for the term of fifteen years from and including September 5, 1884, the date of the lease. The lease contained certain provisions, which are stated in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>It appeared in evidence, from the records of the town clerk, that, on August 25,1884, the inhabitants of said town, at a town meeting, and under an article in the warrant for said meeting, voted to lease said Great Pond for a term of years, and to instruct the selectmen to petition for said lease, and to do it without delay. There was no other record relating to said leasing of the pond, subsequent to this date, upon the records of the town clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\">The government called one Frye as a witness, who was a selectman of said town in the year 1884. He testified that, as such selectman, and under said vote, he went to the chairman of the board of commissioners on inland fisheries, for the purpose of obtaining a lease from the Commonwealth to the inhabitants of North Andover of said Great Pond; that he had a paper with him, and had a conversation with one Brackett, who was then acting as commissioner on inland fisheries; that he received a notice from said Brackett, which he took with him, and made two copies, and posted the notices in three places in North Andover; that they were posted between three and five days of the date of the lease, which was the date of the hearing; that said notices had been lost, and that, generally, said notices stated that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>plication had been made by the inhabitants of North Andover for a lease of Great Pond, under the provisions of the Pub. Sts. c. 91, and that a hearing would be had at the State House in Boston upon the matter, on September 5, 1884; that nobody appeared in opposition to the lease; and that he then received said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\">It appeared that, since said lease, the town had expended on account of it about $84, made up of a payment of $15, as the entire rental reserved by said lease, and certain sums for the obtaining and recording of said lease, car fare, &amp;c., and certain sums for fees incurred in prosecutions instituted against persons fishing, since said lease, upon said pond. It appeared, upon cross-examination of said Frye, that, since said lease; the town had paid nothing for the stocking of said pond with either of the species of fish mentioned in said lease, nor for the purpose of artificially cultivating fish in said pond, nor for the erection of any appliances for so doing, and had done nothing, except as before stated, towards the artificial cultivation of fish of any species in said pond. Frye also testified that he did not know of any return being made in the year 1884 to the commissioners on inland fisheries, as provided in said lease. And the defendant introduced evidence from the report of the commissioners on inland fisheries, for the year ending December 31, 1886, that said town had made no such return up to that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">This was all the evidence upon the matters embraced in the rulings asked for by the defendant, and in the rulings of the court. It did not appear whether the commissioners kept a record of their proceedings or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">The defendant asked the judge to give several instructions to the jury, of which the following is the only one which need now be stated:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">\u201c 4. In order to the validity of a lease of a great pond there must be an application by the lessees, a hearing upon that application, and notice of the hearing. And the hearing must be at a reasonable hour, and at a reasonable place, and there must be reasonable notice of the time and place for hearing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">The judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury, \u201c that, it being undisputed that the whole of said pond was within the limits of the town of North Andover, the notice of hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>provided by the Pub. Sts. c. 91, \u00a7 13, was not necessary, and no notice was required; that no actual setting apart or occupancy of said pond by the town, for the purposes of said lease, was necessary to be proved in the case; and that there was no evidence to be submitted to the jury upon the question whether the town had abandoned the lease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-5\"><em>W.

And upon the further condition that said lessees shall make such regulations concerning the use of such pond and fishing therein as may be required by said commissioners. All regulations concerning the same shall be submitted to said commissioners, and be subject to their approval.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-7\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">The only exceptions argued are the exception to the refusal to give the fourth instruction requested, and the exception to the instruction \u201c that there was no evidence to be submitted to the jury upon the question whether the town had abandoned the lease.\u201d The instruction of the court upon the fourth request was, \u201c that, it being undisputed that the whole of said pond was within the limits of the town of North Andover, the notice of hearing provided by the Pub. Sts. c. 91, \u00a7 13, was not necessary, and no notice was required.\u201d The town of North Andover was the lessee. The Pub. Sts. c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14, are re-enactments of the St. of 1873, c. 195, and the St. of 1874, c. 135. Notice is required \u201c to every city or town within whose limits any part of the pond lies,\u201d that the city or town may appear and be heard upon the application for a lease. But when a city or town within whose limits the whole of the pond lies makes the application for a lease, a notice to it would be unnecessary. The notice required is notice to a city or town in its corporate capacity, and notice to' any person or any other body corporate is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">There was no evidence that the lease had been determined by the board of commissioners on inland fisheries for breach of any of the conditions contained in it, or that the estate created by the lease had been surrendered by the town, and this surrender accepted by the commissioners. The town was still in possession under the lease, and liable to pay the rent reserved, and to keep its covenants contained in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\"><em>Kxeeptions overruled. </em>.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
