The defendant\u2019s testatrix, who was admitted to \u2022 prosecute the action, filed an answer, which, after a general denial, proceeded as follows: \u201c And further answering, defendant denies the genuineness of the signature to the note declared on, and says that if any such note was made, and she denies that any such note was made by the testator during his lifetime, the same has been paid in full.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-11\">At the trial in the Superior Court, Blodgett, J., ruled that the answer was not sufficient, under the Pub.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUfQ\">Our statutes of amendments are very broad in their spirit and scope, allowing amendments at any time before judgment in a civil suit, in any matter either of form or substance, in any process, pleading, or proceeding in the suit which may enable the plaintiff to sustain the action or the defendant to make a legal defence. Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7\u00a7 41-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The special denial of the genuineness of the signature to a written instrument declared on, required by the Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 21, if not in strictness a part of the pleadings, is an important proceeding in the case. It is to be filed \u201c within the time allowed for an answer,\u201d which by leave of court may be at any time before trial. It falls within the letter and the spirit of the statute, and if the special denial is imperfect we can have no doubt that it is within the power of the court to allow an amendment to the same extent that it might allow an amendment to an answer, and upon such terms as it deems reasonable. Such an amendment is within the discretion of the court, and no exception lies to the exercise of this discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
