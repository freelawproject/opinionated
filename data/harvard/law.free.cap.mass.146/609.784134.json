The plaintiff was permitted to introduce, as evidence of her title and possession, proceedings in the Probate Court by which it appeared that commissioners duly appointed to set off dower made a report reciting that the dower as set off was equal to one half of the estate of her deceased husband ; that Josiah Taylor and Sophia Taylor, being the only heirs of her husband, assented in writing to the report; and that on April 16, 1878, the Probate Court made a decree accepting the report, \u201c all parties interested .... having assented thereto in writing,\u201d and assigning the land so set off to the plaintiff as tenant in dower. The only objection by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery was to the admission of such report and decree, on the ground that the commissioners had no power to set off one half of the estate as dower, and that the decree was void. The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b627-11\"><em>T. C.

There was nothing to show that the defendant had any right whatever to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>go upon the land; but the stress of his argument is, that the plaintiff\u2019s title was not good. We need not enter upon that question; although we may remark that those in whom the title stood, if not in her, not only have never questioned, but expressly affirmed her title. The utmost that we have to decide is, that the proceedings setting off the land to her, whether valid or invalid, never having been doubted, might be put in evidence upon the question of her possession of the land. And of this we have no doubt. <em>Allen </em>v. Taft, 6 Gray, 552, 554. <em>Motte </em>v. Alger, 15 Gray, 322. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
