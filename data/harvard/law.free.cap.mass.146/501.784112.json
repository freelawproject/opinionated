The following facts were admitted. The testator, a business man of large intelligence and ability, died on July 7, 1881. The will, dated February 28, 1880, was drawn up by a clergyman without the assistance or advice of persons learned in the law, and was duly admitted to probate on September 7,1881. The testator\u2019s widow, \u2022 Abigail Cummings, died on March 10,1887, leaving a will, which was duly admitted to probate. The widow and her executors had received all the net income of the testator\u2019s estate that accrued during her widowhood, and such income amounted to about six thousand dollars per year. No claim for any further payment was ever made by her or on her behalf until after her death, and no part of the principal was ever paid to her, and the provision for her in the second item of the will was sufficient for her comfortable support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">The testator had six brothers and sisters : Daniel Cummings, Angelina Smith, Maria Keyes, Charles Cummings, Julia I. Albee, and Lydia Thorn. The first-named three survived him, and the last-named three died before him, leaving issue surviving him; but all of them died before March 10, 1887, when the testator\u2019s widow died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-8\">The heirs of the testator at the date of the will, February 28, 1880, and that of his death, July 7,1881, according to the statute rules of the descent of real estate, consisted of seventeen persons, made up of the surviving brother and sisters of the testator, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>of the children of the deceased brother and sisters. The persons who would have been the heirs of the testator if he had died on March 10, 1887, the date of the widow\u2019s death, according to the same rules, were thirty-three in number, consisting of the children of Daniel Cummings, Maria Keyes, Charles Cummings, and Lydia Thorn, and the surviving children and the children of deceased children of Angelina Smith and Julia I. Albee. All the survivors of these, the representatives or heirs of those deceased, the executor of the will of Wright S. Keyes, the husband of Maria Keyes, who, surviving her, died on March 21, 1888, and the executors of the testator\u2019s widow, were made defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-4\">The children of Daniel Cummings and Charles Cummings, and the executor of the will of Wright S. Keyes, contended that the residuary estate of the testator, George Cummings, vested at the time of his death; and that it then vested (subject to deductions to be made therefrom in the administration of his will and estate) in equal sixth parts, <em>per </em>stirpes, according to the number of his brothers and sisters, one sixth part in each of the two sisters and brother then surviving, and one sixth part in the issue then living of each of the two sisters and brother deceased ; and that the estate now in the hands of the plaintiff, subject to distribution, should be divided in accordance with such vested interests; and in the case of the death since the death of the testator of any such persons seised of such vested interests, the share of the estate now payable on account of such interests should be paid to the executors or administrators of such person dying seised of said interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">The children of Lydia Thorn contended that the residuary estate of the testator vested at his death; but that it vested equally among the seventeen persons who were his then next of kin, and should now be distributed equally among them <em>per </em>capita, as of the time of his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">The issue of Maria Keyes, Angelina Smith, and Julia I. Albee, contended that the residuary estate of the testator did not vest until the death of the widow of the testator, on March 10, 1887, and that it then vested equally in the nephews and nieces of the testator then surviving, the issue of any deceased nephew or niece taking the parent\u2019s share. According to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>contention the estate would he divided into twenty-six equal parts, one part for each of twenty-three nephews and nieces living on March 10, 1887, and one part for the issue of a deceased nephew and two deceased nieces.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\">The executors of the will of the widow of the testator contended that twelve hundred dollars annually, in quarterly payments, should have been paid to her out of the principal of the estate independently of the income, and that there is now due to her estate the sum that these payments would have amounted to if paid, but without interest, because the widow had received the interest of the whole estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-5\"><em>E.

Secondly, Do these legatees take <em>per stirpes </em>or <em>per capita f </em>Thirdly, Was the annual payment of twelve hundred dollars to the testator\u2019s widow, under the second clause of the will, to be made from the income of the estate in the hands' of the executors, or from the principal ?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">It seems very clear that the gift of the residuum was to those who were the testator\u2019s blood relations at the time of his death, in accordance with the principle recognized in many cases, that when a bequest is made to one or more for life, and remainder to the testator\u2019s heirs, the bequest is to those who are heirs at the time of his decease, unless there are words indicating a clear intention that it shall go to those who may be in that relation at the time of the happening of the contingency upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>which the estate is to be distributed. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>1 Allen, 223. <em>Bay </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>2 Gray, 171. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Stephenson, </em>99 Mass. 188. <em>Gibbens </em>v. <em>Gibbens, </em>140 Mass. 102, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The term \u201c blood relations \u201d in the sixteenth clause of the will is equivalent in this case to heirs, and the words \u201c equally between my blood relations of the degree which the law permits \u201d seem to have been used to denote the mode of distribution provided by the statute. The will was not drawn by a lawyer, and the language was not accurately used, but it clearly indicates that the testator had in mind the relative rights of heirs differing in relationship to a deceased person, under the law. The word \u201c equally \u201d in this connection is not inconsistent with this view. The testator probably meant by it, with equal regard to the rights of every one as defined by law. Viewing the whole expression most favorably to those who seek a distribution <em>per capita, </em>it was merely equivalent to \u201c equally among my heirs,\u201d and where that is the language the division is according to the Statute of Distributions. \u201cA devise to heirs designates, not only the persons who are to take, but also the manner and proportions in which they take.\u201d <em>Rand </em>v. <em>Sanger, </em>115 Mass. 124. See also <em>Balcom v. Haynes, </em>14 Allen, 204; <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>16 Gray, 102; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>140 Mass. 267; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Vicars, </em>1 Collyer, 6; <em>Fielden </em>v. <em>Ashworth, </em>L. R. 20 Eq. 410; <em>Inre Campbell's Trusts, </em>33 Ch. D. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">There is much in the situation of the testator in reference to the number of his heirs of different classes, and the effect which the opposite construction would have upon the distribution of his estate, and in the manifestation of his intention towards different heirs in other parts of his will, to strengthen this view. We are therefore of opinion that the distribution among the legatees under this clause should be made <em>per stirpes, </em>and not <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">By the second clause of the will the executors were required to pay to the testator\u2019s widow twelve hundred dollars annually, in quarterly payments, during her life; and by the sixteenth clause, to keep the residue invested, and pay her the income thereof for the same period. The legacy of twelve hundred dollars annually was an annuity, and the testator contemplated the retention in the hands of the executors of the means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>paying it. <em>Swett </em>v. Boston, 18 Pick. 123. <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Milnor, </em>9 C. E. Green, 358. The annual income of the entire fund in their hands under the will was about six thousand dollars, and the question is whether the annuity was payable from the income or the principal. The very nature of an annuity suggests, when those charged with the payment of it have in their hands a fund producing income sufficient to pay it, that the payment should be made from the income, and not from the principal. In this' case the payments were to be made quarterly, and the income regularly accruing would naturally be expected to be used for them, rather than sums deducted from the fund. It has been expressly held, that, where a testator gives an annuity without stating from what source it is to be paid, and then divides the rest of his estate among several persons, it is the duty of the executors before distributing the capital, either to appropriate a sufficient amount of the capital to purchase an annuity, or to reserve enough of it to yield ah income amply sufficient to meet the annuity, leaving such portion of the capital to be the subject of another distribution when the annuity has ceased. <em>Treadwell </em>v. Cordis, 5 Gray, 341. See also <em>Wroughton </em>v. Colquhoun, 1 DeG. &amp; Sm. 36; <em>Richardson </em>v. Hall, 124 Mass. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">That rule applied to the present case would have left the widow, under the sixteenth clause of the will, only that portion of the entire income which remained after deducting sufficient to pay her annuity of twelve hundred dollars under the second clause. Her executors, therefore, are not entitled to the amount which they now claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
