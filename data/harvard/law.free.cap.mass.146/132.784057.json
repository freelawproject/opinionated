The district attorney called as a witness one Batchelder, and asked him the following question: \u201c During the time covered by the complaint did you see posted in the defendant\u2019s premises a United States tax receipt as a dealer in spirituous or intoxicating liquors other than malt liquors ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-4\">The defendant objected to the question, upon the ground that the St. of 1887, c. 414, so far as it authorized the introduction of such evidence, was unconstitutional and void.

In the case at bar, the only ruling was that the evidence was admissible; no ruling was asked or given as to the weight or effect of the evidence. The ruling given was clearly right, and we cannot properly consider any question not raised by the bill of exceptions. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
