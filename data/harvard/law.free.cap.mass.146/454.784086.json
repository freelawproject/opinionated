Kempster and Stiles Frost, both of Boston, Mass., and William L. Faxon, of Quincy, Mass. Whereas, said Kempster has invented an improvement in roller skates, for which an application for letters patent of the United States is now pending. And whereas, said Kempster has heretofore sold and assigned one half of his interest in said invention, and any letters patent which may be granted therefor, to said Frost. And whereas, said Faxon is desirous of obtaining an interest in said invention and letters patent, and of joining with said Kempster and Frost in the business of manufacturing and selling said skates, \u2014 now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements of the said parties herein contained, the said parties mutually covenant and agree with each other as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">\u201c <em>First. </em>The said Kempster and Frost agree to assign to said Faxon an undivided one-third interest in said invention and letters patent, for which said Faxon agrees to pay the sum of two thousand dollars, of which five hundred dollars is to be paid in cash on or before March 25, 1885, and the remaining fifteen hundred dollars on the issuing of letters patent for said invention, and the delivery to him of a written assignment of said one-third interest therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>It is agreed, as a further consideration for the assignment aforesaid, that whatever capital may be necessary to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling roller skates, under said letters patent as hereinafter provided, shall be furnished by said Faxon, and that he shall be allowed interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum. Should either of the other parties at any time advance any portion of the capital employed in said business, he shall be allowed interest thereon at the same rate. It is understood and agreed that all capital furnished as aforesaid shall be at the risk of the business, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that none of the parties hereto shall be personally liable to make good any deficiency therein, nor shall their interest in said letters patent and invention be liable therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\">\u201c <em>Third. </em>The business of manufacturing and selling roller skates under said letters patent shall be carried on by said parties under the name of the Kempster Roller Skate Company of Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\"><em>'\u2022'\u2022Fourth. </em>It is agreed that said Faxon shall have general charge of the financial department of said business, including the purchase of materials and sales of skates, and that for such services he shall receive a salary of two thousand dollars per annum. It is, however, expressly understood and agreed that he shall give no notes, nor borrow money on account of said business, in the names of the other parties hereto, or on their credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">\u201c <em>Fifth. </em>It is agreed that said Kempster shall have the entire superintendence and management of the manufacturing department of said business, including the employment and direction of help, and that he shall receive for such services the sum of fifteen hundred and sixty-five dollars per annum, payable weekly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">\u201c <em>Sixth. </em>It is agreed that said Frost shall receive for such special services as he may render a fair compensation, to be determined by mutual agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">\u201c <em>Seventh. </em>It is agreed that the net profits resulting from the manufacture and sale of said skates, after deducting expenses, including the special compensation of the parties as above provided, shall be divided equally among the parties hereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-9\">\u201c <em>Eighth. </em>It is agreed that accurate accounts of the said business shall be kept, which shall always be open to the inspection of all parties hereto, and that once in every six months, commencing November 1, 1885, a statement of such accounts and of the profits made during the preceding six months shall be furnished to each party, and the share of profit due to each party paid to him within thirty days thereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-10\">\u201c <em>Ninth. </em>It is agreed that neither of the parties shall sell or assign his interest in said letters patent and invention, or in the business of manufacturing and selling said skates, or license any other party to manufacture skates under said letters patent, . without the written consent of the other parties hereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201c <em>Tenth. </em>It is agreed that, in case the said Faxon shall fail to furnish the capital necessary for the successful development of said business, the other parties hereto may assume the management and control of the said business in his place, in which case they shall be subject to the same obligations and entitled to the same privileges as are herein specified with reference to said Faxon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">The judge ruled that, under this agreement, the defendants Kempster and Frost were liable for the contracts of Faxon within the scope of the business for which they were associated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">It further appeared in evidence, that the defendants did business under and according to the above agreement, and the defendant Kempster requested the judge to rule that, as he was employed at a stated and agreed price for his services in conducting the business, payable at given periods, and was not liable for any losses of the business, he was not, either as to his employers or third persons, a partner, and that the plaintiffs could not recover against him in this action, although he was entitled to a specific portion of the profits. The judge declined so to rule, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs. The defendants Kempster and Frost alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-6\"><em>A. K. P. Joy &amp; F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvF\">The Superior Court correctly held that the agreement between the defendants made them partners. By it they were to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling roller skates, under the name of the Kempster Roller Skate Company. Faxon was to furnish the capital, and to have the general charge of the financial department of the business, and of buying materials and selling skates; each party was to receive a certain compensation ; and then it is provided <em>thatCl </em>the net profits resulting from the manufacture and sale of said skates, after deducting expenses, including the special compensation of the parties as above provided, shall be divided equally among the parties hereto.\u201d It is further provided, that, if Faxon should fail to furnish the necessary capital, the other parties may assume the management and control of the business in his place. It is impossible to construe this agreement so as to hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Faxon was the only principal in the business, and that the other defendants were his agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">On the contrary, it is clear that the materials purchased and the skates manufactured were the property of the three defendants, and that they shared in the profits of the business, and to some extent at least in the losses. Each defendant is entitled to a share of the profits as profits, and he has a lien upon them and upon the stock as against the private creditors of either of the other defendants. In other words, there is in the three defendants a community of interest in the property or stock engaged in the business, and a community of interest in the profits. This, according to all the authorities, made them partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
