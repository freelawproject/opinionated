The defendant objected to the introduction of the record, and asked the judge to rule that the word \u201ccrime\u201d in the Pub. Sts. c. 169, \u00a7 19, meant felony, and not misdemeanor. The judge overruled the objection, and allowed the record to be put in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">After the jury had retired and been out several hours, they were sent for by the judge, and in reply to a question put by him they reported that they had been unable to agree. The judge then read to the jury that, part of the report of the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1, beginning with the words, (on page 2,) \u201c The only mode,\u201d and ending with \u201c and distrust the weight or sufficiency of that evidence which fails to carry conviction to the minds of their fellows,\u201d and also read that portion of the opinion in that case, (on page 4,) beginning with the words, \u201c The jury room,\u201d and ending with \u201c would become a most effectual obstacle to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">The defendant then requested the judge to instruct the jury: \u201c 1. The case should not be decided with reference to a majority or minority vote of the jury; and 2. It is the right of any juror to stick to his judgment if he thinks he is right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The judge refused to give these instructions, which were in writing, but were not read to or in the hearing of the jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-4\"><em>T. </em>Riley, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-5\"><em>A.

Sts. c. 169, \u00a7 19, the conviction of a witness of any crime, whether a felony or a misdemeanor, may be shown to affect his credibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hall, 4 Allen, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">It is to be presumed that proper instructions were given; and such instructions necessarily implied that the jury could not act by a majority, and that each juror must act upon his own convictions. The judge was not required to repeat these principles, which every juror must have understood. Whether he should do so was within his discretion, and no exception lies to his refusal to give the further instructions at the time and in the form requested by the defendant. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
