The defendant may be liable under Clause 2(B) of the August 8, 1969 contract only for the amounts actually paid by Lintron Corporation to Bichard D. Pouliot for salary between August 8, 1969 and August 8, 1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The trial justice denied the request for ruling with the statement, \u201cThis request is denied as contrary to the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Avu\">Worcester in its brief admitted it owes Lin-tron $2,071.71 which represents the salary of Pouliot for the month of January, 1970 and associated F.I.C.A. taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u2022 <em>At the trial there was evidence tending to show the following:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">In the summer of 1969 Lintron was the owner of a patent covering a device known as a \u201clinear actuator.\u201d Lintron did not have the financial means to manufacture the actuator and Worcester agreed to furnish all manufacturing arid production facilities, labor and clerical assistance to place the actuator on the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">On <em>August 8, 1969 </em>\u201cLintron\u201d and \u201cWorcester\u201d signed a written contract drafted by Worcester\u2019s counsel. This contract provided, among others that 2. We will <em>reimburse </em>Lin-tron Corporation for the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">(b) The salary of Richard D.

Ltd., </em>343 Mass. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Beimburse means \u201cto pay back, to make restoration, to repay that expended: to indemnify or make whole.\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary Bevised Fourth Edition.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">Ballantines Law Dictionary Third Edition defines reimburse as \u201cTo place in a treasury, as an equivalent for what has been taken, lost or expended: to refund: to pay back: to restore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Our Supreme Court in the case of <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>322 Mass. 177, 179 has stated \u2018 \u2018 The word reimburse has been frequently construed as repaying or making good the amount paid out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">We are constrained to agree with \u201cWorcester\u201d in its interpretation of the meaning of the word \u201creimburse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">We find that the trial justice committed prejudicial error in finding for Lintron in the sum of $6,781.81. The finding for the plaintiff is to be reduced to $2,071.71.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
