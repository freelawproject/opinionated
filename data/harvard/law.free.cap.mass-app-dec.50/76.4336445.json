The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by the denial of its motion under circumstances set out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The report, the pleadings and docket entries disclose that the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, entered with the writ on April 24, 1972, alleged the defendants were indebted to it in the amount of $987.16, the balance due on a promissory note. Their real estate was duly attached. Because they failed to appear and answer they were defaulted on April 28, 1972. A \u201cmilitary affidavit\u201d was not filed and judgment has not been entered on the docket of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">On June 13, 1972 the defendants, (according to the report)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a motion (first motion) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to dissolve the real estate attachment, assigning as a reason \u201cthat the plaintiff has failed to levy upon said property, within (30) days after [automatic entry of] its judgment (April 28, 1972) against the above named defendants as required by Gr.L. c. 223, \u00a7 59.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not appear at the scheduled hearing on this motion and it was allowed on June 29, 1972. A report was not claimed to its allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On July 3, 1972 the plaintiff filed a motion (second motion) to vacate the allowance of the (first motion) \u201con the ground that final judgment had not entered ten days after the return date.\u201d This motion, after hearing, was denied and to its denial the report under review was claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Section 520 of the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended, TJ.S. Code Annotated, 50 Appendix, reads in part: \u201cIn any action or proceeding commenced in any court, if there shall be a default of any appearance by the defendant, the plaintiff, before entering judgment shall file in the court an affidavit setting forth facts showing that the defendant is not in military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u201cIf an affidavit is not filed showing that the defendant is not in the military service, no judgment shall be entered without first securing an order of court directing such entry. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">We need not decide whether Norma E. Buffer, the moving party in the first motion, but not a party to the case lacked standing to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>quest the court to dissolve the attachment as this issue is not reported. We do decide, however, that the grounds set forth for the allowance of the first motion \u2014 that judgment had entered on April 28, 1972 and the plaintiff had failed to levy on the property within thirty days as required by G-.L. c. 223, \u00a7 59 was error and should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In the absence of the filing of a military affidavit or order of the court, the case was not \u201cripe for judgment.\u201d The clerk of the court could not enter judgment, and until judgment was entered the statutory thirty day period in which a levy on the attached real estate must be made, never started to run. We are not aware of any statute or rule of court making mandatory the filing of a military affidavit or setting a time limit, in which it must be filed. Neither do we find any prohibition-to a defendant filing such an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">A case becomes \u201cripe for judgment\u201d \u201c(W)hen, under the last entry, the case seems to have been brought to a final determination, and everything seems to have been done that ought to be done before the entry of a final adjudication upon the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>American Wood Working Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Furbush, </em>193 Mass. 455, 457. See Rule 36 of the Eules of the District Courts (1956) and cases cited in the annotations to Superior Court Eule 79, [1954 Legalite edition]. G.L. c. 235, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Judgment in the case under consideration could not have been entered until a military affidavit had been filed, or by order of the court, which was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The defendants argue, that if the allowance of the first motion was not warranted, the plaintiff lost its right of review because of its failure to appear and oppose the allowance of the motion, and more particularly by its failure to take an appeal. They cite no authority in support of this contention and we find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We subscribe to the rule that litigation must come to an orderly conclusion and that \u201cback door\u201d approaches, for the purposes of delay or for other reasons, are not to be encouraged. Here, however, we are of the opinion that the judge was in error in allowing the first motion the method used by the plaintiff \u2014 by a timely motion to revoke its allowance, rather than by appeal \u2014 was proper. It afforded the judge an opportunity to correct his error, which he declined to do, and his action was therefore subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The defendants also argue that the allowance of the first motion and the denial of the second was within the sound discretion of the judge and no abuse .of discretion has been shown. We do not agree. Generally \u201cthere can be no such review of a question of fact or discretion.\u201d <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 42. In the case before us the judge was not permitted to exercise discretion. The statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>contained in the first motion seeking a discharge of the attachment were based on an erroneous interpretation of the law and the judge was in error in adopting them. It was likewise error in denying the second motion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b87-8\">Briar J.
