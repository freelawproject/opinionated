An employee of the detective agency was injured while at his work in the warehouse. The employee would be barred from recovery against Bradlee\u2019s if he were a \u201ccommon employee\u201d. He would be a \u201ccommon employee\u201d if his work was \u201cpart of or process in\u201d the business carried on by Bradlee\u2019s. The trial judge found that he was not a \u201ccommon employee\u201d and awarded plaintiff $7500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The single issue on appeal is whether the evidence required a finding for the defendant. A finding for the defendant would be required if, as a matter of law, the employee\u2019s work was part of Bradlee\u2019s business. This would be a matter of law only if the work was \u201cplainly\u201d part of the business. It is our opinion that the work being done was not \u201cplainly\u201d part of Bradlee\u2019s work, therefore, a finding for the defendant was not required and this report should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The reported evidence is as follows. Plaintiff\u2019s decedent, George Gabriel, was an employee of Watts Detective Agency. He was injured when a fork-lift truck, operated by an employee of Bradlee\u2019s, struck the desk at which he was seated. The accident happened in December, 1965, while Gabriel was performing work in accordance with a 1963 contract which required Watts to provide security and protection for Bradlee\u2019s property at the warehouse. Bradlee\u2019s business is that of merchandising and selling household and commercial goods. The warehouse served as a distributing point for retail outlets throughout New England, and had in excess of two million dollars in inventory at the time of the injury. Security and protection at the warehouse was the sole responsibility of the Detective Agency. At Bradlee\u2019s retail outlets, security and protection services were performed by seven other individuals who were paid by Stop &amp; Shop, Inc. and were subject to supervisory control by employees of either Bradlee\u2019s or Stop &amp; Shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It was stipulated that Bradlee\u2019s had Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance under General Laws, Chapter 152 and that a finding for the plaintiff was warranted subject to the defendant sustaining the burden of proving the \u201cdefense of common employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Section 18 of General Laws, Chapter 152, requires that an employee of a sub-contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>shall be considered an employee of the principal contractor if the contract calls for work that is \u201cpart of or process in\u201d the business being carried on by the principal contractor. Thus the term \u201ccommon employee\u201d. Section 18 further provides that it shall not apply if the contract is \u201cmerely ancillary and incidental to\u201d the business carried on by the principal contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Section 15 of the same chapter allows an injured employee to pursue his rights under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act against his employer, or to pursue his common law rights against a third person, but not both. As related to this case, Bradlee\u2019s asserts that Section 18 makes Bradlee\u2019s the employer of Gabriel and that Section 15 does not authorize a law suit by the employee against the employer. Thus the \u201cdefense of common employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The defendant submitted four requests for rulings<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which are now the subject of this ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>peal. Each of the requests, in effect, calls for a ruling that \u201cthe evidence requires a finding for the defendant\u201d. Therefore, it is the defendant\u2019s contention that there was no factual' determination to be made by the trial judge. In other words, the work being done by Gabriel was, <em>as a matter of law, </em>\u201cpart of or process in\u201d the business being carried on by Bradlee\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The trial judge denied the requests for rulings and found as, fact that the work was merely ancillary and incidental to rather than part of or process in the business carried on by Bradlee\u2019s. It was not error to deny the requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u201cCommon employment\u201d exists as a matter of law when the facts show that the work done is \u201cplainly part of\u201d the principal contractor\u2019s work; if the work done is not \u201cplainly\u201d part of the principal contractor\u2019s work or is not \u201cplainly\u201d incidental to it, there is a jury question. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Roy Bros., Inc., </em>358 Mass. 446. <em>McPadden </em>v. <em>W. T. Halloran Co., </em>338 Mass. 189, 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">There are no Massachusetts decisions bearing directly on whether the work of \u201csecurity and protection\u201d is \u201cplainly part of\u201d a business operation. A particular work is not \u201cplainly part of\u201d the principal contractor\u2019s work merely because of it being necessary to the business, <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Winslow Bros. &amp; Smith Co., </em>309 Mass. 150, 154, or because employees of the subcontractor and the principal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tractor work together, <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Link-Belt Co., </em>324 Mass. 673, or because the principal contractor\u2019s employees could have done the same work, <em>Corbett\u2019s Case, </em>270 Mass. 162, 166.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b71-7\">Dudley B. Killam and David P. Murphy for the Plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A90\">James D. Casey and Charles J. O\u2019Malley for the Defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">On the evidence, we are not certain whether the work being done was \u201cpart of\u201d or \u201cincidental to \u2019 \u2019 the business of retail merchandising. To us, the work done was not \u201cplainly\u201d part of Bradlee\u2019s work. We conclude, therefore, that the existence of \u201ccommon employment\u201d was a question of fact and not a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The report is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\"> See: G.L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a715 and 18 as to liability to employees of independent contractors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\"> 1.
