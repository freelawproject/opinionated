The statutory right to recover for loss of consortium did not become effective until August 21, 1967. RSA 507:8-a; Laws 1967, 218:1. The plaintiff\u2019s husband was a passenger in an automobile operated by the defendant\u2019s employee on December 5, 1966 when he received severe injuries from which he died approximately forty-five minutes later. The defendants \u2019 motion to dismiss was granted by <em>Morris, </em>J. and the plaintiff\u2019s exception thereto was reserved and transferred to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The ruling that the wife does not have a cause of action for loss of her husband\u2019s consortium in <em>Snodgrass </em>v. <em>Cherry - Burrell Corp., </em>103 N.H. 56, 164 A.2d 579 was re-examined in <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Seybolt Motors, Inc., </em>109 N.H. 501, 256 A.2d 151. In the latter case we noted that the trend of the law now and in the future was to allow such a cause of action. Restatement, Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Torts 13-21 (Tent. Draft No. 14, 1969); 37 U.S.L.W. 2660 (May 27, 1969). However we held that the statutory right of action for loss of consortium was not intended to be applied ret - roactively and we deemed it to be the legislative intent that it should not be, directly or indirectly. Consequently we decline to change the rule in this jurisdiction prior to the effective date of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Plaintiff makes a strong argument that the denial of a cause of action to die wife for loss of consortium is a denial of equal protection of the laws. What was said in <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Seybolt Motors, Inc. supra, </em>in 1969, is still true today. \u201c We recognize the claim is not frivolous. <em>Cf. Levy </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 68, 88 S. Ct. 1509, 20 L. Ed. 2d 436. <em>See </em>Comment, Equal Protection: The Wife\u2019s Action for Loss of Consortium, 54 Iowa L. Rev. 510 ( 1968 ). However, in the present state of the law we are not prepared to say that the contention reaches constitutional dimensions that are forbidden. <em>Miskunas </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corporation, </em>399 F.2d 847 (7th Cir. 1968); <em>Krohn </em>v. <em>Richardson-Merrell Co., </em>219 Tenn. 37, 406 S.W.2d 166 ( 1966 ); see <em>Goesaert </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>335 U.S. 464, 69 S. Ct. 198, 93 L. Ed. 163. \u201d So far as the equal protection argument is concerned the law is substantially the same now as it was when <em>Bromfleld </em>was decided. <em>Miskunas </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corporation, </em>399 F.2d 847 (7th Cir. 1968); <em>see </em>Note, Loss of Consortium-Equal Protection, 44 Ind. L.J. 293 (1969 ). <em>Cf. </em>Clark, Negligent Impairment of Consortium, 3 Family L.Q. 197, 202-11. The defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was properly granted by the trial court. The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-7\">Lampron, J., did not sit; die others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
