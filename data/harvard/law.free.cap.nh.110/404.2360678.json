Bridge Street runs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>generally east and west and Broadway Avenue runs north and south but was accepted by the city only as far north as Barnes Street, although as originally dedicated it extended to Bridge Street which is a block further north. There appears to be no dispute that under RSA 238:7 the contested area has been \u201creleased and discharged from all public servitude \u201d because it was not \u201c opened, built or used for public travel within twenty years from such dedication. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The record does not contain any of the deeds out of Walker and we therefore cannot determine whether he retained any rights in that portion of the tract which had been designated as streets. The record does, however, disclose that in 1960 the plaintiff acquired in one deed two lots, one at the southeast corner of Bridge and Broadway and the other adjoining it on the east and fronting on Bridge Street. The westerly boundary of the corner lot was described as running \u201c thence northerly by Broadway, 186 feet ... to the point of beginning\u201d which was described as \u201cthe southeasterly intersection of Bridge Street and Broadway. \u201d These two tracts combined gave plaintiff one plot which he later divided into three lots. The first, at the corner of Bridge and Broadway, he sold to Cote in 1963 who later conveyed to Choate and Johnson by identical description which began \u201c at the southeasterly intersection of Bridge Street and Broadway\u201d and ran clockwise around the lot \u201cto Broadwayf,] thence Northerly by said Broadway, 95 feet, more or less, to the point of beginning. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In 1965 plaintiff conveyed a lot to Cagan which included the rest of his frontage between Bridge Street and an extension of the southerly line of the lot conveyed to Cote. This left plaintiff a lot bounded on Broadway but separated from Bridge Street by the lots of Cote and Cagan. He conveyed this lot to Dubois The Builder, Inc. in 1967. The description began \u201c at a stake on the easterly line of Broadway ... at the southwesterly corner of land ... of Cote \u201d and ran clockwise around the property \u201cto Broadway Avenue[,] thence Northerly by said Broadway Avenue ... to the point of beginning. \u201d None of the deeds contains any reference to any easements in Broadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Although it appears to be agreed that defendants Dakos own the property on the westerly side of Broadway Avenue, there is no evidence concerning their title or its source.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">By his deeds to Cote and Dubois The Builder, Inc., the plaintiff divested himself of any interest he had in the fee underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Broadway as the trial court ruled, without exception. Since he now owns no land to which a right of way could attach, he has no standing to claim one. <em>Sawtelle v. Tatone, </em>105 N.H. 398, 406, 201 A.2d 111, 117; 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses <em>s. </em>11 and <em>ss. </em>115-16. His petition should have been denied without consideration of the question of private easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\n<em>Exception sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-6\">Griffith, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
