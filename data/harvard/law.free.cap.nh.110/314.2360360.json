LaBonte, husband of plaintiff Dorothy LaBonte was injured on June 13, 1968, in the plant of defendant National Gypsum Company by whom he was empolyed. His injury allegedly resulted from a blow about the neck wilfully and maliciously inflicted by a co-worker. On July 1, a memorandum of an agreement for compensation was filed with the Labor Commissioner under the provisions of RSA 281:36 (supp.). On July 2 the agreement was approved by the Deputy Commissioner and William thereafter received compensation payments of $ 58 per week and medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">On August 27, 1968, William instituted a common-law action based on defendant\u2019s negligence in which he sought damages from the employer for the alleged assault and battery committed against him. His declaration alleges in part that the injury which the defendant negligently failed to prevent resulted from a cause unrelated to his employment and was the result of a purely personal matter. On the same day, Dorothy, his wife, began an action for loss of consortium resulting from the injury to her husband negligently caused by the defendant. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss William\u2019s action on the ground, among others, that his exclusive remedy was under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. RSA 281:12 (supp.). Defendant argues that having accepted benefits thereunder he may not maintain a common-law action. It moved to dismiss Dorothy\u2019s action because her \u201c cause of action is dependent upon her husband\u2019s cause of action and if that action is barred so is the plaintiff\u2019s.\u201d Both of these motions were granted and plaintiffs \u2019 exceptions thereto were reserved and transferred by <em>Dunfey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Under the provisions of RSA 281:12 (supp.), if William\u2019s injury was an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment he was conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of the law and \u201c to have waived his rights of action at common law to recover damages for personal injuries against his employer . ...\u201d If, however, his injury did not arise out of his employment, but rather from a cause unrelated thereto, he could maintain an action at law because his injury would be noncompensable. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Achber, </em>101 N.H. 7, 10, 131 A.2d 51, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Since William\u2019s injury occurred after July 15, 1959 when the employee\u2019s privilege to choose his form of relief for accidents arising in the course of his employment (Laws 1959, 187:4) was abolished, his receipt of compensation would not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>a bar, under the doctrine of election of remedies, to his common - law action as it did previously when a choice existed. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Company, </em>83 N.H. 221, 223, 140 A. 704, 706; <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Company, </em>86 N.H. 415, 170 A. 10, 11; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N.H. 520, 2 A.2d 448, 449. Defendant takes tire position, however, that tire agreement for compensation filed and approved under RSA 281:36 (supp.) is a bar on a theory of res adjudicata or preclusion of remedy. <em>Prassas </em>v. <em>Company, </em>100 N.H. 209, 123 A.2d 157, 158; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Company, </em>82 N.H. 221, 131 A. 688, 689; Vestal, Res Judicata/Preclusion 43. (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">If, after notice to the parties and a hearing at which \u201cfull consideration shall be given to all evidence\u201d <em>(see </em>RSA 281:37 ( supp.) ), the Labor Commissioner had determined that William\u2019s injury was compensable, this determination, in the absence of an appeal, would constitute a bar to his common-law action. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Deshone, </em>17 Mich. App. 556, 170 N.W.2d 172; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n., </em>104 Ariz. 548, 553, 456 P.2d 918, 923; 100 C.J.S. Workmen\u2019s Compensation 5. 657. However, where, as in this case, there has been no such determination of that issue in a proceeding approximating the decisional process of courts, the plaintiff is not precluded from maintaining a common-law action if his injury is in fact noncompensable. 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise <em>ss. </em>18.01-.06; Vestal, Res Judicata/Preclusion 224 (1969 ). <em>See Newell </em>v. <em>Moreau, </em>94 N.H. 439, 441, 442, 55 A.2d 476, 478, 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">On defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss William\u2019s action at law, the allegations in his pleadings must be taken to be true and construed most favorably to him. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Beauregard &amp; Sons, </em>105 N.H. 330, 339, 200 A.2d 14, 15. The only count in his declaration alleges in part that his injury did not result from a risk to which his employment subjected him; that it resulted from a cause unrelated to any act by him in the course of his employment; and that it was the result of a purely personal matter unrelated to his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">The law is well established that \u201c if the assault arose from a personal quarrel unrelated to the employment or its environment, the resulting injury did not arise out of the employment. \u201d Horovitz, Workmen\u2019s Compensation: Half Century of Judicial Developments, 41 Neb. L. Rev. 1, 22. \u201cIf the friction and strain arises not because of the enforced contacts resulting from the duties of the employment, but rather' because the two employees, who met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>each other on the job, choose to enter a purely private relationship just as they might if they had elsewhere\u201d and quarrels develop they do not arise out of the employment. 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law <em>s. </em>11.22. To be compensable the injury received in a quarrel must result from \u201cthe conditions and obligations of the employment \u201d and not merely from \u201c the bare existence of the employment. \u201d <em>Id.; Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Achber, </em>101 N.H. 7, 9, 131 A.2d 51, 53; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>J. Lichtman &amp; Sons, </em>42 N.J. 81, 199 A.2d 241; <em>see Newell </em>v. <em>Moreau, </em>94 N.H. 439, 445, 55 A.2d 476, 479; <em>In re Tripp\u2019s Case, </em>246 N.E.2d 449 (Mass. 1969); 99 C.J.S. Workmen\u2019s Compensations. 226. Consequently the above allegations in plaintiff\u2019s action would tend to establish that his injuries resulted from the negligence of the defendant under circumstances which do not make them compen - sable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Achber supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">However, plaintiff\u2019s declaration, like any other document, must be construed as an entirety. <em>Steinberg </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>95 N.H. 461, 462, 65 A.2d 874, 875; 71 C.J.S. Pleading s. 53, at 120. Despite his allegations that his injury was noncompensable and to establish his common-law action, plaintiff makes the following additional allegations in his declaration: The defendant employer had known for about six months that the co - worker who assaulted plaintiff \u201c sought and intended to inflict \u201d this injury on him; the employer owed plaintiff the duty to take all reasonable precautions to avoid that occurrence and failed to take affirmative action to insure the safety of the plaintiff; and, on the contrary, with knowledge of this employee\u2019s evil and malicious intent required them to continue to work together in the same area of the plant which resulted \u201cin the wilful and malicious injury upon the plaintiff\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We hold that construing plaintiff\u2019s declaration as a whole most favorably to him it \u201c admits of only one conclusion \u201d ( <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Achber, </em>101 N.H. 7, 10, 131 A.2d 51, 53 ), that is, that his injury resulted from \u201cthe conditions and obligations of the employment\u201d. 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law s'. 11.12. In other words, plaintiff\u2019s declaration established as a matter of law that his injury resulted from the employer\u2019s negligent supervision of his employees and was an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment and compensable under RSA ch. 281. <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Moreau, </em>94 N.H. 439, 441, 55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>A.2d 476, 479. Plaintiff, being conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (RSA 281:12 (supp.) ), cannot maintain an action at common law against his employer for his injury. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Achber supra. </em>The trial court properly granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s action at law and his exception thereto is over - ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We consider next the dismissal of the action of William\u2019s wife, Dorothy, for her loss of consortium. \u201c \u2018 Consortium, \u2019as a general description, represents reciprocal rights inherent in the marital relationship of husband and wife, including such undefined elements as comfort, companionship, and commitment to the needs of each other.\u201d <em>Thill </em>v. <em>Modern Erecting Co., </em>170 N.W.2d 865, 867-68 (Minn. 1969 ). It \u201c embraces love, companionship, affection, society, sexual relations, services <em>s\u00f3ls,ct.\u201d Moran v. Quality Aluminum Casting Co., </em>34 Wis. 2d 542, 150 N.W.2d 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Prior to 1950, no court, except one, had held that the wife had a cause of action for loss of consortium due to negligent injury to her husband. Restatement, Second, Torts, 5. 695, Note at 18 (Tent. Draft No. 14, April 15, 1969). The reasons given for denying such an action are numerous and varied and can be found in Restatement, Second, Torts <em>supra, </em>Arguments at 14-16; 44 Notre Dame L. 264, 265-67 (1968 ): Annot, 23 A.L.R.2d 1378, 1380, 1391-395. \u201c Since tire decision of <em>Hitaffer v. Argonne Co., </em>183 F.2d 811 (D.C. Cir. 1950) much has been written by courts and commentators concerning the right of a wife to recover for loss of consortium ...\u201d <em>Snodgrass </em>v. <em>Cherry-Burrell Co., </em>103 N.H. 56, 164 A.2d 579. This court in refusing to recognize such a right of action in that case gave, among other reasons, the absence of a statutory grant thereof, an attitude taken by many courts. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Schafter, 161 </em>Me. 340, 211 A.2d 891; Prosser, Torts 5. 119, at 918 (3d ed. 1964); 18 Buffalo L. Rev. 615,619(1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">However, our legislature subsequently (Laws 1967, Ch. 218, now RSA 507:8-a) adopted the following statute: \u201cLoss of Consortium. In a proper action, either a wife or husband is entitled to recover damages for loss or impairment of right of consortium whether caused intentionally or by negligent interference. \u201d This court held in <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Seybolt Motors, </em>109 N.H. 501, 502, 256 A.2d 151, 152 that \u201c [t]he statute did not give the wife merely a new remedy to an existing right but gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>her a new cause of action previously denied \u201d and refused to apply it retroactively. No such problem exists in this case as William\u2019s injury occurred after August 21, 1967, the effective date of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">Relying principally on <em>Courage </em>v. <em>Carleton, </em>96 N.H. 348, 77 A.2d 111, defendant takes the position that Dorothy\u2019s action is derivative and is subject to the same defenses available in the suit of her husband; mainly his acceptance of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law barring her common-law action as well as his. In the <em>Courage </em>case, the father was seeking to recover in an action at common law for the loss of services and medical and hospital expenses resulting from a compensable injury to his minor son. The dismissal of his action was specifically based on the ground that die father\u2019s action was \u201cmerely for \u2018consequential damages\u2019 . . . and \u2018not [for] an independent injury\u2019 \u201d and was barred because die son had lost his right of action at common law under the compensation act. <em>Courage </em>v. <em>Carleton, supra </em>at 350, 77 A.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Contrarily, the right of action for loss or impairment of consortium granted to the wife (as well as to the husband) is a separate and distinct right from that of her husband to recover for her separate and distinct loss of consortium which results to her from the negligent injury to her husband. <em>Kotsiris </em>v. <em>Ling, </em>451 S.W.2d 411, 412 (Ky. 1970); <em>Millington </em>v. <em>Southeastern Elevator Co., </em>22 N.Y.2d 498, 503, 239 N.E.2d 897, 899; <em>Novak </em>v. <em>City Transit, Inc., </em>365 S.W.2d 539, 544 (Mo. 1963); 13 Vill. L. Rev. 418, 422 (1968); Restatement, Second, Torts 5. 695 (Tent. Draft No. 14, April 15, 1969, adopted 46 A.L.I. Proceedings 157 (1969 ) ).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The fact that die allegedly negligent injury to die husband which is die basis of the wife\u2019s action is compensable under RSA ch. 281, is not a bar to her action. Section 12 diereof provides in part that \u201c[a]n employee of an employer subject to diis chapter shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions hereof and to have waived <em>his </em>rights of action at common law to recover damages for personal injuries against his employer ....\u201d( Emphasis added). This waiver of the husband is not a bar to his wife\u2019s action because unlike many compensation statutes which specifically exclude actions by a spouse, parents, dependents and next-of-kin, ours contains a very simple and limited waiver of the husband\u2019s own common-law rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law <em>s. </em>66.10. We hold therefore that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Dorothy\u2019s action was erroneously granted. <em>Kotsiris </em>v. <em>Ling, </em>451 S.W.2d 411, 412 (Ky. 1970); <em>Sheperd </em>v. <em>Consumers Cooperative Ass'n, </em>384 S.W.2d 635, 640 (Mo. 1964); <em>Danek </em>v. <em>Hommer, </em>9 N.J. 56, 62, 87 A.2d 5, 8 <em>(dissent </em>Vanderbilt). <em>See Baldwin v.
