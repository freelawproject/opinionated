Laws 1969, 421:1, which became effective on August 31, 1969 (Laws 1969, 421:3 ), inserted RSA ch. 318-B and repealed RSA ch. 318-A, but provided \u201cthat no offense committed and no penalty . . . incurred . . . before the time when such repeal shall take effect shall be affected by the repeal except that when any punishment . . . shall be mitigated by the provisions of RSA 318-B . . . such provisions may be extended and applied to any sentences under chapter 318-A pronounced after such repeal. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">The penalty provided by RSA ch. 318-B for possession of marijuana made the crime a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">The defendant contends that because the crime of possession had been reduced to a misdemeanor prior to his indictment by reducing the maximum sentence to one year so that the Portsmouth District Court has original jurisdiction, the Superior Court is without jurisdiction to try him and moved to dismiss the indictment. This motion was denied and the defendant\u2019s exception was transferred by <em>Perkins, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">We agree with the Trial Court and overrule the defendant\u2019s exception. RSA 502-A: 11 provides that \u201cEach district court shall have . . . original jurisdiction subject to appeal of all crimes and offenses committed within the confines of the district in which such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>court is located which are punishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.\u201d However, RSA 592-A:l (supp) provides that the Superior Court \u201chas jurisdiction of all criminal cases and proceedings; but it may dismiss a prosecution originally begun therein which is within the jurisdiction of a municipal [district] court. \u201d <em>See </em>RSA,502-A:34 which vested district courts with the jurisdiction of municipal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Thus although district courts have original jurisdiction over misdemeanors, that jurisdiction is not exclusive. The Legislature in RSA 502 - A: 14 (supp ) by the use of the words \u201c original and exclusive jurisdiction \u201d in relation to certain civil causes has shown that its use of the word \u201c original \u201d alone is insufficient to create exclusive jurisdiction. It has left the Superior Court with concurrent but discretionary jurisdiction with the district and municipal courts over misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
