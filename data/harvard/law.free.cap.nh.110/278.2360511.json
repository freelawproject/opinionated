All exceptions taken during the trial to rulings of the court and to its denial of a motion to set aside the verdict were transferred by <em>Davis, </em>District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">The court made findings of fact and rulings of law which ap - pear in the reserved case, but no transcript of the evidence or any exhibits were transferred. In this situation, no question is before us as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict ( <em>Gobbi </em>v. Moulton, 108 N.H. 183, 230 A.2d 747), and we are limited to the consideration of errors apparent on the face of the record. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>100 N.H. 473, 130 A.2d 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">The court\u2019s findings of fact sustain its conclusions that die plaintiff, acting as agent for the defendant, widi an agreed percentage of the sale price as his commission, produced a customer able and willing to buy upon the defendant\u2019s terms. This entitled the plaintiff to recover. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>101 N.H. 377, 379, 143 A.2d 414, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>An examination of the transferred case discloses no errors, and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
