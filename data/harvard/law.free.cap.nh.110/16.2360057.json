S. #1) in the general area opposite the Lafayette Plaza Shopping Center containing about 4 acres. It is about 5 feet below the level of the highway and is a \u201cmarshy area\u201d \u201csusceptible to tides\u201d having no value in its present state but, if filled, will become valuable commercial property. The Fish and Game Department opposed this petition because \u201cthis area is <em>salt marsh </em>and as such is a necessary and vital part of our marine ecological complex.\u201d A marine biologist testified that in 1954 there were a few clams in this area but they have disappeared and no others have taken their place. \u201cWhether any worthy sea life can exist on a narrow creek above a municipal dump is quite dubious.\u201d The Authority, in denying plaintiff\u2019s petition, made the same statement, that it made in denying the Sibson petition <em>(Sibson </em>v. <em>State, </em>110 N. H. 8), relative to the Authority being bound by the restrictive powers of the Director of the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. A motion for rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">This case is governed by the law of <em>Sibson </em>v. <em>State, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>We concur in the position taken by the parties that plaintiff\u2019s land does not come within the provisions of RSA ch. 483-A as construed in the <em>Sibson </em>case. Consequently the orders made by the Port Authority relating to the land of plaintiff, Pic-N-Pay, are null and void for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\n<em>Appeal sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-5\">Grimes, J., concurred in the result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
