The town bases its authority to enact this ordinance on RSA 31:41 which reads, in part, as follows: \u201c Open-Air Motion Picture Theatres. Towns shall have the power to make by-laws relating to the regulation and licensing of open-air motion picture theatres within the limits of the town, and may fix reasonable fees for the operation of said theatres, and may enforce the observance of such by-laws by suitable penalties not exceeding twenty-five dollars for each offense . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u201c[Tjhere is a sharp distinction between a municipal license for revenue and one for regulation under police power: the first named is a tax and is to be construed under the principles and rules governing taxing powers, while the latter is under the police power, looking toward the health, morals, safety, or general welfare of the community. \u201d 38 Am. Jur. Municipal Corporations 5. 321. The touchstone as to whether a statute grants towns power to tax or raise revenue or merely a police power to regulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>is the intent of the legislature. <em>Coltin Company </em>v. <em>Manchester Savings Bank, </em>105 N.H. 254, 256, 197 A.2d 208, 210. \u201c It is a well settled rule that no tax can be assessed in the absence of a manifest declaration of intent of the Legislature to impose it. \u201d <em>Frizzell </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>107 N.H. 286, 288, 220 A.2d 742, 744. The following words of the statute \u201c regulation licensing \u201d \u201cfix reasonable fees\u201d \u201cenforce the observance of such by-laws by suitable penalties \u201d conclusively demonstrate that, in enacting RSA 31:41, die legislature intended to grant towns merely a police power to regulate and license open-air motion picture theatres in the interest of the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">License and permit fees will be sustained so long as they reason - ably cover the regulatory expenses to the town and are not grossly disproportionate thereto. <em>Marine Corps League </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>96 N.H. 423, 427, 78 A.2d 513, 516; 3 Antieau, Municipal Corporation Law <em>s. </em>24.10. A rating of \u201cX\u201d by the Motion Picture Code and Rating Administration indicates that the particular picture should be viewed only by persons 18 years of age and older. Such pictures can reasonably be found to require different regulation as well as closer and more extensive police supervision than pictures classified as suitable for general viewing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Towns must be given reasonable latitude in fixing charges to cover anticipated expenses in the enforcement of the ordinance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>91 N.H. 137, 144, 16 A.2d 508, 513, 312 U.S. 569, 85 L. Ed. 1049, 61 S. Ct. 762; <em>Marine Corps League </em>v. <em>Benoit, supra. </em>The fact that the fee charged produces some incidental revenue does not render it unreasonable or the ordinance invalid. <em>Laconia </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>107 N.H. 209, 211, 219 A.2d 701, 703. However, the power to regulate does not embrace the power to prohibit in the guise of a confiscatory fee. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Town of Irvington, </em>20 N.J. 432; <em>Central States Theatre Corporation </em>v. <em>Sar, </em>66 N.W.2d 450 (Iowa 1954). In determining the appropriateness of the fee a town must consider not only its costs to enforce the ordinance but also the proportionate share left to the business regulated after the fee is paid. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Town of Irvington, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">It is agreed by the parties that the plaintiff as the operator of an open-air motion picture theatre is required to pay to the town an annual license fee of $ 300. Plaintiff has also made an offer of proof that \u201c The average weekday gross income at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>theater is less than $500 per day. On weekends the theater\u2019s gross is less than $ 1000. \u201d The $500 fee imposed for each showing under the ordinance would thus exceed \u201cthe average weekday gross income \u201d. The town has not proved or offered to prove the cost of administering and enforcing the regulatory ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We are familiar with the oft enunciated rules that the presump - tions favor the validity of ordinances adopted in the exercise of the police power, whether under RSA 31:39, 41 or otherwise, and that die burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the regulation is on the plaintiff in this case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>107 N.H. 1, 3, 216 A.2d 790, 791. However, we cannot escape the conclusion, on the record before us, drat the fee of $500 set by this ordinance for each showing of a picture rated \u201cX\u201d bears no reasonable relationship to the cost of administering and enforcing the ordinance and is dierefore confiscatory and renders the ordinance in its present form invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In view of the result reached we see no need to consider other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b338-7\">Grimes, J., concurred in the result; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
