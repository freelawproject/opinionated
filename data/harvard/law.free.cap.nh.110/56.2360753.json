The action was heard by a master (Leonard C. Hardwick, Esq.). The Master\u2019s report recommended the establishment of a line 12 feet east of the defendant\u2019s building. Subject to the defendant\u2019s exceptions, the Master\u2019s report was approved and a decree entered in accordance therewith by order of the Superior Court <em>{Leahy, </em>C. J.) under date of June 11, 1968. The defendant seasonably excepted to the denial of certain requests for findings and rulings, to certain findings and rulings made by the Master, and to the denial of his motion to set aside the decree of the Superior Court. All questions of law presented by the defendant\u2019s exceptions were reserved and transferred by <em>Bownes, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The defendant Brown operates a iobster pound and restaurant which is situated on the northerly side of South Main Street just east of the Blackwater River. The dispute between the parties was precipitated when Brown undertook to expand his parking lot by filling in marsh land which the plaintiff Ross claims to own easterly of the lobster pound. As stated by the Master: \u201cThe plaintiff claims that the [boundary] line lies eleven or twelve feet easterly of the easterly sideline of building presently situate on the defendant\u2019s property .... The defendant claims that the line is marked by a creek and ditch some four hundred feet easterly of the line claimed by the plaintiff. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The plaintiff Ross claims under a deed from Alfred and Harvey Nutting dated February 25, 1954. The defendant Brown\u2019s claim is based upon a deed of the town of Seabrook dated March 4, 1950 and a quitclaim deed of the heirs of Charles 0. Ackerman dated October 18, 1959. Both deeds to the defendant describe the property conveyed as bounded on the west by the river, on the south by South Main Street, and on the east by land now or formerly of Alfred and Harvey Nutting. The deed from the town contained the following recital: \u201cThe frontage on South Main Street has been described in prior deeds as two hundred (200) feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The deed from the Nuttings to the plaintiff Ross dated February 25, 1954 bounded the conveyed premises on the west by land of the defendant Brown and \u201cSoutherly by South Main Street about eleven hundred eighty (1,180) feet, this distance being approximate, the Westerly terminus being approximately two hundred ( 200) feet Easterly of the Northerly abutment of the bridge of Blackwater River.\u201d The southerly terminus of the easterly boundary, which was Ocean Boulevard, was described as \u201cthe point where Ocean Boulevard intersects the Northerly side of South Main Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Master adopted the testimony of an engineer called as a witness by the plaintiff who fixed the dividing line between the lands of the parties at a point some 12 feet east of the defendant\u2019s building. The Master found and ruled \u201cthat the boundary line between the land of the [ parties ] is the line indicated on Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit #1 as running N 10\u00b0 08' 30\" E for a distance of 128.34 feet.\u201d The method by which the plaintiff\u2019s expert established the division line between land of the parties is summarized by the Master\u2019s report as follows: \u201cThat portion of the plaintiff\u2019s property which lies adjacent to land of the defendant and is northerly of the highway was carved out of the lot conveyed in the Fraser-Nutting deed. Both the defendant\u2019s expert and the expert called by the plaintiff agreed that that portion of the property lying southerly of the highway could not be laid out on the ground from the deed description, and the plaintiff\u2019s expert disregarded that portion of the description. The description in this conveyance began: \u2018Beginning at the northeasterly corner thereof at a stone bound at the corner of marsh land of said Nutting and marsh of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u2019 There was no evidence that showed a stone bound is presently locatable. However, the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>expert was able to locate this point by referring to the deed of George D. Paul to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New Hampshire (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 2B ) and the sketch that was attached to the conveyance (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 2A).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u201cThe Master finds that the point thus determined by plaintiff\u2019s expert was in fact the point of beginning in the Fraser-Nutting deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u201cThe final bound in the Fraser-Nutting deed fixes the northerly boundary of the premises therein conveyed, such bound being the present northerly bound of plaintiff\u2019s land. The course is described as follows: \u2018Thence southeasterly by marsh of said Smith and by land of Nutting about 690 feet to place of beginning.\u2019 The engineer needed only to measure back on a northwesterly course 690 feet and he would thus locate the northwesterly corner of plaintiff\u2019s lot. The problem would, of course, arise as to the actual course of this line, as \u2018southeasterly\u2019 as used in the Fraser-Nutting deed is not specific as to course. In order to assist him, the engineer had the benefit of a plan of Seabrook Beach prepared by one Titcomb in 1925 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit #7). While this plan was prepared primarily for the purpose of laying out lots in the beach area and not within the area herein involved, it did indicate a line similar to that arrived at by the plaintiff\u2019s expert for the purpose of marking the northerly boundary of plaintiff\u2019s property. It is worthy of note that on the plan of the defendant\u2019s expert the course of the line marking the northerly boundary of plaintiff\u2019s property falls in the same general area as determined by the plaintiff\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u201cThe Master finds that the point located by plaintiff\u2019s expert on his proposed plan (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit #1 ) marks the northwesterly corner of plaintiff\u2019s premises at a point where it intersects with the easterly sideline of the defendant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u201cWith this point determined, it is only necessary to determine the course that the line runs from this point in a southwesterly direction to the highway. The Fraser-Nutting deed describes this line in reverse: \u2018Thence northeasterly by marsh of said Smith about 150 feet to a corner.\u2019 The plaintiff\u2019s engineer again referred back to the Titcomb plan for this course and determined that the line ran south 10\u00b0 08' 30\" west for a distance of 128.34 feet to the highway. While the Fraser-Nutting deed sets forth that this line is 150 feet in length, a certain portion of the premises had been taken by the State for highway purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u201cThe Master finds and rules that the boundary line between the land of the plaintiff and that of the defendant is the line indicated on Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit #1 as running N 10\u00b0 08' 30\" E for a distance of 128.34 feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">As previously indicated herein, the southerly terminus of the line which the Master found to be the common boundary is situated 11 or 12 feet easterly of the easterly sideline of the defendant\u2019s building. As shown on the plan under date of September 1966, which is Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit <em>\u00a7 </em>1, this point is approximately 131 or 132 feet from the east bank of the Black-water River measured along the frontage on South Main Street. The Master accepted as the northerly boundary of the Ross land the boundary shown on but not identified by the Titcomb plan of 1925 which was used by the plaintiff\u2019s expert to determine the course of that line. Having thus determined the location of the defendant\u2019s northeast corner, the Master also accepted the judgment of the plaintiff\u2019s expert that the course of the dividing line between the parties was that shown by the Titcomb plan as N 10\u00b0 08' 30\" E. As a result, the southerly boundary of the Brown land as transposed by the plaintiff\u2019s expert from the Titcomb plan to his own plan (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit #1) shows the defendant\u2019s southwesterly corner to be some 61 feet out into the river. This, despite the fact that the Titcomb plan does not show the river, but does show a distance from the southeasterly corner of the land assumed to be the Brown land to Ocean Boulevard along the course of the highway as it then existed before widening, which scales to approximately 1,280 feet, or 100 feet more than the frontage of the Ross land on the highway as described in the deed from the Nuttings to Ross.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The defendant excepted to the following finding by the Master: \u201cMeasuring the two hundred feet from the Blackwater River, given in the deed [to the plaintiff] as the westerly boundary of the lot, would so place the easterly boundary as to exclude that part of the built-up parking lot now claimed by the defendant.\u201d The area of fill for the parking lot is indicated on Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit <em>$ </em>1; and as pointed out by the defendant a measurement of 200 feet from the easterly bank of the Blackwater River as shown thereon comes to a point approximately midway of the filled area or some 70 feet east of the point established by the Master as the defendant\u2019s southeast corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>We are of the opinion that the defendant\u2019s exception to the finding that measurement of 200 feet from the river would exclude the portion of the built-up parking lot claimed by the defendant must be sustained. The testimony of the defendant\u2019s engineer was that the easterly bank of the river had not changed materially over the years in question. The plan prepared by this witness (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit R ) purports to show the location of the abutment of the old bridge across the river, referred to in the deed from the Nuttings to the plaintiff Ross, which described the westerly terminus of his southerly line as \u201capproximately two hundred (200 ) feet Easterly of the Northerly abutment of the bridge of Blackwater River.\u201d As shown on Exhibit R this abutment is approximately in line with the easterly sideline of the river in its present course.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On the other hand the Master had before him the testimony of Harvey Nutting, one of the plaintiff\u2019s grantors, given at a previous trial of this case, that the east bank of the Blackwater River had \u201creceded toward the ocean\u201d so that the river \u201cis twice as wide as it was\u201d in the early 1900\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">It is plain from the context in which the finding appears that it relates to measurement from the river\u2019s edge as it existed in 1954 and later; and nowhere does the report disclose that the Master placed any reliance upon the testimony of Harvey Nutting quoted above. The finding excepted to must be considered erroneous. The extent to which it may have affected the Master\u2019s final conclusion as to the location of the common boundary line cannot be determined on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">On the present state of the record, the plaintiff cannot be held to have sustained his burden of proving that the southerly end of the common boundary is where the Master found it to be, approximately 137 feet from the river. This location conflicts with plain indications in the deeds under which both parties claim, that the southerly terminus of the line was 200 feet easterly of the river, and 1180 feet westerly of Ocean Boulevard. Accordingly the Master\u2019s finding as to the location of the division line is set aside, and the decree adopting the report is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, the Master denied his request for a ruling that the action is barred by the plaintiff\u2019s laches. The Master found that when the defendant commenced to build up the parking lot, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Nutting, had called the defendant\u2019s attention to where he believed the line to be; and that after the plaintiff acquired title in 1954, he notified the defendant that the fill was a trespass upon his property. According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, in 1954 the fill extended approximately halfway across the area finally covered, and thereafter was gradually extended. The plaintiff\u2019s action was commenced in 1962, and first tried in that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Master found and ruled that the plaintiff was not guilty of laches \u201cin view of the notice that the defendant had relative to possible question as to location of his easterly boundary line, plus the notice given to him by Nutting and the plaintiff of alleged trespass.\u201d We consider that this conclusion could properly be reached upon the record. See RSA 508:2. The defendant\u2019s exception to the ruling is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Other exceptions taken by the defendant fall short of disclosing reversible error and are also overruled. The case is remanded for reconsideration in the light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-7\">Lampron, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
