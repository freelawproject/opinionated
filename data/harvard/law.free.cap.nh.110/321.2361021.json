On that date the decedent Ellene A. Chakalos, age fifteen, was fatally injured when a motorcycle upon which she was a passenger left the road in Keene. The stipulation of the parties establishes that the operator of the motorcycle, a minor, was the owner and operator of an uninsured motor vehicle within the meaning of RSA 268:15 - a ( supp.). The liability provisions of the defendant\u2019s policy afforded coverage with respect to a 1966 Ford automobile owned by Ellene\u2019s father, which was in no way involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The questions of law presented by the pleadings, the stipulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of the parties, and the exhibits were reserved and transferred by <em>Morris, </em>J., without ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\">The policy issued by the defendant consists of four parts, the first of which is headed \u201cPart I - Liability, \u201d and the fourth of which bears the heading \u201cPart IV-Family Protection Coverage. \u201d Parts II and III which related to \u201c Expenses for Medical Services \u201d and \u201cPhysical Damage\u201d are not material here. The policy bears a \u201cStatutory Motor Vehicle Liability Policy Endorsement\u201d which provides in part that the policy \u201cis a Motor Vehicle Liability Policy \u201d as defined by statute, \u201c and all policy provisions required . . . are hereby expressly incorporated in the policy by reference. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Part I of the policy provided the coverage against liability to others required by RSA 268:15 (supp). By this part of the policy the decedent was expressly made an insured \u201c with respect to the owned automobile, \u201d belonging to her father, since she was at the time of her injury a \u201cresident of the same household. \u201d As to a \u201cnon-owned automobile,\u201d however, the policy provided drat she was an insured \u201c only with respect to a private passenger automobile or trailer, \u201d which under a definition applicable to this part of the policy did not include a motorcycle, because not a \u201cfour-wheel . . . automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The defendant concedes that under Part IV of the policy, the decedent was an insured. By this part of the policy, the defendant undertook to pay all sums which the insured would be \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury . . . arising out of . . . use of such uninsured automobile . . . \u201d; and for purposes of this part of the policy, an \u201c insured \u201d was defined to include \u201c any relative \u201d of the named insured. While the definition of an \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d in Part IV of the policy differed from the definition of an insured \u201c automobile \u201d under Part I, the differences are not decisive of the issues transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We hold that the defendant is required, by the provisions of RSA ch. 268 to respond in damages to die plaintiff\u2019s claim. The controlling statutory provision in effect at the time of the accident was Laws of 1967, 284:2, effective August 26, 1967. This statute inserted a new section, RSA 268:15 - a, which provided in sub - section I in part as follows: \u201cNo policy shall be issued or delivered in this state, under the provisions of section 15, with respect to a motor vehicle . . . registered in this state unless cover - age is provided <em>therein </em>... in amounts . . . prescribed for bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter, . . . for die protection of <em>persons insured thereunder </em>who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles . . . because of bodily injury, . . . including death resulting therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See </em>RSA 268:15-a (supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Section 15, (RSA 268:15 ) as amended by the same 1967 statute prohibited the issue of a motor vehicle policy \u201c as defined in section 1 \u201d unless it contained \u201c an agreement that insurance is provided in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Laws 1967, 284:1. Section 1 (RSA 268:1) contained the definition of a \u201c Motor Vehicle Liability Policy \u201d in the same form in which it now appears in RSA 268:1 (VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Thus the defendant was required by section 15-a, (Laws 1967, 284:2 ), to furnish uninsured motorist coverage to any person insured under a policy issued under the provisions of section 15 of the act. Since the defendant\u2019s policy was issued under section 15, and since the decedent by the terms of Parts I and IV of the policy, was a person insured under the \u201c policy . . . issued . . . . under the provisions of secfion 15,\u201d the plaintiff is entitled to the protection sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary is based upon the hypotheses that the decedent was not an insured under the liability provisions of Part I of the policy, and that the requirements of the 1967 amendment relate only to a person insured under a liability policy, so that the decedent was not entitled to the protection required by the 1967 amendment even though she was an insured under Part IV of the policy. This argument cannot be accepted, first, because we find that the decedent was an insured under Part I of the policy by its express terms; and second, because we consider that the word \u201c thereunder \u201d in the statutory phrase \u201c for the protection of persons insured thereunder, \u201d like the word \u201c therein \u201d which precedes it, refers back to tire subject of the sentence, namely the \u201c policy, \u201d rather than to the words \u201cliability policy under this chapter,\u201d used merely in specifying the limits of coverage to be provided. RSA 268:15-a (supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In view of our interpretation of the statute, it is unnecessary to determine whether a motorcycle is an \u201c uninsured automobile \u201d as defined by Part IV of the defendant\u2019s policy. The statute required the defendant to furnish uninsured motorist coverage against bodily injury and death arising out of the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cuninsured motor vehicles\u201d (RSA 268:15-a (supp.) and the statutory definition of \u201c motor vehicle \u201d included a motorcycle.
