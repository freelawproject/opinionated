Jackson for workmen\u2019s compensation for a heart attack occurring on December 28, 1967. After trial, the court found that Jackson \u201c suffered an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of lois employment\u201d and awarded compensation benefits. Defendant\u2019s exceptions were transferred by <em>Morris, J.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">Plaintiff, age 43, was employed by the defendant as a carpenter, a vocation at which he had worked for most of his working life. He did not work on December 20, 21 and 22 and over Christmas, a Monday. He felt that he had a cold. He worked on December 26 and 27 although he thought he still had a cold. He had experienced pains in his chest beginning December 25 or 26. When he came to work about 6:30 a.m. on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>28, he told his boss that he felt badly and might not make it through the day. He testified that at about 9:30, while standing on a sawhorse and using a hammer to install a header for a door frame, he \u201c got these terrific pains like nothing I ever had before . . . through my chest and arms, and they just intensified to the point I just don\u2019t know what happened. \u201d He told his boss he thought he would have to go to the doctor and went to tire Keene Clinic where he was seen by Dr. Gregory who made a diagnosis of a questionable coronary occlusion and told him to go to the hospital. The plaintiff, however, took his truck home first and was then driven to the hospital where he had a cardiac arrest in the corridor but was saved from death by artificial respiration applied by a nurse. He spent nineteen days in the hospital. Since there was no evidence of any \u201c unusual strain, \u201d the defendant contends that the plaintiff\u2019s heart attack cannot be found to have been an \u201c accidental injury . . . arising out of and in the course of the employment \u201d (RSA 281:2 (III) ) placing reliance on such cases as <em>Guay </em>v. <em>Brown Co., </em>83 N.H. 392, 142 A. 697; <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>85 N.H. 398, 159 A. 297; and <em>Blecatsis </em>v. <em>Manchester Gas Co., </em>103 N.H. 542, 176 A.2d 711. However, the principles laid down in those cases do not bar recovery on the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In <em>Guay </em>v. <em>Brown Co., supra, </em>the statute then in effect was construed to require that the injury be \u201cby accident\u201d although those words were omitted from the statute. The court held, however, that the statute provided for compensation when the results were so unexpected as to be considered accidental and that it included all nonoccupational disease cases \u201c\u2018although not preceded by traumatic causes provided it is clearly shown that the disease arose out of and in the course of the employment and was unusual, undesigned, unexpected and sudden\u2019 Brodin\u2019s Case, 124 Me. <em>162.\u201d Id. </em>395.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Proctor, supra, </em>the principles of the <em>Guay </em>case were confirmed but recovery for a heart attack while at work was denied because the evidence did not support the hypothesis that there had been a strain upon which the medical testimony as to cause was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In <em>Blecatsis </em>v. <em>Manchester Gas Co., supra, </em>recovery was denied, not because there was no evidence of unusual strain, but because there was no medical evidence upon which to base a finding that the heart attack \u201c arose out of and in the course of his work. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>None of these cases establishes the principle that as a matter of law there must be evidence of an \u201cunusual strain \u201d before compensation can be granted for a heart attack suffered while at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Hagianis, 97 </em>N.H. 314, 87 A.2d 154, it was said that an accident may consist of an unexpected effect as well as an unexpected cause. \u201c Sudden or acute manifestation of disease may be an accident, even though its causation is gradual. \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 317. Thus pre-existing pain does not bar a finding oi accidental injury when the pain on the day in question became so intolerable as to be disabling. <em>See also Kacavisti </em>v. <em>Sprague Electric Co., </em>102 N.H. 266, 155 A.2d 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">It is not necessary, therefore, that there be evidence of \u201c unusual strain \u201d in order that a heart attack or other injury be found to have been accidental because this requirement of the statute need not be supplied by cause but may be fulfilled by effect. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Hagianis, supra. </em>\u201cUnusual strain\u201d would be a requirement, not as a matter of law, but as a matter of fact, only if it were made so by the medical testimony. <em>See Eaton </em>v. <em>Proctor, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In the case before us, plaintiffs attending physician testified that in his opinion the heart attack \u201c. . . was precipitated by the work he was doing. \u201d By this, he said, he meant it aggravated a pre-existing condition. He testified that in his opinion, based on reasonable medical certainty, plaintiff would not have had the attack if he had not been working. Although there was medical testimony to tire contrary, the resolution of this conflict was for the trial court, and his finding was supported by the evidence. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Hagianis, supra. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s doctor\u2019s opinion did not rest upon any finding of unusual strain, and the law requires none. The fact that the plaintiff had a pre-existing condition of arteriosclerosis and was showing signs of coronary insufficiency and impending heart attack which he would have had sometime, in any event, does not, in view of the findings made, foreclose an award of compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s contention that there was no competent medical evidence to support the court\u2019s findings. Plaintiff\u2019s physician, although a general practitioner and not a cardiologist, was nevertheless qualified to give his opinion <em>(Ricker </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>94 N.H. 313, 53 A.2d 196; <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>102 N.H. 84, 151 A.2d 230) and the fact that his testimony did not establish a causal relationship between plaintiff\u2019s work and his heart attack with absolute certainty and contained some cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>for doubt does not as a matter of law remove it from the court\u2019s consideration. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Hagianis, supra; Pepin </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, supra </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-6\">Kenison, C.

The problem is more acute in cardiac cases because cardiovascular diseases account for more than 54% of deaths from all causes and more than 27 million are living with some form of cardiovascular illness. American Heart Association, Heart Facts 4-5 (P.R.-33 (1970 ) ). The relationship of strain on the heart was considered by a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Paul Dudley White which concluded that it found \u201c... no method, either clinical or pathological, of determining the causative relationship between any given event and typical coronary thrombosis with infarct. \u201d Report of the Committee on the Effect of Strain and Trauma on the Heart and Great Vessels, 26 Circulation 612, 617 (1962). As a practical matter this means that industry will pay for \u201c... the cost of a substantial number of heart attacks whose connection with work is probably coincidental rather than causal. \u201d Thornton, Heart Attacks and Workmen\u2019s Compensation-A General View, 1968 Proc. ABA Sect, of Insurance, Negligence, and Compensation Law 276, 284; Wilentz, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Problems: Causal Relationship in Cardiac Deaths, 14 J. of Forensic Sciences 302 (1969 ).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">It is important that the employee receive protection from heart attacks in industry but it is equally important that in the process we do not unduly discourage the employability of known cardiacs. \u201c The acceptance of a heart claim as industrial may assist one individual by the receipt of a medical and monetary award and, at die same time, erect a barrier to employment for many others with discernible heart conditions. \u201d Bell, The Heart and Workmen\u2019s Compensation, 1968 Proc. ABA Sect, of Insurance, Negligence, and Compensation Law, 271, 274. As claims in cardiac cases by employees increase, the waiver of workmen\u2019s compensation ( RSA 281:12-a) may be a more constant requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>by the employer and the net gain becomes questionable.

Rev. 214,233(1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The problem is difficult as it is important but it is one that deserves the continuing consideration and study of those interested in workmen\u2019s compensation and related benefits and warrants the brief outline statement included herein.
