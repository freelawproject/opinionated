You state that the \u201ceconomic impact of this income tax on such a large number of New Hampshire citizens is a matter of public importance, substantially affecting the welfare of this State\u201d and ask whether you may require an opinion from the Attorney General under RSA 7:8 which requires him to advise state agents and officers in the performance of their official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">RSA 7:9 provides that: \u201cThe governor and council may, in any action or proceeding, wherever pending, represent to the attorney - general that he should appear to protect the interests of the state or of the people, and thereupon it shall be his duty to appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Under the provisions of this section you are entitled to an opinion from the Attorney General to assist you in determining what action if any should be taken in the event that proceedings are or should be instituted.

While the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>has sole responsibility of formulating his legal opinion, any action which you may determine to take for the protection of \u201cthe interests of the state or of the people\u201d will not be concluded by his opinion.
