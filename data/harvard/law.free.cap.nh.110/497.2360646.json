The builder thereof has recovered against the city a judgment of $3,926 plus interest and costs in an action for failure to obtain and include such minimum wage rates in its advertisement for bids on the projects in question in accordance with the requirements of RSA 280:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s action on the ground that it is based on a loss allegedly caused by the negligent conduct of Pingree which is not insured under defendant\u2019s bond. Plaintiff\u2019s exception to the granting of this motion was reserved and transferred by Flynn., J.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Meanwhile plaintiff instituted a new suit against the defendant with a declaration substantially identical to that in the previous action except that it specifically characterized Pingree\u2019s conduct which caused the loss as a \u201c breach of faithful performance. \u201d Defendant moved that this action be abated as a second suit for the same cause of action and that it be dismissed on the ground stated in its previous motion to dismiss as well as on other grounds. Plaintiff excepted to the granting of this motion and its exception was reserved and transferred. However the latter exception was neither briefed nor argued by the plaintiff and is considered waived. <em>Bartis </em>v. <em>Bartis, </em>107 N.H. 34, 37, 216 A.2d 784, 786 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The main issue to be decided is whether if the declaration in plaintiff\u2019s first action seeks to recover for a loss resulting from the negligent conduct of its employee Pingree in the discharge of his official duties it states a cause of action against the defendant who insured the city under its bond for loss caused by Pingree\u2019s failure \u201cto perform faithfully his duties. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">RSA 280:1 provides that the rate per hour of the wages paid to certain specified persons employed in the construction of public works by a city \u201c shall not be less than the rates of wages to be determined by the labor commissioner. \u201d RSA 280:2 requires that \u201c[a]t least ten days before asking for bids the authorized officials or agency prescribing specifications shall request the labor commissioner to determine the minimum wage rates as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>provided in section 1. \u201d It also provides that in advertising for bids \u201cdie awarding official, or public body, shall incorporate said schedule in the advertisement or call for bids ...\u201d which schedule shall be made a part of the contract. RSA 280:4 provides that \u201c[w]hoever shall willfully pay less dian said rates . . . shall forfeit to the commissioner a sum equal to twice the difference between the determined rates and the wages actually paid to said employees. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">It is clear diat this statute imposed a positive duty on an official of the city of Concord to obtain a schedule of such minimum wage rates and to incorporate it in the advertisement for bids on public works and to make it a part of the construction contract. <em>Union School District </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019r of </em>Labor, 103 N.H. 512, 515, 176 A.2d 332, 335 (1961). Plaintiff\u2019s declaration alleges that a failure to comply with this statutory duty in two instances caused the losses for which it seeks recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s declaration also alleges that \u201c[t]he responsibility for obtaining wage rates and notifying the contractor and all other City officials was vested in die Personnel &amp; Purchasing Director, Mr. Thomas Pingree. \u201d In considering the propriety of granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the facts alleged in plaintiff\u2019s pleadings are to be considered as true and are to be construed most favorably to the plaintiff. <em>Cote </em>v. <em>Litawa, </em>96 N.H. 174, 175, 71 A.2d 792, 793 (1950). The statutory obligation imposed on the city by RSA ch. 280 and the allegation that the duty to comply devolved on Pingree by virtue of bis office become material factors in assessing Pingree\u2019s \u201cfaithful performance\u201d which defendant was insuring by its bond. 4 Mc-Quillin, Municipal Corporations <em>ss. </em>12.224, 12.224a (rev. vol. 1968); Rhyne, Municipal Law <em>s. </em>8-35, at 171, 172 (1957). <em>See Paisner </em>v. <em>Renaud, </em>102 N.H. 27, 29, 149 A.2d 867, 869 (1959); <em>Rivier College </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire Lns. Co., </em>104 N.H. 398, 401, 187 A.2d 799, 802 (1963 ); <em>Totowa </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>39 N.J. 332, 343, 188 A.2d 586, 592 (1963); <em>Cf. City of Lowell </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>232 Mass. 341, 342, 122 N.E. 412, 413 (1919 ). The rule which governs the interpretation of a contract of insurance prevails in this situation. <em>Insurance Company of North America </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>262 A.2d 489, 490 (Vt. 1969); 28 Ins. Counsel J. 210 (1961). Therefore the defendant\u2019s obligation under its bond is to be determined not by what the insurer intended the clause to mean but by what a reasonable person in the position of the named insured would have understood it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>mean. <em>Standard &amp;c. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Swift, 92 </em>N.H. 364, 367, 31 A.2d 66, 68 (1943 ); <em>McCaffery </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire Ins. Co., </em>108 N.H. 373, 375, 236 A.2d 490, 492 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Defendant\u2019s bond entitled a \u201c Public Employees Blanket Bond \u201d can provide two types of coverage: (1) \u201c Plonesty \u201d which insures against loss sustained through any fraudulent or dishonest act committed by an employee; (2 ) \u201c Faithful performance \u201d which insures for loss sustained by the failure of an employee to perform faithfully his duties. The bond in question was of the latter category. \u201c The term \u2018 faithful performance \u2019 . . . goes further than honesty and implies that a person may be held responsible . . . even though he has been entirely honest in his conduct. \u201d F.C.&amp;S. Bulls., Public Employees Blanket Bonds, Po-2 (July 1958). It is to be noted that the bond in question is on a revised form of May 1958. Such a bond \u201cinvolves competence in the performance of specific duties, \u201d it covers \u201c acts of commission and acts of omission. \u201d \u201c This is broad coverage taking in acts of negligence, carelessness, incompetence.\u201d Samuel Komoroff, Public Employee Blanket Bonds, ABA Sect. Ins. N.&amp;C.L. 1968 Proceedings 148, 153-55; 4 A.B.A. The Forum 292 (1969); 37 Ore. L. Rev. 95, 114 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Public employees\u2019 faithful performance bonds are similar in coverage to faithful performance bonds for private business. F.C.&amp;S., <em>supra </em>at Po-1. Bank officers bonds conditioned upon the faithful discharge of their duties have been held to guarantee competency, efficiency and diligence in the discharge of duties. 10 Am. Jur. 2d Banks <em>s. </em>87 ( 1963 ). Such bonds may cover losses resulting from the negligence of the bonded employee. 35 Am. Jur. 2d Fidelity Bonds and Insurance 5. 21 (1967). The negligent discharge or nonperformance by a municipal employee of positive duties imposed upon him by law have been held to create liability on the surety insuring his faithful performance. Low<em>ell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass. 257, 47 N.E.2d 265 (1943); 4 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations 55. 12.208b, 12.224 (rev. vol. 1968). <em>See Sparta State Bank </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>202 Ind. 553, 177 N.E. 258 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Defendant relies on <em>Exeter Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>85 N.H. 458, 160 A. 733 (1932 ), in support of the action of the trial court granting its. motion to dismiss. There were two actions in that case, one on an \u201chonesty bond,\u201d the other on a \u201cfaithful performance bond. \u201d The headnote to the case, and the case cited in the opinion <em>(Follett </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>77 N.H. 457, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>459, 92 A. 956, 957 (1915) ), seem to indicate that the court\u2019s statement that the bond did not insure against loss caused by negligence was meant to apply to the honesty bond. As to that type of bond, it is in accordance with well established law that mere negligence does not constitute fraud or a violation of a bond insuring loss through fraudulent or dishonest acts. <em>Home Indemnity Company </em>v. <em>Reynolds &amp; Co., </em>38 Ill. App. 2d 358, 375, 187 N.E.2d 274, 282 (1963 ); 9 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice 5. 5667 (1943 ); 35 Am. Jur. 2d Fidelity Bonds and Insurance 5. 23 (1967 ). <em>See </em>Annot., 98 A.L.R. 1264, 1275-276 (1935 ) so construing the holding in <em>Exeter Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">If the court intended the statement relied on to apply to the faithful performance bond, we doubt that it represents the current law and we hold that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based thereon should not have been granted.
