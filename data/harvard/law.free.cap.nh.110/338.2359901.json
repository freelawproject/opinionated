Ployer, Jr., on January 4, 1966. The parties filed a stipulation which was incorporated in the decree by the trial court and contained the following provision:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">\u201c That John H. Ployer, Jr., shall pay to Ruth Marie Ployer the sum of Thirty ($30) Dollars per week for the support of said minor child, said payments to automatically terminate when said child either becomes self-supporting or reaches legal age, whichever event occurs sooner. After said minor child either becomes self-supporting or reaches legal age, John H. Ployer, Jr., shall pay to Ruth Marie Ployer, as alimony, the sum of $60.00 per month, provided that she is tiren unmarried; said alimony payments to terminate on the death or remarriage of Ruth Marie Ployer, whichever event occurs sooner. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">On March 28, 1969 the defendant John Ployer, Jr., ceased the payments of $60 per month he was then making and a petition for contempt was brought by the plaintiff. The matter was referred to a Master, <em>Leonard C. Hardwick, </em>Esq., who found that tire minor child became self-supporting on March 2, 1966 but ruled that tire order of $60 per month continued in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>until modified by the court. The master\u2019s report was approved by <em>Grant, </em>J., who reserved and transferred the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The defendant relies upon RSA 458:19 which limits orders of support to three years from the date of the order \u201c in cases in which no children are involved, or in which the children have reached the age of majority . . . . \u201d This statute was enacted by Laws 1937, ch. 154 and is apparently unique to this state. 27A C.J.S. Divorce <em>s. </em>238, at 1113 n. 55.25. It has been held to place the burden on the beneficiary of the order \u201cto bring it up for reconsideration, \u201d otherwise it expires at the end of three years. <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Lund, </em>96 N.H. 283, 285, 74 A.2d 557, 559; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>92 N.H. 70, 24 A.2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The language of the statute limits its application to orders not involving children. We have held that provisions in a decree \u201c relating to the wife and children are not to be construed as separate and distinct unless specifically made so by the terms of the decree itself. \u201d <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Lund, supra </em>at 285; <em>Angwin </em>v. <em>Angwin, </em>103 N.H. 531, 176 A.2d 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The <em>Lund </em>case involved a decree with a separate allowance to a wife and an eighteen year old daughter. Although the daugh - ter would have attained her majority in three years it was held five years later that since the decree affected both wife and child it was not limited by the statute and remained in effect until mod - ified or cancelled by another decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In the present case a minor child was involved and the decree affected both wife and child, although the wife\u2019s support as such did not begin until after the child\u2019s support terminated. The limitations imposed upon the payment of alimony in this decree were unrelated to the three-year limitation of RSA 458:19.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
