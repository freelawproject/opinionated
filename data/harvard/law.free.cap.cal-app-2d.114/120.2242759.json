J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6r\">Defendant appeals from that portion of an interlocutory judgment of divorce, entered upon his default, whereby defendant was ordered to pay to the plaintiff wife $15 per week \u201cfor her support.\u201d The respondent wife has made no appearance in this court by brief or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">By her complaint the wife alleged that the defendant had been guilty of extreme cruelty; that there were no children of the marriage; that there was no community property. No averments were made as to the need of the wife for support or the husband\u2019s ability to pay. The complaint concluded with a prayer that the bonds of matrimony be dissolved; that plaintiff\u2019s maiden name be restored; and that \u201cplaintiff be allowed a reasonable sum for attorney\u2019s fees and for her costs herein; for such other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Appellant\u2019s contention that in the circumstances presented the trial court erred in making an award of support money is well taken.  The rule that the relief granted to a plaintiff, if no answer be filed, cannot exceed that which is demanded in the complaint (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 580) is applicable to default divorce cases <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>50 Cal.App. 48 [194 P. 503]; <em>Eddy </em>v. <em>Eddy, </em>64 Cal.App.2d 672 [149 P.2d 187]; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>52 Cal.App.2d 792 [127 P.2d 94]; <em>Darsie </em>v. <em>Darsie, </em>49 Cal.App.2d 491 [122 P.2d 64]; <em>Majors </em>v. <em>Majors, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 619 [161 P.2d 494]; <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 513 [194 P.2d 796]).  A prayer for general relief cannot enlarge the power of the court to award what is not specifically demanded <em>(Eddy </em>v. <em>Eddy, supra, </em>p. 673). As above stated, the complaint herein contains no prayer for support and no allegations as to the need therefor or the ability of the defendant to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The judgment is modified by striking therefrom the words, \u201cThat defendant be required and he is hereby ordered to pay to plaintiff $15.00 per week for her support to commence forthwith. \u201d As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. Appellant to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Doran, J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
