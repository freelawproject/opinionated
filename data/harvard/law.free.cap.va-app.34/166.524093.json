For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">On March 23, 1998, appellant pled guilty to grand larceny before Judge Poston of the Norfolk Circuit Court. After hearing evidence and argument, Judge Poston found appellant guilty. He imposed a four-year sentence but suspended all four years on condition appellant be of good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">On January 26, 1999, appellant\u2019s probation officer notified the trial judge that appellant had been convicted of an offense on November 12, 1998. As a result, the probation officer requested that a probation violation capias be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">On February 24, 1999, the trial judge issued the capias. On April 29, 1999, the trial court, Judge Martin presiding, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ducted a revocation hearing. At the beginning of the hearing, appellant\u2019s attorney stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">On today\u2019s docket on the probation violation Timothy Wayne Gurley, I talked to Mr. Gurley about the situation. This is Judge Poston\u2019s case, and Mr. Gurley has asked that I request that the matter be postponed so that Judge Poston can hear the case. It\u2019s a little bit unusual and I would ask that be done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">In support of his request, defense counsel indicated that appellant \u201cfeels that he encountered you ... as a judge in Norfolk Juvenile Court on several occasions, evidently when you served in that capacity.\u201d Judge Martin denied having \u201cany recollection of him.\u201d Judge Martin stated that \u201cJudge Poston\u2019s position is that any judge in this court can handle any probation violation,\u201d and he denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\n<em>The Issue on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Appellant initially pointed out that \u201cthis is Judge Poston\u2019s case\u201d and requested a continuance so Judge Poston \u201ccan hear the case.\u201d He then explained \u201cone of the reasons\u201d for requesting Judge Poston was because Judge Martin \u201cencountered\u201d appellant in juvenile court \u201con several occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">The record thus shows that appellant advanced two reasons for requesting Judge Poston to preside. First, appellant argued that this was \u201cJudge Poston\u2019s case\u201d; therefore, he should preside. Appellant also argued that he knew Judge Martin from juvenile court. However, on appeal, appellant limits his argument to the authority of a circuit court judge to preside at a revocation hearing where that judge did not preside at the guilt and sentencing phases of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">\n<em>Preservation of the Issue on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">The Commonwealth contends the issue was not preserved for appellate review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>An alleged error is preserved for consideration on appeal if \u201cat the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, [a party] makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objections to the action of the court and his grounds therefor.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-384. The purpose of this rule is \u201cto avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials by allowing the trial judge to intelligently consider an issue and, if necessary, to take corrective action.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 480, 405 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1991) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Appellant clearly asked for Judge Poston, the sentencing judge, to preside. Relying on Judge Poston\u2019s position that \u201cany judge in this court can handle any probation violation,\u201d Judge Martin denied the request. By referring to Judge Poston\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d in his ruling, the trial judge recognized but disagreed with appellant\u2019s argument that the original sentencing judge should preside. The fact that the appellant did not cite the statutory authority upon which he relies in his brief does not affect the determination whether he preserved the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Appellant contends that Judge Martin\u2019s reliance on \u201cJudge Poston\u2019s position ... that any judge in this court can handle any probation violation\u201d violated Code \u00a7 17.1-503. Code \u00a7 17.1-503 authorizes the Supreme Court to \u201cformulate rules of practice and procedure for the circuit courts.\u201d It provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">[n]o rule shall hereafter be promulgated under the limitations of \u00a7 8.01-4 or otherwise which would avoid or preclude the judge before whom an accused is arraigned in criminal cases from hearing all aspects of the case on its merits, or to avoid or preclude any judge in any case who has heard any part of the case on its merits, from hearing the case to its conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Id.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-4 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">[C]ircuit courts may, from time to time, prescribe rules for their respective ... circuits. Such rules shall be limited to those rules necessary to promote proper order and decorum and the efficient and safe use of courthouse facilities and clerks\u2019 offices. No rule of any such court shall be prescribed or enforced which is inconsistent with this statute or any other statutory provision, or the Rules of Supreme Court or contrary to the decided cases, or which has the effect of abridging substantive rights of persons before such court. Any rule of court which violates the provisions of this section shall be invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Thus, appellant\u2019s argument is that Judge Poston\u2019s expressed \u201cposition\u201d amounted to a local rule that improperly precluded the original sentencing judge, Judge Poston, from \u201chearing all aspects of the case on its merits ... to its conclusion,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 17.1-503 as it relates to Code \u00a7 8.01-4. The practice of allowing any circuit judge to handle any probation violation does not violate Code \u00a7 17.1-503 as it pertains to Code \u00a7 8.01-4. Judge Poston\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d did not prevent the circuit judge who presides at trial from presiding at a subsequent revocation hearing. Instead, the statement merely explained that any circuit judge, even the original sentencing judge, could preside at a revocation proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">Moreover,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">\u201c[w]hen interpreting a statute, the courts have a duty to give full force and effect to every word thereof.\u201d \u201cA construction which would ... enervate, impede and paralyze the administration of the criminal laws of the State should not be adopted unless the legislative intent to produce such a result is clearly indicated.\u201d Clearly, the legislature in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tended to grant broad discretion to judges to revoke suspensions of sentences for cause. Thus, the statutes \u201cshould be liberally construed to provide trial courts a valuable tool for rehabilitation of criminals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><em>Carbaugh v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 119, 124, 449 S.E.2d 264, 267 (1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201c[T]he revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1971); <em>see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759-60, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1972) (holding that \u201c[probation revocation, like parole revocation is not a stage of a criminal prosecution\u201d). In setting forth the minimum due process requirements for a revocation hearing, the Supreme Court \u201cemphasize[d] there is no thought to equate this [hearing] to a criminal prosecution in any sense.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604 (explaining \u201c[i]t is a narrow inquiry\u201d and the process should be flexible). The Supreme Court purposely avoided prescribing \u201can inflexible structure for parole revocation procedures,\u201d and noted that \u201c[t]he few basic [due process] requirements .... should not impose a great burden on any State\u2019s parole system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. Similarly, we have adopted that view of probation revocation hearings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have previously indicated <em>probation revocation hearings are not a stage of criminal prosecution and therefore a probationer is not entitled to the same due process protections afforded a defendant in a criminal prosecution. </em>Specifically, the United States Supreme Court has stated that in revocation hearings \u201cformal procedures and rules of evidence are not employed,\u201d' and that the process of revocation hearings \u201cshould be flexible enough to consider evidence ... that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_l\"><em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 81, 84, 402 S.E.2d 684, 686 (1991) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Furthermore, when discussing the authority to revoke a suspended sentence, our revocation statute and case law ascribe that authority to \u201cthe court,\u201d \u201ca court\u201d and, using the indefinite article, to \u201ca judge,\u201d without specifying which trial judge. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-306 <em>(\u201cthe court </em>may, for any cause deemed by it sufficient within the probation period, ... revoke the suspension of sentence\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Griffin v. Cunningham, </em>205 Va. 349, 354, 136 S.E.2d 840, 844 (1964) (\u201c[a] <em>court </em>which has ordered a suspension of sentence undoubtedly has the power to revoke it\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Carbaugh, </em>19 Va.App. at 123, 449 S.E.2d at 266 (\u201cunder Virginia law once a defendant receives a suspended sentence, <em>a judge\u2019s </em>power to revoke the suspension is governed by statute\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In <em>Hess v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 738, 742, 441 S.E.2d 29, 32 (1994), we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to revoke Hess\u2019 suspended sentence because the trial judge presiding at the revocation proceeding improperly based his decision to revoke Hess\u2019 suspended sentence on unspecified evidence he allegedly heard while presiding at Hess\u2019 earlier trial. In that case, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\"><em>If the presiding judge at the probation revocation hearing also presided at the probationer\u2019s criminal prosecution </em>and the judge deems it necessary or desirable to consider evidence or aspects of the earlier criminal proceeding as a basis for revoking probation, the judge may in the exercise of sound discretion consider such evidence, provided that the judge delineates during the evidentiary portion of the revocation proceeding precisely the evidence that is being considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 742, 441 S.E.2d at 32 (emphasis added). <em>Hess </em>contemplates that the sentencing judge may or may not preside at the revocation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">We find that the trial court did not promulgate a local rule preventing the original judge from presiding at a revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>proceeding. Accordingly, the trial court committed no statutory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We further hold that, because a revocation proceeding \u201cis not a stage of criminal prosecution,\u201d <em>see Davis, </em>12 Va.App. at 84, 402 S.E.2d at 686, because such a proceeding may or may not take place depending on future contingencies involving a probationer\u2019s conduct, because our code and case law have consistently referred to the authority of \u201cthe court\u201d rather than a specific judge to conduct a revocation hearing, and because no statute or rule places any restriction on a different trial judge presiding at a subsequent revocation hearing, the same circuit court judge who presides at a defendant\u2019s original trial is not required to preside at a later revocation hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">. In his brief, appellant misquoted Code \u00a7 17.1-503 to read \"no local rule may preclude a Judge of a Circuit Court from hearing all aspects of the case on its merits.\u201d As explained in the body of this opinion, Code \u00a7 8.01-4 is the section that addresses the circuit court\u2019s authority to prescribe certain rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
