He argues the trial court erred by limiting his toxicologist\u2019s testimony and when instructing the jury. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">Botetourt County Deputy C.L. Cook stopped the defendant for driving 67 miles per hour in a 45 mile-per-hour zone. He detected a strong odor of alcohol, and after conducting sobriety tests and an alcosensor test, he arrested the defendant for driving under the influence. The defendant refused to submit to a blood or breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">At trial, the defendant testified that between 7:30 and 10:00 p.m. he consumed two one-and-a-half-ounce drinks of vodka and a glass of wine with dinner. He presented a toxicologist, Richard J. McGarry, who testified extensively on the absorp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tion and dissipation rates of alcohol in the blood stream. The trial court permitted McGarry to answer a hypothetical question that, given the defendant\u2019s size and alcohol consumption, the amount of alcohol consumed would be insufficient to cause a person to drive unsafely. However, the trial court did not permit the toxicologist to state his opinion that defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content would have been between .02% and .03%.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in prohibiting McGarry from specifying the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of the offense. He argues the statutory presumptions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied to the toxicologist\u2019s opinion, and the trial court erred in not instructing on them. The trial court refused defense Instruction Z,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which stated that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>person with a blood alcohol concentration of .05 or less is presumed not under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The statutory presumptions do not apply to this case. Those presumptions apply only when a blood or breath test is administered pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.1 through -268.12. The statutory presumptions do not apply because the defendant refused to take either the blood or breath test and no test was given under the implied consent law. Code \u00a7 18.2-269. In <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 286, 322 S.E.2d 216, 223 (1984), the trial court erred when it instructed on the statutory presumptions. In that case, a test performed at a hospital, but not pursuant to the implied consent law, did not raise the presumptions. \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-269 expressly provides that the presumptions it creates arise only when a blood-alcohol test is conducted \u2018in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 18.2-268 [now \u00a7 18.2-268.1 et seq.].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 322 S.E.2d at 223 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">As in <em>Essex, </em>the evidence in this case did not permit the giving of an instruction about the statutory presumptions. Even an instruction that accurately states the law may not be given if it is inapplicable to the facts of a given case. <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 708, 711, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986). The toxicologist\u2019s opinion about the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was not based on the results of a properly administered blood or breath test. Expert testimony is inadmissible \u201cif it is founded on assumptions that have an insufficient factual basis.\u201d <em>Keesee v. Donigan, </em>259 Va. 157, 161, 524 S.E.2d 645, 648 (2000) (citations omitted). The trial court did not err in refusing to admit the opinion or to give Instruction Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The defendant also contends the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which told the jury it could consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>defendant\u2019s prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence. The Commonwealth introduced the statements the defendant made when stopped by the deputy to show he kept changing his story about whether he had been drinking and the amount he had consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"> A witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement is admissible to impeach trial testimony but is not admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the prior statement is offered to prove the. truth of the statement uttered, it is hearsay. <em>Hall [Pugh] v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 369, 374, 355 S.E.2d 591, 594-95 (1987). However, if the witness is a party, the prior inconsistent statement is an admission and is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Land v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 229, 176 S.E.2d 586, 590-91 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\"><em>Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 421 S.E.2d 821 (1992), addressed the argument defendant raises. \u201cSatcher contends the trial court erred in refusing his Instruction J, which would have limited the jury\u2019s consideration of Satcher\u2019s pretrial I-am-being-framed-for-murder-or-rape\u2019 statement to its bearing on his credibility. However, this limitation is applicable only to \u2018a witness who is not a party to the case on trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 421 S.E.2d at 843 (quoting <em>Hall [Pugh], </em>233 Va. at 374, 355 S.E.2d at 594). <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 470 S.E.2d 114 (1996), explains the reason behind the exception to the hearsay rule. \u201cIn the case of a party admission, the credibility of the extrajudicial declarant is not an issue affecting the admissibility of the statement, because the party need not cross-examine his own statement in order to be in a position to deny, contradict, or explain the statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 470 S.E.2d at 127 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> \u201cDespite occasional misunderstandings on this point, consideration by the trier of fact of a party\u2019s admissions is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>limited to the issue of the party\u2019s credibility. <em>Party admissions are admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and may be considered by the trier of fact for that purpose.\u201d </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-38, at 748 (5th ed.1999) (emphasis in original). Instruction 4 was a correct statement of law, and the trial court did not err in giving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">For the foregoing reasons,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\">. \u00a7 18.2-269.
