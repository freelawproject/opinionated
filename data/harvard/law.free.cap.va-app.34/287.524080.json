An appeal to the trial court by defendant resulted in a like finding and disposition. On appeal to this Court, defendant complains the court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence and failed to apply the proper standard of proof in adjudicating the petition. We agree and reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The procedural history and pertinent facts are undisputed. During an adjudicatory hearing before the J &amp; D court on April 9,1997, the court found defendant \u201cdelinquent\u201d upon his plea of guilty to a petition alleging \u201cunauthorized use\u201d of a motor vehicle. The proceedings were then continued until May 30, 1997, when a \u201cDisposition\u201d hearing was conducted, and defendant was \u201cplacefd] on probation\u201d upon certain terms and conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">On October 21,1999, the subject petition, alleging defendant \u201ctested positive for marijuana on 9 \u2014 6\u201499[,] ... was suspended from school ... on 10/1/99\u201d and had failed to comply with a \u201cDay reporting program,\u201d all in violation of probation, was filed with the J &amp; D court. Following a related hearing and disposition unfavorable to defendant, he appealed to the trial court. Pretrial, defendant moved the court to \u201cexclude hearsay\u201d evidence and apply \u201cthe reasonable doubt standard\u201d of proof in determining the violations. Following argument <em>ore terms, </em>the court overruled the motion and commenced the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Lisa Arnold, a probation officer with the Alexandria Court Services Unit, testified that supervision of defendant had been assigned to her following the disposition to probation by the J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>&amp; D court of the unauthorized use petition. Subsequently, in April 1999, direct supervision was \u201ctransferred\u201d to Amy Ashley, a probation officer in Prince William County, defendant\u2019s place of residence. Over defendant\u2019s renewed objection, Ms. Arnold further testified that Ms. Ashley soon advised her of \u201csome issues\u201d related to defendant that required intervention of \u201ctheir court\u201d and \u201cmore intensive supervision,\u201d including \u201cday reporting, drug testing, [and] monitoring of school.\u201d Later, on September 6, 1999, Ms. Arnold \u201cwas told\u201d by Ms. Ashley \u201cthat ... defendant tested positive for marijuana\u201d and, in early October, similarly learned that he had been suspended from school and was in noncompliance with the \u201cday reporting program,\u201d the circumstances prompting the instant petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">At the conclusion of Ms. Arnold\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth rested, defendant presented no evidence and moved the court \u201cto strike,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe case ha[d] not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court disagreed and, applying the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard to the Commonwealth\u2019s proof, found defendant in violation of probation. Before disposition, however, the court considered a lengthy \u201cCourt Study,\u201d which recounted defendant\u2019s social and \u201cCourt History\u201d and recommended \u201ccommittment] to the Department of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate period,\u201d the disposition imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Upon adjudicating \u201ca juvenile ... delinquent ... ,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the juvenile court or the circuit court may make any of\u2019 an array of \u201cdisposition[s] for [the] supervision, care and rehabilitation\u201d of the child. Code \u00a7 16.1-278.8(A). Among the statutory op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tions, the tribunal may \u201c[p]lace the juvenile on probation under certain conditions and limitations as the\u2019 court may prescribe.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-278.8(A)(7). Thereafter,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">A. A child who violates an order of the juvenile court entered into pursuant to \u00a7 [16.1-278.8] ... may be proceeded against for a revocation or modification of such order .... A proceeding to revoke or modify probation ... shall be commenced by the filing of a petition. Except as otherwise provided, <em>such petitions shall be screened, reviewed and prepared in the same manner and shall contain the same information as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-260 and 16.1-</em>262.... <em>Proceedings to revoke or modify probation ... shall be governed by the procedures, safeguards, rights and duties applicable to the original proceedings.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">B. If a child is found to have violated a prior order of the court ..., the court may, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-278.2 through 16.1-278.10, upon a revocation or modification hearing, modify ... the terms of the order ... or make any other disposition of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Code \u00a7 16.1-291 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-260 directs that \u201c[a]ll matters alleged to be within the jurisdiction of the [J &amp; D] court shall be commenced by the filing of a petition\u201d in the \u201cform and content\u201d specified by Code \u00a7 16.1-262. Code \u00a7 16.1-260(A). A petition alleging delinquency, a matter within the jurisdiction of the J <em>&amp; </em>D court pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A) and, therefore, embraced by Code \u00a7 16.1-260, emanates from a \u201ccomplaint\u201d initially screened and reviewed by an \u201cintake officer.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-260. Thus, Code \u00a7 16.1-291, by reference to Code \u00a7 16.1-260, prescribes the identical procedural course for complaints alleging either a violation'of probation or a delinquent act, although a violation of probation, by definition, is clearly not a delinquent act. Code \u00a7 16.1-228. Similarly, Code \u00a7 16.1-291 empowers the court, upon finding a violation of probation, to select from the panoply of statutory dispositions available in a delinquency adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Significantly, Code \u00a7 16.1-291 further instructs that proceedings to revoke juvenile probation be \u201cgoverned by the procedures, safeguards, rights and duties applicable to the <em>original proceedings.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-291 (emphasis added). Defendant, in support of his argument that the trial court erroneously admitted the hearsay testimony of Ms. Arnold and failed to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the alleged violations, construes \u201coriginal proceedings\u201d to reference the prior adjudication of delinquency on the criminal offense, unauthorized use. He, therefore, reasons that juvenile revocation proceedings must assure the \u201cconstitutional ... \u2018essentials of due process and fair treatment,\u2019 \u201d which \u201c[specifically\u201d include \u201cthe right to confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses\u201d and the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 150, 153, 198 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1973) (quoting <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 30, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1445, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967)); <em>see Commonwealth v. Chatman, </em>260 Va. 562, 569, 538 S.E.2d 304, 306 (2000) (juvenile defendant entitled to due process protections afforded adults in criminal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In response, the Commonwealth maintains that \u201coriginal proceedings\u201d contemplates the post-adjudicatory, dispositional phase in the criminal prosecution of a juvenile, a stage that allows hearsay without offending due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth thus concludes that such evidence, admissible in a disposition to probation, is equally admissible in determining a later violation of such probation. In dismissing the need for proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the Commonwealth relies upon the relaxed due process standards judicially countenanced in adult revocation proceedings. The Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>argument, however, overlooks the substantial statutory differences between adult and juvenile revocation procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In sentencing an adult offender, like disposition of a delinquency adjudication, the court may impose probation \u201cunder such conditions as the court shall determine.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303. Thereafter, \u201c[t]he court may, for any cause deemed by it sufficient which occurred at any time\u201d during the period of probation, \u201crevoke ... [such] probation.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306. Also, not unlike juvenile revocation, an adult probation violation is \u201cnot itself a criminal conviction\u201d but, rather, \u201can aspect of the sentencing process imposed upon a criminal conviction,\u201d a \u201ccontinuation and part of the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 506, 509, 528 S.E.2d 743, 744 (2000) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-306. Thus, it is well established in our jurisprudence that adult revocation proceedings are \u201cnot a stage of criminal prosecution[,] ... a probationer is not entitled to the same protections afforded a defendant in a criminal prosecution\u201d and \u201cthe process ... [allows] \u2018evidence ... that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial,\u2019 \u201d including hearsay. <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 81, 84, 402 S.E.2d 684, 686 (1991) (citations omitted); <em>see Hess v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 738, 742, 441 S.E.2d 29, 32 (1994) (\u201ca probation officer can, and frequently does, give hearsay evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">A determination to revoke adult probation in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-306 \u201clies in the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 325, 326, 228 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1976). Therefore, although revocation must be upon reasonable cause, an assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain an order is vested in the trial court, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not required. <em>Marshall v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 217, 220-21, 116 S.E.2d 270, 273-74 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In contrast, the juvenile revocation procedure prescribed by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 16.1-291 specifically guarantees such probationer \u201cthe safeguards, rights and duties applicable to the original proceedings,\u201d assurances not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>expressly afforded a similarly situated adult. The adjective \u201coriginal,\u201d which modifies proceedings, is defined, \u201cof, relating to, or constituting an origin or beginning.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>882 (9th ed.1983). In divining legislative intent, \u201cwe must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1994). Further, \u201cwe may determine the intent of the legislature from a comparison of the statute\u2019s several parts <em>in pari materia,\u201d </em>a \u201crule of statutory construction that statutes ... relating to the same subject \u2018should be read, construed and applied together. ...\u2019\u201d <em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 69, 77, 509 S.E.2d 543, 547 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Thus, by referencing the \u201coriginal proceedings\u201d to prescribe the \u201csafeguards, rights and duties\u201d guaranteed a juvenile' confronting revocation of probation pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-291, the legislature clearly looked to the \u201corigin or beginning\u201d of the relevant prosecution, clearly the adjudicatory phase. Such interpretation is further manifested by the incorporation into Code \u00a7 16.1-291 of those adjudicatory procedures specified in Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-260 and -262. Therefore, presumably \u201cwith full knowledge of the law as it affected the subject matter,\u201d <em>Broadnax v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 808, 814-15, 485 S.E.2d 666, 669 (1997), the legislature deliberately extended the due process protections assured to juvenile offenders at the adjudicatory phase of a criminal prosecution to subsequent proceedings to revoke probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Accordingly, the hearsay testimony of Ms. Arnold, relied upon by the Commonwealth to establish violation by defendant of several terms and conditions of the subject probation, was erroneously received into evidence and consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ered by the court.
