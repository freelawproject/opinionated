Mahoney\u2019s appeal from a judgment of the juvenile and domestic relations district court. We granted appellee\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of that decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we hold the trial court did not err in its ruling that upon failure to post an appeal bond fixed under Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H), appellant\u2019s appeal must be dismissed. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Guided by well-settled principles, we review the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. On August 28, 1998, the Arlington Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (J <em>&amp; </em>DR) found appellant, Michael Mahoney (father), in civil contempt of court on Jeanne Mahoney\u2019s Rule to Show Cause which was issued against the father for failing to comply with court-ordered support, both child and spousal, as well as medical bills and attorney\u2019s fees. The court entered judgment against father in the amount of $151,902.52, the amount in arrears due to mother. On appeal to the circuit court, father characterized the appeal as one challenging the \u201cjurisdiction of the Court [to] enter any orders and the validity of all orders entered in this case based on fraud.\u201d He specifically noted his intention not to appeal the amounts of support found due and owing. Bond was fixed at $165,888.62 by the juvenile court. When no bond was posted, the circuit court dismissed father\u2019s appeal upon mother\u2019s motion. The court\u2019s order of dismissal was appealed to this Court. We affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision on the grounds that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-296Q3) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">No appeal bond shall be required of a party appealing from an order of a juvenile and domestic relations district court except for that portion of any order or judgment establishing a support arrearage or suspending payment of support during pendency of an appeal. <em>In cases involving support, no appeal shall be allowed until the party applying for the same or someone for him gives bond, in an amount and with sufficient surety approved by the judge or by his clerk if there is one, to abide by such judgment as may be rendered on appeal if the appeal is perfected or, if not perfected, then to satisfy the judgment of the court in which it was rendered. </em>Upon appeal from a conviction for failure to support or from a finding of civil or criminal contempt involving a failure to support, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may require the party applying for the appeal or someone for him to give bond.... An appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>will not be perfected unless such appeal bond as may be required is filed within thirty days from the entry of the final judgment or order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">(Emphasis added). Mahoney contends the circuit court erroneously dismissed his appeal <em>de novo </em>because he limited his appeal to a challenge of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. He reasons that, having specifically excluded from his notice of appeal the juvenile court\u2019s establishment of a support arrearage and its finding of contempt, he was not required to post an appeal bond under Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Mahoney\u2019s challenge to the validity of \u201call orders entered\u201d by the juvenile court, and to the authority of the court to enter any such orders, necessarily and logically implicates a ehalleng\u00e9 to the subject of the orders entered by the juvenile court. In this case, the order Mahoney appealed from the juvenile court to the circuit court established a support arrearage he owed to his former wife. Thus, Mahoney\u2019s appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s order was necessarily subject to the jurisdictional requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H), which requires an appeal bond \u201cfor that portion of any order establishing a support arrearage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In addition, not only is the substantive issue of support arrearages logically related to, and inherent in, Mahoney\u2019s challenge to the jurisdiction of the court and the claimed invalidity of \u201call orders entered,\u201d but the law governing appeals from courts not of record also provides a well established legal foundation for the imposition of bond. An appeal from a court not of record is tried <em>de novo. See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-106, 16.1-113; <em>Copperthite Pie Corp. v. Whitehurst, </em>157 Va. 480, 488, 162 S.E. 189, 191 (1932) (citing <em>Southern Ry. Co. v. Hill, </em>106 Va. 501, 505, 56 S.E. 278, 280 (1907)); <em>see also Hailey v. Dorsey, </em>580 F.2d 112, 114 (4th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 937, 99 S.Ct. 1282, 59 L.Ed.2d 495 (1979). Such an appeal transfers the <em>entire </em>record to the circuit court for retrial <em>as though the case had been originally brought there. See Addison v. Salyer, </em>185 Va. 644, 650, 40 S.E.2d 260, 263 (1946). Upon transfer, the order and judgment of the lower court are annulled. <em>See Ragan v. Woodcroft Village </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Apts., </em>255 Va. 322, 327, 497 S.E.2d 740, 742 (1998) (citing <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tuttle, </em>208 Va. 28, 32, 155 S.E.2d 358, 361 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">It follows that because no case or judgment exists in the lower court, and because the circuit court upon appeal acts as the tribunal of original jurisdiction, it must address and dispose of all issues raised by the petitioner in the lower court. <em>See Addison, </em>185 Va. at 649, 40 S.E.2d at 263 (\u201c \u2018A court which hears a case <em>de novo ... </em>acts not as a court of appeals but as one exercising original jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Thomas Gemmell, Inc. v. Svea Fire &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>166 Va. 95, 98, 184 S.E. 457, 458 (1936))). Specifically, the circuit court must decide both the issue of jurisdiction and the issue of arrearages, because no judgment on arrearages exists once the matter is appealed from the lower tribunal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The policy underlying the requirement of appeal bonds is clear. An appeal bond provides assurances that any judgment that may be rendered on appeal, if perfected, will be satisfied. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-107; <em>Hutchins v. Carrillo, </em>27 Va.App. 595, 606, 500 S.E.2d 277, 282 (1998) (noting that \u201cthe essential function of an appeal bond [is] \u2018to protect the [appellee] against any loss or damage he may sustain by reason of the suspension of his right to proceed with the collection of his judgment against the [appellant]\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jacob v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>wealth ex rel. Myers, </em>148 Va. 236, 242, 138 S.E. 574, 576 (1927))). Such bonds also provide assurances in cases in which an appeal is hot perfected that the judgment of the court in which it was rendered will be satisfied. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, the policy considerations underlying the need for bond upon appeal from the lower court are so material to the statutory scheme reflected in Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) that the failure to post the required bond will constitute reversible error even when the appellant prevails in the trial <em>de novo. See Commonwealth ex rel. May v. Walker, </em>253 Va. 319, 323, 485 S.E.2d 134, 136-37 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In summary, we hold that the JD &amp; R order from which appellant appealed addressed only one subject, viz., that of support arrearages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, Mahoney\u2019s failure to post bond under Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) was fatal to his appeal. We accordingly affirm the decision of the trial court to dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. For example, if jurisdiction is found to exist on appeal, the circuit court must determine arrearages. It is reversible error to permit the judgment of the lower court to be introduced as evidence in the case and no other judgment on the issues is extant, because that of the lower court is annulled. <em>See Gravely v. Deeds, </em>185 Va. 662, 664, 40 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1946); <em>see also Nationwide, </em>208 Va. at 33, 155 S.E.2d at 361-62. Conversely, if the circuit court finds no jurisdiction exists, the case must be dismissed and no arrearages established. Moreover, that the party bringing the appeal prevails in the trial <em>de novo </em>is insufficient to avoid the dictate of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) that \"no appeal shall be allowed unless and until a bond is given by the party applying for the appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth ex rel. May v. Walker, </em>253 Va. 319, 322, 485 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1997). In fact, the circuit court does not even have jurisdiction to hear the case unless the appeal bond is posted. <em>See id. </em>at 323, 485 S.E.2d at 136 (\"[T]he failure to post an appeal bond ... is a fatal jurisdictional defect....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-10\">. We do not address in this opinion the applicability of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) to an order which addresses multiple, independent issues unrelated to the issue of support.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b98-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">No appeal bond shall be required of a party appealing from an order of a juvenile and domestic relations district court except for that portion of any order or judgment establishing a support arrearage or suspending payment of support during pendency of an appeal. In cases involving support, no appeal shall be allowed until the party applying for the same or someone for him gives bond, in an amount and with sufficient surety approved by the judge or by his clerk if there is one, to abide by such judgment as may be rendered on appeal if the appeal is perfected or, if not perfected, then to satisfy the judgment of the court in which it was rendered. Upon appeal from a conviction for failure to support or from a finding of civil or criminal contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>involving a failure to support, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may require the party applying for the appeal or someone for him to give bond, with or without surety, to insure his appearance and may also require bond in an amount and with sufficient surety to secure the payment of prospective support accruing during the pendency of the appeal. An appeal will not be perfected unless such appeal bond as may be required is filed within thirty days from the entry of the final judgment or order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Although the statute clearly states that \u201c[i]n cases involving support, no appeal shall be allowed until the party applying for the same or someone for him gives bond,\u201d in equally clear language the statute begins by stating that \u201c[n]o appeal bond shall be required ... except for that <em>portion </em>of any order or judgment ... establishing a support arrearage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">By its explicit terms, the statute removes the requirement for posting a bond except as provided in the statute. The provision specifying that a bond shall be required for an appeal of a judgment establishing support arrearages implicitly recognizes that an order that sets arrearages may have a component that does not establish a support arrearage. In such a case, an appeal bond is required only for \u201cthat portion of any order ... establishing a support arrearage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\"><em>Avery v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 698, 700, 472 S.E.2d 675, 676 (1996) (citation omitted). I would hold that Michael A. Mahoney\u2019s appeal of the \u201cjurisdiction of the Court [to] enter any order\u201d is not an appeal of a \u201cportion of any order or judgment establishing a support arrearage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">When Mahoney appealed the judgment to the circuit court, he wrote on the notice of appeal that he <em>\u201cappeals jurisdiction of the Court [to] enter any orders </em>and the validity of all orders entered in this case based on fraud\u201d and that \u201c[h]e <em>is not appealing amounts of support.\u201d </em>(Additional emphasis added). Consistent with his notation on the notice of appeal, Mahoney informed the trial judge during the hearing that he was \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>appealing] the amount of support\u201d but was \u201cappealing] ... the lack of subject matter jurisdiction by the [juvenile and domestic relations district] court.\u201d Specifically, Mahoney alleged that the juvenile court never acquired jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act or the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. Ruling that a party \u201ccan\u2019t piecemeal the appeal,\u201d the trial judge apparently recognized that Mahoney\u2019s challenge was not to any portion of the judgment but to the power of the court to render any judgment. Nevertheless, the trial judge granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In my opinion, Mahoney\u2019s appeal is not subject to the appeal bond requirement because it is not an appeal from \u201cthat portion of any order or judgment establishing a support arrearage.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H). A judgment entered by a court when it lacks subject matter jurisdiction is void, and that judgment is subject to a challenge at any time. <em>Morrison v. Bestler, </em>239 Va. 166, 170, 387 S.E.2d 753, 755-56 (1990). In addition, a party may challenge a judgment on the basis of a court\u2019s failure to abide by mandatory statutory requirements. In this regard, the Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a] court\u2019s authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over a case may be restricted by a failure to comply with statutory requirements that are mandatory in nature and, thus, are prerequisite to a court\u2019s lawful exercise of that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Dennis Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 405, 409, 527 S.E.2d 415, 417 (2000). Such a failure renders the court without jurisdiction to act and renders the judgment void. <em>See David Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 431, 439, 527 S.E.2d 406, 410 (2000). Mahoney\u2019s appeal directly challenges the juvenile court\u2019s power to render its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The Supreme Court has ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u201c[T]he record is never conclusive as to the recital of a jurisdictional fact, and the defendant is always at liberty to show a want of jurisdiction, although the record avers the contrary. If the court had no jurisdiction, it had no power to make a record, and the supposed record is not in truth a record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Slaughter v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 787, 793, 284 S.E.2d 824, 827 (1981) (citation omitted). \u201c[A]ny subsequent proceeding based on ... a [jurisdictionally] defective judgment is void or a nullity.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>239 Va. at 170, 387 S.E.2d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We have addressed situations in which parties in support disputes sought to challenge contempt rulings against them and did not want to post the bond required by statute. In <em>McCall v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 348, 457 S.E.2d 389 (1995), we held that, under the pre-1992 version of Code \u00a7 16.1-107, a court has no duty to bifurcate support arrearage judgments from other issues to determine whether a party must post a bond. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 457 S.E.2d at 390. We noted that when McCall appealed from a juvenile court judgment, he \u201cdid not specify or indicate in any way that he was appealing only the civil contempt citation and not the determination as to the amount of his support arrearage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, 457 S.E.2d at 391. We also noted that McCall initially asserted the limited nature of his appeal only in this Court. <em>See id. </em>at 350, 457 S.E.2d at 390. Thus, we affirmed the ruling dismissing McCall\u2019s appeal because he did not bifurcate the issues. In <em>Avery, </em>however, we reversed an order dismissing an appeal on similar grounds because the party showed clearly that he \u201csought only to appeal the contempt finding.\u201d 22 Va.App. at 702, 472 S.E.2d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">I believe we should treat challenges to jurisdiction in the same way we treat appeals from contempt orders. In this case, as in <em>Avery, </em>the appellant, Mahoney, has \u201csufficiently \u2018inform[ed] the court that he was pursuing an appeal of the [court\u2019s jurisdiction] and not appealing the determination of the support arrearage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McCall, </em>20 Va.App. at 352-53, 457 S.E.2d at 392). Mahoney separately listed in his notice of appeal to the circuit court the matters he wished to appeal and he orally stated at the circuit court hearing the limited nature of his appeal. He did not challenge the support arrearage judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">For these reasons, I would reverse and remand this matter to the circuit court for consideration solely on the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>whether the juvenile court acquired jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
