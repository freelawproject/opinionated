Wilson entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his post-arrest statements. The sole issue on appeal is whether the two-hour delay after Wilson was arrested and before he was brought before a magistrate violated his Fourth Amendment right to a prompt judicial determination of probable cause. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">At approximately 7:15 p.m., Sergeant Christopher Preuss of the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Police Department was conducting surveillance of an off-campus house, which was, nonetheless, within the jurisdiction of the VCU police department. Hidden from view and using a telescope, Preuss observed Wilson sitting on the front stoop of his house. An unidentified person approached Wilson, and the two had a brief conversation. The person then handed Wilson some U.S. currency. In turn, Wilson handed the person an object, which he had cupped in his hands, and some U.S. currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">After the transaction, the person walked away, but he was apprehended a short distance from the scene by Officer Michael O\u2019Berry. After giving the person his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, O\u2019Berry questioned the person and, when confronted, the person admitted he had just purchased cocaine from Wilson and still possessed it. Preuss and three other officers then went to Wilson\u2019s house and arrested him for distribution of cocaine within one thousand feet of an elementary school. Wilson was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and taken to the VCU police station. Wilson made no incriminating statements at the scene of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Preuss testified that while he was processing Wilson at the VCU police station, Wilson made an inculpatory statement. The Commonwealth introduced evidence that Wilson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvL\">He was a drug user, used cocaine to combat depression. He said he did not sell drugs, he could give the police someone who sold weight, that he could get this person to sell to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">[He] further stated that all but $100 of the $1,130 found on him incident to arrest belonged to his mother and that he was holding the money because she was sick. He indicated that he had just been paid from his job at an automotive business where he worked 40 hours per week and earned $6.50 an hour.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">At the police station, the officers took \u201cextraordinary procedures to try to keep the alleged buyer and [Wilson] apart\u201d so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that Wilson and the buyer could not confront each other. After the buyer was \u201cprocessed,\u201d Wilson was \u201cprocessed.\u201d The processing procedure included fingerprinting, photographs, securing the evidence, and completing \u201cnumerous amounts of paperwork.\u201d Preuss estimated that he kept Wilson at the VCU police station approximately an hour \u201cprocessing\u201d him before he was transported to the Richmond Sheriffs Department and taken before a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Preuss acknowledged that, in an attempt to secure a confession while processing Wilson, he told Wilson that he had observed Wilson selling drugs shortly before arresting him and that the police had also arrested the buyer, who was in custody and in possession of the drugs that Wilson had sold. Preuss further stated that he informed Wilson that Wilson could help himself if he confessed to his involvement in the offense. Although Wilson was required to be present for some of the booking procedures, Preuss admitted that Wilson did not need to be present while Preuss completed some of the paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Prior to trial, Wilson moved to suppress his inculpatory statements. The trial court denied the motion. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254, Wilson entered a conditional plea of guilty and appealed the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u201cIn considering the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is on appellant to show that the court\u2019s ruling constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 479, 483, 524 S.E.2d 171, 172 (2000) (citing <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc.)) </em>When we review a trial court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion, \u201c[w]e view the evidence in a light most favorable to ... the prevailing party below, and we grant all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991) (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Holloway, </em>9 Va.App. 11, 20, 384 S.E.2d 99, 104 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.\u201d <em>Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 114, 95 S.Ct. 854, 863, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975). \u201c[A] jurisdiction that provides judicial determinations of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest will, as a general matter, comply with the promptness requirement of <em>Gerstein.\u201d County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, </em>500 U.S. 44, 56, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 1670, 114 L.Ed.2d 49 (1991). However, a probable cause determination in a particular case conducted within forty-eight hours \u201cmay nonetheless violate <em>Gerstein, </em>if the arrested individual can prove that his or her probable cause determination was delayed unreasonably.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">Examples of unreasonable delay are delays for the purpose of gathering additional evidence to justify the arrest, a delay motivated by ill will against the arrested individual, or delay for delay\u2019s sake. In evaluating whether the delay in a particular case is unreasonable, however, courts must allow a substantial degree of flexibility. Courts cannot ignore the often unavoidable delays in transporting arrested persons from one facility to another, handling late-night bookings where no magistrate is readily available, obtaining the presence of an arresting officer who may be busy processing other suspects or securing the premises of an arrest, and other practical realities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 56-57, 111 S.Ct. at 1670.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We hold that the two-hour delay between the time Wilson was arrested and the time he was brought before the magistrate for a probable cause hearing was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Here, during the time Wilson was detained at the VCU police department, the police officers completed the necessary paperwork, fingerprinted and photographed Wilson, packaged and secured the evidence, and called for a wagon to transport Wilson from the VCU police station to the Richmond Sheriffs Department. Moreover, while the officers were processing Wilson, they took \u201cextraordinary procedures\u201d to keep Wilson and the buyer separated from one another. Although Preuss admitted that while com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>pleting the police paperwork and processing procedures he questioned Wilson and made comments to him in an effort to get Wilson to confess, Wilson has failed to show that the two-hour delay was merely a \u201cruse\u201d to gather information to justify the arrest. We do not confront a situation where a discrete period of time was devoted to interrogating Wilson to the exclusion of other booking or processing procedures. Preuss\u2019 questioning of Wilson took place while he was photographing and fingerprinting Wilson, packaging the evidence, or doing the other necessary paperwork before transporting him to the magistrate. Furthermore, Wilson has failed to show that Preuss\u2019 questioning delayed Wilson\u2019s presentment to the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Because Wilson has failed to show that the two-hour delay in transporting him to the probable cause hearing was unreasonable, the trial court did not err by denying Wilson\u2019s motion to suppress his inculpatory statements. We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
