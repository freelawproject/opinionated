He was sentenced to prison terms of three years and five years, respectively. Barrett claims the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to strike for cause from the jury the brother of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. On May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>16, 2000, a panel of this Court affirmed Barrett\u2019s convictions. Upon a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On December 17,1998, Barrett was operating an automobile in the City of Charlottesville. He was observed by Virginia State Trooper J.S. Fleming, who noted that the vehicle had an expired license tag and a broken left rear taillight lens held in place with duct tape. Fleming followed Barrett, turned on the blue strobe lights on top of his police cruiser, but did not sound the siren. Barrett pulled his vehicle into a small parking lot, opened his door, and began to walk away from the vehicle. When Fleming \u201chollered\u201d for Barrett to stop, Barrett continued to move away from the officer. Fleming followed, took Barrett\u2019s arm, and escorted him toward the police cruiser. Barrett broke away from the officer, and a series of struggles ensued as Fleming unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Barrett. Ultimately, as the situation escalated, Fleming drew his service weapon. Barrett re-entered his vehicle and backed up, hitting Fleming\u2019s cruiser before moving forward. Fleming, having seized Barrett through the window of the car with one arm, held on as the vehicle moved. When Barrett began to drive the car forward, Fleming shot Barrett in the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Charlottesville Police Officer Charles Wade arrived on the scene after the incident had ended. Other Charlottesville police officers were already present. Officer Wade saw Fleming seated in the rear of a marked Charlottesville police cruiser and Barrett lying on the ground. Officer Wade assisted in the investigation of the scene by putting up the yellow \u201cDO NOT ENTER\u201d tape to secure the crime scene and by examining the area for physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Barrett was taken to the University of Virginia Hospital, where he was treated for the gunshot wound. On December 20, 1998, he was arrested at the hospital on the charges for which he was subsequently convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>During <em>voir dire, </em>defense counsel asked a series of questions to prospective juror James Wade. After establishing that Wade\u2019s brother was expected to be one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, he was asked, \u201cif your brother were to take the stand and testify for the Commonwealth, and if my client took the stand and testified, wouldn\u2019t it be a natural ... wouldn\u2019t it be natural for you to give your brother\u2019s testimony more weight than someone else you didn\u2019t know of that was accused of a crime?\u201d Wade responded, \u201cI\u2019m an impartial person.\u201d In a subsequent query, defense counsel asked, \u201c[Wjouldn\u2019t there be a tendency for you, no matter how hard you tried to be impartial, to give your brother, the police officer\u2019s testimony at least a little bit more credibility and believability than somebody like my client, Calvin Barrett, who you don\u2019t know and who\u2019s accused of serious crimes?\u201d To this question, Wade answered, \u201cTruthfully, yes.\u201d The same question, rephrased, was posed again several times by defense counsel, to which Wade responded, in essence, that he could put aside his relationship with the witness and arrive at a fair and impartial verdict. He explained his earlier answer by stating that, while by \u201cinstinct\u201d he would probably tend to favor his brother\u2019s testimony, he was certain he could put it aside and be impartial. <em>See </em>Appendix, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s motion to strike James Wade for cause was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>\u201cPer se </em>rules of disqualification which are based on \u2018a presumption of [juror] bias or prejudice,\u2019 are disfavored in Virginia.\u201d <em>McGann v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 448, 454, 424 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1992) (quoting <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 447, 452, 339 S.E.2d 899, 901 (1986)); <em>see Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 616, 466 S.E.2d 754 (1996) <em>(en </em>banc) (a venireman who worked as a correctional officer was not <em>per se </em>disqualified from being a juror in a case where the defendant was charged with assaulting a correctional officer). We noted in <em>Williams </em>that \u201c[a] <em>per se </em>rule in Virginia has been approved only where the venireman knew of an accused\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>prior conviction for the same offense; stood in a near <em>legal </em>relationship to the victim of the accused; or was a part owner of a victim bank,\u201d the relevant question being whether the juror could be fair and impartial. 21 Va.App. at 618-19, 466 S.E.2d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In two recent cases decided by the Virginia Supreme Court, preserving public confidence in the integrity of jury trials was noted as an additional consideration in determining the propriety of retaining a prospective juror among the venire, even when the individual\u2019s responses to <em>voir dire </em>evidence the absence of any potential bias or prejudice against either side and established the juror\u2019s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict. <em>Cantrell v. Crews, </em>259 Va. 47, 523 S.E.2d 502 (2000); <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000). In both <em>Cantrell </em>and <em>Medici, </em>the juror\u2019s relationship to counsel for one of the parties was given preclusive effect on public policy grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In the case before us, the close familial relationship between the juror in question and a police officer who was an anticipated witness in the case arguably raises policy considerations similar to those underlying the decisions in <em>Cantrell </em>and <em>Medici </em>However, we find that the question here is controlled by the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 558, 569-70, 499 S.E.2d 522, 531 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d and remanded on other grounds, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117, <em>on remand, </em>258 Va. 548, 523 S.E.2d 208 (1999). In <em>Lilly, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcBO\">when the officer\u2019s sole role in a criminal prosecution is as a witness, he is not a \u201cparty\u201d____Thus, a juror\u2019s relationship to such a police officer-witness does not require <em>per se </em>dismissal of that juror from the venire, and the juror may be retained if the trial court is satisfied that the juror c\u00e1n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>set aside considerations of the relationship and evaluate all the evidence fairly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). <em>See also Core v. Core\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, </em>139 Va. 1, 12-13, 124 S.E. 453, 456 (1924).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s exercise of judicial discretion in deciding challenges for cause will not be disturbed on appeal, unless manifest error appears in the record.\u201d <em>Pope v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 123-24, 360 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1987). This deference is afforded because \u201cthe trial judge has the opportunity, which [the appellate court] lack[s], to observe and evaluate the apparent sincerity, conscientiousness, intelligence, and demeanor of prospective jurors first hand....\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the trial court\u2019s determination of the question, \u201cthe entire <em>voir dire </em>must be examined, not just isolated statements.\u201d <em>Chrisman v. Commonwealth, 3 </em>Va.App. 371, 373, 349 S.E.2d 899, 901 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The <em>voir dire </em>of James Wade, in its entirety, makes clear that he could set aside his relationship to the officer-witness and fairly try the case. James Wade did not discuss the case with his brother at any time. When asked if he would be unduly swayed by his relationship to Officer Charles Wade, or whether he would favor or tend to believe his brother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>testimony because of the relationship, he responded in the negative, stating, \u201cI\u2019m an impartial person.\u201d He stated repeatedly that he could put aside the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Furthermore, as we noted in <em>Mullis v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 564, 572, 351 S.E.2d 919, 924 (1987), where \u201c[t]he degree of impact which credibility issues played in the case as a whole was minimal and could have had very little significance on the jury\u2019s resolution of the case,\u201d it is not manifest error to seat a juror who indicates that he would tend \u201cto give some weight to the fact that a witness was a police officer in resolving credibility issues if all else were equal.\u201d Here, Officer Wade\u2019s credibility was not in question, and he was not even cross-examined by Barrett\u2019s counsel. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>338 F.2d 543, 545 (D.C.Cir.1964) (appropriate for court to consider whether credibility of witness will be at issue in case); <em>cf. Core, </em>139 Va. at 13, 124 S.E. at 456 (where credibility of witness to be determined by jury, proper to strike prospective juror who was brother of that witness). In addition, his testimony was not material to Barrett\u2019s conviction, therefore the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in seating James Wade. <em>Cf. Simpson v. State, </em>666 So.2d 100 (Ala.Cr.App.1995); <em>Tucker v. State, </em>454 So.2d 552 (Ala.1984); <em>State v. Kilpatrick, </em>158 W.Va. 289, 210 S.E.2d 480 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In sum, we hold that the record clearly shows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike James Wade for cause. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The relevant portion of the <em>voir dire </em>to which Wade responded is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Wade, your brother is one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">MR.

And then you said in the most instinct or distinct way as far as something, and I said well, it probably would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right, then following up with that, isn\u2019t it possible, because of your brother being the police officer and being the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, that in spite of your best efforts, something, partiality wise or believability wise, will creep in to your filtering and thinking about the evidence in the case if you\u2019re allowed to sit as a juror that may be unfair to my client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">MR. WADE: No.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\">. In <em>Cantrell, </em>the prospective juror was, at the time of the trial, a client of the law firm representing the plaintiff, in a similar personal injury case. In <em>Medici, </em>the prospective juror\u2019s husband had been murdered and his alleged murderer was being represented by the same public defender\u2019s office that was representing the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">. In <em>Core, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court examined the materiality of the witness\u2019 testimony to determine the propriety of striking a prospective juror who was the brother of one of the witnesses in the case, applying, by implication, an abuse of discretion standard, rather than a <em>per se </em>rule. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 124 S.E. at 456. We further note that all of the states which have addressed this issue have similarly found no basis for creating a <em>per se </em>rule disqualifying a prospective juror who is closely related to a witness, such as a parent, child or sibling. <em>See, e.g., Simpson v. State, </em>666 So.2d 100 (Ala.Cr.App.1995); <em>Kelly v. People, </em>121 Colo. 243, 215 P.2d 336 (1950); <em>State v. Lee, </em>559 So.2d 1310 (La. 1990); <em>Smith v.

In the few instances when an appellate court found that the trial court had abused its discretion in seating a close relative of a prosecution witness, the determination turned on either the materiality of the witness\u2019 testimony, <em>see, e.g., Simpson, </em>666 So.2d 100; <em>Tucker v.

I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The case involved the prosecution of Calvin Lee Barrett for felonious assault on a police officer, Virginia State Trooper J.S. Fleming. Trooper Fleming had stopped Barrett\u2019s vehicle after having observed license tag and equipment violations. After being stopped, Barrett' attempted to flee the scene which resulted in Fleming having to forcibly apprehend Barrett. The situation escalated when Barrett reentered his vehicle and attempted to drive away with Fleming holding onto Barrett\u2019s arm through the vehicle window. Trooper Fleming, who had drawn his service weapon, shot Barrett in the chest as he attempted to drive away. After Barrett was apprehended, he was determined to have been an habitual offender and to have been previously convicted of operating a motor vehicle after having been adjudicated an habitual offender. Thus, he was also being prosecuted in this case for feloniously operating a motor vehicle after having been adjudicated an habitual offender, second or subsequent offense. It is from this backdrop that jury <em>voir dire </em>was conducted and that the challenged juror was seated as a member of the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In my opinion, to allow a juror to sit in judgment of a criminal defendant who is charged with feloniously assaulting a police officer, where the juror\u2019s brother is a police officer and a prosecution witness in the case, creates an unacceptable public image and impression of unfairness and partiality. \u201c[C]ourts have an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within ... standards ... that ... appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Wheat v. United States, 486 </em>U.S. 153, 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). \u201cPublic confidence in the integrity of the process is at stake.\u201d <em>Cantrell v. Crews, </em>259 Va. 47, 51, 523 S.E.2d 502, 504 (2000). In my opinion, the trial judge abused his discretion by seating a prospective juror whose impartiality and objectivity were, under these circumstances, in serious doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u201c[T]he right of an accused to trial by \u2018an impartial jury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a constitutional right, reinforced by legislative mandate, [Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 8.01-357 and 19.2-262], and by the Rules\u201d of Court. <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 975-76, 266 S.E.2d 87, 90 (1980).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">Every prospective juror must stand indifferent to the cause, \u201cand <em>any reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d [Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 298, 227 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1976).] \u201cIf there be a reasonable doubt whether the juror possesses these qualifications, that doubt is sufficient to insure his exclusion. For, as has been well said, it is not only important that justice should be impartially administered, but it also should flow through channels as free from suspicion as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 941, 943 (1879)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\"><em>Clements v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 386, 392, 464 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The majority concludes that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 558, 499 S.E.2d 522 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d and remanded on other grounds, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117, <em>on remand, </em>258 Va. 548, 523 S.E.2d 208 (1999), controls this case. In <em>Lilly, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court held that \u201ca juror\u2019s relationship to ... a police officer-witness does not require <em>per se </em>dismissal of that juror from the venire, and the juror may be retained if the trial court is satisfied that the juror can set aside considerations of the relationship and evaluate all the \u2018evidence fairly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 499 S.E.2d at 531. In <em>Lilly, </em>the only basis for challenging the juror\u2019s impartiality was that the juror was a second cousin of the police officer-witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">As the majority notes, <em>\u201c[p]er se </em>rules of disqualification, which are based on \u2018a presumption of [juror] bias or prejudice,\u2019 are disfavored in Virginia.\u201d <em>McGann v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 448, 454, 424 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1992) (citation omitted). As we noted in <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 616, 618-19, 466 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1996) <em>(en banc </em>), the Supreme Court has recognized very limited bases for <em>per se </em>juror disqualification. Relying upon the statement in <em>Lilly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that <em>per se </em>disqualifications are disfavored, the majority apparently concludes that regardless of the degree of kinship between a challenged juror and a witness, we are required to reject a <em>per se </em>disqualification based on degree of kinship. I do not read the holding in <em>Lilly </em>so broadly. While <em>per se </em>disqualifications are disfavored, in my opinion, the teachings of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Cantrell </em>and <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000), would support a holding that a very close familial relationship between a juror and a prosecution witness constitutes a <em>per se </em>disqualification in order to preserve and promote public confidence in our jury system. Therefore, while I would favor adopting a <em>per se </em>rule of disqualification where a prospective juror\u2019s brother is going to be a prosecution witness,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nevertheless, I would reverse because, in my opinion, on the facts of this case the trial judge abused his discretion by seating juror Wade.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Although on review great deference must be .accorded a trial judge\u2019s decision to seat a juror, in my opinion, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>facts of this case, the judge abused his discretion by refusing to remove juror Wade from the venire. Here, the juror, after indicating that \u201ctruthfully\u201d he would give more credibility to his brother\u2019s testimony than he would the defendant, later reiterated several times that he was \u201can impartial person.\u201d The trial judge, stating that he had \u201csome real concern\u201d about the situation, intervened in questioning juror Wade and, after obtaining assurances from him that he was impartial, seated Wade as a member of the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Breeden, </em>situations exist where regardless of the \u201cassertions of the veniremen ... that they could give the defendant a fair trial[, their assurances] did not purge the taint.\u201d 217 Va. at 298, 227 S.E.2d at 735 (citation omitted). Reversing the trial judge\u2019s seating of the juror in <em>Breeden, </em>the Court reiterated the standing principle stated \u201c \u2018by Judge Scott in <em>Armstead\u2019s case </em>11 Leigh, 663, [that] \u201chowever, willing the juror might be to trust himself, the law will not trust him.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Although juror Wade assured the trial judge that he could set aside his familial relationship with his brother-witness and be fair and impartial, in my opinion, we close our eyes to the obvious to expect a juror to stand impartial and indifferent to a criminal defendant who is charged with feloniously assaulting a police officer where the juror\u2019s brother is not only a police officer but a prosecution witness. Moreover, here we have the aggravating circumstance that one of the controverted incidental issues in this case was that the arresting police officer would be asserting that he was justified in shooting the defendant. \u201c[I]t is extremely unlikely the public would have confidence in the integrity of the process\u201d where a juror\u2019s brother is a police officer-witness in a case where the defendant is being tried for feloniously assaulting another police officer, who in turn claims that he had to shoot the defendant in defending against the assault. <em>Medici, </em>260 Va. at 226-27, 532 S.E.2d at 30-31. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Cantrell, </em>even where \u201cthe juror states that the circumstances ... would have no \u2018bearing\u2019 on [his] judgment as a juror and that [he] could \u2018be totally fair to both sides,\u2019 \u201d jury selection \u201cmust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>be administered in a manner that promotes confidence in the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d 259 Va. at 51, 523 S.E.2d at 504. The appearance that juror Wade lacked objectivity and was not impartial is so great in these circumstances that for the court to allow the juror to serve manifests a willingness to administer justice with disregard of \u201c[pjublic confidence in the integrity of the process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the convictions and remand for retrial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. The holding in <em>Lilly </em>does not preclude <em>per se </em>disqualifications where a close familial relationship exists between a juror and witness, such as brothers, spouses, or parent-child. In my opinion, the same compelling reasons that required <em>per se </em>disqualifications in those cases where the juror was closely related to counsel or to a party exist here. <em>See, e.g., Medici, </em>260 Va. at 226-27, 532 S.E.2d at 30-31 (holding that, although there was no reason to question the prospective juror\u2019s honesty and sincerity, where prospective juror\u2019s husband had been murdered and the accused murderer was represented by a lawyer in the same public defender\u2019s office that also served as counsel for the defendant, permitting the juror to be seated under those circumstances, \"would weaken public confidence in the integrity of criminal trials\"); <em>Cantrell, 259 </em>Va. at 49-52, 523 S.E.2d at 503-04 (holding that trial court erred in failing to strike a prospective juror for cause where, at the time of trial, the juror was a client of the law firm representing the plaintiff). A bright-line rule providing for <em>per se </em>disqualification where a juror is within two degrees of affinity or consanguinity of a witness, which would encompass spouses, parents and children, and siblings, would avoid the appearance of bias, would promote the appearance of fairness, and would provide the courts with a consistent and easily applied guideline. <em>See Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 591, 595, 311 S.E.2d 409, 411 (1984) (illustrating the degrees of kindred according to the civil law incorporated into the common law); <em>see also </em>26A C.J.S. <em>Descent &amp; Distribution </em>\u00a7 22 (1956 &amp; Supp.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
