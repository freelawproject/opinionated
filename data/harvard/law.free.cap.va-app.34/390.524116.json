Employer contends the commission erred in calculating claimant\u2019s average weekly wage as $793.45. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>See R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">So viewed, the evidence proved that claimant began performing landscaping work for employer in the spring of 1987. Beginning in November 1987, claimant worked for employer installing Christmas decorations for various businesses. The Christmas decoration work normally began in November and ended in mid-January. From mid-January until October, claimant performed landscaping work for employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>On January 24, 1995, claimant was laid off from his employment because employer eliminated its landscaping division and could not provide claimant with year-round work.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Claimant was not immediately able to find other work and, therefore, received unemployment compensation for two months. In April 1995, claimant found a job with another company performing landscaping work. At the end of October 1995, claimant received a letter from Howell Jewell, employer\u2019s executive vice-president and CEO, requesting that claimant return to work for employer installing seasonal Christmas decorations. As a result, claimant quit his job with his new employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On November 3, 1995, claimant began performing the Christmas decoration work for employer. Claimant was injured on December 15, 1995, when he fell off a roof as he was repairing a garland at a shopping center. For the seven-week period from November 3, 1995 through December 15, 1995, claimant earned $5,554.17 in wages from employer. On December 22, 1995, claimant received a payment of $392 from employer entitled, \u201cbonus,\u201d with a net pay to him of $295.37, after deductions for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In determining that claimant\u2019s average weekly wage was $793.45, the commission found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">[Claimant left the employer\u2019s employment at the end of January 1995 for another job because the employer left the landscaping business. He got a job with another employer, which resulted in a significant gap in employment with the defendant employer. The claimant quit this new job and returned to the defendant employer\u2019s decorating business in November 1995. When he returned to the employer, he began the seasonal decorating job. This job did not involve decorating during certain months and landscaping during others. The claimant worked for the employer only as a decorator when he was injured. This represented a separate and distinct employment with the defendant employer. Therefore, ... the average weekly wage must be based on the claimant\u2019s earnings for the seven-week period prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>his injury because he planned to continue working at some other job after the seasonable [sic] job ended as opposed to not working after the job ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">Additionally, the employer paid the claimant an extra $392 on December 22, 1995. We are not persuaded that the $392 was a gift. While the claimant admitted that the employer was a friend, taxes were withheld from this payment. Clearly, the payment was paid pursuant to the employer/employee relationship. The Deputy Commissioner properly considered the amount as a bonus and incorporated it into the average weekly wage computation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"> Employer argues that the commission \u201cshould have included <em>all </em>of the claimant\u2019s wages with [employer] in the fifty-two weeks prior to the date of accident.\u201d Employer asserts that this calculation would have required the commission to consider claimant\u2019s earnings with employer between December 31, 1994 and January 28, 1995, combined with his earnings after October 1995 through the date of his injury on December 15, 1995. Employer also contends that the $392 paid to claimant on December 22, 1995, although labeled a \u201cbonus,\u201d was actually a \u201cgift\u201d and should not have been considered in determining claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">It [is] the duty of the Commission to make the best possible estimate of future impairments of earnings from the evidence adduced at the hearing, and to determine the average weekly wage.... This is a question of fact to be determined by the Commission which, if based on credible evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\"><em>Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Reeves, </em>1 Va.App. 435, 441, 339 S.E.2d 570, 573 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u201cThe commission is guided by statute in determining average weekly wage.\u201d <em>Dominion </em>Assocs. <em>Group, Inc. v. Queen, </em>17 Va.App. 764, 766, 441 S.E.2d 45, 46 (1994). Code \u00a7 65.2-101 defines \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ads\">l.a. The earnings of the injured employee <em>in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, divided by fifty-two---- <em>When the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of less than fifty-two weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee earned wages shall be followed, </em>provided that results fair and just to both parties will be thereby obtained....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">b. When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">(Emphasis added.) \u201cThe reason for calculating the average weekly wage is to approximate the <em>economic loss </em>suffered by an employee ... when there is a loss of earning capacity because of work-related injury.... \u201d <em>Bosworth v. 7-Up Distrib. Co., </em>4 Va.App. 161, 168, 355 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Here, the employment in which claimant was working at the time of his injury was seasonal Christmas decoration work, which he performed for seven weeks before his injury. At that time, he had not worked for employer as a landscaper for over nine months, and employer was no longer in the landscaping business. Claimant quit his job with the other landscaping company and fully intended to pursue other employment once the seasonal Christmas decorating job with employer ended in January 1996. Under these circumstances, where the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of less than fifty-two weeks, the commission properly followed the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks claimant worked. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">It was undisputed that claimant was employed as a seasonal Christmas decorator from November 3, 1995 through the date of his injury. Uncontradicted and credible evidence also proved that during that time claimant earned a total of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>$5,554.17, including his $892 bonus. Therefore, the commission did not err in using the total of those wages divided by the seven weeks claimant worked for employer to determine that his \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d was $793.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The commission properly included the $392 bonus in calculating claimant\u2019s average weekly wage. The bonus was paid to claimant after employer made deductions for taxes. The commission found, based on credible evidence, that the bonus constituted wages based upon the employer/employee relationship and was not a gift, notwithstanding Jewell\u2019s testimony to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Because credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings, we affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
