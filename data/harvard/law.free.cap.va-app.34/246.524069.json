Hickson (wife) filed a \u201cPetition for Declaratory Judgment\u201d in the trial court, challenging an order vacating a previously entered decree of divorce between wife and Robert D. Hickson (husband). Wife alleged the court was without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>jurisdiction to vacate the decree, resulting in an \u201cactual controversy as to the state of the parties\u2019 marital status,\u201d and prayed the court to declare the decree \u201cfinal and binding between the parties.\u201d In response, husband moved to confirm the order and revisit the divorce and related issues, including equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Concluding that husband \u201cha[d] not had his ... day in court ... because of some oversight or mistake on the part of the court or of the attorney,\u201d the court, citing a general \u201cpower to vacate\u201d the decree, and additional authority to correct \u201c[a]n error of law ... by bill of review,\u201d ruled \u201cthat the\u201d parties are still married.\u201d Wife appeals, arguing Rule 1:1 divested the court of jurisdiction to vacate the decree of divorce twenty-one days after entry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In the context of a bill of complaint for separate maintenance, filed by wife May 13, 1993, husband, on December 29, 1998, lodged a <em>\u201cConditional </em>Motion for Divorce\u201d with the court, which motion was subject to certain specified terms. (Emphasis added). Wife responded on January 9, 1999, and, without disputing husband\u2019s \u201centitle[ment]\u201d to pursue divorce, objected to the proposed conditions. The court addressed husband\u2019s motion in an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing on January 19, 1999, attended only by attorneys representing each party, awarded husband a divorce, without imposing the requested conditions, and directed his counsel to prepare an appropriate decree. Dissatisfied with the result, husband discharged his attorney immediately following the hearing. However, no order was entered of record to relieve his counsel of record, although both attorneys were aware of husband\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On February 3, 1999, wife\u2019s attorney notified the court and husband\u2019s counsel of record that, pursuant to the January 19 hearing, a proposed decree of divorce would be presented to the court for entry on February 16, 1999. Several days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>thereafter, her counsel provided a draft of the decree to the court and husband\u2019s counsel of record. Wife, her attorney, and husband\u2019s counsel of record personally appeared before the court on the appointed day, with husband present, at his request, by telephone. At the inception of the hearing, the court granted the motion of husband\u2019s counsel to withdraw, although she remained and participated in the ensuing hearing. At the conclusion of the proceedings, the court entered the decree previously circulated by wife\u2019s attorney, subject to several insubstantial revisions then disclosed to the parties and counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without endorsement of either husband or his former counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">On March 23, 1999, husband first requested a copy of the decree from the clerk' of the trial court and, after receiving a facsimile, moved the court, on March 29, 1999, to vacate the decree, alleging that the provisions did not comport with his conditional motion and the related proceedings. By order of April 20, 1999, the court granted husband\u2019s motion, \u201cto the extent that this [cjourt has jurisdiction to vacate that final decree,\u201d finding that husband had not received \u201ctimely notice of the earlier entry of the ... decree\u201d and \u201cnow wishes to withdraw\u201d his \u201cconditional motion for divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On September 30, 1999, wife filed the instant suit for declaratory judgment, asserting that Rule 1:1 divested the court of jurisdiction to vacate the decree twenty-one days after entry, and seeking a determination that the divorce was \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d By order entered December 29,1999, the court concluded the decree had been \u201cproperly vacated ... and that the parties are still married,\u201d resulting in the instant appeal by wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Rule 1:1 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>shall remain under the control of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d Thus, \u201c \u2018[a]t the expiration of that 21-day period, the trial court loses jurisdiction to disturb a final judgment, order, or <em>decree.....' \" Bogart v. Bogart, </em>21 Va.App. 280, 290, 464 S.E.2d 157, 161-62 (1995) (quoting <em>School Board of Lynchburg v. Caudill Rowlett Scott, Inc., </em>237 Va. 550, 554, 379 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1989)). However, the finality imposed by the rule is not without exceptions, several of which are relied upon by husband in support of the disputed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Rule 1:13 directs that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxW\">[djrafts of orders and decrees shall be endorsed by counsel of record, or reasonable notice of the time and place of presenting such drafts together with copies thereof shall be served by delivering, dispatching by commercial delivery service, transmitting by facsimile or mailing to all counsel of record who have not endorsed them. Compliance with this rule and with Rule 1:12 may be modified or dispensed with by the court in its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201cThis rule is designed to protect parties without notice,\u201d <em>Davis v. Mullins, </em>251 Va. 141, 147, 466 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1996), and, notwithstanding Rule 1:1, \u201cfailure to comply ... renders an order voidable.\u201d <em>Singh v. Mooney, </em>\u2014 Va.\u2014,\u2014, 541 S.E.2d 549, 551 (2001); <em>see Francis v. Francis, </em>30 Va.App. 584, 518 S.E.2d 842 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Relying upon Rule 1:13, husband maintains that the divorce decree, arising from improper notice to his <em>former </em>counsel and lacking endorsement, was invalid and vulnerable to attack, a contention not novel to this Court. In resolving an appeal on similar facts in <em>Francis, </em>we concluded, \u201c[o]nce an attorney has appeared as the counsel of record, service on the counsel is proper until the court enters a withdrawal order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 518 S.E.2d at 845; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-314 (\u201cany process, order, or other legal papers ... may be served on ... attorney of record\u201d); <em>see also </em>Rule 1:5 (\u201c[c]ounsel of record shall not withdraw from a case except by leave of court\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Such service, \u201cduring the midst of ongoing litigation is notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the course of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Francis, </em>30 Va.App. at 590, 518 S.E.2d at 846. Thus, \u201c[u]ntil [husband\u2019s] counsel had effectively withdrawn, ... service upon [her] was proper\u201d and in compliance with Rule 1:13, despite the absence of endorsement and actual notice to both the court and opposing counsel that husband \u201cwas no longer represented by counsel of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591-92, 518 S.E.2d at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Husband next contends that the court was authorized to vacate the decree pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428, which permits correction, \u201cat any time,\u201d of \u201c[clerical mistakes in all judgments or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or ... inadvertent omission.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-428(B). He asserts that the clerk\u2019s failure to provide \u201cany notice of the entry of the order\u201d departed from \u201ccustomary practice\u201d and constituted an \u201cinadvertent omission\u201d that \u201cdeprived [him] of any notice of the entry of the order.\u201d However, husband\u2019s argument is belied by a record that reflects proper notice of the proposed decree and entry, his personal presence, albeit telephonically, at the related hearing and awareness of the attendant revisions. Such circumstances clearly do not establish clerical deficiencies in the decree either supportive of husband\u2019s argument or contemplated by Code \u00a7 8.01-428(B). <em>See, e.g., School Board of Lynchburg, </em>237 Va. at 554-55, 379 S.E.2d at 321 (statute codifies inherent authority of court to \u201ccorrect the record to ... \u2018speak the truth\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Finally, husband relies upon reference by the trial court in the subject order to a \u201cbill of review\u201d as authority to vacate the divorce decree. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-623, a bill of review is an extraordinary injunctive remedy to redress \u201c \u2018errors of law apparent on the face of the record,\u2019 \u201d predicated upon a pleading that \u201cidentifies, with the requisite degree of accuracy and definiteness, [such] errors.\u201d <em>Blunt v. Lentz, </em>241 Va. 547, 550, 404 S.E.2d 62, 64 (1991) (citation omitted). A \u201cprocedural device,\u201d \u201climited in scope,\u201d the relief is \u201crarely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>used\u201d and \u201cdiscouraged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 404 S.E.2d at 63-64. Here, the record discloses neither the pleadings requisite to a bill of review nor circumstances in justification of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Accordingly, the trial court was without jurisdiction to vacate the decree of divorce, and we reverse the instant declaratory judgment order to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\">. The appeal is before us on a \u201cWritten Statement of Facts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\">. Revisions to the draft decree noted husband\u2019s presence \"in person\u201d at the hearing, corrected the birthdate of a child born to the marriage and the date of separation, and denied wife attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
