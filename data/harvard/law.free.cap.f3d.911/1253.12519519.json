Approximately four years later, he, his younger sister, and his mother moved to San Jose, California, to join Torres's father, who had entered the United States a year earlier. Nothing in the record suggests that either of Torres's parents ever had an immigration status through which Torres could qualify for legal status in the United States. Torres was enrolled in the school system in San Jose from 1991 until he was expelled in\n   2000. This expulsion resulted from Torres's affiliation with the Sur Santos Pride gang, which he joined at age fourteen. Because of his gang involvement and attendant trouble at school, Torres's parents sent him back to live in Mexico in 2002, when he was sixteen years old. After he reached adulthood, Torres attempted to unlawfully enter the United States three times in June 2005. During each of his first two attempts, Torres was apprehended and permitted to voluntarily return to Mexico. However, he successfully entered the United States unlawfully on the third attempt. Upon this reentry, Torres joined his family in San Jose and began working with his father in landscaping. In 2012, Torres married a United States citizen in San Jose. However, Torres never applied for legal status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2014, a citizen reported to the Los Gatos Police Department that there was a suspicious pickup truck in a nearby parking lot and that its driver might be attempting to sell a stolen bicycle. When officers arrived, the driver's side door of the suspicious pickup was open. The officers found Torres working on something on the bed of the vehicle. Through the open driver's side door, officers saw a backpack and what appeared to be counterfeit license plates. The bed of the pickup contained \"a newer looking Trek road bike.\" Torres told the officers that he owned the bicycle and that he had received it as a gift in December 2013. However, by reporting the bicycle's serial number to dispatch, officers confirmed that it had been reported stolen two days earlier. When later confronted with this information, Torres admitted he knew the bicycle was stolen. Officers requested that Torres provide identification. Torres responded that it was in his vehicle. When Torres began to reach into the pickup to allegedly retrieve his identification, the officers stopped him out of concern for safety. An officer then looked into the vehicle and did not see any identification, but the officer asked if he could look inside Torres's backpack. Torres consented. Inside the backpack, the officer found a loaded .22 caliber revolver, bolt cutters, and what appeared to be two homemade silencers for the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon this discovery, officers placed Torres under arrest. In addition to the contents of Torres's backpack, the subsequent search of his vehicle revealed a small amount of methamphetamine and a glass pipe. Officers transported Torres to a holding facility where they explained his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights to him before conducting an interview. In response to questions about two of his tattoos that indicated a gang affiliation, Torres admitted to being an active member of Sur Santos Pride. According to Torres, the stolen bicycle and the backpack containing the firearm had been placed in his vehicle by a friend (a fellow gang member), whose identity Torres refused to reveal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, Torres was federally indicted in the Northern District of California for one count of being an unlawful alien in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Torres moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Second Amendment protections apply to unlawful aliens and that \u00a7 922(g)(5) violates the Second Amendment. The district court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to trial, resulting in Torres's conviction. The district court imposed a sentence of twenty-seven months of incarceration followed by three years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Torres admits that he is an alien unlawfully present in the United States and that he possessed the firearm found in his vehicle. However, he contests his conviction by challenging on constitutional grounds the federal statute under which he was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We consider challenges to the constitutionality of a statute de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend. II. We must answer, as an issue of first impression in our circuit, whether this right is violated by a federal criminal statute prohibiting the possession of a firearm by an alien unlawfully in this country. The Second Amendment's application to unlawful aliens has been widely debated among courts and scholars in recent years, with analytical divisions even among those agreeing in result. We proceed to address this issue, first, by outlining the general framework to analyze challenges under the Second Amendment. We then review the approach of other circuits to Second Amendment challenges to the specific statute at issue. Finally turning to the parties' arguments, we assume (without deciding) that the Second Amendment extends to unlawful aliens, and we conclude that \u00a7 922(g)(5) is constitutional under intermediate scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Central to the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment is \"the inherent right of self-defense.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.
