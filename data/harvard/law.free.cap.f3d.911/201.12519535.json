On appeal, Defendant raises numerous grounds for setting aside his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court reversibly erred in refusing to suppress inculpatory statements Defendant made during a custodial interrogation. We further hold that the district court erred in failing to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of confidential law enforcement records requested by Defendant, when Defendant established the confidential records plausibly contained materially favorable information. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 2012, law enforcement officers began investigating the sale and distribution of unlawful synthetic cannabinoids (known as \"spice\") in Newport News, Virginia and the surrounding area. During the investigation, the officers received complaints that spice was being sold at a local Red Barn gas station and convenience store that was owned and operated by Defendant and his son. The officers conducted multiple controlled purchases of spice at the Red Barn, the last of which occurred on September 16, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Two days after the last purchase, the officers executed a search warrant at the Red Barn. Inside, they found and seized cardboard parcels filled with packages of spice; a digital scale; $109,308 in cash; and two keys. One of the keys opened a storage unit containing more spice and the other key opened Defendant's safe deposit box. After obtaining another warrant, the officers seized an additional $701,450 in cash from the safe deposit box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the United States Customs and Border Protection sent Defendant notice that it had confiscated his property and that he could file an administrative petition for its return. Defendant filed two sworn petitions to recover the two sums of cash that had been confiscated from the Red Barn and the safe deposit box. Each petition stated: \"I maintain my earnings in cash form for religious reasons. I am a Muslim and I strictly adhere to the tenets of my faith. One of these is the law against usury. I, therefore, do not maintain a bank account and whenever possible keep my money in cash ... and other tangible forms that do not accrue interest.\" J.A. 777-79. But Defendant had multiple bank accounts and had conducted bank transactions on the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the search, Defendant sold the Red Barn and bought another building at the former Newport Video location. Thereafter, Defendant's son emailed Michael McMahon-the owner of a spice distribution company-and informed McMahon that he and Defendant wanted to use the Newport Video location to sell spice wholesale. The officers intercepted these emails and began to track the location's packages. On April 20, 2015, the officers executed a search warrant at the Newport Video location, during which they found additional spice, a revolver, crack cocaine, drug paraphernalia, and $10,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Five days before the Newport Video search, a federal grand jury returned its first indictment against Defendant and, that same day, a federal court issued an arrest warrant for Defendant. The officers arrested Defendant at the Newport Video location and took him to the Newport News Police Headquarters for interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Three officers were present for Defendant's interrogation: (1) Special Agent Lewis of the Department of Homeland Security, (2) Inspector Sylvester of the United States Postal Inspection Service, and (3) Detective Calhoon of the Newport News Police Department. Special Agent Lewis and Inspector Sylvester later recounted Defendant's interrogation during a suppression hearing before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Defendant exercised his right not to testify, and the district court ultimately adopted the officers' recitation of events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Abdallah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182012\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/599/\">\n    196 F.Supp.3d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The officers chose not to record the interrogation. Instead, Inspector Sylvester took notes and Detective Calhoon observed while Special Agent Lewis interrogated Defendant. According to the officers, Special Agent Lewis started the interrogation by reading Defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Defendant purportedly interrupted \"approximately halfway\" through to inform the officers that he \"wasn't going to say anything at all.\" J.A. 79;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abdallah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182012\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/599/\">\n    196 F.Supp.3d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Agent Lewis responded by stating, \"Well, just let me finish your Warning first.\" J.A. 79. Immediately after the warning, Agent Lewis asked, \"Do you even know why you're under arrest[?]\" Defendant responded, \"No, tell me.\" J.A. 79. Agent Lewis then repeated the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning. This time, Defendant did not interrupt, and Defendant indicated that he understood his rights. Defendant subsequently made multiple inculpatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The officers also described Defendant's demeanor during the interrogation. Both Special Agent Lewis and Inspector Sylvester testified that Defendant was \"lucid,\" \"very upbeat, jovial, [and] very animated.\" J.A. 79, 112, 127. During cross-examination, Agent Lewis agreed with defense\n   counsel that Defendant was \"very cooperative,\" not difficult, \"very forthcoming,\" and was not \"the type of person that had an attitude.\" J.A. 96-97. Finally, Agent Lewis acknowledged that Defendant's demeanor \"[s]urprisingly\" did not \"change at all during the course of the interview.\" J.A. 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 1, 2016, Defendant filed a motion to suppress all statements made during his custodial interrogation. Defendant first argued that by stating that he \"was not going to say anything at all,\" he unambiguously requested to remain silent. Because the officers failed to scrupulously honor Defendant's request, Defendant maintained his statements were inadmissible. The district court denied Defendant's suppression motion, finding his invocation to be \"ambiguous, especially given the fact that he voluntarily waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights minutes later once informed of the charges against him and the subject of the interrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    Abdallah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182012\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/599/\">\n    196 F.Supp.3d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant also sought suppression because \"it is not clear what if any\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were given.\" J.A. 46. Defendant noted the officers did not record the interrogation and only Inspector Sylvester took notes. Inspector Sylvester's handwritten notes first state, \"\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   from DHS form-understood,\" and, on the next line, Defendant was \"Not going to say anything at all.\" J.A. 154. Inspector Sylvester's contemporaneous notes nowhere suggest that Defendant interrupted his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the interrogation, Agent Lewis drafted a report from his memory. Agent Lewis emailed that draft to Detective Calhoon and Inspector Sylvester, which prompted \"some modifications.\" J.A. 92. Eight days after the interrogation, Agent Lewis issued a final typewritten report indicating that Defendant interjected halfway through the first set of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Claiming inconsistencies between Inspector Sylvester's contemporaneous notes and the final report, Defendant requested production of the officers' emails pertaining to the drafting of the report. The district court denied Defendant's production request, relying on Agent Lewis's representation that he had not removed a request for counsel or a request to remain silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 2, 2016, Defendant moved for the district court to reconsider his motions requesting production of the drafting exchange and for suppression of his statement. In support, Defendant asserted that, after reviewing a copy of Agent Lewis's grand jury testimony, Defendant found what he considered to be additional inconsistencies among Agent Lewis's grand jury testimony, his suppression hearing testimony, and the final report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In particular, during the suppression hearing, Agent Lewis testified that he did not obtain a written\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver from Defendant because he did not want to \"interrupt the flow\" of the interrogation. J.A. 101-02. Agent Lewis also testified that Defendant was \"moving a mile a minute\" and he \"did not want to stifle the statements that [Defendant] was making.\" J.A. 101-02. By contrast, Agent Lewis testified to the grand jury that Defendant had waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights \"both orally and in writing\"\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the interrogation. J.A. 1256. Furthermore, Agent Lewis told the grand jury that Defendant \"started off slow\" after receiving the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning-contrary to Agent Lewis's suppression hearing testimony that Defendant was \"moving a mile a minute.\" J.A. 1264. Finally, Agent Lewis did not testify before the grand jury that Defendant interrupted his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to say he \"wasn't going to say anything at all.\" On March 16, 2017,\n   the district court again denied Defendant's production and suppression motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Beginning October 4, 2016, Defendant was tried by jury before the district court. During Defendant's trial, the government introduced much of Defendant's confession through Inspector Sylvester's testimony. For example, Inspector Sylvester informed the jury that Defendant had provided a detailed explanation of his spice distribution relationship with McMahon. Defendant also told the officers that he sold spice to \"pretty much everybody\" and had sold approximately 10,000 grams of spice. When asked about the crack cocaine and paraphernalia found during the Newport Video search, Defendant admitted that he used crack cocaine and had smoked crack cocaine two days prior. Defendant also stated that he would give prostitutes crack cocaine as a \"bonus.\" Regarding the safe deposit box, Defendant told the officers that he had a second safe deposit box that the officers were \"too late\" to seize. From that box, Defendant escaped with $150,000. Finally, Inspector Sylvester testified that Defendant \"said his understanding was that [spice] was illegal under federal law.\" J.A. 343. Relying on that statement in Defendant's confession, the government emphasized during closing arguments that Defendant \"told agents [spice] was illegal.\" J.A. 1148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After twelve days of trial, the jury convicted Defendant of (1) one count of conspiring to distribute Schedule I controlled substances and controlled substance analogues (i.e., spice), in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) one count of possessing a Schedule I controlled substance (i.e., spice) with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C) ; (3) one count of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute a Schedule II controlled substance (i.e., crack cocaine), in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (4) two counts of making false statements to the federal government (i.e., one count for each of his sworn petitions to Customs), in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal, Defendant first argues that the officers violated his Fifth Amendment rights when the officers continued to question him after he unambiguously invoked his right to remain silent and therefore that the district court erred by failing to suppress the statements Defendant made in response to those questions. \"We review the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court's legal determinations de novo. When a suppression motion has been denied, this Court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hashime\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718083\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/278/#p282\">\n    734 F.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282 (4th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). On review, we agree with Defendant. Because law enforcement officers failed to scrupulously honor Defendant's unequivocal invocation of the right to remain silent, the district court erred by failing to grant Defendant's motions to suppress and reconsider suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides: \"[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself[.]\" U.S. Const. amend. V. To protect this constitutional right against self-incrimination, the Supreme Court's landmark decision in\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   established certain \"procedural safeguards\" that officers must comply with to subject a suspect to custodial\n   interrogation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 478-79,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p478\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966).

For example, Inspector Sylvester's handwritten notes said, \"\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   from DHS form-understood\"\n   <em>\n    and then\n   </em>\n   Defendant was \"not going to say anything at all.\" J.A. 154. These contemporaneous handwritten notes do not mention Defendant interrupting his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In contrast, Agent Lewis's final report states that Defendant interrupted halfway through his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Furthermore, Agent Lewis testified during the suppression hearing that there were \"some modifications\" made over the eight-day drafting period. J.A. 92. Based on Agent Lewis's testimony and these inconsistencies-inconsistencies that could plausibly lead to evidence and arguments materially favorable to Defendant-Defendant requested production of the email exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Together, this evidence was sufficient to meet the \"meager\" plausibility requirement for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414808\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/1305/#p1313\">\n    57 F.3d at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the district court denied Defendant's request solely based upon Agent Lewis's representation that there would not be exculpatory information in the officers' emails pertaining to the drafting of the report.

There, Defendant demonstrated additional substantial inconsistencies between Agent Lewis's suppression hearing testimony, grand jury testimony, and final typewritten report. For example, Agent Lewis testified at the suppression hearing that he did not use a written waiver because Defendant was \"moving a mile a minute\" and he \"did not want to stifle\" Defendant's statements. J.A. 101-02. But Agent Lewis testified before the grand jury that Defendant waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights \"both orally and in writing\" prior to the interrogation. J.A. 1256. Furthermore, Agent Lewis told the grand jury that Defendant \"started off slow\" after receiving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. J.A. 1264. And Agent Lewis did not tell the grand jury that Defendant interrupted his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We recognize that the requested emails \"may contain nothing helpful to\" the Defendant.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075990\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/693/#p702\">\n    628 F.3d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as was previously discussed, Defendant's confession contributed to each count for which the jury convicted Defendant. It was critical for Defendant's \"entire defense\" to establish that he unambiguously invoked the right to remain silent and to impeach the officers' credibility on the nature and timing of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075990\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/693/#p702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075990\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/693/#p702\">\n    at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based upon: (1) the inconsistencies that existed between Inspector Sylvester's contemporaneous handwritten notes and Agent Lewis's final report, (2) the inconsistencies in Agent Lewis's grand jury testimony and suppression hearing testimony, and (3) Agent Lewis's own testimony that there were \"some modifications\" over the course of the drafting exchange, it is plausible that an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the specific drafting exchange would reveal evidence that was materially favorable to Defendant's challenge of when\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were given. The district court thus erred in failing to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant raises several additional arguments on appeal. For reasons briefly discussed below, each of these arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant first contends that the district court erred by limiting non-party witnesses' testimony on whether\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   believed-not whether\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   believed-that spice was illegal. We review \"a trial court's rulings on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion\" and \"will only overturn an evidentiary ruling that is arbitrary and irrational.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Trial courts have \"wide latitude\" to \"place limitations upon the cross-examination of witnesses ... based on concerns including harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, repetition, or marginal relevance.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Zayyad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899130\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/452/#p459\">\n    741 F.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 (4th Cir. 2014) (citations and alterations omitted). Furthermore, we \"rarely reverse relevancy decisions because they are fundamentally a matter of trial management.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899130\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/452/#p459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). Under this deferential standard of review, the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding non-party witnesses' testimony on whether they believed spice was illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Zayyad\n   </em>\n   , the defendant sought to cross-examine non-party witnesses on their knowledge of the \"gray market\" to show that the defendant \"reasonably believed that he dispensed real [as opposed to counterfeit] drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899130\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/452/#p459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899130\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/452/#p459\">\n    at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court excluded this testimony, finding the witnesses' knowledge of the gray market was not relevant to the defendant's\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899130\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/452/#p459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 459 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 402 (\"Irrelevant evidence is not admissible\") ). This Court affirmed. We explained that absent some showing that the defendant relied on the witnesses' belief, the district court reasonably determined that this testimony was merely a distraction, having \"no connection to the knowledge element [of the crime] and consequently no relevance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899130\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/452/#p459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899130\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/452/#p459\">\n    at 460-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Zayyad\n   </em>\n   , the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of non-party witnesses regarding their knowledge of the illegality of spice. Defendant did not establish any connection between the witnesses' knowledge and Defendant's own\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   at trial. Without this connection, the district court could reasonably determine that the witnesses' knowledge would confuse the jury as to the critical issue it was tasked with deciding-whether\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   knew spice was illegal. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the non-party witnesses' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendant also challenges the district court's reliance on Agent Lewis's conflicting testimony in denying Defendant's motion to suppress. According to Defendant, the district court \"should have considered the conflicting testimony of Special Agent Lewis [and therefore] granted the motion for reconsideration.\" Appellant's Br. at 17. But even when there are \"serious questions about the credibility of some of the government's witnesses ... it is for the [factfinder] and not the appellate court to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"509212\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/118/228/#p236\">\n    118 F.3d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (4th Cir. 1997). Unlike the appellate court, the factfinder has \"the opportunity to observe the witnesses, listen to their testimony, and [is] in the best position to make the credibility finding.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

App'x 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207 (4th Cir. 2008) (unpublished opinion). Despite the inconsistencies which existed among Agent Lewis's grand jury testimony, suppression hearing testimony, and in the final typewritten report, it was ultimately for the district court to observe Agent Lewis and weigh the credibility of testimony at the hearing. Defendant has presented no evidence to suggest that the district court failed to meet its obligation, and there is no basis for us to conclude the district court erred in crediting Agent Lewis's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant did not raise this argument below. When, as here, a defendant fails to object to an improper closing argument at trial, this Court's review is limited to plain error.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under this circumscribed standard of review, we reject Defendant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Improper closing arguments by a prosecutor \"may so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To determine whether a prosecutor's argument violated a defendant's due process rights, this Court examines: \"(1) whether the remarks were, in fact, improper, and, (2) if so, whether the improper remarks so prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights that the defendant was denied a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049666\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/321/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the context of using false testimony, prosecutorial misconduct occurs \"not only where the prosecution uses perjured testimony to support its case, but also where it uses evidence which it knows creates a false impression of a material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamric v.

At trial, Inspector Sylvester did not mention that Defendant thought spice was legal in Virginia. Instead, Inspector Sylvester testified that Defendant's \"understanding was that [spice] was illegal under federal law.\" J.A. 343.

We disagree. First, Inspector Sylvester's statement was literally true. Defendant had in fact stated that spice was illegal under federal law. Though Inspector Sylvester omitted Defendant's statement that spice was \"legal in Virginia,\" this omission is immaterial to the knowledge element of the Analogue Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). To the extent that the government sought to prove Defendant's knowledge under the first\n   <em>\n    McFadden\n   </em>\n   method, it is simply irrelevant whether Defendant believed spice was legal under\n   <em>\n    Virginia\n   </em>\n   law. Instead, what is relevant is that Defendant knew spice was listed on the\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   drug schedules. To the extent that the government sought to prove knowledge under the second\n   <em>\n    McFadden\n   </em>\n   method, all that is pertinent is that Defendant knew the identity of the controlled substance.
