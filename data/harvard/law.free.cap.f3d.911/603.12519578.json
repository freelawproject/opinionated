She now appeals the district court's summary judgment ruling that her subsequent lawsuit against St. James under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") was barred by the First Amendment's \"ministerial exception\" to generally applicable employment laws. We hold that, assessing the totality of Biel's role at St. James, the ministerial exception does not foreclose her claim. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Biel received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts and a teaching credential from California State University, Dominguez Hills. After graduating in 2009, Biel worked at two tutoring companies and as a substitute teacher at several public and private schools. St. James, a Roman Catholic parish school within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, hired Biel in March 2013 as a long-term substitute teacher. At the end of that school year, St. James's principal hired Biel as the school's full-time fifth grade teacher. Biel is herself Catholic, and St. James prefers to hire Catholic teachers, but being Catholic is not a requirement for teaching positions at St. James. Biel had no training in Catholic pedagogy at the time she was hired. Her only such training was during her tenure at St. James: a single half-day conference where topics ranged from the incorporation of religious themes into lesson plans to techniques for teaching art classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Biel taught the fifth graders at St. James all their academic subjects. Among these was a standard religion curriculum that she taught for about thirty minutes a day, four days a week, using a workbook on the Catholic faith prescribed by the school administration. Biel also joined her students in twice-daily prayers but did not lead them; that responsibility fell to student prayer leaders. She likewise attended a school-wide monthly Mass where her sole responsibility was to keep her class quiet and orderly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Biel's contract stated that she would work \"within [St. James's] overriding commitment\" to Church \"doctrines, laws, and norms\" and would \"model, teach, and promote behavior in conformity to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.\" St. James's mission statement provides that the school \"work[s] to facilitate the development of confident, competent, and caring Catholic-Christian citizens prepared to be responsible members of their church[,] local[,] and global communities.\" According to the school's faculty handbook, teachers at St. James \"participate in the Church's mission\" of providing \"quality Catholic education to ... students, educating them in academic areas and in ... Catholic faith\n   and values.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The faculty handbook further instructs teachers to follow not only archdiocesan curricular guidelines but also California's public-school curricular requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2013, Biel received a positive teaching evaluation from St. James's principal, Sister Mary Margaret, measuring her performance in aspects both secular (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , her lesson planning strategies) and religious (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , displaying Church symbols in her classroom). The principal's written evaluation praised Biel's \"very good\" work promoting a safe and caring learning environment, noted that she adapted her teaching methods to accommodate her students' varied learning styles, and observed that she encouraged social development and responsibility. The principal also identified some areas for improvement: for instance, Biel's students had many items on their desks and two students were coloring in the pages of their books.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Less than six months after that evaluation-which was her first and only formal evaluation at St. James-Biel learned that she had breast cancer and informed the school administration that her condition required her to take time off to undergo surgery and chemotherapy. Sister Mary Margaret told Biel a few weeks later that she would not renew Biel's contract for the next academic year, citing her belief that Biel's \"classroom management\" was \"not strict\" and that \"it was not fair ... to have two teachers for the children during the school year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Biel sued St. James in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that her termination violated the ADA, which prohibits employment discrimination based on disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Following discovery, St. James moved for summary judgment, arguing that the First Amendment's ministerial exception to generally applicable employment laws barred Biel's ADA claims. The district court agreed and granted summary judgment for St. James.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Brunozzi v.

These principles guide our analysis here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Biel does not dispute that St. James, as a part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, is the type of religious organization that could potentially invoke the ministerial exception as a defense.

The Court focused on four major considerations to determine if the ministerial exception applied: (1) whether the employer held the employee out as a minister, (2) whether the employee's title reflected ministerial substance and training, (3) whether the employee held herself out as a minister, and (4) whether the employee's job duties included \"important religious functions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Biel's role in Catholic religious education was limited to teaching religion from a book required by the school and incorporating religious themes into her other lessons. Whereas Perich orchestrated her students' daily prayers, Biel's students themselves led the class in prayers. Biel gave students the opportunity to lead the prayers and joined in, but she did not teach, lead, or plan these devotions herself. Similarly, while Perich crafted and led religious services for the school, Biel's responsibilities at St. James's monthly Mass were only \"to accompany her students,\" and \"[t]o make sure the kids were quiet and in their seats.\" These tasks do not amount to the kind of close guidance and involvement that Perich had in her students' spiritual lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   St. James argues that we should reach a contrary conclusion in light of the Seventh Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Grussgott v.

Although the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Grussgott\n   </em>\n   lacked a formal religious title, she had obtained a certification in a Jewish curricular program called Tal Am-a curriculum that involved integrating religious teachings into Hebrew lessons, as the Seventh Circuit noted in its\n   analysis of the plaintiff's job title.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">\n    at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In her religion class, she used the curriculum\n   from\n   <em>\n    Coming to God's Life\n   </em>\n   , a Catholic textbook chosen by the school principal, Sister Mary Margaret. Using that curriculum, Biel taught and tested the students in her religion class about the Catholic sacraments, the lives of Catholic Saints, Catholic prayers, Catholic social teaching, Gospel stories, and church holidays. In her secular classes, she was expected to incorporate Catholic teachings.

Its success depends upon the professional competence, quality, and commitment of the teacher who chooses to teach in a Catholic school.\" This Code of Ethics detailed various commitments that Catholic school teachers in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles were expected to fulfill.

To achieve this goal, \"[the staff] guide the spiritual formation of the student ... and hope to help each child strengthen his/her personal relationship with God.\" The handbook further explained that staff implement that goal by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Teaching the Gospel message and Catholic doctrine in such a way as to make them relevant to everyday life ...

Here, Biel never received any diploma or commissioning from the parish comparable to the teacher in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   . Her title is apparently secular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   However, as the majority recognizes, a title is merely an expression of how an employer holds its employee out to the community. Part of St. James's expression of Biel's role in the school is her designation as a \"Catholic school educator[ ]\" in the school's Code of Ethics. The Code conveyed to the community that Catholic school educators such as Biel would, among other things, \"[p]romote the peace of Christ in the world.\" Biel's title is presumably both \"Catholic school educator[ ]\" and \"Grade 5 Teacher,\" the former contextualizing the latter. St. James thus holds Biel out as a distinctively Catholic Grade 5 Teacher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This first factor could therefore indicate that Biel was a minister. In fact, some of the \"called\" language that was important to determining that the teacher in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   was a minister is also present in the faculty handbook in this case. For instance, in the Code of Ethics, under \"Commitment to the Community,\" the handbook reads \"As Catholic school educators, we are\n   <em>\n    called\n   </em>\n   to ...

Considering other elements under the second factor facilitates the ministerial exception's application to different religions, including those that may not require formal training for ministers.

In\n   <em>\n    Fratello\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit ultimately concluded that a \"lay principal\" of a Catholic elementary school was a minister.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275802\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/190/#p204\">\n    863 F.3d at 206, 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similarly, the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Grussgott\n   </em>\n   held that the second factor weighed in favor of applying the exception to a Hebrew language teacher at a Jewish school, not only because of her religious training, but also because \"the substance of [the teacher's] title as conveyed to her and as perceived by others entails the teaching of the Jewish religion to students.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">\n    882 F.3d at 659-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The majority distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Grussgott\n   </em>\n   based on the teacher's Tal Am certification, but in\n   <em>\n    Grussgott\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit specifically noted that there was nothing in the record indicating what the Tal Am certification entailed beyond completion of seminars.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">\n    at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though the Seventh Circuit found that the teacher's Tal Am certification was not material to its analysis, the court nevertheless held that the teacher's curriculum and experience teaching religion \"support[ed] the application of the ministerial exception\" at the second factor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515987\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/655/\">\n    at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to the majority's conclusion, this case is not distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Grussgott\n   </em>\n   based on a certification that may or may not have indicated any significant degree of education or training. The Seventh Circuit's consideration of curriculum and teaching experience under the second\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   factor supports the conclusion that this factor encompasses more than just training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even more explicitly than in\n   <em>\n    Grussgott\n   </em>\n   , the substance of Biel's title as the Grade 5 Teacher encompasses her responsibility for all facets of her pupils' education, which unquestionably includes religion class and imparting the substantive teachings of the Catholic faith. In addition to her role as the religion teacher, Biel agreed in her contract that she \"understood that the mission of the School [was] to develop and promote a Catholic School Faith Community within the philosophy of Catholic education as implemented at the School, and the doctrines, laws and norms of the Catholic Church.\" The faculty handbook extensively prescribes how the faculty should model the Catholic faith and promote religious development. Additionally, Biel was required to attend a Catholic education conference, which focused on incorporating religion into lesson plans. Finally, her contract was approved by both St. James's principal, Sister Mary Margaret, and the pastor of the parish, and it clarified that her role as a fifth grade teacher included teaching religion, specifically the Catholic faith. Because all of these expectations were included in Biel's role and in the title given to her by St. James, I conclude that her title reflected significant religious substance. This factor\n   therefore weighs in favor of applying the exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Her claim that she executed her duties in a secular manner directly conflicts with her contractual agreement to \"integrate Catholic thought\" into subjects, \"celebrate regularly scheduled Masses ... with students,\" and \"encourage student participation in liturgical services.\" In fact, under \"Staff Guidelines and Responsibilities\" in the handbook, teachers are specifically expected to do more than merely keep their elementary students quiet during mass-they are expected to prepare their students for mass: \"Teachers prepare their students to be active participants at Mass, with particular emphasis on Mass responses.\" Biel indicated that her students participated in mass by presenting the gifts, i.e., the Eucharist. Biel's students were trained to present the gifts, and Biel was available to review the practice with them if necessary. Biel's role at mass was also to personally demonstrate her faith through active participation in \"worship-centered school events.\" Biel's role as an \"exemplar[ ] of practicing\" Catholics would not make her a minister if that were her only religious function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

However, the teacher in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   was within the Protestant Christian framework, and therefore the terminology of her employment very neatly fit within the ministerial exception.

Contrary to the dissent's implication, had St. James asserted a religious justification for terminating Biel, our holding would neither have commanded nor permitted the district court to assess the religious validity of that explanation, but rather only whether the proffered justification was the actual motivation for termination, or whether not wanting to accommodate Biel's disability was the motivation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The faculty handbook is specifically referenced in Biel's employment contract: \"You shall be familiar with, and comply with the School's personnel policies and procedures ... including policies in the faculty handbook.\" The handbook provides insight into St. James's expectations for faculty at the school. Like Biel's performance review, the handbook is a reflection of the role St. James intended Biel to fill. Regardless of whether it imposed contractual obligations on Biel, it is helpful to our determination of whether the relationship between Biel and St. James was that of a minister and church or merely an employee-employer relationship.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The majority suggests that because the ADA and Title VII lack a religious organization exemption, courts must take care not to \"invalidate unnecessarily vast swaths of federal law as applied to many employees of religious organizations.\" Maj.

In\n    <em>\n     Bollard\n    </em>\n    , we held that \"[d]espite the lack of a statutory basis for the ministerial exception, and despite Congress' apparent intent to apply Title VII to religious organizations as to any other employer, courts have uniformly concluded that the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses ... require a narrowing construction\" to prevent \"constitutionally impermissible interference by the government.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11558336\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/940/#p946\">\n     196 F.3d at 945\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

However, the record indicates that Biel's prayer leaders led the class in prayer: \"I had prayer leaders. The prayers that were said in the classroom were said mostly by the students.
