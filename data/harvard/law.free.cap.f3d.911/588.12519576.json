(\"Mirage,\" or the \"Company\"). Mirage operates a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The Union represents Mirage's food and beverage employees. A collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") governed the parties' relationship from 2007 to 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December of 2012, the Union filed a grievance against Mirage pursuant to Article 21 of the CBA, captioned \"Grievance and Arbitration.\" The grievance culminated in an arbitration award in Mirage's favor after the arbitrator concluded that the grievance was \"not arbitrable.\" The Union petitioned the district court to vacate the arbitrator's award pursuant to \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and Mirage filed a cross-petition seeking confirmation of the award. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court confirmed the award, and the Union timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The events leading up to the Union's grievance are straightforward. In late 2009, Mirage subcontracted with Beale Street Blues Company Las Vegas, LLC (\"BB King's\") to operate a food and beverage venue called BB King's Blues Club and Grill at the Mirage. Their Memorandum of Agreement (\"MOA\") provided that BB King's would \"directly employ\" the Union's food and beverage employees and would be responsible for paying their wages and employee benefits. Mirage, however, would \"at all times hold and exercise full control over the terms and conditions of employment of all of the employees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BB King's opened at the Mirage in November of 2009, but its run was short-lived: BB King's declared bankruptcy in 2011 and shuttered permanently in November of 2012. At the time of BB King's closing, many of its employees had accrued vacation time for which the Union believed they had a right to payment under the terms of the CBA. When BB King's failed to pay these benefits, the Union turned to Mirage to enforce the employees' rights under the CBA. After it became clear that Mirage would not step in to ensure that the employees received the benefit of their collective bargain, the Union filed a grievance against Mirage on December 5, 2012. Mirage denied the grievance, which wended its way to arbitration. After an evidentiary hearing and partial briefing on the issues presented, the arbitrator concluded: \"The dispute over vacation pay not paid to B. B. King employees upon the Club's closing is not arbitrable.\" The federal action now before us ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As we explain below, the arbitrator's essential error was his failure to discern a critical distinction between the\n   <em>\n    arbitrability\n   </em>\n   of a grievance and its\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   . The arbitrator\n   compounded this error by neglecting a second important distinction between\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   arbitrability and\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   arbitrability. The arbitrator's confusion led him to decide an arbitrability question that he was not empowered to adjudicate on the mistaken belief that it was procedural, and to base his conclusion of non-arbitrability on an analysis anchored entirely in his view of the merits. Rather than correct the legal errors in the arbitrator's analysis, the district court echoed them, concluding that the Union's merits argument \"encompasse[d]\" the issue of substantive arbitrability and that by submitting the grievance for arbitration, the Union had implicitly authorized the arbitrator to render a decision on the scope of his own jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unlocking the analytical puzzle before us requires a review of arbitration's first principles with a sharp focus on the limited but essential role of the courts in effectuating its basic canons. The application of those canons in this case leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the arbitrator's award cannot stand and that the district court's judgment must be reversed and the case remanded with instructions to vacate the arbitrator's award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. The Arbitration Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Article 21 of the CBA, entitled \"Grievances and Arbitration,\" establishes the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement and related procedures. Section 21.01 defines a \"grievance\" as \"a dispute or difference of opinion between the Union and Mirage involving the meaning, interpretation, [and] application [of the CBA] to employees covered by this Agreement,\" except that violations of the CBA's no-strike and no-lock-out provisions \"shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 21.03 defines the exclusive procedures for adjusting \"all grievances\" and sets forth applicable time limits. Specifically, 21.03(a) provides that an aggrieved party must submit a written grievance identifying the claimed violation of the CBA within twenty calendar days of either the event giving rise to the grievance or the aggrieved party's knowledge of that event's occurrence. If the parties are unable to settle a grievance, Section 21.03(b) commands that the matter be set for hearing before a joint labor-management Board of Adjustment. And Section 21.03(c) provides for final and binding arbitration of grievances not settled by the board of adjustment. Finally, Section 21.04 provides that the time limits in Article 21 may be extended or waived by agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. The Subcontracting Arrangement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties negotiated contractual obligations in the event Mirage subcontracted or subleased third-party operations on its property. The CBA, a side letter accompanying the CBA, and the MOA all contain provisions concerning the subleasing or subcontracting of Mirage facilities. Article 29 of the CBA provides that any work performed under subcontracting or subleasing arrangements must be performed by Union members and that Mirage shall maintain \"full control of the terms and conditions of employment\" of employees performing subcontracted work. Specifically, article 29.01 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   It is recognized that the Employer [i.e., Mirage] and the Union have a common interest in protecting work opportunities for all employees covered by this Agreement and employed on a regular basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Therefore, no work customarily performed by employees covered by this Agreement shall be performed under any sub-lease, sub-contract, or other agreement unless the terms of any lease, contract or other agreement specifically states that (a) all such work shall be performed only by members of the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, and (b) the Employer shall at all times hold and exercise full control of the terms and conditions of employment of all such employees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The provisions of this Article apply to all operations on the Employer's premises covered by this agreement, regardless of location or displacement of employees or prior use of the area occupied by such operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Side Letter #5, executed by the parties in July of 2009, modifies Mirage's obligations to allow additional \"hiring flexibility\" when opening new venues. It sets forth staffing and seniority procedures that apply to \"the opening of ... new branded, fine dining or ultra/gaming lounge venue[s] ... located on [Mirage]'s premises\"; requires Mirage to give notice to the Union before opening such venues; and establishes procedures for hiring Union employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition to the CBA and its side letters, the parties regularly negotiated venue-specific memoranda of agreement, including as relevant here, the MOA executed by the Union, Mirage, and BB King's in November of 2009. The MOA stipulated that BB King's would operate as \"an independent business enterprise\" that would \"directly employ\" the venue's food and beverage employees and would be responsible for paying all wages and employee benefits to them. Echoing Article 29 of the CBA, the MOA went on to clarify that \"[n]otwithstanding the foregoing, The Mirage will at all times hold and exercise full control over the terms and conditions of employment of all of the employees, as required by Section 29.01(b) of the Agreement.\" The MOA likewise reiterated that BB King's would operate the restaurant \"strictly in accordance\" with the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. The Union's Grievance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Union invoked the CBA's grievance procedures on December 5, 2012, when it filed a formal grievance against Mirage based on BB King's failure to pay outstanding employee benefits in the wake of its bankruptcy and subsequent closure. The Union's central theory was that by failing to ensure that BB King's employees were paid for unused vacation time, Mirage violated the provisions in Section 29.01 of the CBA, Side Letter #5, and the MOA requiring Mirage to maintain \"full control\" over the terms and conditions of employment of BB King's employees. Mirage participated in the grievance proceedings described in Article 21 but disputed its liability for the payments. When the Board of Adjustment was unable to resolve the matter, the Union informed Mirage of its intent to submit the grievance to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties held an arbitration hearing before Arbitrator Jonathan S. Monat on April 8, 2015. The hearing opened with the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ARBITRATOR MONAT: Is this matter properly before the arbitrator for a final and binding decision under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   MR. GRANDGENETT [Mirage's attorney]: We are going to make the argument that it is not subject to arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ARBITRATOR MONAT: So that answer would be maybe?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   MR. GRANDGENETT: Right. But we would agree for you to hear the merits of the underlying grievance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ARBITRATOR MONAT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   MR. JELLISON [Union's attorney]: And we will vigorously oppose-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. GRANDGENETT: I'm sure you will.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   MR. JELLISON: -any last-minute argument for the first time raised at the hearing that it's not arbitrable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ARBITRATOR MONAT: Okay. I'll just write this down. Company raises nonarbitrability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties then stated the issues on which they sought resolution. In the Union's view, the dispute encompassed a single issue: \"Has the Mirage violated the [CBA] and [MOA] by failing to pay BB King's employees their accrued vacation pay and pay for unused floating holidays when the BB King's employees were terminated on or about November 11, 2012?\" Mirage, however, presented four issues: (1) whether the grievance was timely; (2) whether the grievance was \"subject to arbitration\" against Mirage; (3) if subject to arbitration, whether Mirage violated the CBA by failing to pay the aggrieved employees' accrued vacation and holiday benefits; and (4) if Mirage was liable, what was the appropriate remedy?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mirage explained the basis for its assertion that the grievance was not subject to arbitration as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The CBA obviously is between the Mirage and the culinary union, and this grievance deals with the nonpayment by BB King's, the lessee of the Mirage, of vacation pay accrued, unused vacation pay, and unused floating holidays. And the Mirage is not the employer of these particular employees, and so this is not even subject to arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Union disputed that the grievance was untimely and further argued that Mirage had waived its timeliness objection in all events by raising it for the first time at the hearing. Responding to Mirage's second issue-whether the dispute was \"subject to arbitration\"-the Union's attorney stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   It's a little hard for me to understand exactly what their argument is, but it sounds like their argument on arbitrability is more on the merits than it is on procedural arbitrability. To the extent they say that they're not violating the contract, you know, that's an issue on the merits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As the party submitting the grievance for arbitration, the Union obviously believed that the matter was substantively arbitrable, i.e., that it fell within the substantive scope of the parties' arbitration agreement as memorialized in Article 21 of the CBA. But the Union did not offer argument or evidence supporting that view, nor did it insist that any dispute over the issue be resolved by a court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After these opening remarks, the parties presented opening statements followed by evidence on the merits of the Union's grievance. Both the Union and Mirage called witnesses and offered exhibits directed to whether the MOA and Article 29 of the CBA required Mirage to cover the unpaid vacation its subcontractor/lessee failed to pay. In lieu of closing arguments, the parties agreed to submit post-hearing briefs to the Arbitrator. In a letter memorializing their agreement, the Union's attorney informed the arbitrator that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The parties have agreed to submit briefs to you on the timeliness-arbitrability question 10 days after receipt of the transcript. The parties request you to then issue an expedited decision on the timeliness-arbitrability issue. If you rule that it is arbitrable, then the parties will submit a brief on the merits 10 days after receipt of your award on the timeliness-arbitrability issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The arbitrator agreed to \"follow the instructions from the parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Despite the appearance of agreement, the first round of briefing revealed the parties' very different understandings of the issue-or issues-to be decided at the first stage of the bifurcated proceedings. Mirage's brief argued two points: that the grievance was \"not subject to arbitration\" because BB King's-not Mirage-was the employees' employer, and that the grievance was not timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Union, however, confined the substantive arguments in its brief to the issue of timeliness. It acknowledged Mirage's argument that it was not the aggrieved employees' employer but declined to counter it substantively at that time since in its view, the \"issue clearly [went] to the merits of the case and w[ould] be dealt with when the parties submit[ted] their briefs to the Arbitrator on the merits of the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   D. The Arbitration Award\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On June 2, 2015, the arbitrator issued a decision and award, which he viewed as resolving \"two procedural issues\": whether the grievance was \"timely filed and therefore arbitrable,\" and whether the grievance \"is not arbitrable because [Mirage] is not the employer under the CBA.\" The arbitrator noted that \"the parties engaged in mutual discussion and decided to bifurcate procedural arbitrability from the merits,\" and requested that he \"decide the procedure issue first.\" In this way, the arbitrator continued, the parties \"authorized [him] to provide an answer to the procedural question\"-before turning to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The arbitrator began his analysis by observing that, \"as a general rule, there is a presumption of arbitrability when a CBA contains a grievance procedure within which the last step is final and binding arbitration,\" and that \"legal precedent provides that the Arbitrator is the one to determine procedural questions of timeliness and arbitrability.\" The arbitrator went on to chronicle the events leading up to the grievance and the steps the parties took to resolve it. He noted that the grievance was timely filed and found that although it lay dormant for almost two years thereafter, Mirage was at least partially responsible for the delay. Moreover, Mirage's conduct indicated a willingness to proceed to arbitration, which \"created an expectation of resolution of the issue on the merits.\" For these reasons, the arbitrator concluded that Mirage had waived its timeliness objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The arbitrator then proceeded to consider whether the grievance was \"not subject to being arbitrated because Mirage was not the employer but a lessor.\" In this connection, he quoted provisions in the MOA defining the relationship between Mirage and BB King's and establishing BB King's responsibility for the operation of its restaurant and employment of its employees. The arbitrator observed that although BB King's \"is not a signatory to the CBA between Mirage and the Union,\" the MOA stipulates that it \"will operate the Restaurant strictly in accordance with the [CBA].\" The arbitrator then considered the text of Side Letter #5, Article 29.1 of the CBA, and the testimony of a Union witness involved in negotiating agreements among the Union, hotels, and subcontractors. Based on this evidence, the arbitrator determined that Mirage was not \"the guarantor for payment of wages or benefits of [BB King's] employees,\" and that the parties' agreement that Mirage would \"at all times hold and exercise full control over the terms and conditions of employment of all the employees\" meant only that Mirage was required to \"assure\n   compliance with the CBA by [BB King's] and nothing else.\" For these reasons, the arbitrator concluded, \"[t]he dispute over vacation pay not paid to B.B. King employees upon the Club's closing is not arbitrable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   E. The District Court's Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The district court considered whether to vacate the arbitrator's award on the grounds that it \"d[id] not draw its essence from the CBA and usurp[ed] the role of the Court in determining whether the dispute is one the parties to the CBA agreed to submit to arbitration.\" Applying the \"nearly unparalleled degree of deference\" that generally attends a federal court's review of a labor arbitration award, the court confirmed the award. The court held that the Union's submission to the arbitrator of the merits of its grievance \"necessarily encompasse[d]\" the question of arbitrability, thus empowering the arbitrator to determine the latter. The court reasoned that by \"clearly and unmistakably agree[ing] to arbitrate substantive issues,\" the Union consented to have the arbitrator decide substantive arbitrability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court went on to hold that the arbitrator did not exceed the scope of issues presented by considering merits-based arguments in proceedings limited to the \"timeliness-arbitrability question.\" The court expressed sympathy for the Union's \"apparent misunderstanding regarding the scope of the 'timeliness-arbitrability question,' \" resulting in its failure to confront the substance of Mirage's argument that it was not the aggrieved employees' employer. But by agreeing to arbitration, the court held, the Union was bound to accept \"the loose procedural requirements along with the benefits which arbitration provides.\" Further, the court reasoned, the Union was aware that Mirage viewed its asserted lack of an employment relationship with BB King's employees as a threshold arbitrability issue within the scope of the \"timeliness-arbitrability\" question and had the opportunity to present any counter-arguments it may have had during the first stage of briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On appeal, the Union argues that the arbitrator fundamentally misunderstood the concept of arbitrability. This is evident, the Union insists, by the arbitrator's failure to examine or even mention the only provisions of the CBA that are legally relevant to the issue of arbitrability, and by his grounding of his decision instead on his view of the grievance's substantive merits. The district court reproduced the arbitrator's confusion, the Union argues, when it held that the Union's merits argument \"necessarily encompasse[d]\" the legally and analytically distinct antecedent question of substantive arbitrability and that the Union's clear and unmistakable agreement \"to arbitrate substantive issues\" implicitly authorized the arbitrator to adjudicate the scope of his own jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II.

That dispute is\n   <em>\n    arbitrable\n   </em>\n   if it falls within the arbitration agreement expressed in Article 21 of the CBA; its arbitrability is determined\n   <em>\n    by the arbitrator\n   </em>\n   if the parties \"clearly and unmistakably agreed\" to submit that question to him; and it is\n   <em>\n    meritorious\n   </em>\n   if the Union's \"control\" theory is supported by the text of Article 29 of the CBA, Side Letter #5, the MOA, and other evidence presented at the hearing. But the arbitrator conflated these distinct inquiries, holding that the grievance was \"not arbitrable\" without considering his authority to decide that issue, and, compounding the error, resting his holding on Article 29's \"control\" provisions and other provisions relevant to Mirage's putative responsibility for the claimed employee benefits but irrelevant to the parties' arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Conspicuously, no one defends the arbitrator's analysis. Mirage does not contend that the contractual provisions on which the arbitrator relied (or any other portion of the CBA) authorized him to decide the issue of arbitrability, nor does it argue that the Union's grievance is non-arbitrable as outside the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement. In fact, part of what makes this appeal so inscrutable is that Mirage\n   <em>\n    agrees\n   </em>\n   that \"the proper forum for the grievance was in arbitration as opposed to litigation in court.\" Because that is the essence of the substantive arbitrability inquiry-which, properly understood, examines the parties' arbitration agreement and determines whether a particular dispute is within its scope, and thus \"arbitrable,\" or outside its scope, and thus \"non-arbitrable\"-Mirage has effectively conceded that the dispute is substantively arbitrable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The arbitrator's conclusion that the grievance was not arbitrable simply misunderstood the arbitrability inquiry. As Mirage acknowledges, by \"not arbitrable,\" the arbitrator meant that the grievance \"was filed against the wrong party-Mirage rather than BB King's.\" But the Union's grievance asserts obligations that the\n   Union believes the CBA and other agreements impose\n   <em>\n    on Mirage\n   </em>\n   . No one disputes that the CBA requires Mirage to arbitrate \"grievances,\" and Mirage has never contended that disputes involving its subcontractors fall outside the CBA's definition of a \"grievance.\" The arbitrator apparently concluded that the Union's exclusive remedy to recover the claimed benefits was against BB King's; but whatever the soundness of that conclusion, it plainly had nothing to do with substantive arbitrability, which, again, concerns only whether the dispute falls within the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Options\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p947\">\n    514 U.S. at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p947\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The district court did not disembroil the arbitrator's analysis. Without endorsing the arbitrator's reasoning, the district court upheld the award on the ground that it was entitled to \"nearly unparalleled\" deference and that it was sufficiently grounded in the \"essence\" of the CBA to satisfy minimal scrutiny. But the court's extreme deference was premised on two, equally erroneous beliefs: first, that the substance of the Union's grievance \"encompasse[d]\" the question of arbitrability, and second, that by agreeing to arbitrate \"substantive issues,\" the Union implicitly authorized the arbitrator to determine whether the grievance itself was arbitrable.

At the arbitration hearing, Mirage asserted for the first time that the grievance was \"not subject to arbitration,\" but it went on to explain that its view rested exclusively on contractual provisions relating to the merits of the Union's grievance. At no point in the proceedings did Mirage mention the parties' arbitration agreement or cite Article 21 of the CBA. The cornerstone of Mirage's \"arbitrability\" challenge was that Mirage had no employment relationship with the aggrieved employees-the very crux of its merits challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    George Day Construction Co. v.

Here, by contrast, the Union did not present any argument on substantive arbitrability to the arbitrator because it recognized that Mirage's second \"arbitrability\" argument was actually directed to the merits, and it believed that the issue would be argued and submitted at a later time. So unlike the employer in\n   <em>\n    George Day\n   </em>\n   , the Union is not seeking a second bite at the apple on an issue it previously briefed and submitted to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The upshot of the foregoing is that although the arbitrator did not have authority to decide the question of substantive arbitrability, he concluded that the Union's grievance was \"not arbitrable.\" As a result, the aggrieved employees were denied benefits to which the Union might have proven their entitlement had it presented its merits arguments to the arbitrator. That harm is undoubtedly significant in the eyes of the employees concerned. Equally important, however, is that left undisturbed, the arbitrator's award and the district court's confirmation of it establish a hazardous precedent whose consequences are likely to reverberate far beyond the benefits claims at issue in this case. On its terms, the arbitrator's award effectively carves out of the parties' arbitration agreement a wide swath of presumptively arbitrable grievances involving Mirage's (and potentially other employers') subcontractors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And it does so without any textual basis in the CBA or rational basis in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   By blurring the line between arbitrability and merits determinations, the arbitrator's analysis contravenes foundational principles of the arbitral process by overlooking the limits the Supreme Court has placed on the arbitrator's presumptive powers.
