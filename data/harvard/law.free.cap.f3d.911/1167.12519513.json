Bar Examination (\"Bar\"). Since then, Jackson has challenged that decision and, in turn, the handling of his challenge. His case reached the federal district court in 2016. The district court dismissed his complaint based on three alternative doctrines: the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine and the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . Because none of the three doctrines applies, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Clarence Jackson sat unsuccessfully for the Bar four times. In 2010, he applied to sit a fifth time. He failed to pay the required fees or to provide proof of law school graduation and the Committee denied his application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Five years later, Jackson sued the Committee in the D.C. Superior Court (\"State Complaint\"). He alleged that the denial of his application violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, constituted a breach of contract and resulted in the intentional infliction of emotional distress. On April 1, 2016, the Superior Court granted without explanation the Committee's motion to dismiss the State Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or around April 5, 2016, Jackson submitted a petition to the D.C. Mayor's Office in an apparent attempt to seek review of the decision denying him a further opportunity to take the bar exam. The Mayor's Office denied his petition on the ground that he had already filed a lawsuit making the same claim. Jackson then petitioned for review in the D.C. Court of Appeals, but his petition was denied as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 7, 2016, Jackson asked the Superior Court to explain why it dismissed the State Complaint. The request remained pending for more than one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the interim, Jackson filed the instant complaint (\"Federal Complaint\"). This time Jackson sued both the Committee and the Mayor's Office (\"Defendants\"). He alleged that the denial of his application and the rejection of his challenge to that denial violated the Sixth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   He also reasserted\n   his breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims and asserted a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. In March 2017, the district court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss the Federal Complaint. The district court construed the Federal Complaint as a suit against the District and characterized the claims contained therein as \"effectively the same as those advanced [in the State Complaint].\" It then identified three alternative grounds in dismissing the Federal Complaint: the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine and the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2017, the Committee asked the Superior Court to resolve Jackson's request that the court explain its decision to dismiss the State Complaint. In July 2017, the Superior Court stated that it had not ruled on the request over the previous fifteen months because it believed its earlier decision was \"a final adjudication\" and that \"the matter was closed.\" It clarified that it had dismissed the State Complaint \"for many reasons,\" including its \"lack[ ] [of] subject-matter jurisdiction over this action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

Because Jackson did not ask the district court to review and reject the Superior Court's dismissal of the State Complaint,\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   does not apply. The\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   doctrine prevents a federal court from interfering with certain categories of ongoing state proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Sprint Commc'ns, Inc. v.

The Superior Court dismissed the State Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Although the Superior Court noted alternative bases for dismissal, including the Committee's immunity from suit, the running of the statute of limitations and the complaint's failure to state a claim, it had no authority to consider them having determined it was without jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re D.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099809\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/771/360/#p364\">\n    771 A.2d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (D.C. 2001) (\"Without jurisdiction, the Court cannot proceed at all in any cause.

But even collateral estoppel would not apply here because the Federal Complaint does not require the district court to relitigate the same jurisdictional\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   that led to the dismissal of the State Complaint.
