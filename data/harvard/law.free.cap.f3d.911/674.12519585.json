Va. 2017). The plaintiffs seek the reinstatement of three claims: a Title IX sex discrimination claim against the University of Mary Washington (\"UMW,\" or the \"University\"); a Title IX retaliation claim against UMW; and a \u00a7 1983 claim against UMW's former president, Dr. Richard Hurley, for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feminist Majority Found. v.

Plaintiff Feminists United is a student organization at UMW and a local affiliate of plaintiff Feminist Majority Foundation, a national organization. During the 2014-2015 academic year, plaintiffs Paige McKinsey, Julia Michels, Kelli Musick, Jordan Williams, and Alexis Lehman were UMW students who served on Feminists United's executive board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2014, UMW's student senate voted to authorize male-only fraternities at the University. During a campus town hall meeting following the senate's authorization, Feminists United members questioned the wisdom of having such fraternities at UMW, in light of \"research that showed that Greek life on campus increased the number of [on-campus] sexual assaults.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 21. Plaintiff McKinsey was particularly troubled by the vote of approval, and she believed that UMW had failed to support victims of sexual assault in the past. Soon after the town hall meeting, UMW students debated the Greek life vote on Yik Yak, a now-defunct social media application. Yik Yak allowed its users within a limited geographic range to create and view anonymous messages known as \"Yaks.\" Within the Yik Yak conversational thread available at UMW, several students expressed - in offensive terms - strong criticism of Feminists United and its members for their opposition to on-campus fraternities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 21, 2014, several Feminists United members met with UMW's Title IX coordinator, Dr. Leah Cox, to explain their concerns about the University's past failures in responding to student sexual assault complaints. As the Feminists United members walked home from the meeting, other UMW students drove by and screamed, \"Fuck the feminists!\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two days later, on November 23, a UMW student videotaped members of the UMW men's rugby team performing a chant that glorified violence against women, including rape and necrophilia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later that month, the student who recorded the rugby team video provided it to the UMW administration and informed plaintiff McKinsey about the video. Members of Feminists United subsequently met with then-President Hurley to discuss the rugby team's offensive chant. They were assured\n   by Hurley that some unspecified \"action\" was being taken in response thereto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite President Hurley's assurances, plaintiff McKinsey perceived that UMW's administration was indifferent to the rugby team's chant and other discriminatory acts suffered by female students on campus. On January 29, 2015, McKinsey published an opinion piece in UMW's student newspaper explaining \"[w]hy UMW is not a feminist friendly campus.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 28. McKinsey therein discussed the rugby team's chant and recent harassing and threatening Yaks aimed at Feminists United members. That article, however, was not well-received by some members of the UMW community and \"led to an escalation of verbal assaults and cyber-attacks on members of Feminists United.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. For example, various comments of a \"derogatory, sexist, and threatening\" nature were posted to the school newspaper's website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 20, 2015, members of the UMW men's rugby team approached plaintiff McKinsey in the University's dining hall and confronted her about the newspaper article. That same day, McKinsey informed Dr. Cox - UMW's Title IX coordinator - that McKinsey felt unsafe on the UMW campus after her encounter with the rugby team members, particularly in light of the threats lodged against her and other Feminists United members on Yik Yak and the school newspaper's website. McKinsey requested that the UMW administration take \"some sort of action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Cox responded to plaintiff McKinsey on February 24, informing McKinsey that Cox did not know what actions UMW would take against the men's rugby team. Cox offered, however, to schedule a mediated discussion between the rugby team and Feminists United. About that time, a UMW professor - concerned with the threatening nature of recent Yik Yak posts - emailed various Feminists United members to request their participation in what the professor called \"listening circles.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 34. As proposed, UMW students, including Feminists United members, would meet with UMW faculty and administrators in small groups and explain how the offending Yaks were affecting them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 11, 2015, UMW held an open forum about sexual assault on campus, at which President Hurley downplayed the seriousness of the rugby team's chant. Several days later, plaintiff Michels emailed Hurley and notified him that she planned to release a transcript of the rugby team's chant to UMW's student newspaper because the administration had not yet punished those responsible for it. Michels reiterated that Feminists United members felt unsafe on campus. In response, Hurley disclosed that some students had been sanctioned for their participation in the repulsive chanting and that those sanctions had been appealed. Hurley added that he took student safety concerns \"quite seriously.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   About a week after the open forum, President Hurley emailed the UMW student body, \"generally discussing UMW's efforts to end sexual assault, violence against women, and others forms of discrimination and harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 41. Without referencing the rugby team's chant or any other specific acts, Hurley described certain students' recent behavior as \"repugnant and highly offensive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That same day, Hurley met with several Feminists United members, who questioned why Hurley's email to the student body had not mentioned the rugby team's repulsive chant or the sanctions imposed on the students who had participated therein. Hurley responded that he\n   was following his lawyer's advice and that \"he would rather rely on the student grapevine to spread the word about what happened with the rugby team and why.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 19, 2015, after several UMW students expressed outrage on Facebook over the rugby team's chant, President Hurley announced that all rugby activities had been suspended indefinitely and that the rugby players would be required to participate in anti-sexual assault and violence training. Immediately after Hurley's announcement, a flurry of harassing and threatening Yaks were directed at members of Feminists United, blaming them for the rugby team's suspension. The Yaks named plaintiffs McKinsey and Musick, along with Feminists United member Grace Mann, and contained threats of physical and sexual violence. By way of example, the Yaks threatened:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 \"Gonna tie these feminists to the radiator and [g]rape them in the mouth\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 \"Dandy's about to kill a bitch ... or two\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \"Can we euthanize whoever caused this bullshit?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 46 (alterations in original). Several of the offending Yaks, as alleged in the Complaint, also referred to Feminists United members by such terms as \"femicunts, feminazis, cunts, bitches, hoes, and dikes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to naming plaintiff McKinsey, some of the offending Yaks shared her whereabouts so that she could personally be confronted. After McKinsey agreed to speak at the March 24, 2015 meeting of UMW's Young Democrats Club, an anonymous poster shared McKinsey's schedule and outlined a plan to accost her at that meeting. Although McKinsey had already notified UMW administrators about her safety concerns and had not received a satisfactory response, the anonymous Yak revealing the plan to confront McKinsey prompted her to contact UMW's campus police and report that she felt unsafe attending the Young Democrats meeting. The campus police believed the threat serious enough to assign an officer to the Feminists United and Young Democrats meetings that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 25, plaintiff Michels sent an email to President Hurley, Dr. Cox, and UMW's vice president, Douglas Searcy. The email explained that Feminists United members had documented \"nearly 200 examples of students using Yik Yak to post either violent, vitriolic hate or threats against [them],\" and that they feared for their safety on the UMW campus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 49. Michels therein requested a meeting between Feminists United and the UMW administration to address the Feminists United members' safety concerns. As a result, Cox, Searcy, and other UMW employees met with Feminists United members the next day. The members then requested that the UMW administration take a number of steps. Those requests included: (1) contacting Yik Yak to have the Yik Yak application disabled on UMW's campus;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) barring access to Yik\n   Yak on UMW's wireless network; (3) communicating \"more transparent[ly]\" with students; (4) announcing to UMW's student body that Feminists United \"had no role in ... [UMW's] decision [to suspend rugby activities];\" and (5) hosting an \"assembly to explain rape culture and discuss harassment, cyber bullying[,] and social media issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Rather than grant the requests of Feminists United, Dr. Cox sent a schoolwide email on March 27, 2015, addressing the University's recent cyber bullying issues. Cox asserted that nothing could be done, that is, the University had \"no recourse for such cyber bullying.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 51. Instead, she encouraged UMW students to report any threatening online comments to Yik Yak or other platforms where such comments were made. Disappointed with Cox's approach to the ongoing threats, plaintiff Michels responded and urged Cox and UMW administrators to \"take the lead against this problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 30, 2015, following plaintiff Michels's response to Dr. Cox, another member of Feminists United emailed President Hurley and suggested that UMW's hands-off response to the offending Yaks had contravened the statutory mandate of Title IX. By that time, more than 700 harassing and threatening Yaks had been directed at Feminists United and its members. According to the email to Hurley, Feminists United members had reported the offending posts to Yik Yak for several months, but to no avail. The emailer described feeling so unsafe at UMW that she could not concentrate on her classwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A day later, on March 31, Feminists United members held a march on the UMW campus to raise awareness about campus rape. At its conclusion, some UMW students and administrators, including President Hurley, gathered to hear plaintiff McKinsey speak. During her speech, McKinsey discussed the various threatening messages posted on Yik Yak. The following day, McKinsey emailed Hurley and asked whether the University would be taking action on Feminists United's request that students be barred from accessing Yik Yak on UMW's wireless network. Hurley responded that he had discussed the option of banning Yik Yak with \"several experts\" and was concerned about violating the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 59. Dr. Cox echoed Hurley's First Amendment concerns in a subsequent email to a Feminists United member. She added that if any student felt threatened by an \"identified member[ ] of [the] community,\" the student should contact Cox or the campus police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 8, 2015, plaintiffs McKinsey and Michels met with President Hurley and other UMW administrators at the first of two listening circles to discuss the voluminous harassing and threatening posts on Yik Yak. Michels stressed that several Feminists United members felt they were in danger on the UMW campus, especially those students who had been named in the Yaks. Once again, UMW administrators failed to take any action in response to the harassment and threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   About a week later, Feminists United members and University administrators, including Dr. Cox, attended the second listening circle. The Feminists United members again expressed concerns about the offending Yaks and requested that UMW address the hostile campus atmosphere. A UMW professor recommended that the University provide \"better training\" and engage in \"more transparency and communication at all levels.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint\n   \u00b6 64. Dr. Cox responded, however, that \"such solutions would violate privacy rights,\" and she otherwise failed to offer any plan to address the harassment and threats suffered by Feminists United members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 17, 2015 - in an event later determined to be unrelated to the offending Yaks - UMW student and Feminists United member Grace Mann was killed by another student who was her roommate. During the immediate aftermath of that terrible event, Feminists United members were unaware that it had no apparent connection to the harassing and threatening Yaks. Mann's demise prompted one Feminists United member to send an email to UMW administrators chastising the University for its failure to respond to the Yik Yak bullying and threats. UMW administrators did not respond to that email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On May 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (the \"OCR complaint\"), alleging that UMW had contravened Title IX by failing to address the hostile environment at the University resulting from the sexually harassing and threatening online posts. The plaintiffs also held a press conference on UMW's campus to announce the OCR complaint. That same day, UMW issued a statement denying the allegations in the OCR complaint. After the University's denials, several messages were posted on Yik Yak that again harassed Feminists United members, and also criticized the filing of the OCR complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   About a month later, on June 8, 2015, President Hurley wrote to the president of the Feminist Majority Foundation addressing the OCR complaint. He promptly distributed copies of his responsive letter to the UMW community and several media outlets. According to the Complaint, Hurley's letter falsely asserted that the OCR complaint drew a connection between Grace Mann's death and the threatening social media posts. Hurley also inaccurately claimed that neither UMW nor its campus police had received any reports of Yik Yak threats directed at Feminists United members. Additionally, Hurley suggested that the safety concerns of Feminists United members were exaggerated because some of the online threats simply derived from \"pop culture.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the wake of President Hurley's June 2015 letter, additional harassing and threatening messages were directed at Feminists United members on Yik Yak. Similar Yaks continued to be posted throughout the summer of 2015. According to the Complaint, \"[t]he [new] posts expressed a sense of validation regarding the earlier posts along with a newfound sense of outrage toward Feminists United for filing their OCR [complaint].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 74. The plaintiffs thereafter amended the OCR complaint to allege retaliatory conduct by UMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In May 2017, the plaintiffs withdrew the OCR complaint and initiated this lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging, inter alia, the three claims now on appeal. First, the Complaint alleges that UMW contravened Title IX by being deliberately indifferent to student-on-student sex discrimination (the \"sex discrimination claim\"). In support of the sex discrimination claim, the Complaint specifies that UMW's deliberate indifference served to create and foster a campus atmosphere so hostile that Feminists United members refrained from leaving their homes, attending classes, and participating in campus events. Second, the Complaint alleges that\n   UMW retaliated against the plaintiffs for advocating against sexual assault and reporting sexual harassment, also in violation of Title IX (the \"retaliation claim\"). According to the Complaint, UMW retaliated against the plaintiffs in two ways: (1) the University was deliberately indifferent to UMW students harassing and threatening members of Feminists United for engaging in protected conduct; and (2) President Hurley prepared and released his June 2015 letter, which made false accusations against - and was intended to disparage - members of Feminists United. Third, under \u00a7 1983 of Title 42, the Complaint alleges that Hurley infringed on the plaintiffs' equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment (the \"equal protection claim\"). The Complaint alleges that Hurley contravened the plaintiffs' equal protection rights by, inter alia, failing to act against those UMW students who had sexually harassed members of Feminists United.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendants promptly moved to dismiss the Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), asserting that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. President Hurley also maintained that he is entitled to qualified immunity on the equal protection claim. By its decision of September 19, 2017, the district court granted Hurley qualified immunity and dismissed the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feminist Majority Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522749\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/283/495/\">\n    283 F.Supp.3d at 502-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those elements are: (1) that the educational institution receives federal funds; (2) that the plaintiff \"was subjected to harassment based on her sex\"; (3) that \"the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile (or abusive) environment in an educational program or activity\"; and (4) that \"there is a basis for imputing liability to the institution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865382\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/686/#p695\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The University has not disputed the sufficiency of the Complaint on the first, second, and third elements identified in our\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   decision. That is, the Complaint sufficiently alleges that: (1) UMW receives federal funds; (2) many of the harassing and threatening Yaks targeted the plaintiff Feminists United members on the basis of sex; and (3) those Yaks, along with other online posts and in-person interactions, created a hostile and abusive environment. But UMW maintained below - and the district court agreed - that the Title IX sex discrimination claim fails as a matter of law on the fourth element of\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ; that is, it lacks a basis for imputing liability to UMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The district court explained that the sexual harassment endured by members of Feminists United \"took place in a context over which UMW had limited, if any, control.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feminist Majority Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522749\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/283/495/\">\n    283 F.Supp.3d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the plaintiffs, their allegations reflect that UMW had substantial control over both the context in which the student-on-student harassment occurred and those students who harassed Feminists United members. The plaintiffs also maintain that the Complaint adequately alleges UMW's deliberate indifference to such sexual harassment and specifies several ways the University could have responded without implicating the First Amendment. We must therefore focus on and resolve the crux of the sex discrimination claim: whether the Complaint sufficiently alleges a basis for imputing liability to UMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court determined that UMW had little - if any - control over the context in which the Feminists United members were harassed, because nearly all of that harassment occurred through Yik Yak. We are satisfied, however, that the court's decision in that regard is undermined by the Complaint's factual allegations. In so ruling, we remain mindful that the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   decision limits an educational institution's Title IX liability for student-on-student sexual harassment to those situations where the defendant institution \"exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the context in which the known harassment occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    526 U.S. at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We begin the substantial control analysis by identifying the context in which the sexual harassment occurred and UMW's control over that context. The Complaint alleges that much of the harassment occurred through Yik Yak. Although that harassment was communicated through cyberspace, the Complaint shows that UMW had substantial control over the context of the harassment because it actually transpired on campus. Specifically, due to Yik Yak's location-based feature, the harassing and threatening messages originated on or within the immediate vicinity of the UMW campus. In addition, some of the offending Yaks were posted using the University's wireless network, and the harassers necessarily created those Yaks on campus. Moreover, the harassment concerned events occurring on campus and specifically targeted UMW students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    526 U.S. at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where ... the misconduct occurs during school hours and on school grounds[,] ... the [educational institution] retains substantial control over the context in which the harassment occurs.\");\n   <em>\n    Kowalski v.

The Complaint also alleges that the University could have sought to identify those students using UMW's network to harass and threaten Feminists United members. If the University had pinpointed the harassers, it could then have circumscribed their use of UMW's network. Indeed, it is widely known that a university can control activities that occur on its own network. A university may, for example, bar a student caught downloading music or movies in violation of copyright laws from accessing its network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201094\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(29)(A) (requiring educational institutions to \"develop[ ] plans to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material\" in exchange for federal funds).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Beyond the University's technical capacity to control the means by which the harassing and threatening messages were transmitted, the Complaint demonstrates that UMW could have exercised control in other ways that might have corrected the hostile environment. For instance, UMW administrators could have more clearly communicated to the student body that the University would not tolerate sexually harassing behavior either in person or online. The University also could have conducted mandatory assemblies to explain and discourage cyber bullying and sex discrimination, and it could have provided anti-sexual harassment training to the entire student body and faculty. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the Complaint sufficiently alleges UMW's substantial control over the context in which the alleged harassment occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The substantial control analysis also requires us to consider the educational institution's control over the harasser, especially its \"disciplinary authority.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    526 U.S. at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the Complaint, UMW had the ability to punish those students who posted sexually harassing and threatening messages online. Indeed, the Complaint recounts that UMW had previously disciplined students - members of the men's rugby team - for derogatory off-campus speech. If UMW could punish students for offensive off-campus speech that was not aimed at any particular students, the University also could have disciplined students for harassing and threatening on-campus speech targeted at Feminists United members. In fact, according to the Complaint, Dr. Cox actually advised Feminists United members to contact her if they felt threatened by an \"identified member[ ] of [the] community.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 60. Viewed in the proper light, Cox's statement demonstrates UMW's capacity to exercise control over students engaging in threatening online behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To the extent the University contends it was unable to control the harassers because the offending Yaks were anonymous, we readily reject that proposition. The Complaint alleges that the University never sought to identify the students who posted the offending messages on Yik Yak, even though some of those messages were facilitated by (i.e., posted through the use of) UMW's network. Nor did the University ever ask Yik Yak to identify those users who had harassed and threatened UMW students. The University cannot escape liability based on facially anonymous posts when, according to the Complaint, UMW never sought to discern whether it could identify the harassers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At bottom, in assessing whether UMW - under the Complaint - had sufficient control over the harassers and the context of the harassment, we cannot conclude that UMW could turn a blind eye to\n   the sexual harassment that pervaded and disrupted its campus solely because the offending conduct took place through cyberspace.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kowalski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758742\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/565/#p573\">\n    652 F.3d at 572-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting student's First Amendment challenge to high school's disciplinary action taken against student who, off campus, created website to bully classmate). Rather, we are satisfied that the Complaint sufficiently alleges that UMW could exert substantial control over the context in which the harassment occurred and could exercise disciplinary authority over those UMW students who sexually harassed and threatened the Feminists United members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The district court also ruled that the sex discrimination claim fails because the Complaint does not sufficiently allege UMW's deliberate indifference to sexual harassment. We again disagree. Simply put, the Complaint demonstrates that - although UMW was not entirely unresponsive to allegations of harassment - the University did not engage in efforts that were \"reasonably calculated to end [the] harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zeno v. Pine Plains Cent. Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645719\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/655/#p669\">\n    702 F.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669 (2d Cir. 2012). Indeed, the Complaint portrays repeated instances of UMW students targeting and harassing Feminists United members with threats and other sex-based hostility. Those harassing activities were reported to the University on multiple occasions over many months. UMW's administrators, however, merely responded with two listening circles, a generic email, and by sending a campus police officer with a threatened student on one evening after particularly aggressive and targeted Yaks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The University faces serious difficulties in its effort to convince us that the Complaint does not sufficiently allege deliberate indifference. The pertinent facts include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 In November 2014, UMW students began harassing Feminists United members through Yik Yak for opposing the creation of fraternities at UMW;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 In February 2015, plaintiff McKinsey informed Dr. Cox that she felt unsafe on the UMW campus because of the harassing and threatening online posts directed at her, as well as her in-person interactions with members of the rugby team;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 In March 2015, McKinsey and plaintiff Michels reported ongoing safety concerns to President Hurley on behalf of themselves and other Feminists United members;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 After Hurley's March 19, 2015 announcement that the rugby team would be suspended indefinitely, a flurry of harassing and threatening Yaks were aimed at Feminists United members;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 The offending Yaks threatened to \"euthanize,\" \"kill,\" and \"[g]rape,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Feminists United members, named specific members, and reported McKinsey's locations on the UMW campus with the goal that she be confronted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 46.

The University, however, never investigated the harassment and threats, and never asked any law enforcement agencies to investigate them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On the allegations of the Complaint, we are satisfied that the plaintiffs sufficiently allege that UMW exhibited deliberate indifference to known instances of sexual harassment. Although the Complaint acknowledges that UMW took limited steps in response to the harassing and threatening Yaks, those actions do not preclude Title IX liability at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    526 U.S. at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that court may determine, in appropriate situation, that institution did not act with deliberate indifference as matter of law). UMW's decision to have a campus police officer at two student meetings was a short-term countermeasure - a one-off - that failed to address the more than six-month harassment campaign directed at Feminists United and its members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zeno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645719\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/655/#p669\">\n    702 F.3d at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We affirmed Bly's \u00a7 876(b) conviction and sentence, explaining that true threats, such as those in Bly's letter, are not constitutionally protected.

Although the University contends that the Yaks quoted in the Complaint do not constitute \"true threats\" because many of them reference \"pop culture,\" we are entirely unpersuaded.

Additionally, UMW could have offered counseling services for those impacted by the targeted harassment. To be sure, Title IX required none of those specific actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    526 U.S. at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, when an educational institution claims that it has done all it can to address instances of sexual harassment and threats, a reviewing court should consider whether the institution failed to take other obvious and reasonable steps.

Applying those principles, we are satisfied that an educational institution can be liable for acting with deliberate indifference toward known instances of student-on-student retaliatory harassment. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , however, the institution can only be liable for such retaliation if it \"exercises substantial control over both the [student engaged in retaliatory harassment] and the context in which the known [retaliatory harassment] occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    526 U.S. at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Feminists United members engaged in protected activity in three ways: (1) by advocating against \"sex-based violence at UMW\"; (2) by reporting instances of sexual harassment to the University; and (3) by filing the OCR complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 68, 98. The Complaint further alleges that, in response to those protected activities, other UMW students harassed and threatened them in a manner that would deter a reasonable person from \"making or supporting a charge of [sex] discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    548 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Complaint demonstrates that, after plaintiff McKinsey published her newspaper article speaking out against sex discrimination at the University, her fellow UMW students harassed and threatened her on the newspaper website and on Yik Yak. In addition, members of the UMW men's rugby team confronted McKinsey in a manner that rendered her extremely unsettled. Shortly thereafter, in response to President Hurley's announcement that the men's rugby team would be suspended indefinitely, UMW students ramped up their harassing and threatening Yaks against the Feminists United members. Some of the Yaks named specific members of Feminists United, and other Yaks revealed plaintiff McKinsey's locations on UMW's campus. As of March 2015, more than 700 harassing and threatening Yaks had been directed at Feminists United members. When the plaintiffs filed their OCR complaint two months later, they were subjected to another barrage of harassing and threatening Yaks. The Complaint specifies that those types of Yaks continued well into the summer of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As the Complaint illustrates, Feminists United members promptly reported the foregoing retaliatory conduct to UMW on several occasions. The Complaint alleges that UMW had the ability to control both the students who engaged in retaliatory harassment and the context in which that harassment occurred.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.3.a. The University took little or no action, however, to address and curtail the retaliatory activities.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.3.b. Instead, Dr. Cox actually asserted that the University had \"no recourse\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   for the harassing and threatening behavior of UMW students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 51. Because an educational institution can be liable under Title IX for its deliberate indifference to student-on-student retaliatory harassment, we are satisfied that the Complaint sufficiently alleges a retaliation claim against UMW.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As UMW would have it, the retaliation claim merely restates and duplicates the sex discrimination claim. That contention does not acknowledge, however, the propriety of pleading multiple or alternative claims based on the same facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). And, in any event, the sex discrimination claim and the retaliation claim are not duplicative. Although both claims rely on student-on-student harassment that occurred after the plaintiffs engaged in protected activities, the sex discrimination claim differs from the retaliation claim because, to prove the latter, the plaintiffs must show a retaliatory motive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Guessous v. Fairview Prop. Invs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336129\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/208/#p216\">\n    828 F.3d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (4th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The University also argues on appeal that the retaliation claim seeks to hold UMW liable for its students' instantaneous retaliatory conduct, and the University contends that, practically speaking, it could not reasonably be expected to control such conduct. In that regard, we disagree with the University's characterization of the retaliation claim. The Complaint plainly faults UMW for its failure - over several months - to address and seek to eliminate retaliatory harassing conduct. Furthermore, as explained in our analysis of the sex discrimination claim, the Complaint alleges UMW's control over the context and the harassers during that period of time. In other words, the retaliatory harassment engaged in by UMW students spanned a sufficient period for the University to have taken reasonable steps to address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In sum, if an educational institution can be liable for student-on-student sexual harassment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    526 U.S. at 646-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p649\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it can also be liable for student-on-student retaliatory harassment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

We are therefore satisfied that the district court erred in dismissing the retaliation claim, insofar as it is predicated on UMW's deliberate indifference to student-on-student retaliatory harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Turning to the part of the retaliation claim that is predicated on President Hurley's June 2015 letter, we observe that\n   the letter was never filed in the district court. Consequently, that letter is not part of the record on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 10(a) (providing that the record on appeal includes, inter alia, \"the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court\"). Additionally, although either party could have sought to correct or modify the record on appeal to include Hurley's letter, they have not done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 10(e)(2). In these circumstances, we are constrained to consider only the Complaint's description of the letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   With that caveat, we agree with the district court that President Hurley's letter - as described in the Complaint - does not constitute a materially adverse action that, in and of itself, can support the retaliation claim. Put simply, an educational institution and its administrators are entitled to defend against accusations of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949135\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/73/#p84\">\n    504 F.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"[T]he person or entity accused of discrimination must be allowed to defend himself or itself.\"). Furthermore, an institution and its administrators can explain their denials of discrimination allegations without fear that those denials might create additional liability. Although we acknowledge that \"[t]here is an important difference between defending oneself ... and threatening, intimidating, or otherwise interfering with someone's right to pursue a discrimination claim,\" the Complaint does not sufficiently allege that Hurley's letter falls within the latter category.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949135\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/73/#p84\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suarez Corp.

First, the Complaint alleges that Hurley falsely asserted that the OCR complaint \"drew a 'troubling' connection between [Grace] Mann's death and the Yik Yak threats despite Feminists United's and its counsel's\n   public statements to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 72. The Complaint acknowledges, however, that at least one member of Feminists United claimed that the Mann incident and the Yik Yak posts were related. Consequently, Hurley's assertion in his letter about Mann's death must be viewed as a permissible response to a student's effort to blame UMW for that terrible event.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, the Complaint faults President Hurley's letter for downplaying certain Yik Yak threats by emphasizing their use of \"pop culture references.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 73. We agree with UMW, however, that this part of Hurley's letter sought to contextualize those Yaks and, in so doing, served as an assessment of actual danger on the UMW campus. School administrators are entitled to communicate freely with students and faculty regarding the existence and severity of potential safety risks on the school's campus without fear of creating future liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Third, the Complaint accuses President Hurley's letter of erroneously asserting that neither UMW nor its campus police had received reports of Yik Yak threats against Feminists United members. Hurley's assertion, however, amounts to little more than a denial of the allegations of discrimination made in the OCR complaint. That is, Hurley again sought to characterize the seriousness of the Yaks and explained his belief that no actual threats against particular students were reported to the University. Even if Hurley's characterization of the Yaks was misguided, he was entitled to defend against the allegations of sex discrimination without running afoul of Title IX anti-retaliation principles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949135\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/73/#p84\">\n    504 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that entity is permitted to defend itself against accusations of discrimination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In sum, as with any denial of a discrimination claim, President Hurley's response to the OCR complaint might have cast doubt on the veracity of that complaint and those who filed it. The fact that a response to a discrimination complaint calls into question the credibility of the complainants, however, does not make the response a materially adverse retaliatory action. A person who charges an institution and its administrators with discrimination - particularly in a highly publicized way - should reasonably expect that the institution and its administrators may deny the claim in a publicized response. We are therefore satisfied that, to the extent the Complaint alleges retaliation based solely on President Hurley's letter of June 2015, the claim fails because the letter alone does not constitute a materially adverse retaliatory action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.B. ex rel. A.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252698\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/69/#p77\">\n    819 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   78 n.7 (determining that certain alleged retaliatory actions were not materially adverse as matter of law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In these circumstances, we will vacate the dismissal of the retaliation claim insofar as it is premised on UMW's deliberate indifference to student-on-student retaliatory harassment. We will affirm, however, the dismissal of the aspect of the retaliation claim that relies exclusively on President Hurley's June 2015 letter. We do not decide the probative value of Hurley's letter to the deliberate indifference part of\n   the retaliation claim. We leave that issue for the remand proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, we turn to the equal protection claim pursued against President Hurley in his individual capacity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for his own deliberate indifference to student-on-student sexual harassment suffered by the plaintiff Feminists United members. In dismissing the equal protection claim, the district court rejected the premise of the plaintiffs' sexual harassment theory, i.e., that deliberate indifference to student-on-student harassment contravenes the Equal Protection Clause. The court further ruled that - because \"UMW did not act with deliberate indifference in response to the plaintiffs' complaints\" - the sexual harassment theory fails on the merits alongside the Title IX sex discrimination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feminist Majority Found.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522749\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/283/495/\">\n    283 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   502 n.15.

As our distinguished departed colleague Judge Michael carefully explained in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment secures a student's \"right to be free from sexual harassment in an educational setting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865382\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/686/#p695\">\n    482 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , that Clause not only guards against sexual harassment perpetrated by a school administrator against students, it also protects students from a school administrator's deliberate indifference that allows such harassment to occur and persist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865382\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/686/#p695\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865382\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/686/#p695\">\n    at 701-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (sustaining causal link that supports liability arising from, inter alia, administrator's deliberate indifference).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Although the equal protection claim in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   was premised on supervisory liability, there are compelling parallels between that claim and an equal protection claim premised on a school administrator's deliberate indifference to known student-on-student sexual harassment. In each circumstance, the school administrator has the power and opportunity to both address and rectify the sexual harassment. And, in each situation, the administrator's failure to exercise that power can result in the harassment victim suffering further injury. Lastly, each scenario directly impacts a student's right to be free from sexual harassment in an educational setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   We are not alone in appreciating those parallels.

Our discussion of deliberate indifference to sexual harassment in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   occurred solely in the context of a supervisory liability equal protection claim.

But the similarities between those two types of claims did not provide fair warning, i.e., \"obvious clarity,\" that an insufficient response to student-on-student harassment violates established law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.W. ex rel.

The district court dismissed all of the claims and that judgment should be affirmed in whole. In particular, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the FMF's Title IX claims-which are based on deliberate indifference to peer harassment-adequately alleged that the University exercised substantial control over the harassers and the context of the harassment, so as to show either a sex discrimination or a retaliation claim. However, I concur with the majority's decision to affirm the district court's dismissal of FMF's Title IX claim alleging the University retaliated by disseminating a letter responding to FMF's administrative complaint. Further, while I concur with the majority's decision to affirm the district court's dismissal of FMF's \u00a7 1983 equal protection claim against President Hurley, the qualified immunity analysis is unnecessarily overbroad. The only holding necessary, and prudent under the circumstances, is that qualified immunity is appropriate because FMF's claim is not based on a clearly established violation of protected rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   I.

And even if assumed to be a University student, the Complaint also fails to identify who-of the over 5,000 University students-they were.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marty Morrison,\n   <em>\n    UMW Board of Visitors Announces Tuition Fees for 2014-15\n   </em>\n   , UMW Voice (May 9, 2014), https://www.umw.edu/news/2014/05/09/umw-board-of-visitors-announces-tuition-fees-for-2014-15 (saved as ECF Opinion Attachment). The Complaint alleges that \"Yik Yak is an anonymous social media app,\" J.A. 16 \u00b6 22, meaning that posts on the app, \"Yaks,\" are anonymous: the authors are unnamed. The Complaint also repeatedly acknowledges that the identity of the harasser or harassers was unknown.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 31 \u00b6 63 (recounting one individual plaintiff's fear was exacerbated because \"she did not know if those who threatened and harassed [her] were sitting with [her] in class\"); 35 \u00b6 78 (describing that the \"anonymous nature of the harassment intensified\" the individual plaintiffs' \"concerns, as they had no way of knowing which students harbored animosity against them\").

By contrast, although the Complaint claims that \"[s]tudents posted Yaks,\" J.A. 16 \u00b6 22, it contains no factual basis for drawing that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wag More Dogs, LLC v.

To the contrary, the Complaint's allegations about Yik Yak's geographic limits open the universe of possible harassers to the general population who are not students. Based on the Complaint's allegations of how Yik Yak operated, Yaks visible to University students on the app could have been sent by anyone who was within a 1.5-mile radius (3-mile diameter) of the viewer. J.A. 16 \u00b6 22 (\"Yik Yak ... allows people to create and view messages ... within a 1.5 mile\n   radius.\"). The majority accepts FMF's invitation to draw the inference that since the geographic range includes the University's campus and the topic of the Yaks concerned University matters and University students, the senders were University students. In so doing, the majority goes beyond permissible inference to pure speculation to reach a desired result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Each Yak could have been sent by\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   Yik Yak user located within Yik Yak's geographic range. And that range, even from the center of campus, extends well beyond the University's roughly 0.3-square-mile territory in every direction.\n   <em>\n    Compare [a place to] Distinguish Yourself\n   </em>\n   , Univ. of Mary Washington 3, https://documents.umw.edu/document/umw-a-place-to-distinguish-yourself/ (last visited Dec. 4, 2018 and saved as ECF Opinion Attachment) (stating the campus contains \"176 acres of stately buildings and beautiful woodlands\"),\n   <em>\n    with University of Mary Washington\n   </em>\n   , U.S. News &amp; World Report, https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/mary-washington-3746 (last visited Dec. 4, 2018 and saved as ECF Opinion Attachment) (listing the campus size as 234 acres).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that there are no allegations about where the students were on campus, the geographic range of possible posters extends far off campus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The University's campus is located in the city of Fredericksburg. Within the 1.5-mile Yik Yak coverage radius surrounding the campus are populated areas, including residential neighborhoods, apartment complexes, and numerous shopping and dining establishments. In addition, Yaks posted by individuals located at Mary Washington Hospital, James Monroe High School, the Central Rappahannock Regional Library, as well as downtown Fredericksburg state and municipal buildings would all be within Yik Yak's geographic range on the University's campus. Yik Yak's limited geographic range thus cannot serve as a basis for inferring that the anonymous harassers were University students.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Coupled with the overbreadth of Yik Yak's geographic limitation is the equally problematic fact that it only reflects where the person was at the moment the Yak was sent. Thus, each of the hundreds of Yaks FMF complained of could have been sent by an ever-shifting and fluid number of senders based on who was in that range, much of which was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   part of the University campus. The potential body of harassers is characterized by a persistent transience that makes it even more difficult to know with any level of confidence who sent each Yak, much less that they were a student.\n   <em>\n    And, of course, even if a student, their identity was still unknown.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   These deficits in the Complaint's factual allegations are fatal to FMF's deliberate indifference claim. Merely labeling something as student harassment does not\n   make it so. And because no facts support the conclusion that the University exercised substantial control over the harassers, the Complaint fails on its face to plausibly show that FMF would be entitled to the relief requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"[w]here a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief\");\n   <em>\n    McCleary-Evans v.

For example, the majority generally discusses whether the University can punish students for sexually harassing other students. The answer to that question is clear: it can. But that simplistic conclusion has nothing to do with analyzing the\n   <em>\n    pleadings in the Complaint\n   </em>\n   and ignores the correct\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   inquiry: does the University have control over the harassers?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   To avoid that necessary inquiry, the majority misdirects the focus to the fact that the\n   <em>\n    targets\n   </em>\n   of the harassment were University students under the University's care.

As an initial matter, looking to the physical location of the harassment is not a proper fit. In typical\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   cases, courts have used the funding recipient's school grounds or campus as a basis for determining whether the school exercised substantial control over that environment. But because FMF's claim arises from alleged harassment that occurred in the ether, on a social media app, the location of the harassment is several degrees removed from the traditional geographic consideration: the funding recipient's real property. Thus, at a basic level, the context of the harassment in this case is markedly different from prior\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Online harassment will never, by its nature, occur on a school's grounds or other physical location controlled by a funding recipient in the same way that in-person harassment will. In short, the manner in which in-person harassment can be found to satisfy the context inquiry will necessarily differ from the way in which online harassment could be found to satisfy that inquiry. Even so,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' context inquiry must be satisfied before a funding recipient can be said to incur any liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The Complaint does not plausibly allege that the act of posting harassment occurred on the University's campus. The majority opinion grounds its de minimis context inquiry in its atextual conclusion that \"due to Yik Yak's location-based feature, the harassing and threatening messages originated on or within the immediate vicinity of the UMW campus.\" Maj. Op. 687. This conclusion presents at least two factual problems: First, as discussed in the context of the harasser inquiry, there are no allegations in the Complaint that permit a non-speculative inference that the messages originated on campus. Although the Complaint alleges that Yik Yak allowed only individuals within a 1.5 mile radius to post messages to each other, no allegations further narrow that range to the University's campus. Second, being on or off campus matters to the inquiry because messages posted \"in the vicinity of\" the campus do not-without more-have a sufficient connection to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' context inquiry. Being near an environment that the University controls cannot demonstrate that the University controls the harassment's origination point. To the contrary, it leads to the conclusion that the University does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   control the harassment environment.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   simply does not permit the majority to deem \"vicinity\" to be close enough to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ostrander\n   </em>\n   , a university student alleged that her school should be held liable for its deliberate indifference to her sexual assault by a fellow university student.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100046\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/341/745/#p750\">\n    341 F.3d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Over a decade later, the Eighth Circuit reiterated that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   \"made it clear ... that to be liable for deliberate indifference under Title IX, a University must have had control over the situation in which the harassment or rape occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239572\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/874/#p884\">\n    746 F.3d at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App'x 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (9th Cir. 2018) (memorandum op.) (observing that the plaintiff's \"sexual assault occurred off campus ... at a location that had no sponsorship by or association with\" the funding recipient, meaning that she \"ha[d] failed to allege how [the funding recipient] exercised any control over the environment of her sexual assault\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   That the alleged harassment occurred online is not necessarily dispositive, however, because\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' physical location requirements may have virtual counterparts. For example, a funding recipient may own or otherwise have a property interest in the online forum where the harassment occurred or the means the harasser used to access that forum. But neither circumstance has been alleged here. Specifically, the Complaint does not allege that the University owned Yik Yak or otherwise exercised any control over its content or operation. From all that can be reasonably inferred from the Complaint, Yik Yak was a third-party social media app that was unrelated to the University and open to students and non-students alike. Hence, nothing in the Complaint allows the conclusion that the University had any authority to control what happened on Yik Yak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Nor does the Complaint allege that the University exercised control over other aspects of the environment where the harassment occurred. The Complaint does not allege that the University ever directed its students to access or use Yik Yak for any school business or activities. Individuals accessed the forum on their own initiative totally unrelated to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   University relationship or business. Put differently, this is not alleged to be a situation where the harassment occurred on a University-hosted social media account or as part of online coursework, circumstances where the alleged harassment could satisfy\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' context inquiry. In addition, nothing in the Complaint supports the conclusion that the University facilitated access to the forum where the alleged harassment occurred. That is to say, the Complaint does not allege that the University owned or controlled the electronic devices on which the harassers accessed Yik Yak. Further, the Complaint does not allege facts demonstrating that any of the harassing Yaks were posted using the University's wireless network. The Complaint simply offers no facts connecting the University to the forum in which the harassment occurred (Yik Yak) or alleging that a University-controlled means was used to access that forum (University computers or wireless network).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The absence of allegations concerning the wireless network merits a brief additional discussion because the majority opinion asserts otherwise, claiming that \"some of the offending Yaks were posted\n   using the University's wireless network, and the harassers necessarily created those Yaks on campus.\" Maj. Op. 687. This is baseless speculation without support in the Complaint. At no point does the Complaint allege any facts that connect any of the Yaks to the University's wireless network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 6-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   To be sure, the Complaint alleges the Yaks had to be created within the geographic parameters of the app because of how Yik Yak operated. But, as already discussed, that range extended well off campus into the Fredericksburg community at large. Furthermore, as the Complaint recognizes, students and nonstudents alike could access Yik Yak within those geographic parameters through non-University network capabilities on their own personal devices; they had no need to use the University's wireless network to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 26, \u00b6 50. In sum, the allegations fail to plausibly associate even one harassing Yak to the University's wireless network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   With one exception, all of the Complaint's references to the University wireless network occur in the context of discussing that students asked the University to ban Yik Yak from being accessible on the University network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 26-27, 29-30, 39. Students' repeated requests to the University to ban Yik Yak obviously do not correlate to whether anyone had ever used the University's wireless network to access Yik Yak in the first instance, let alone that anyone had done so to post a harassing Yak.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The one exception occurs in the Complaint's preliminary statement and introduction to the underlying events, which postulates that the \"Defendants failed to report the threats of violence to law enforcement authorities or even to attempt to identify the assailants,\n   <em>\n    even though the University's wireless internet was used to access Yik Yak\n   </em>\n   , thereby facilitating the cyber assaults and threats, and the assailants' conduct violated Virginia law.\" J.A. 12, \u00b6 5 (emphasis added). Such a conclusory characterization, utterly unsupported by any factual development or allegations in the statement of the underlying facts anywhere in the Complaint, does not satisfy FMF's minimal pleading burden under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Aziz v.

For these reasons, the Complaint does not contain allegations that allow for a connection between the University's wireless network-over which the University does have control-and Yik Yak or the offensive Yaks-over which the University has no control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Complaint simply fails to plead a fundamental part of a\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim: that the University substantially controlled the context where the harassment occurred. When comparing the hallmarks of the context inquiry under\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   against the Complaint's allegations, the Complaint fails to plausibly allege facts sufficient to satisfy this threshold requirement. As such, the University cannot be held liable under Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Nothing in the majority opinion's scant analysis alters this conclusion. To the contrary, after mentioning that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   requires a showing of substantial control over the context of the harassment, the majority ignores the principles set out by the Supreme Court. Added to the errors already discussed, a few more examples illustrate how far the majority's analysis strays from\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' explanation of the context inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The majority opinion cites this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kowalski v. Berkeley County Schools\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3758742\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/565/#p573\">\n    652 F.3d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (4th Cir. 2011), for the observation that \"speech originating outside of the schoolhouse gate but directed at persons in school and received by and acted on by them [may] in fact [constitute] in-school speech.\" Maj. Op. 687. That observation, made in the context of a First Amendment challenge and school-disruption analysis under\n   <em>\n    Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/\">\n    393 U.S. 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/\">\n    89 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/\">\n    21 L.Ed.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969), says nothing about the Title IX\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   context inquiry. While both\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   direct courts to look to certain aspects of the school environment, the underlying principles, objectives, and analyses in each case are markedly different.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   What is more, the record in\n   <em>\n    Kowalski\n   </em>\n   showed that although Kowalski created the website off campus, other students used both school and personal computers to access and comment on it. 652 F.3d at 567-68, 574. No similar allegations establishing the necessary nexus concerning on-campus conduct exist here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The majority opinion also conjures up that the University controlled the context of the harassment because it could have \"control[led] activities that occur on its own [wireless] network\" such as by blocking any person on the University's network from accessing Yik Yak or banning the harassers (once identified) from using the University's network for any purpose. Maj. Op. 688. Such analytical sleight of hand substitutes obvious areas over which the University could have exercised control (its wireless network and students) as\n   proof that the University controlled the context of the harassment. But by itself, the University's ability to control its own wireless network says nothing about the University's ability to control the harassment on Yik Yak, a third-party app. Clearly, even if the University closed any access to Yik Yak via its network (a First Amendment error described above), Yik Yak would still be readily available and easily accessed anywhere on campus via the student's own electronic devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Using similar misdirection, the majority opinion suggests that the University could have controlled the context of the harassment by communicating its anti-harassment policies more effectively, or by holding assemblies or training to oppose cyberbullying and sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. 688. The notion of doing more to raise awareness and combat harassment-while a laudable goal-is irrelevant to\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' context inquiry. To state the obvious, before delving into whether a funding recipient was deliberately indifferent or whether its response was clearly unreasonable, courts must first look at whether the funding recipient is appropriately subjected to a deliberate indifference claim under Title IX. That threshold requirement is satisfied only where the recipient exercised substantial control over the context of the known harassment, that is, the environment where it occurred. The efforts identified by the majority ignore that instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Because the Complaint failed to plausibly allege facts that the University exercised control over Yik Yak or the means the harassers were using to access Yik Yak, the Complaint fails to meet the minimal pleading requirement that the University controlled the context of the harassment at issue in this case. And because a litigant must satisfy\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' context inquiry in order to bring suit, the district court appropriately granted the University's motion to dismiss for failure to state a deliberate indifference claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Only by distorting and ignoring the original principles set out in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   can the majority reach its preferred result, holding that the Complaint states a plausible claim of deliberate indifference against the University. The majority has repositioned the once high bar for a\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim to a new low.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.B.\n   </em>\n   , 819 F.3d at 76. As demonstrated, the Complaint does not contain factual allegations that satisfy\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' harasser or context inquiries. And because the Complaint does not survive 12(b)(6) review concerning these threshold requirements for a deliberate indifference claim, there's no need to proceed further and consider whether the University's response was clearly unreasonable. The district court's decision to dismiss this claim should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   II. Title IX: Retaliation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   FMF's retaliation claim relies on two distinct acts: first, the University's alleged deliberate indifference to peer retaliatory harassment on Yik Yak, and, second, its alleged direct retaliation in disseminating a letter responding to FMF's administrative complaint (President Hurley's June 2015 letter). Neither ground pleads a viable claim, and I would affirm the district court's judgment dismissing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   First, FMF asserts the University is liable under a Title IX retaliation claim based on its alleged deliberate indifference to retaliatory peer harassment. This type of imputed retaliation claim has never been recognized by either the Supreme Court or any circuit court. The Supreme Court has recognized only that Title IX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   implicitly authorized a private right of action for the University's own retaliatory conduct.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537908\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/167/#p171\">\n    544 U.S. at 173-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537908\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/167/#p171\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Title IX implicitly authorizes a private right of action against funding recipients who retaliate against a person for complaining of sex discrimination). Lacking binding authority or even persuasive circuit-court authority to support the viability of such a claim, the majority must instead cite a district court decision to hold that a plaintiff can pursue a retaliation claim based on a funding recipient's deliberate indifference to peer retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. 696-97. That recourse reflects the frailty of the majority's goal-oriented analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Unlike the majority, however, it is unnecessary to conclusively determine when, or if at all, a retaliation claim based on deliberate indifference to retaliatory peer harassment could be recognized as a separate cause of action. Even assuming that such a claim may be viable in some circumstances,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' discussion of when a funding recipient can be held liable under a deliberate indifference theory would control the analysis. And, as noted, FMF's Complaint does not satisfy the necessary pleading requirements because it does not plausibly allege facts that would satisfy\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ' threshold harasser and context inquiries. Put simply, FMF relies on the same allegations to demonstrate the University's deliberate indifference for both claims, so the same analysis precludes both claims. I would affirm the district court's dismissal of the retaliation claim predicated on the University's deliberate indifference to peer retaliatory harassment and therefore dissent from the majority's contrary conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Second, FMF asserts that the University-through President Hurley-directly engaged in unlawful retaliation by disseminating a letter responding to FMF's administrative complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights. I agree with the majority's observation that \"an educational institution and its administrators are entitled to defend against accusations of discrimination\" so long as that defense does not threaten or intimidate the complainant from pursuing the claim. Maj. Op. 697. I further agree with its conclusion that the allegations concerning the contents of President Hurley's letter do not cross that line.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. 697-99. I therefore concur with the majority's decision to affirm the district court's\n   dismissal of this part of FMF's retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   III.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   : Equal Protection Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   FMF also brought a \u00a7 1983 -based equal protection claim against President Hurley, individually, based on his alleged deliberate indifference to peer sexual harassment. President Hurley defends both on the merits and by asserting qualified immunity. Because I agree that President Hurley is entitled to qualified immunity, I concur with the majority in affirming dismissal. I write separately, however, because the majority's speculative analysis goes well beyond the limited review needed to conclude that President Hurley's actions did not violate clearly established law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Qualified immunity looks both to \"whether a constitutional violation occurred\" and \"whether the right violated was clearly established at the time of the official's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
