She stipulated to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to March 3, 2016, an acquaintance asked Priscilla Valdez if she was willing to purchase ammunition and drive it to Nogales, Arizona. Ms. Valdez did not agree to commit the offense, but gave this acquaintance's contact information to an individual she knew-Anhelika Ruiz.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly before March 3, 2016, Ms. Ruiz asked Ms. Valdez to help and accompany her regarding the ammunition purchase. Ms. Valdez agreed. Prior to the offense, Ms. Valdez picked up a quantity of cash from the acquaintance, for the ammunition purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about March 3, 2016, Ms. Valdez and Ms. Ruiz met in Tucson. Ms. Valdez gave Ms. Ruiz the money she had been given. Ms. Ruiz rented a car, in her own name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   They then drove to a gun store in Phoenix, Arizona. Ms. Ruiz purchased 10,000 rounds of 7.62 x 39mm ammunition at the gun store, using the money that Ms. Valdez had provided her. The ammunition was loaded into the rented car. Ms. Ruiz and Ms. Valdez then drove south, to Nogales, Arizona.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   They received instructions to drive the car, with ammunition inside, to a specific business in Nogales, Arizona. They were instructed to give the keys of the rented car to a person who worked at the front desk of the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Later, Ms. Valdez and Ms. Ruiz were informed when they could pick up the car. When they picked up the car, the ammunition had been unloaded by unknown individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Valdez was aware that her acquaintance and the individuals that picked up the ammunition intended to try to move it from the U.S. to Mexico. Ms. Valdez, by assisting in the commission of the offense, knowingly attempted to export ammunition. Ms. Valdez does not have a license to export ammunition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court accepted the factual stipulation and found Defendant guilty. The government was unsuccessful in its efforts to recover the ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The indictment included a forfeiture allegation, seeking forfeiture of the ammunition or, if the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p) were met, substitute property in lieu of the ammunition. After the court accepted Defendant's guilty plea, the government submitted a receipt for the ammunition from the gun store, showing that the ammunition cost $2,470. The government sought a money judgment against Defendant for half the cost of the ammunition. The district court rejected Defendant's objections and entered a final order of forfeiture against Defendant for $1,235, in the form of a money judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sentenced Defendant to five years of probation. Defendant timely appeals, challenging only the forfeiture order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This case involves the interaction of three disparate statutory provisions.

(Emphasis added.) Whatever distinction might exist between \"provisions\" of \u00a7 853 and \"procedures\" of \u00a7 853 in these two disparate statutes, that distinction is immaterial here because \u00a7 853(p) is a procedure within \u00a7 853. We join our sister circuits in holding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202461\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) incorporates the substitute property provision in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The district court properly ordered forfeiture of substitute property\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Section 853(p) authorizes forfeiture of substitute property when, \"as a result of any act or omission of the defendant,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 853(p)(1), the forfeitable property \"has been transferred ... to ... a third party,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 853(p)(1)(B). Here, Defendant received money from her acquaintance, gave it to Ruiz for the purpose of purchasing ammunition, and accompanied Ruiz on her journey. Defendant and Ruiz then left the ammunition in the car and provided the car keys to a third party, knowing that someone would remove the ammunition from the car and attempt to transport it into Mexico. Those acts and omissions clearly caused the ammunition to be transferred to a third party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the district court properly ordered Defendant to forfeit substitute property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant objects to that analysis on the ground that it omits a critical portion of the text of \u00a7 853(p)(1). In particular, Defendant quotes the following passage from \u00a7 853(p)(1) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Paragraph (2) of this subsection [which authorizes the forfeiture of substitute property] shall apply,\n   <em>\n    if any property described in subsection (a)\n   </em>\n   , as a result of any act or omission of the defendant ... (B) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Defendant asserts that the ammunition here does not meet the\n   definition of forfeitable property in \u00a7 853(a) and that, accordingly, the requirements of \u00a7 853(p)(1) are not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant misunderstands how the three relevant statutes work together. Section 924(d) describes the forfeitable property, and \u00a7 2461(c) authorizes the use of the procedures of \u00a7 853\n   <em>\n    with respect to the forfeitable property\n   </em>\n   . In a case governed by \u00a7 2461(c), Congress intended courts to apply \u00a7 853(p) and the other procedures of \u00a7 853 to the forfeitable property as defined elsewhere. Subsection 853(a) is plainly a substantive, not procedural, provision of \u00a7 853, because it describes the forfeitable property for certain drug crimes. As a substantive provision, it is not incorporated by \u00a7 2461(c). Accordingly, in a case governed by \u00a7 2461(c), courts must read the references in \u00a7 853 's procedural provisions to \"property described in subsection (a)\" as referring to the forfeitable property as defined elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bermudez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968701\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/304/#p305\">\n    413 F.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305-06 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (holding that \u00a7 853(p) applies with respect to forfeitable property as defined in \u00a7 982(a)(1) rather than \u00a7 853(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We reject Defendant's argument that our interpretation is inequitable. In the course of her crime, Defendant caused ammunition to be transferred to a third party. Congress has determined that, in this circumstance, the government may seek the forfeiture of substitute property. Defendant complains that, had she been arrested\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she caused the ammunition to be transferred, the government would have recovered the ammunition and would have had no ability to seek forfeiture of substitute property. She contends that Congress could not have intended this unfair result, which treats intermediary smugglers differently depending on when they are arrested. We see no inequity in treating persons differently depending on whether they cause contraband to remain in the hands of criminals. For those who cause that additional harm, Congress permissibly has concluded that they must forfeit substitute property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The district court separately ordered co-defendant Ruiz to forfeit the same amount.
