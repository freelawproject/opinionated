(Express Scripts), alleging various contract claims, a promissory estoppel claim, and violations of federal antitrust laws and state Any Willing Provider laws. The district\n   court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   dismissed Irmat's complaint for failure to state a claim. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Express Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) in the United States. A PBM is a third-party administrator of prescription drug programs. PBMs process and pay prescription drug claims made by pharmacies and patients. PBMs also negotiate drug discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, handle pharmacy benefits for health plans and self-insured entities, and develop lists of drugs that are approved for reimbursement. A patient's health insurance plan chooses which PBM covers their drug-related expenses. Express Scripts and another PBM, CVS Health (CVS), account for 65% of the PBM market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PBMs create networks of pharmacies in which PBM members can receive their prescription pharmaceuticals at covered, discounted rates. To be successful, independent pharmacies must participate in the largest PBM networks. These independent pharmacies contract with PBMs either directly or through an agent such as a Pharmacy Services Administrative Organization (PSAO). Ninety-seven percent of retail pharmacies in the United States participate in Express Scripts's pharmacy network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Express Scripts also operates a mail-order pharmacy that fills prescriptions by mail nationwide. It is the only mail-order pharmacy allowed in Express Scripts's PBM network. According to Irmat, PBMs that own mail-order pharmacies dominate the mail-order pharmacy service industry. Nevertheless, independent pharmacies, like Irmat, have been able to successfully provide mail-order pharmacy services to customers in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Irmat is a New York-based, independent pharmacy located in midtown Manhattan. It opened in 1978. For many years, Irmat was a successful retail pharmacy that filled and sold prescriptions via its storefront location. In 2013, Irmat began focusing on dermatological pharmaceuticals. It entered into a patient assistance program with dermatological drug manufacturers for pharmaceuticals that often had no generic equivalent. Under the programs, the manufacturers would pay a portion of a patient's insurance co-payment to Irmat. Because of its participation in these programs, Irmat expanded its business into a nationwide mail-order pharmacy and increased its staff from twenty employees to 208 employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Irmat joined Express Scripts's PBM network in 2012 through AccessHealth, a PSAO, and gained access to more than 100 other PBMs. In October 2014, Express Scripts sent Irmat a Network Provider Agreement (the agreement) requiring that Irmat sign or risk termination from its network. The agreement required Irmat to meet the definition of a \"retail provider,\" which was defined as a pharmacy \"that primarily fills and sells prescriptions via a retail, storefront location\" and that \"shall not include mail order\" pharmacies. The agreement also included recredentialing requirements whereby a retail provider must disclose updated information to Express Scripts. Failure to comply with the recredentialing requirements constituted a breach of the agreement and was cause for termination from Express Scripts's network. Finally, the agreement allowed Express Scripts to unilaterally terminate the contract without cause upon thirty days\n   written notice. Irmat signed the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Express Scripts required Irmat to submit a recredentialing application in July 2015. Irmat disclosed that 35% of its business came from its retail pharmacy and that 65% of its business came from its mail-order pharmacy. On August 7, 2015, Express Scripts sent Irmat an e-mail, the subject line of which read \"Express Scripts credentials approved,\" and the text of which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   We are pleased to inform you that your recently submitted credentials have been reviewed and you are approved to continue in the Express Scripts Holding Company pharmacy networks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Irmat then hired more employees, constructed a multi-million dollar facility in New York, and spent time and money acquiring mail-order accreditations. In May 2016, Express Scripts sent Irmat a letter demanding Irmat cease and desist its mail-order operations because they were in violation of the agreement. Irmat responded with a letter referring to the August 2015 e-mail. On July 15, 2016, Express Scripts replied that Irmat would be terminated from the network in sixty-one days, primarily because of Irmat's mail-order business. Irmat appealed the termination through Express Scripts's internal appeal process. Express Scripts affirmed its decision in a letter dated August 22, 2016, which added that it was also terminating Irmat without cause. Express Scripts terminated Irmat from its network on or about September 30, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the grant of a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Christiansen v.

There is no necessity 'that for each stipulation in a contract binding the one party there must be a corresponding stipulation binding the other.' \"\n   <em>\n    Laclede Gas Co. v.

Specifically, Express Scripts threatened that if Irmat did not complete and return the agreement, Irmat would be in breach of their original network contract and suffer patient disruption. Irmat also cites its allegation that more than 97% of all U.S. retail pharmacies participate in Express Scripts's network and that participating in Express Scripts's network was a matter of business necessity for Irmat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Irmat argues that this case is analogous to\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   , in which the Missouri Supreme Court found the contract at issue was unconscionable. In\n   <em>\n    Brewer\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, an average consumer, contracted for a secured loan bearing an annual interest rate of 300%.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315678\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/486/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315678\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/486/\">\n    at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Furthermore, Irmat is a sophisticated consumer that had operated successfully outside Express Scripts's network prior to 2012. Finally, as the district court properly noted, Irmat had access to more than 100 PBM networks when it joined AccessHealth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford Prof'l Drugs, Inc. v. CVS Caremark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=748%20F.3d%20249\">\n    748 F.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264 (5th Cir. 2014) (noting there was no contract of adhesion wherein \"[t]he Plaintiffs have failed to present any evidence that they were prevented from contracting with another PBM\"). Irmat has thus failed to plausibly plead that the agreement was unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Irmat next argues that Express Scripts violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing when it terminated Irmat from its network. \"Missouri law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Farmers' Elec.

A party exercising its express contract rights, however, may still breach the covenant if it does so \"in a manner that evades the spirit of the agreement and denies the movant the expected benefit of the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Glenn v.

Ct. App. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Irmat does not deny that it violated the contract and that Express Scripts was thus entitled to terminate Irmat from its network for cause. Irmat argues instead that Express Scripts acted in bad faith by terminating Irmat on the basis of its anticompetitive motives when exercising its right to terminate Irmat without cause. Irmat cites\n   <em>\n    BJC Health System v. Columbia Casualty Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782008\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/478/908/\">\n    478 F.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2007), which we conclude is inapposite. We held in that case that under Missouri law a jury could find that a party to a contract acted in bad faith when making a subjective decision regarding the contract that may have been unreasonable and intentionally designed to trigger a termination provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782008\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/478/908/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 916 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

App. 1986) (determining that defendant acted in bad faith when it subjectively read contract terms to allow for termination of benefits at will and without notice). Here, however, Express Scripts did not make a discretionary decision in either defining the terms of the agreement or in exercising its rights under the agreement. The Missouri Supreme Court has explicitly held that a defendant does not act in bad faith when it acts in accordance with express contractual rights that allow it to terminate the agreement without cause upon thirty days notice.\n   <em>\n    Bishop &amp; Assocs. v.

It contends that the e-mail excised the prohibition against operating a mail-order pharmacy from the agreement and abrogated Express Scripts's contractual rights to terminate Irmat for and without cause. Irmat argues that Express Scripts thus breached this new contract when it terminated Irmat from the network. Express Scripts responds that because the e-mail was not a novation but merely a contractually obligated step in the recredentialing process, there was no new contract and thus no breach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.R.

We conclude that the e-mail was instead part of the recredentialing process required by the agreement.

It claims that CVS and Express Scripts conspired to terminate Irmat from their PBM networks because it operated a mail-order pharmacy that competed with Express Scripts's and CVS's mail-order pharmacies. Irmat had been a member of CVS's pharmacy networks since 2012. In August 2016, CVS required Irmat to participate in its mail-order network, three months after Express Scripts sent Irmat a letter demanding that Irmat abandon its mail-order pharmacy operations. Although CVS later terminated Irmat from its pharmacy networks on February 3, 2017, the fact that CVS allowed Irmat to join in its mail-order network at all suggests that CVS and Express Scripts did not conspire to boycott Irmat. Irmat contends, however, that the August 2016 requirement to participate in CVS's mail-order pharmacy network was a veiled plan to reimburse Irmat at lower rates than it had paid in the past. Irmat also claims that CVS subjected Irmat to abusive audits throughout the years. Even assuming the truth of those allegations, there is no evidence that Express Scripts joined in CVS's conduct. Express Scripts never required Irmat to enter into a mail-order network so that it could reimburse prescriptions at lower rates, nor does Irmat contend that Express Scripts ever subjected Irmat to abusive audits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The only allegation that hints at parallel conduct is that both CVS and Express Scripts terminated Irmat from their networks. But the terminations lack temporal proximity. Express Scripts notified Irmat of termination in July 2016, six months before CVS notified Irmat of termination. In determining whether six months was\n   too long of a time frame to suggest parallel activity, the district court looked to\n   <em>\n    In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062238\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1011/#p1022\">\n    527 F.Supp.2d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (N.D. Cal. 2007), in which the court found that three months between actions fell \"short of unusual, lockstep ... behavior.\" We do not hold that actions taken within six months of each other can never constitute parallel conduct, but only that the terminations here, executed under dissimilar circumstances and separated by six months, did not constitute parallel conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burtch v.

Irmat and Express Scripts did not have a voluntary, years-long relationship regarding their competing mail-order pharmacies.
