The couple was later identified as Appellant Ibrahim McCants and Chelsea Fulton. Two other officers-Stephen Rochester and Cory Patterson-also arrived on the scene within minutes after hearing the call. Before they approached the couple, Officer Rochester confirmed with the dispatcher that \"the male actor involved had dreadlocks.\" App. 78.

McCants filed a pretrial motion to suppress the firearm and drugs and requested an evidentiary hearing on the motion, arguing the officers did not have reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity before they frisked him. The Government opposed the motion, and the District Court denied it without oral argument. The Court found that the stop was based on reasonable suspicion because the caller's \"anonymous tip bore sufficient indicia of reliability.\"\n   <em>\n    McCants\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204705452\">\n    2016 WL 4705452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The District Court then conducted a stipulated bench trial, and McCants was found guilty as charged on both counts. The United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) in which it designated McCants a career offender. McCants objected to the PSR, arguing that his two previous second-degree robbery convictions in New Jersey did not qualify as crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Had the convictions not qualified as crimes of violence, his advisory range would have been lowered from 168-210 months to 63-78 months under Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1. The District Court overruled McCants's objection, concluding that his two prior robbery convictions qualified as crimes of violence. At sentencing, the Court varied downward, imposing a sentence of 120 months' imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. McCants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and we have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In the District Court's view, the tip sufficed because the caller used the 911 system to report firsthand knowledge of ongoing domestic violence, and she gave an accurate description that was quickly confirmed by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   McCants argues that the 911 call could not have provided the officers with reasonable suspicion to justify the stop for two main reasons: (1) the tip was vague and did not demonstrate sufficient indicia of reliability; and (2) the officers did not find corroborating evidence of domestic violence at the scene. These arguments are unpersuasive in light of controlling precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, McCants contends that the 911 call was unreliable because it was akin to the bare-bones tip deemed inadequate by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Florida v. J.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    529 U.S. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). In\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   , the police received an anonymous call \"that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court held that this \"bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant\" who did not explain the basis for his tip lacked sufficient indicia of reliability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the facts of McCants's appeal differ from\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   in important respects. Here, the 911 caller gave a firsthand account of ongoing criminal activity, as well as a highly specific and accurate description of the suspect's location, clothing, and hair. In\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   , the informant reported significantly fewer details and described potentially innocuous behavior without explaining why the informant thought the subject was committing (or was about to commit) a crime. Because of these differences, we disagree with McCants that the 911 call mirrors the limited and vague report in\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the Government argues, the indicia of reliability in McCants's case are like those in\n   <em>\n    Navarette v.

Regarding the second robbery offense on April 28, 2004, the court asked McCants: \"And on that occasion did you take or attempt to take from an individual by the threat of force some items?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184420\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/185/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He again responded, \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184420\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/185/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We agree with the Government that McCants's admissions that he threatened or attempted to threaten another with force is evidence of guilt under subsection (a)(2), which requires that a defendant \"[t]hreaten[ ] another with or purposely put[ ] him in fear of immediate bodily injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although McCants concedes that the colloquy shows he did not plead guilty under subsection (a)(1), which requires the use of force, he makes two semantic arguments that his admissions do not fall under subsection (a)(2). First, he contends the colloquy does not address injury or fear, which he believes are required by the statute. Second, he argues his admissions regarding force do not equate to threats of immediate bodily injury. Taken together, he claims the colloquy allows for the possibility that he was convicted under subsection (a)(3), which does not require violent force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We disagree that McCants's colloquy shows he could have been convicted under subsection (a)(3). First, his semantic arguments are inconsistent with the plea colloquy. His admissions of attempting or successfully using threat of force to take items from individuals most closely match subsection (a)(2). Second, McCants points to nothing in the colloquy permitting even the inference that he pleaded guilty under subsection (a)(3). Had McCants pleaded guilty to subsection (a)(3), he would have needed to admit that he committed or threatened to commit another crime. Yet his plea colloquy makes reference to neither. Because he could not have pleaded guilty to subsection (a)(3) and McCants concedes he was not convicted under subsection (a)(1), the only logical choice is subsection (a)(2). Thus, we have no reason to overturn the District Court's finding that the natural reading of the plea colloquy is that McCants's two prior robbery convictions fall under N.J. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 2C:15-1(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, we must decide whether McCants's convictions under subsection (a)(2) are predicate offenses under either the \"elements\" clause or the \"enumerated offense\" clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) of the Guidelines. In our view, they satisfy both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Under the elements clause (\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) ), a conviction qualifies if it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\n   the person of another.\" We have explained that the \"use of physical force ... involves the intentional employment of something capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person, regardless of whether the perpetrator struck the victim's body.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275357\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/129/#p131\">\n    866 F.3d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Subsection (a)(2) of the robbery statute requires that the defendant \"[t]hreaten[ ] another with or purposely put[ ] him in fear of immediate bodily injury.\" N.J. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 2C:15-1(a)(2). In New Jersey, \"bodily injury\" is defined as \"physical pain, illness or any impairment of physical condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275357\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/129/#p131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2C:11-1(a). Under both the Guidelines and New Jersey definitions, the defendant must place another in fear of physical pain or injury. Because \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) does not mandate physical contact, New Jersey's definition of \"bodily injury\" falls within the Guidelines' definition of \"crime of violence.\" Accordingly, we hold that McCants's conviction under subsection (a)(2) qualifies as a crime of violence under the elements clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) of the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We reach the same result with regard to the enumerated offense clause (\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) ), which lists \"robbery\" as a crime of violence. When the Guidelines specifically list an offense, we \"compare the elements of the crime of conviction to the generic form of the offense as defined by the States, learned treatises, and the Model Penal Code.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We held in\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   that \"generic robbery requires no more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   force\" to meet this definition.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265040\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/494/#p499\">\n    877 F.3d at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

STAT. ANN. \u00a7 2C:15-1(a)(2). We agree with the Government that subsection (a)(2) falls within the definition of generic robbery because the statute requires the threat of bodily injury, which involves more force-and is therefore categorically narrower-than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   force,\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265040\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/494/#p499\">\n    877 F.3d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we hold that McCants's convictions under subsection (a)(2) qualify as crimes of violence under the enumerated offense clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).
