Five judges voted in favor of rehearing en banc; five judges voted against rehearing en banc; one judge is disqualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, the suggestion to rehear the case en banc is denied. Chief Judge Smith, Judge Wollman, Judge Loken, Judge Colloton, and Judge Gruender would rehear the case en banc. Judge Erickson did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I would rehear this case en banc to reconsider the panel's decision that aggravated assault in North Dakota is not a \"crime of violence\" under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The panel's conclusion-that an offense encompassing reckless driving causing injury does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another-is unsupported by the text of the guideline, has significant effect on the law of the circuit, and conflicts with other persuasive authority. We should undertake further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The panel opinion says that reckless driving causing injury \"does not require physical force.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Reckless driving causing injury thus has as an element the use of physical force against the person of another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The panel decision applies circuit precedent that never analyzed the text of the guideline.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the \"force\" clause has distinct textual elements, and decisions interpreting the residual clause are unenlightening.\n   <em>\n    Ossana\n   </em>\n   did not deny that reckless driving causing injury requires force, but added another element-not found in the text of the \"force\" clause-that an offender's conduct must be \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199444\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/895/#p900\">\n    638 F.3d at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Begay v.

Insofar as\n   <em>\n    Ossana\n   </em>\n   implicitly ruled that a reckless application of force is not a \"use\" of force, that conclusion was superseded by\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fogg\n   </em>\n   and should have been abandoned in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As the Tenth Circuit recently recognized in rejecting\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   , nothing in the text of the \"force\" clause supports a distinction between reckless driving causing injury and other reckless uses of force that cause injury.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the \"force\" clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is identical to the \"force\" clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i), the decisions inhibit both proper criminal history scoring under the sentencing guidelines and proper classification of recidivists under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

The panel decision here excludes all aggravated assault convictions in North Dakota. Applying\n   <em>\n    Schneider\n   </em>\n   , the decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.
