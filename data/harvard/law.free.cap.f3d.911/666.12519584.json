Bruce Carlson was co-lead counsel representing the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    In re Community Bank of Northern Virginia Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation\n   </em>\n   , MDL No. 1674 (\"\n   <em>\n    In re Community Bank\n   </em>\n   \" or \"CBNV\"). He began his work on the case\n   while an associate with Specter Specter Evans &amp; Manogue (\"SSEM\" or \"the firm\"), and continued to work on the case after he left the firm. He entered into agreements with SSEM regarding how fees recovered in CBNV, and other cases, would be allocated between himself and SSEM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the final order approving the class settlement and fee award was entered in CBNV, SSEM filed a state court breach of contract action against Carlson, alleging that he owed the firm a portion of the fees he received in CBNV. Carlson moved the District Court to stay the state case and confirm his fee award. The Court exercised ancillary jurisdiction over the state contract dispute, stayed the state case, and granted Carlson's motion, concluding that SSEM was not entitled to any portion of the fee Carlson had received because a condition precedent for triggering any payment to SSEM had not occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District Court erred in exercising ancillary jurisdiction over the state contract dispute because it did not retain jurisdiction over disputes arising from the allocation of fees among counsel, the state law breach of contract claim is factually distinct from the federal claims the CBNV plaintiffs made against the bank, exercising ancillary jurisdiction was not needed for the Court to resolve matters properly before it, and the Court had no control over the funds SSEM seeks. Because the Court improperly exercised ancillary jurisdiction over this dispute, we will reverse the order exercising ancillary jurisdiction, lift the stay of the state court action, vacate the order confirming Carlson's fees, and leave to the state court the resolution of this state law contract dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   SSEM hired Carlson as an associate in 2000 for a salary and various benefits, as well as a percentage of fees earned by the firm for class actions he originated. Within weeks of his hiring, Carlson identified individuals who had incurred losses allegedly arising from their dealings with lenders who paid illegal kick-backs to undisclosed third parties. Based upon his investigation, Carlson filed several lawsuits that eventually became part of the CBNV multidistrict litigation, alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , as amended by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (\"HOEPA\"),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1639\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   In 2003, the District Court granted a joint motion for class certification and approval of a class settlement, which would have paid $33 million to the class and $8.1 million to class counsel. Objectors and proposed intervenors appealed the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2004, while the appeal of the class certification and class settlement order was pending, Carlson and SSEM entered into an agreement concerning how they would split fees for CBNV. The agreement noted that the District Court had approved a class counsel fee award of $8.1 million that was on appeal, and that, \"assuming that the district court's Order is affirmed ..., Carlson shall be entitled to 20% of the first $2,000,000 and 35% of all amounts in excess of $2,000,000.\" App. 289. Two months later, Carlson decided to leave the firm, and in June 2004, he and SSEM entered into a Separation Agreement. That agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All defense counsel, all plaintiff's counsel and all courts shall be advised that SSEM and CARLSON have a joint interest in a portion of the fee in the cases set forth herein [including CBNV], and that, with respect to that interest,\n   CARLSON and SSEM (as soon as practicable but in no event later than June 1, 2004) shall prepare and dispatch a joint letter to defense counsel directing that their respective fee interests be wired to separate escrow accounts, consistent with the fee sharing arrangements set forth in this Agreement. CARLSON expressly represents that he has consulted with defense counsel in each of these cases and they are agreeable to this arrangement. CARLSON and SSEM will also file a notice under seal with each court wherein a case is pending that is subject to this Agreement that confirms the fee arrangement between SSEM and CARLSON for that case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   App. 258-59 \u00b6 13. The Separation Agreement acknowledges previously negotiated fee-splitting agreements and, with respect to CBNV states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   SSEM and/or CARLSON are entitled to fifty-percent (50%) of the $8.1 million fee approved in this case (after payment to objectors). The parties previously agreed that CARLSON is entitled to twenty percent (20%) of the first $2 million payable to SSEM and/or CARLSON and thirty-five percent (35%) of all amounts in excess of $2 million. This agreement shall continue intact, irrespective of CARLSON'S ongoing responsibilities in the matter and any time that CARLSON may devote to the appeal of the settlement's approval and thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   App. 259-60 \u00b6 16. After Carlson left SSEM, we vacated the 2003 class certification and class settlement order and remanded the case.\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933047\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/277/#p301\">\n    418 F.3d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301-02 (3d Cir. 2005). Carlson notified SSEM of this ruling and sought to change the Separation Agreement. The record is silent as to whether SSEM responded to this notification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2008, the District Court granted a second joint motion for class certification and approval of a class settlement.\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Bank\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-0425,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20239650\">\n    2008 WL 239650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 25, 2008). While the second order was on appeal, Carlson suggested that he and SSEM enter mediation to renegotiate their fee-splitting agreement. There is no evidence that SSEM responded to this suggestion. In the meantime, we vacated the second class certification and class settlement order and again remanded.\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787748\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/275/#p279\">\n    622 F.3d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279 (3d Cir. 2010),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 20, 2010). Carlson's partner Gary Lynch informed SSEM that the second order had been vacated and again sought to revise the fee-splitting agreement. Nothing in the record indicates the agreement was revised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the second remand, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, the parties engaged in discovery and motion practice, and the District Court entered an order granting a contested motion for class certification,\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Bank\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 03cv0425 and 05cv0688,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203972458\">\n    2013 WL 3972458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (W.D. Pa. July 31, 2013), which we affirmed,\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918960,4288288\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/380/\">\n    795 F.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410 (3d Cir. 2015). Thereafter, the parties reached a class settlement, which the District Court approved. The Court permitted the parties to use a three-arbitrator panel to conduct a \"high-low\" arbitration to fix the actual settlement amount and the fee award. The Court's final order retained jurisdiction over any dispute or cause of action \"related to the administration and/or enforcement of the Agreement, Settlement, [or] Order,\" App. 204, but it excised the section of the order concerning attorneys' fees and expenses. The Court also denied without prejudice the pending motion for attorney fees \"since jurisdiction lies with the Arbitration Panel.\" App. 290.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In March 2017, the panel determined the value of the settlement, establishing a $24 million common fund from which it awarded $8.4 million in counsel fees. The arbitrators did not allocate the $8.4 million among plaintiffs' counsel. Instead, the panel stated that class counsel\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   have irrevocably agreed on an allocation of attorneys' fees and reimbursable expenses among themselves.... Such attorneys' fees are ... to be allocated among the various Class Counsel as they have previously agreed. No fees, costs or expenses are approved or authorized except as described herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   App. 209-10. The attorneys' fees were distributed to class counsel, including Carlson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In June 2017, SSEM sued Carlson in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, arguing that Carlson breached their 2004 Separation Agreement and seeking $1.9 million. Carlson moved the District Court for orders staying the state court action and confirming his fee award. The Court exercised ancillary jurisdiction, stayed the state court action, and granted Carlson's motion to confirm his fee award.\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Bank\n   </em>\n   , No. 03CV0425,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203621509\">\n    2017 WL 3621509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 23, 2017). With respect to its exercise of ancillary jurisdiction, the Court explained\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   the utter lack of attendance on the part of any representative of SSEM, the Court's own experience with the Parties' counsel during the complex negotiations which ultimately led to the Settlement Agreement (ECF 759-1) and the Court-approved Notice (ECF 761), and the statements contained in paragraph 5 of the decision ... of the Arbitration Panel (ECF 778), that the payment of attorneys' fees were (and are) inextricably intertwined with the final resolution of this 14-year old lawsuit. This Court, the Parties, and their counsel have a vital interest in the arrangements insofar as the payment of attorneys' fees is concerned given not only the lengthy history of this case, but to preserve the integrity of the various legal processes (mediation, court intervention/involvement, and final and binding arbitration) that brought about a hard-fought and creative resolution to this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468422\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/53/#p54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4.

As a preliminary matter, contrary to Carlson's assertion, the District Court did not retain jurisdiction over disputes arising from the allocation of fees among counsel. The allocation of the fee award to class counsel occurred pursuant to a confidential agreement among counsel and the allocation was not the subject of a ruling by the arbitrators or the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   More significantly, the Court struck the paragraphs of the final order approving the class action pertaining to fees. App. 200-04, 290. In its final approval order with the stricken language, the Court stated\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   this Court expressly retains jurisdiction as to all matters relating to the administration and enforcement of the Agreement and Settlement and of this Order, and for any other necessary purpose as permitted by law, including, without limitation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   entering such additional Orders as may be necessary or appropriate to protect or effectuate the Court's Orders and/or to ensure the fair and orderly administration of the settlement and the distribution of the Arbitration Panel's awards[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   App. 204. By striking the fee language, it excluded fee issues from matters over which it retained jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While the District Court's decision not to retain jurisdiction over attorney fee disputes may be sufficient for it to decline to exercise ancillary jurisdiction here, there are additional reasons why exercising ancillary jurisdiction was an error. First, SSEM's breach of contract claim is not factually interdependent with the federal claims asserted in CBNV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBNV involved federal statutory claims arising from allegedly deceptive lending practices, whereas the state case involved a state law contract dispute between an attorney and his former firm as to how they would split a fee award. The fee-splitting case is not the type of dispute one would expect to be tried with the federal deceptive lending claims in CBNV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

SSEM and Carlson's dispute is between two Pennsylvania residents and did not arise as a result of any rulings in CBNV. While their fight became ripe when Carlson allegedly failed to share with SSEM the fees he received from the class settlement, any obligation he may have had to do so is based upon a private agreement between him and his former firm. Thus, the disputed issue \"did not arise as a matter of necessity from anything\" that occurred in the CBNV proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468422\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/53/#p54\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468422\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/53/#p54\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Moreover, the resolution of the fee-splitting case will have no impact on the class or the fee award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Courts exercising ancillary jurisdiction over fee disputes between attorneys have done so where the district court had control over the disputed funds.\n   <em>\n    Law Offices of David Efron v.
