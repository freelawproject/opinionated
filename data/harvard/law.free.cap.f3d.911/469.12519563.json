He confessed at the scene, but come trial he sought to mitigate his crime with the second-degree defense of adequate provocation. The Wisconsin trial court, in deciding whether the defense should go to the jury, asked for an offer of proof and an evidentiary hearing. Schmidt complied with the first request but balked at the second, not wanting to show any more of his defense hand. That concern was well taken, and the trial court ordered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination of Schmidt instead. The trial court added, however, that Schmidt's lawyer could \"not say[ ] anything\" and would \"just be present\" for the examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court questioned Schmidt in chambers. Schmidt's lawyer observed silently. Schmidt rambled, interrupted only by a few open-ended questions from the trial court and a brief break during which he reviewed his offer of proof with his lawyer. After the examination, the trial\n   court ruled that Schmidt did not act with adequate provocation. He therefore could not raise the defense at trial. A jury later convicted Schmidt of first-degree homicide, and he was sentenced to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Schmidt petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the trial court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination deprived him of counsel and due process. The district court denied Schmidt's petition, and a divided panel of our court reversed and remanded with instructions to grant it. We vacated that decision, reheard the case en banc, and now affirm the district court's judgment. The state trial court's unusual examination of Schmidt was constitutionally dubious, and we discourage the measure. But our habeas review is limited. We ask whether the state court of appeals unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent in rejecting Schmidt's constitutional claims. We answer that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During an argument on April 17, 2009, Schmidt followed his estranged wife, Kelly Wing-Schmidt, out of her home and onto her driveway. There, he shot her seven times with his revolver. Police arrived and found Schmidt standing over the body with the gun in his hand. He confessed immediately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

He intended, specifically, to introduce evidence of Wing-Schmidt's \"false allegations, controlling behaviors, threats, isolation, unfaithfulness, verbal abuse and arguments.\" The state argued that evidence of the couple's history, however fraught, did not support a theory of adequate provocation under Wisconsin law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court held a pretrial hearing in early 2010. At the hearing, the court echoed the state's concern that Schmidt's proposed provocation evidence, most of which related to events years before the murder, was irrelevant and would unfairly prejudice the state's case. The trial court therefore\n   ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Schmidt could meet his threshold burden. It instructed Schmidt that during the hearing his counsel could call witnesses, and, if the court was unsatisfied with the evidence presented, Schmidt could supplement the record. Before the hearing, Schmidt had to file a list of witnesses he intended to call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Schmidt did so. His counsel filed a list of 29 witnesses with short summaries of their anticipated testimony, a legal analysis of the defense's applicability, and a five-page offer of proof with a six-year timeline of the couple's troubled history. A few days later, at another hearing, the trial court noted that it had reviewed Schmidt's submissions, but its reservations persisted. The trial court did not, however, ask for the presentation of witnesses or evidence from Schmidt, as it had said it would the month before. Instead, the court explained that its review of Wisconsin law-namely,\n   <em>\n    State v. McClaren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771525\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/318/739/\">\n    318 Wis.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771525\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/318/739/\">\n    767 N.W.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) -confirmed that a hearing was appropriate, but that it should hold the hearing\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   to protect the defense from disclosing its trial strategy to the state (a measure\n   <em>\n    McClaren\n   </em>\n   blessed,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771525\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/318/739/\">\n    767 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   559 n.12 ). Schmidt's lawyer responded that additional evidence was unnecessary, but he agreed that if the court was going to question Schmidt it should do so\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   . Schmidt's lawyer, in fact, noted that he intended to suggest that, if the court \"ask[ed] for evidence from the defendant that goes to his subjective belief for adequate provocation,\" it should do so through an \"ex parte in-camera inspection of the Court and the defendant and seal those records.\" The state agreed this was the \"best way\" to handle the court's examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court then asked the state whether it would object to Schmidt's lawyer silently observing the examination. The state did not object-nor, for that matter, did Schmidt's lawyer. The state noted, though, that it did not want Schmidt conferring with counsel about how to answer the court's questions. Before concluding the in-court hearing and beginning the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination, the court offered Schmidt's lawyer \"a few minutes\" to consult with his client. Schmidt's lawyer accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination opened with the trial court putting on the record that Schmidt's lawyer was \"present but ... not participating in the hearing.\" The court then asked Schmidt \"what was in your mind\" when he confronted Wing-Schmidt. Schmidt's answer, which went on uninterrupted for 14 transcript pages, addressed the events leading up to the killing, some history between him and his estranged wife, the moment of the killing (though he professed not to remember pulling the trigger), and the immediate aftermath. The trial court stopped Schmidt as he was describing his arrest. It explained to Schmidt that his \"attorney has made an offer of proof about other things that had occurred prior to this that had entered into your mind at the time.\" The trial court asked Schmidt to \"tell us how those things entered into your mind at the time?\" Schmidt explained that his estranged wife had threatened to take the kids and physically abused him. The trial court asked again; Schmidt continued to detail the couple's troubled history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court explained that Schmidt's testimony did not align with his offer of proof, to which Schmidt replied that he had not even seen the offer. The trial court then suggested a \"short break,\" during which Schmidt could review the offer of proof while the court took a phone call. Schmidt's lawyer asked if he could consult with his client. The trial court responded, \"It's off the record. Yeah, you can talk. But he should just be reviewing\" the offer of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Back on the record, the trial court noted that they had taken a break so that Schmidt could \"review this offer of proof and different facts contained in it.\" Then, and again, the trial court asked Schmidt about \"what you contemplated at the time\" of the killing. Schmidt responded that everything had come \"to a head,\" he was \"overwhelmed, and eventually just got-they piled up one after another.\" Schmidt elaborated upon events that happened in years past-financial struggles, abusive behavior, and fights. The trial court concluded the examination, asked Schmidt and his lawyer to return to the courtroom, and said that it would consider its decision. Schmidt's lawyer did not ask to supplement his evidentiary presentation with affidavits or additional testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That afternoon, and without further argument, the trial court ruled. It did not detail factual findings, citing the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   nature of the examination. Its conclusion was that the killing \"did not involve a provocation and it was not an adequate provocation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A month later, at another pretrial hearing, the parties discussed whether Schmidt would call one of the witnesses identified in his annotated witness list. The trial court stated that since it had ruled on the defense's admissibility, it did not see the relevance of the testimony. Schmidt's lawyer explained that he thought the \"issue open\" and believed that the court would allow further supplementation. The trial court rejected that idea, noting again that it had already ruled on the defense's admissibility. The court would, though, allow Schmidt to \"supplement the record for appeal.\" Schmidt's lawyer did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial and Posttrial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Trial began on March 4, 2010, and lasted five days. The jury convicted Schmidt of first-degree homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Schmidt moved for a new trial on two grounds: the denial of his due process right to present a defense and the denial of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel during the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination. The trial court held oral argument. During oral argument, the trial court asserted that the examination was simply \"an effort to supplement the writing\" which the court \"relied upon and made reference to\" during the examination. At the end of oral argument, the court denied Schmidt's motion and issued its opinion. The opinion explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [D]efense counsel suggested and agreed to an in-camera hearing, and did not at any point request to actively participate in the in-camera examination. In addition, there was a break during the in-camera hearing to allow defense counsel and defendant to confer regarding the offer of proof. Thus, defense counsel actively participated prior to and during the in-camera proceeding. As the State notes, this is not a circumstance where the issues and argument were undertaken by the defendant without representation of counsel. The nature and detail of the written offer of proof clearly indicates that counsel discussed the numerous points with the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The opinion repeated that the defense \"expressed a preference for, and agreed to, an in-camera proceeding for the defendant's oral offer of proof\" and that \"[a]t no time did counsel make a request to question the defendant.\" It concluded, in \"view of defense counsel's extensive argument and submissions with regard to the adequate provocation defense, the Court finds there was no denial of the right to counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court sentenced Schmidt to the mandatory penalty for first-degree homicide-life in prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20940.01\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 940.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 939.50(3)(a), 973.014(1g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court of Appeals Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Schmidt appealed. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin explained first that Schmidt's case presented a \"close question\" as to whether he put forth \"some evidence\" of adequate provocation.\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030642\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/344/336/\">\n    824 N.W.2d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It noted that the state had conceded that \"Schmidt, subjectively, acted in the heat of passion when he shot Wing-Schmidt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030642\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/344/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 850 n.8 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030642\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/344/336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 844 n.5. But the state court of appeals, citing mostly Schmidt's \"rambling narrative\" during the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination, held that Schmidt had failed to present some evidence of objectively adequate provocation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 847, 850-52. It cited also the lengthy history of hostility between Schmidt and his estranged wife. Considering this history and the fact that Schmidt had a hand in starting the fight that culminated in the killing, the court decided that Schmidt \"deliberately chose to ignite the fire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 852.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court of appeals also rejected Schmidt's right-to-counsel claim. The\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination was, according to the court, \"merely a supplementary proceeding conducted for his benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Especially in light of\n   <em>\n    McClaren\n   </em>\n   , the court said, the examination in \"a nonadversarial atmosphere was a reasonable accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 852-53. Regarding Schmidt's argument that the examination was a \"critical stage,\" the court of appeals saw it as \"[f]atal\" that the examination was \"not the only opportunity for Schmidt to present his provocation evidence to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853. The court added that, in any event, the trial court \"recessed to allow Schmidt to review his attorney's written offer of proof and speak with his attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court of appeals concluded that \"if counsel felt Schmidt or the court was overlooking something, or had any other concerns, there was an opportunity to so advise Schmidt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plus, according to the court, \"Schmidt had the opportunity to present any concerns or questions he had to his attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Federal-Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Schmidt turned to federal court, petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied Schmidt's petition. It concluded that the state courts had not deprived Schmidt of his due process right to present a defense. It concluded further that the state courts had not unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court law in rejecting Schmidt's right-to-counsel claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).

The majority reasoned that Schmidt had a clearly established right to counsel at critical stages, and, in this case, there was no more important stage for Schmidt-whose sole defense hinged on the ruling that immediately followed-than the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination.

Yet the Court has not confronted the circumstance that this case presents: a deprivation of counsel during an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination, which was conducted as a part of a broader, pretrial evidentiary presentation. Its decisions, therefore, do not bind us on how to assess the relevant stage, whether as the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination alone or as the entire evidentiary presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   That gap in the law shows itself here. In his papers, Schmidt contended that the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination was itself the relevant critical stage. At oral argument, his counsel seemed to take a different approach. She submitted that the critical stage was the \"entire proceeding\" regarding the sufficiency of Schmidt's provocation evidence, \"one portion\" of which was the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination. Under this view, the critical stage comprised in-court hearings, briefing, an offer-of-proof submission, oral arguments, and, of course, the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination. The dissent, for its part, submits that both the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination and the broader evidentiary presentation are critical stages unto themselves, a conclusion which means there can be critical stages within critical stages. That may be one way to look at the problem. No Supreme Court decision says that it is the only or right way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We need not resolve how to define the scope of a critical stage in cases like this one. Nor do we need to decide whether this case presents a critical stage, whatever its scope, under clearly established law. AEDPA governs our review, and we note only that these unanswered threshold questions portend this case's unsuitability for habeas relief. We can assume this case involves a critical stage, and whether that stage was the entire evidentiary presentation or only the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination, Schmidt cannot meet the second part of the analysis-that he was so deprived of counsel as to mandate the presumption of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Save for the one portion of the stage in which the trial court held the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination, Schmidt had full access to counsel. No Supreme Court precedent suggests, much less establishes, that such facts warrant the presumption of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even if the proper critical stage is the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination in isolation rather than the entire evidentiary presentation, the result is the same. During the examination, as the trial court made clear, Schmidt's lawyer was \"present\" but could \"not participat[e].\" Schmidt insists that this deprived him of counsel, and, to an extent, we agree. But again: the deprivation must be \"complete\" to mandate the presumption of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Schmidt and his counsel consulted immediately before the examination. In the examination, the trial court repeatedly referenced, and made plain that he was working from, the offer of proof Schmidt's lawyer drafted. The trial court later noted that the \"nature and detail\" of the offer of proof reflected that counsel had discussed its many factual assertions with Schmidt. Schmidt and his lawyer consulted again during a recess in the examination, as the state court of appeals observed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030642\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/344/336/\">\n    824 N.W.2d at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that recess, Schmidt and his counsel-who had the benefit of hearing the trial court's questions and his client's answers-discussed the offer of proof, the focus of the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030642\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/344/336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To be sure, Schmidt otherwise lacked assistance during the examination.

He,\n   instead, argues that his testimony was filled with \"trivial, irrelevant[ ] matters.\" That is hard to believe, because he prevailed on the subjective prong. But even if the argument held water, it is unclear how superfluous testimony would likely prejudice him. The state courts needed to look only for \"some evidence\" of adequate provocation, and we cannot presume that they are prone to distraction or obfuscation by a poorly performing witness. There are therefore grounds to think that the deprivation here did not render \"the proceeding presumptively unreliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   , 528 U.S. at 484,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p483\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those judges have decided that Schmidt had adequate counsel (the state courts), that the examination was not a critical stage (the state court of appeals), that the examination was too incomparable to anything the Supreme Court has considered (the district court), that the examination was not a critical stage under clearly established law (the panel dissent), and that Schmidt was not completely denied counsel under clearly established law (our majority). The dissent thinks this divergence of thought suggests that denying Schmidt relief is an error. The opposite is true. That so many judges see Schmidt's claim differently underscores that there is room for fair-minded disagreement about how to view and resolve Schmidt's claim.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harrington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    562 U.S. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   That room exists because the Supreme Court has never addressed a case like this.

Due Process Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Schmidt also raises a due process claim. He argues on appeal that the trial court's \"inquisitorial\" (as opposed to adversarial) procedure for resolving the admissibility of his only defense \"was so arbitrary\" that it violated his right to present a defense. Schmidt admits that this is a \"novel\" argument. He submits, however, that novelty does not doom his claim-he argues that the claim should enjoy\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review because the state court of appeals did not address it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The warden argues that Schmidt has procedurally defaulted and waived this claim. There is another problem worth addressing first. In its order denying Schmidt's petition, the district court certified the following for appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Schmidt's argument that the state court violated his right to present a defense when it ruled he had not met his burden on the state law affirmative defense of adequate provocation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   That is not the argument Schmidt now advances. To be sure, the argument he now advances is difficult to pin down. His opening brief focused on the arbitrariness of the examination's procedure; on reply he submits that his perhaps \"esoteric\" claim is \"not [focused on] the process per se or the result per se\" but the \"\n   <em>\n    arbitrariness\n   </em>\n   , which suffused\" both. At any rate, the challenge is not one to the trial court's evidentiary ruling\n   <em>\n    vis-\u00e0-vis\n   </em>\n   his right to present a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"When a petitioner's case is subject to \u00a7 2253(c),\" as this case is, \"non-certified claims are not properly before this court.\"\n   <em>\n    Bolton v.

Mississippi\n   </em>\n   , challenging the trial court's \"ruling\" and \"exclusion\" of his defense. He did not, as he does now, challenge the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination as itself violative of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Nothing we have said should be mistaken as belief that the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination of Schmidt, held without his counsel's active participation and regarding his principal defense, was in fact constitutional. A pillar of the Sixth Amendment is the right to unhampered counsel; the aim of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the promise of a fair trial tested by adversaries. Trial courts must promote access to counsel and guard the adversarial process while it runs its course. These principles hold even when-especially when-courts meet uncharted waters filled with risk for an accused facing life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Applied here, trial courts should not opt to hold\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearings and silence defense counsel over other, less severe alternatives without exceedingly good reasons. Even then, trial courts must, if necessary, obtain a knowing and voluntary right-to-counsel waiver from the accused for purposes of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   These, however, are our admonitions. They are not clearly established Supreme Court precedent dictating habeas relief in this case. No such precedent exists. For that reason, we AFFIRM the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The state trial court violated Schmidt's right to counsel.\n   <em>\n    The judge was questioning the accused\n   </em>\n   on the merits of the case. Yet\n   <em>\n    the judge ordered his lawyer not to participate\n   </em>\n   in the hearing. This constitutional violation was clear even under the demanding standard for federal habeas corpus relief in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The accused in a criminal case is entitled to the assistance of counsel in any \"critical stage\" of the prosecution, a category that applies broadly.

Cone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354940\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/685/#p695\">\n    535 U.S. 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695-96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354940\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/685/#p695\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354940\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/685/#p695\">\n    152 L.Ed.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (describing a \"critical stage\" as \"a step of a criminal proceeding, such as arraignment, that held significant consequences for the accused\"). The Supreme Court's critical-stage cases show beyond reasonable debate that the judge's interrogation of Schmidt about his mitigation defense was a critical stage. By commanding the lawyer to stay silent while the judge interrogated his client, the judge violated the right to counsel that is a foundation of our system of criminal justice. Denying counsel at such a critical stage requires relief without separate proof of prejudice from the denial. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

The majority, not the Supreme Court, has introduced here the notion that only a \"complete\" denial of counsel requires a presumption of prejudice. But see\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 659 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Court has\n   <em>\n    uniformly\n   </em>\n   found constitutional error without any showing of prejudice when counsel was either totally absent,\n   <em>\n    or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding\n   </em>\n   .\") (collecting cases discussed below) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   If the judge had simply said that he wanted to hear what the accused had to say without any counsel even present, I could not have imagined, at least before this case, that any court in the United States would find such interrogation acceptable without a valid waiver of counsel by Schmidt himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The only difference here is that Schmidt's lawyer was physically present in the room, but the judge might as well have gagged him: he ordered the lawyer not to \"participate\" in this critical stage of the prosecution. I don't see a constitutional difference between an absent lawyer and a silenced lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The majority's own discomfort with the state court's extraordinary procedure shines through from beginning to end: \"constitutionally dubious,\" \"we discourage the measure,\" \"we ... do not endorse the constitutionality of the trial court's unusual ... examination,\" \"these ... are our admonitions.\" That discomfort is fully justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Readers will notice, in addition to the majority's discomfort, that the theories to justify denying relief to Schmidt kept shifting. The state trial court concluded that Schmidt was not denied counsel at the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearing because his counsel submitted the written offer of proof, made an oral argument, and conferred with Schmidt during the brief recess for the judge's telephone call. That was wrong because Schmidt's testimony was itself a critical stage. Even if one thinks of the entire pretrial proceeding as the critical stage, Schmidt was entitled to counsel for all of the critical stage, not just part of it. The state appellate court found that the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearing was not a critical stage at all, but \"merely a supplementary proceeding conducted for his benefit,\" so that Schmidt was not entitled to counsel at all.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The majority's new theory requires it to embrace at least one of two mistaken propositions. The first is that Supreme Court precedents allow state courts to deprive a defendant of counsel for\n   <em>\n    part\n   </em>\n   of a critical stage of the prosecution. But see\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v.

The second is that Supreme Court precedents allow state courts to silence a lawyer in a critical stage as long as the lawyer is physically present in the room. But see\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 659 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting the relevant cases).

In this case, the majority has over-corrected. It denies habeas relief in the face of a blatant violation of the right to counsel. It does so by suggesting immaterial distinctions that the Supreme Court itself has refused to draw in its right-to-counsel decisions. We should grant a writ of habeas corpus to allow petitioner Schmidt a fair chance to show that he was guilty of second-degree murder rather than first-degree murder.

He admitted shooting his wife while he was still standing over her holding a smoking gun. He faced a mandatory life sentence for first-degree murder. The only way he might have avoided a life sentence was to show that he acted under \"adequate provocation,\" which could have mitigated the crime to second-degree murder.

The judge wanted to see if Schmidt could satisfy the modest \"some evidence\" standard under state law for submitting the defense to the trial jury. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

We know that Schmidt's testimony was critical for the judge's pretrial decision. The judge had already reviewed a written submission from Schmidt's counsel and had heard argument from both the defense lawyer and the prosecutor. Those submissions had not convinced the judge either way. Before making a decision, the judge wanted to hear directly from Schmidt himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The majority places great, perhaps even decisive, importance on the brief recess late during Schmidt's testimony during the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearing. The recess came as a surprise to everyone except the judge, who announced that he needed to make a telephone call. When Schmidt's lawyer asked the judge for permission merely to talk with his client-a phrase that deserves\n   emphasis: merely\n   <em>\n    to talk\n   </em>\n   with his client during a recess-the judge told the lawyer he could only review with Schmidt the written offer of proof summarizing the intended defense. This limited opportunity for a brief talk with counsel was not enough to satisfy the Sixth Amendment \"in any substantial sense,\" and to conclude otherwise \"would simply be to ignore actualities.\"\n   <em>\n    Powell v.

Since the 1996 amendment of \u00a7 2254(d), habeas corpus relief is reserved for rare cases in which state courts have strayed from clearly established federal law. This case meets that standard. Part II-A explains why, under controlling Supreme Court precedent, Schmidt's testimony was a critical stage of the prosecution. Part II-B explains the principal mistakes in the majority's reasoning, which seeks to excuse the state court's denial of counsel in a critical stage on the theories that a state court may deny the accused counsel for\n   <em>\n    part\n   </em>\n   of a critical stage and/or that silencing the lawyer by court order during the critical hearing was allowed because it was not a \"complete\" denial of counsel as long as the lawyer was physically present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Critical Stage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees that in \"all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right\" to \"have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" The Supreme Court has long recognized that the right applies not only at trial but also at all \"critical stages\" of the adversary process.

The majority tries not to base its denial of habeas relief on the absence of a critical stage. The majority questions whether this hearing was a critical stage but in the end assumes without deciding that it was. Still, the critical-stage issue must be addressed here.

The majority complains that the Supreme Court has not provided one single definition of a critical stage. The slightly different phrasing in different cases does not reflect substantive uncertainty about the broad and inclusive standard. In\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168076\" index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/218/#p227\">\n    388 U.S. at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168076\" index=\"409\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/218/#p227\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Looking both at what the Supreme Court has done and at what it has said shows beyond reasonable dispute that testimony on a contested substantive issue is a critical stage of the proceedings. The Court has repeatedly found that pretrial stages were critical as long as the accused risked serious consequences affecting the fairness of the trial. In the face of the extensive body of case law, the majority has not identified any Supreme Court case even suggesting, let alone holding, that a hearing comparable to the one in this case was not a critical stage, or offered a plausible theory for saying it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing certainly had the potential to prejudice Schmidt's defense. The Sixth Amendment analysis focuses on whether there is a potential for prejudice given what or whom the uncounseled defendant must confront and what counsel could do later to fix the defendant's mistakes.

In this case, Schmidt was asked to show before trial that he could meet the burden of production to go forward at trial with his only defense in mitigation. No stage was more critical. What happened in the judge's chambers settled Schmidt's fate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The risks for Schmidt were evident. Without assistance of counsel, he faced the risks that the judge might lose sight of the elements of adequate provocation or might fail to separate the wheat from the extensive chaff in Schmidt's rambling answers. There was also a risk that Schmidt would help the judge, perhaps unconsciously, convert the hearing into a mini-trial on the ultimate merits of the defense rather than a debate about only the burden of production. If Schmidt had met the burden of production-and only that burden-he would have had the right to present his evidence and to argue his defense to the jury. The trial judge's oral ruling suggests that this risk might have been realized\n   here: \"The Court finds that the circumstances that led to the death of Kelly Wing did not involve a provocation and it was not an adequate provocation and denies the motion.\" That conclusion sounds a lot more like a decision on the ultimate merits of the defense than a decision on the burden of production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In addition, Schmidt's counsel could not fix later the harm done by Schmidt's rambling answers. The judge, having silenced counsel in the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearing, rejected the defense shortly after the hearing ended. When counsel tried to revisit the issue shortly before trial, the judge refused, saying he had already made his decision. Because counsel could not later undo the harm to Schmidt, the risk of prejudice at the evidentiary hearing affected his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Finally, there should be no doubt that Schmidt could have benefited from his attorney's help at the hearing. In\n   <em>\n    Ferguson v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    365 U.S. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594-96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    5 L.Ed.2d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1961), the Supreme Court explained the need for counsel in a context very close to this case. At that time, Georgia prohibited the accused from testifying in his own defense, but state law allowed the accused to make an unsworn statement to the jury. In making such a statement, however, the accused ordinarily had to do so without questioning by his counsel to guide him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   that the accused had a right to have his lawyer question him to help elicit his statement. In explaining this conclusion, the Court quoted Chief Justice Cooley, the nineteenth-century jurist from Michigan, in a lengthy passage that recognizes how essential a lawyer's help can be, and that fits Schmidt's case well:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   But to hold that the moment the defendant is placed upon the stand he shall be debarred of all assistance from his counsel, and left to go through his statement as his fears or his embarrassment may enable him, in the face of the consequences which may follow from imperfect or unsatisfactory explanation,\n   <em>\n    would in our opinion be to make, what the statute designed as an important privilege to the accused, a trap into which none but the most cool and self-possessed could place himself with much prospect of coming out unharmed\n   </em>\n   . An innocent man, charged with a heinous offence, and against whom evidence of guilt has been given, is much more likely to be overwhelmed by his situation, and embarrassed, when called upon for explanation, than the offender, who is hardened in guilt; and\n   <em>\n    if he is unlearned, unaccustomed to speak in public assemblies, or to put together his thoughts in consecutive order any where, it will not be surprising if his explanation is incoherent, or if it overlooks important circumstances.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    365 U.S. at 595-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added), quoting\n   <em>\n    Annis v.

Without the guidance of counsel's questioning, Schmidt provided a rambling and disjointed narrative, much like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Annis\n   </em>\n   . Even without the assistance of counsel, Schmidt's account of the circumstances came close to supporting his defense in mitigation.

Both run contrary to clear Supreme Court precedents on the right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Denial for Part of a Critical Stage?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   One branch of reasoning requires the majority to take sides on the issue it says it does not decide: whether to consider Schmidt's interrogation as a critical stage by itself. To conclude that the denial of counsel was not complete, the majority expands the lens to view the entire pretrial proceeding to evaluate the mitigation defense: \"Schmidt's lawyer filed the notice of the provocation defense, argued for its application during court hearings, briefed the law, and submitted a detailed offer of proof and an annotated witness list.\" Ante at 481. That is all true but beside the point, as a matter of fact and law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   As a matter of fact, the judge clearly had not made up his mind based on that information submitted with the lawyer's assistance. The decision point for the judge was his\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   interrogation. Shortly after it ended, the judge made a final decision that Schmidt would not be allowed to present his defense to the jury. Schmidt was denied counsel during that critical event due to the court's order silencing his lawyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As a matter of law, allowing a defense lawyer to submit written and oral arguments cannot justify excluding or silencing the lawyer for his client's oral testimony. Consider, for example, a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case. The defense lawyer submits a brief and affidavits in advance of the evidentiary hearing and then makes an opening statement. Could the judge then send the lawyer away (or silence her) during the live witness testimony, or even the defendant's own testimony? Surely not, yet under the majority's rationale, it would seem to be acceptable for the judge simply to excuse the defense lawyer while her client is cross-examined, whether in a hearing on a motion to suppress or at trial. After all, the lawyer would have participated in all other aspects of the hearing or trial. Under the majority's reasoning, there would not be a \"complete\" denial of counsel at that critical stage of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   This reasoning runs contrary to\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   , among other cases. In both, a state court prevented counsel from\n   providing effective assistance at a critical stage within a larger critical stage. I am aware of no support for the majority's logic in the Supreme Court's critical-stage jurisprudence, and I hope that no court would follow the majority's logic to the conclusion allowing denial of counsel for \"part\" of any critical stage. Yet the majority's insistence that only a supposedly \"complete\" denial of counsel supports a presumption of prejudice certainly points that way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Denial of Counsel Need Not Be \"Complete\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   So let's shift back to treat the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination itself as a critical stage. It is beyond dispute that Schmidt's counsel was silenced for the entirety of the judge's questioning, and the judge never modified his order to offer counsel an opportunity to supplement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The majority builds its entire decision on the premise that Supreme Court precedent requires a \"complete\" denial of counsel to invoke the presumption of prejudice. See ante at 480-85. That premise is demonstrably wrong. Start with\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cronic\n   </em>\n   , where the Court described the \"complete denial of counsel\" as the \"[m]ost obvious\" situation for presuming prejudice. 466 U.S. at 659,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"462\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is surely correct that a \"complete\" denial of counsel is sufficient to invoke the presumption of prejudice, but\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   and other cases cannot be read to say a \"complete\" denial is necessary to invoke that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In that same paragraph,\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   dropped a footnote that shows the majority's reading of Supreme Court precedent is simply wrong:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   The Court has\n   <em>\n    uniformly\n   </em>\n   found constitutional error without any showing of prejudice when counsel was either totally absent,\n   <em>\n    or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding\n   </em>\n   .

The question is not whether counsel in those circumstances will perform less well than he otherwise would, but whether the circumstances are likely to result in such poor performance that an inquiry into its effects would not be worth the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675918\" index=\"511\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/120/#p125\">\n    552 U.S. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675918\" index=\"512\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/120/#p125\">\n    128 S.Ct. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). This passage from\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   also cannot be fairly read to impose a new requirement of \"complete\" denial of counsel. It restated the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   standard, which, as shown above, allows the presumption of prejudice in a wide range of circumstances in which a trial court prevents a lawyer who is present from providing effective assistance. And the lawyer in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   participated in a plea hearing by speakerphone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   He could at least be heard. That cannot reasonably be compared to this case, where the judge's order silenced the lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   To support its assertion that only a \"complete\" denial of counsel will invoke the presumption of prejudice, the majority also quotes our decision in\n   <em>\n    Kitchen v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11194614\" index=\"513\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/1014/\">\n    227 F.3d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2000). The majority writes: \"In\n   <em>\n    Kitchen\n   </em>\n   , we described the Court's complete-denial cases (specifically in the appellate-stage context) as establishing that the presumption of prejudice applies only when 'defendants have had\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   assistance of counsel for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   issues.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11194614\" index=\"514\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/1014/\">\n    227 F.3d at 1020-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases in original) (citing\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   , 528 U.S. at 483,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"515\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p483\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\" Ante at 481. The critical \"only\" in that sentence comes from the majority here, not from\n   <em>\n    Kitchen\n   </em>\n   , let alone from the Supreme Court. The same is true for all of the majority's other attempts to introduce \"only\" into the standard for presuming prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Instead,\n   <em>\n    Kitchen\n   </em>\n   correctly cited\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   regarding the presumption of prejudice,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11194614\" index=\"516\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/1014/\">\n    227 F.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and concluded that Kitchen's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel required proof of prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Kitchen had in fact had counsel on appeal who pursued several issues, including some that were successful. We correctly treated Kitchen's claim as one challenging his lawyer's strategic choice of issues to pursue on appeal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11194614\" index=\"517\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/1014/\">\n    227 F.3d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having appellate counsel who chooses which issues to pursue cannot reasonably be compared with having a lawyer whom the trial judge has silenced.\n   <em>\n    Kitchen\n   </em>\n   does not support the majority's attempt to impose \"complete\" denial as a new requirement for the presumption of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The majority also argues that a state court could reasonably conclude that the mere physical presence of counsel should defeat the presumption of prejudice.

This remarkable observation is wrong in two basic ways. First, it patronizes the state courts, which did not make this error of thinking that mere physical presence was enough, let alone cite\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   .

Recall that in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , state law prohibited the defense lawyer from calling the accused to the witness stand and questioning him in the ordinary fashion. Instead, the accused was required to make any statement on his own behalf on his own, in narrative fashion, without guidance from a lawyer's questioning.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    365 U.S. at 571-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The majority offers several proposed distinctions to avoid applying\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   to the denial of counsel in this critical stage of the prosecution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   held only that a state law effectively banning counsel from eliciting his client's trial testimony was unconstitutional. It did not establish that defendants have an absolute right to have their counsel elicit any important testimony, or else prejudice will be presumed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Ante at 482-83. The majority also notes that\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   concerned a defendant's statements about his innocence during a jury trial, whereas Schmidt's situation concerned his response to questions, in part guided by his written offer of proof, in chambers regarding the admissibility of a defense. According to the majority, unlike with Schmidt's situation, \"\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   worried about the 'tensions of a\n   <em>\n    trial\n   </em>\n   ,' embarrassment before '\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   assemblies,' the chance to establish a defendant's '\n   <em>\n    innocence\n   </em>\n   ,' and the risk that he could '\n   <em>\n    overlook\n   </em>\n   [ ] important' exculpatory facts.\" Ante at 482, quoting\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    365 U.S. at 594-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"544\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The majority assures us that these distinctions matter because \"none of those worries\" apply here. That's hard to accept at face value. In terms of tension, no matter how many people were in the room, the stakes could not have been higher for Schmidt: life in prison versus a chance at a term of years he might survive.\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   spoke in terms of an accused who is \"unaccustomed to speak in public assemblies, or to put together his thoughts in consecutive order any where.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"545\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    365 U.S. at 595-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168667\" index=\"546\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/365/570/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while Schmidt may or may not have overlooked any exculpatory facts, he certainly flooded the judge with lots of irrelevant and distracting detail in his rambling narrative, which conflicted, at least in the judge's mind, with the lawyer's summary offer of proof. See ante at 474-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   More important, when considering the majority's proposed distinctions, it's essential to remember that\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   simply does not stand alone, in terms of precedent, logic, or common sense. The suggestion that its logic could be limited to only one critical stage-trial testimony-runs counter to the entire sweep of the Supreme Court's critical-stage jurisprudence. Is the majority's theory that even if\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   established a rule for trials, a court may deny the accused the assistance of a lawyer in presenting his testimony in other critical pretrial proceedings? The majority's theory for treating this state court decision as reasonable depends on suggesting distinctions between\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   and this case that the Supreme Court's right-to-counsel cases reject: between trial and sentencing (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Mempa v. Rhay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335632\" index=\"547\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/128/#p134\">\n    389 U.S. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335632\" index=\"548\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/128/#p134\">\n    88 S.Ct. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335632\" index=\"549\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/128/#p134\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967) ), and between trial and pretrial hearings (see all the pretrial critical-stage cases). The Supreme Court has made sufficiently clear that criminal courts may not pick and choose among critical stages, denying assistance of counsel for only some of them as long as they allow counsel for others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The majority criticizes this analysis of the right-to-counsel cases as too general, connecting\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Geders\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   . Ante at 483-84. In the majority's view, drawing a general principle from such varied contexts simply cannot meet the burden of showing that habeas relief is required by Supreme Court precedent. After the 1996 amendment to \u00a7 2254(d)(1), that is often a good argument against habeas relief, but not here. The point here is that the Supreme Court itself has applied both the right to counsel and the presumption of prejudice in so many different contexts, regardless of distinctions the majority invokes here. The right to counsel is broad. So is the presumption of prejudice, though not as broad as the right to effective assistance of counsel. Habeas relief cannot reasonably be denied on the basis of distinctions the Supreme Court itself has rejected by extending both that right and the presumption of prejudice so broadly and in so many contexts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   stated clearly what I would expect trial judges and lawyers to take for granted: only the most extraordinary client could provide a narrative as effective as an account of relevant facts set forth through a lawyer's organized direct examination.\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   is only the closest example of a series of Supreme Court cases, cited above, holding that an accused was denied counsel when the state silences the lawyer or otherwise prevents the lawyer from providing effective assistance to the accused in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   critical stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   I noted earlier a potentially relevant line of cases, though one that neither the state courts nor the majority have invoked. It addresses defense lawyers who fall asleep or who are briefly absent from trial. The practical consequences of a silenced lawyer are akin to those of a sleeping lawyer. The general rule is that a lawyer who is physically present but asleep is not acting as a lawyer for the accused. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277144\" index=\"550\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1133/#p1161\">\n    855 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1161 (11th Cir. 2017) (en banc);\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617749\" index=\"551\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/757/#p762\">\n    497 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   762 n.2 ;\n   <em>\n    Burdine v.

The cases show, however, that courts have allowed for\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   exceptions to the presumption of prejudice, applying the presumption if counsel slept through a \"substantial portion\" of the trial.\n   <em>\n    Roy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277144\" index=\"555\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1133/#p1161\">\n    855 F.3d at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases); see also\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

Another consideration is \"whether the specific part of the trial that counsel missed is known or can be determined.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Those cases of dozing or briefly absent lawyers help illustrate how different the denial of counsel was in this case. There was nothing\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   about this denial of counsel. The lawyer was silenced during the entire interrogation, and the importance of this interrogation cannot be overstated. It was the decisive presentation of evidence on the only disputed issue. Having been ordered by the judge not to participate in it, Schmidt's lawyer might as well have been asleep ... or entirely absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The right to counsel at all critical stages of a prosecution is not narrow and fact-bound. It is critical to our criminal justice system, and the presumption of prejudice is essential to the Supreme Court jurisprudence enforcing that right. The majority has lost sight of the fact that the accused is entitled to the assistance of counsel during the entirety of a critical stage, not just part of it. Schmidt needed counsel's help in confronting the burden of production on a complex factual and legal defense. The court's silencing of his lawyer deprived him of counsel at the most critical stage of his case. When the state denies a defendant counsel at a critical stage, prejudice is presumed. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Cone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354940\" index=\"560\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/685/#p695\">\n    535 U.S. 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695-96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354940\" index=\"561\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/685/#p695\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354940\" index=\"562\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/685/#p695\">\n    152 L.Ed.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ;\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 658-59 &amp; n.25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"563\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This presumption should apply here.

The Supreme Court has long held that the accused in a criminal case has a due process right to present a defense, and that arbitrary or disproportionate limits on that right can violate the federal Constitution.

Under this line of cases, state rules of law that are ordinarily reasonable may, as applied, deprive a particular defendant of liberty without due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   To the extent Schmidt argues in this appeal that the state trial court's inquisitorial process-all questioning by the judge rather than counsel-violated his due process rights, that focus on the judicial questioning was not developed in the state courts or the district court. At every stage of the prosecution and appellate and habeas review, including this appeal, however, Schmidt has raised a broader due process challenge to the judge's pretrial decision that prevented him from presenting his \"adequate provocation\" defense to the trial jury. His briefing has cited the\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Rock\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   line of Supreme Court due process cases and Wisconsin state court decisions citing and applying them, including\n   <em>\n    State v.

His challenge in the state courts to the judge's pretrial decision was addressed primarily in terms of state law: whether the judge erred in finding that Schmidt had failed to produce \"some evidence\" of \"adequate provocation.\" His argument included a clear assertion, however, that he was also seeking relief on a federal due process theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Accordingly, on the question whether he fairly presented his due process claim to the state courts and to the district court, Schmidt has considerably stronger arguments than the majority asserts. Since Schmidt's claim for denial of his right to counsel is so strong, however, I see no need to delve more deeply into his due process theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The violation of petitioner Schmidt's right to counsel during the most critical stage of his prosecution was evident from controlling Supreme Court precedent.
