Sonner alleges that these products were falsely labeled as capable of improving various cognitive functions when in fact they provided no such benefits. Although she supported her claims with expert opinion and other scientific evidence, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the sellers because they produced contrary expert evidence. District courts in our circuit appear to be split on the summary judgment standard that applies to false advertising claims under California's UCL and CLRA.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Korolshteyn v.

On September 14, 2016, Schwabe moved for summary judgment, supporting its motion with expert testimony from Dr. Alan F. Shatzberg, as well evidence from randomized controlled trials, that Ginkgo biloba benefits cognitive function. In opposition, Sonner produced expert testimony from Dr. Beth E. Snitz, who analyzed several clinical studies and meta-analyses to conclude that \"Ginkgo biloba is no more effective than [a] placebo for improving cognitive functioning or preventing cognitive decline.\" Sonner also proffered independent reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and a scientific review article to support her contention that Ginkgo biloba does not benefit cognitive functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 2, 2017, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Schwabe. The district court acknowledged\n   that \"both sides have produced expert testimony and scientific research in support of their claims,\" but it nevertheless granted Schwabe summary judgment on the ground that Sonner failed to critique the expert testimony and each of the scientific studies proffered by Schwabe. The district court reasoned that because Sonner fell short in \"challenging the methodology, structure, or independence of [Schwabe's] studies,\" her evidence is \"insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that there is no scientific support for [Schwabe's] claims.\" Sonner timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, to defeat summary judgment, Sonner need only produce evidence of a genuine dispute of material fact that could satisfy the preponderance of the evidence burden at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322-23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sonner easily met her burden by producing expert testimony and other scientific data that Ginkgo biloba has no more of an effect on mental sharpness, memory, or concentration than a placebo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Provenz v.

By requiring Sonner to do more-by not only producing affirmative expert evidence of her own but also \"foreclos[ing] any possibility\" that Schwabe's products provided the labeled benefits-the district court elevated Sonner's burden well beyond what is usually required to defeat summary judgment. Again, a plaintiff need only show a triable issue of material fact to proceed to trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) ;\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , not foreclose any possibility of the defendant's success on the claims. At trial, undoubtedly each party will seek to undermine the scientific bases underlying the opinion of the opposing party's expert. Those arguments, however,\n   go to the weight that the fact-finder should give to the evidence, an inquiry that is not proper at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Schwabe argues that a more exacting summary judgment standard applies to false advertising claims brought under the UCL and CLRA, relying on a Fourth Circuit decision,\n   <em>\n    In re GNC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n    789 F.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2015).

The court reasoned that because the plaintiffs did \"not allege that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   scientists agree that [the products] are ineffective at providing the promised [ ] benefits,\" they failed to show as a matter of law that the advertised claims are false.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/\">\n    at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When litigants concede that some reasonable and duly qualified scientific experts agree with a scientific proposition, they cannot also argue that the proposition is 'literally false.' \"). Some district courts in our circuit have adopted similar reasoning in weighing competing expert evidence in false advertising cases at the summary judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Korolshteyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203622226\">\n    2017 WL 3622226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6, *12-13 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullins v.

Other district courts in our circuit have flatly disagreed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Racies v.
