Lane was accused by the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") of sending threatening letters from prison, and was disciplined under BOP Prohibited Acts Code 203. Code 203 prohibits inmates from \"[t]hreatening another with bodily harm or any other offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.3\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Table 1. Lane contends that Code 203, construed to apply to non-true threats, is unlawfully broad and vague. He also argues that the evidence against him was insufficient. We disagree. The BOP's prohibition on threats of bodily harm addresses legitimate penological concerns in a manner that is sufficiently narrow to satisfy constitutional concerns. We also find that the evidence against Lane was sufficient. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 27, 2002, Lane was sentenced to 360 months in prison after convictions for drug and money laundering offenses. In 2008, Lane notified the BOP that he believed his underlying criminal sentence was illegal, arguing that the quantity of drugs involved in his offense was erroneously listed as 500 kilograms rather than 500 grams. He pursued his argument through the BOP's Administrative Remedy Program, eventually appealing to the BOP Central Office. As part of his appeal, he included a handwritten letter stating, \"I don't Think My judgement and Commitment was 'verified.' I'm going to bet my life. Are you willing to Bet a Guards Life?\" The letter then repeated, \"Bet a Guard's Life? I don't like it when people play Games with My life!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a result of this letter, Lane received an incident report for violating Code 203. On December 23, 2008, a Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) held a hearing at which Lane was the only witness to testify. Lane denied the BOP's allegations, stating: \"I was trying to let them know I was serious about what I was doing. I wasn't threatening anyone.\" The DHO nonetheless found that Lane had violated Code 203 and sanctioned him with a loss of 27 days of good time credit, 30 days in disciplinary segregation, and six months without phone privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Lane was again sanctioned for violating Code 203. The punishment was based upon statements made in two outgoing letters. The first, addressed to an individual named Brian Dempsey, stated: \"I give Bureau of Prisons staff a chance to follow orders from the Civil Rights Division. I don't want to, I may be forced to take a life!.... Pray for me, that the last thing I want to do is cause the next person harm!\" The second letter, sent to the United States District Court in Evansville, Indiana, stated in part: \"When the deal goes done! I want to make sure they come for you and [Assistant United States Attorney] Mr. Brad Blackington (Criminal charges).\" In a postscript, Lane wrote: \"That steel does damage to the human body! I personal know!! I had to put some work in at Greenville. The fucker bled like a stuck hog!! The guard asked that I just walk away and leave it alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a June 10, 2009 hearing, Lane again asserted that he did not intend the letters to be threatening. The DHO considered the first letter a threat of bodily harm, as Lane had threatened to take a life. The second letter's identification of AUSA Blackington was viewed in conjunction with the reference to Lane having stabbed someone while in prison. The BOP again sanctioned Lane under Code 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, Lane addressed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee and then-Representative Mike Pence. The letter sought to expose what Lane characterized as criminal conduct by the government, and repeated the claim that his conviction was erroneous. At the end of the letter, Lane wrote: \"I want to expose this criminal matter! The BUREAU OF PRISONS may not take action. I may be forced to protect myself and take a life. ... I will never let the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT violate my rights, and not take action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lane was cited for violating Code 203, and a DHO held a hearing. Lane asserted in a written statement that he intended the language in question as self-defense and not a threat of bodily harm. The DHO found this assertion not credible given that Lane stated he would \"take a life,\" and imposed punishment that included lost good conduct time, disciplinary segregation, and other sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After exhausting his administrative remedies with respect to each of the three disciplinary proceedings, Lane filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   habeas corpus petitions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. The district court denied the petitions, finding that \"some evidence\" supported the BOP's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, a panel of this Court found that it could not determine whether the evidence against Lane was sufficient without first determining how to define a \"threat\" for purposes of Code 203.\n   <em>\n    Lane v. Feather\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276455\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/610/628/#p629\">\n    610 F. App'x 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629 (9th Cir. 2015). Examining the plain language of Code 203, the panel found that the term \"should be interpreted to prohibit all threatening statements, whether they amount to true threats or not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276455\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/610/628/#p629\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The panel next found that its interpretation necessarily implicated Lane's First Amendment rights, meaning that Code 203 could only be valid if it satisfied the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Procunier v.

Briefly stated,\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   requires that where a regulation restricts prisoners from exercising their First Amendment right to send outgoing mail to non-prisoners, that regulation must (1) \"further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression\" and\n   (2) \"be no greater than is necessary\" to protect that interest.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/#p413\">\n    416 U.S. at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/#p413\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court held that Code 203 satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   test and denied Lane's \u00a7 2241 petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court's denial of Lane's petitions is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    McNeely v.

Instead,\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   \"require[s] no more than that a challenged regulation be 'generally necessary' to a legitimate governmental interest,\" and that the regulation provide \"a close fit between the challenged regulation and the interest it purported to serve.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605806\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/401/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the district court concluded that Code 203 enhances security and order within the prison. Lane's disciplinary history offers clear examples of how those legitimate governmental interests come into play. In at least three of the letters at issue, Lane threatened to kill someone. In one such letter he specifically threatened to kill a prison guard. As explained in one of Lane's disciplinary reports,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [t]he action/behavior on the part of any inmate to make any sort of threat towards any person poses a serious threat to the health, safety and welfare of not only the person involved, but that of all other inmates and staff. ...

Bazzetta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897508\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/126/#p132\">\n    539 U.S. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897508\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/126/#p132\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897508\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/126/#p132\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (noting that courts owe \"substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators\");\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

In\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   , where the letters at issue consisted of complaints and grievances, the Supreme Court found that prison officials had failed to \"specify what contribution the suppression of complaints ma[de] to the rehabilitation of [prison inmates].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/#p413\">\n    416 U.S. at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/#p413\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the communications are far more serious in nature. Namely, they speak of lethal violence. As explained in the DHO's affidavit, part of the rehabilitation process is to help inmates transform their anger into nonviolent communication. By imposing reasonable sanctions as a consequence of violent speech, prison officials are furthering that effort at redirection and rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With respect to the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   test, the government has shown that Code 203 is \"generally necessary\" to curb threats in outgoing mail, and that the regulation constitutes a \"close fit\" with its legitimate governmental interests.\n   <em>\n    Abbott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605806\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/401/\">\n    490 U.S. at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605806\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/401/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   , inmate complaints and other expressions of dissatisfaction are clearly protected from punishment. Threats of bodily harm, as noted above, constitute communications of a very different, more troubling nature. As relevant to this appeal, Code 203 prohibits only those latter communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lane argues that Code 203, as construed by the BOP, is overly broad because it encompasses conduct that does not implicate any legitimate penological concerns. As examples, he submits that the regulation could result in punishment for jokes, statements of predicted self-defense, or statements that the recipient unreasonably views as a threat. Lane further warns that prison inmates often suffer from mental illness or learning disabilities, and should not be punished for their unique styles of communication. These arguments are without merit. Lane himself is a strong example of how threatening language can be discerned and treated. In his letters, Lane posed the possibility of killing someone, including a prison guard. He cannot now seriously assert that those statements were either jokes or products of poor communication skills. As to unreasonable responses to prisoner communications, there is no indication that the BOP has sanctioned any such conduct. Instead, the BOP reasonably considered Lane's writings, identified legitimate penological concerns, and issued appropriate punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lane further argues that only true threats are punishable, while rhetoric and hyperbole are not. A panel of this court previously concluded that a threat under Code 203 includes non-true threats, and we are bound by the law of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Old Person v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9322981\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1036/#p1039\">\n    312 F.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039 (9th Cir. 2002). Moreover, whether the threats are true cannot be a litmus test for\n   punishment, as prison officials should not be placed in the position of determining the credibility of what could reasonably be viewed as a threat. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   warned that prison administrators must not \"be required to show with certainty that adverse consequences would flow from the failure to censor a particular letter. Some latitude in anticipating the probable consequences of allowing certain speech in a prison environment is essential to the proper discharge of an administrator's duty.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/#p413\">\n    416 U.S. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/#p413\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, even if a threat is not intended to be acted upon, threats of bodily harm contribute to an atmosphere of hostility and disrespect. While curbing threats such as those penned by Lane might limit an inmate's expressive outlets, threats of bodily harm run counter to penological purposes and are legitimately curtailed.

The regulation does not prohibit threats generally, but rather is limited to threats of bodily harm or any other offense. Inmates are therefore on notice that they may not make threats of either bodily harm or other activities that violate the criminal code or BOP regulations. Moreover, the BOP's interpretation comports with a common-sense understanding of a threat. As the Seventh Circuit once explained, \"[w]hen making a threat one hopes not to have to carry it out; one hopes that the threat itself will be efficacious. Most threats, indeed, are bluffs. But if the bluff succeeds in intimidating ... it ought to be punished.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He bases his argument on two claims: first, that the context of each statement shows that it was merely hyperbole; and second, that the statements did not target \"another\" as required by the regulation. The first statement at issue is the 2008 attachment to Lane's administrative remedy form, on which he wrote: \"I'm going to bet my life! Are you willing to Bet a Guard's Life?\" At the hearing before the DHO, Lane stated that he was not threatening anyone, and was instead \"trying to let them know I was serious about what I was doing.\" His testimony suggests that he did not actually intend to kill a prison guard, but rather was stating a lethal threat in order to show his level of commitment. From the prison's perspective, this reasonably constituted a threat of bodily harm. The law requires only a \"modicum of evidence\" that Lane was making a threat.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512284\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/445/#p455\">\n    472 U.S. at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512284\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/445/#p455\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That standard is satisfied by Lane's suggestion that he would kill a prison guard if not granted the relief he was seeking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The 2009 letters to Brian Dempsey were equally threatening, as Lane stated that he \"may be forced to take a life\" and/or \"cause the next person harm!\" Lane's counsel argues that these statements were intended to communicate threats of legal, rather than physical, harm, as Lane's writings referred to his own sentencing error as an attempt on his (Lane's) life. Counsel's claim requires a tortured reading of Lane's statements, which plainly contemplated causing physical harm to another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The threats against AUSA Blackington are less clear. The letter initially referenced legal action: \"I want to make sure they come for you and Mr. Brad Blackington (Criminal charges).\" However, elsewhere in the letter Lane spoke of \"that steel\" doing \"damage to the human body,\" and suggested that he had stabbed someone in Greenville. These statements were perceived as threatening, and the Court should defer to prison officials in that interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Like his 2008 administrative papers and the Dempsey letter, Lane's 2010 letter to Congress threatened to take a life. As discussed above, prisons need not tolerate those kinds of statements, both for fear of escalation and for rehabilitative purposes. Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that the BOP's actions were supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
