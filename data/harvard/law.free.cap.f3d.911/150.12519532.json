Accordingly, we grant the petition for review of the Forest Service's SUP and ROD, vacate those decisions, and remand to the Forest Service for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ACP is a proposed 604.5 mile, 42-inch diameter natural gas pipeline that would stretch from West Virginia to North Carolina. The ACP route approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") -- and for which the Forest Service issued the SUP, ROD, and right of way challenged in this case -- crosses 21 miles of national forest land (about 16 miles in the GWNF and five miles in the MNF) and crosses the ANST in the GWNF. Construction would involve clearing trees and other vegetation from a 125-foot right of way (reduced to 75 feet in wetlands) through the national forests, digging a trench to bury the pipeline, and blasting and flattening ridgelines in mountainous terrains. Following construction, the project requires maintaining a 50-foot right of way (reduced to 30 feet in wetlands) through the GWNF and MNF for the life of the pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to NEPA, when a federal agency proposes to take a \"major Federal action[ ] significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,\" the agency must prepare a detailed environmental impact statement (\"EIS\") describing the likely environmental effects, \"adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided,\" and potential alternatives to the proposal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C). On April 27, 2015, the Forest Service provided scoping comments on FERC's Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the ACP project. The scoping comments stated, among other concerns, that the EIS must analyze alternative routes that do not cross national forest land, and that the EIS must address the Forest Service's policy that restricts special uses on national forest lands to those that \"cannot reasonably be accommodated on non-National Forest System lands.\" J.A. 3593;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Forest Serv. Manual, Addendum to Pet'rs' Br. 65-66. The Forest Service's comments further identified concerns about landslides, slope failures, sedimentation, and impacts to groundwater, soils, and threatened and endangered species that it believed would result from the ACP project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 18, 2015, Atlantic filed its formal application with FERC to construct, own, and operate the pipeline. On November 12, 2015, Atlantic applied for the SUP from the Forest Service to construct and operate the pipeline across the MNF and GWNF. This application was amended in June 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Review and Comment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As FERC prepared the EIS, the Forest Service reviewed and commented on draft\n   environmental resource reports, construction designs, biologic evaluations, and the first draft of Atlantic's Construction, Operation, and Maintenance (\"COM\") Plan filed with FERC. Additionally, in a letter to Atlantic dated October 24, 2016, the Forest Service requested ten site-specific stabilization designs for selected areas of challenging terrain to demonstrate the effectiveness of Atlantic's proposed steep slope stability program, which Atlantic called the \"Best in Class\" (\"BIC\") Steep Slopes Program. As the Forest Service explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Both the [GWNF and MNF] contain Forest Plan standards that limit activities in areas that are at high risk for slope and soil instability. To facilitate the acceptance of ACP's [SUP] application for further processing, the Forests need to be able to determine that the project is consistent or can be made consistent with this Forest Plan direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   J.A. 3379. The letter further noted that the ten selected sites were \"merely representative sites that have been selected to demonstrate whether stability can be maintained for the purpose of making a preliminary determination of Forest Plan consistency. Should the ACP Project be permitted, multiple additional high hazard areas will need to be addressed on a site-specific basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a meeting between Atlantic and the Forest Service on November 21, 2016, Atlantic presented the first two of these site-specific stabilization designs (identified as MNF01 and GWNF02 in the October 24, 2016 letter). According to the meeting notes, the MNF Forest Supervisor noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [W]hile the BIC program [Atlantic] is proposing is laudable [the MNF Forest Supervisor] is skeptical the techniques will work; the Forest Service has seen slope failures on lesser slopes and would be able to provide examples. [Atlantic] needs to be able to demonstrate that the techniques will work in extreme conditions. ... The [Forest Service] wants to know beforehand that these examples have a reasonable chance of working.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   J.A. 3319. Additionally, the Forest Service observed that the MNF01 and GWNF02 \"drawings are a step in the right direction but more detail is needed for site specific design, the Forest Service needs to see how this lays out on the land.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3320.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thereafter, beginning in December 2016, Atlantic circulated a timeline of \"FERC and Forest Service Reviews\" to the Forest Service, which set the following deadlines for the agency's decisions (as proposed by Atlantic): (1) FERC's Draft Environmental Impact Statement (\"DEIS\") to be issued in December 2016; (2) FERC's Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"FEIS\") to be issued in June 2017; (3) the Forest Service's draft ROD to be issued also in June 2017; (4) a \"Federal Agency Decision Deadline\" of September 2017 (for issuance of the FERC Certificate of Convenience and Public Necessity and the Forest Service's SUP and ROD); (5) Forest Plan amendments completed in October 2017; and (6) the pipeline in service by 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 3252-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In line with Atlantic's deadlines for the agencies' decisions, FERC issued the DEIS on December 30, 2016. Regarding its analysis of alternative routes, the DEIS explicitly stated that the ACP was routed on national forest lands in order to avoid the need for congressional approval for the pipeline to cross the ANST:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    A significant factor in siting ACP was the location at which the pipeline would cross the ANST\n   </em>\n   . In the general project area, the ANST is located on lands managed by either the [National Park Service (\"NPS\") ] or [the Forest Service]. The NPS has indicated that it does not have the authority to authorize\n   a pipeline crossing of the ANST on its lands. Instead, legislation proposed by Congress and signed into law by the President would be necessary to allow the NPS the authority to review, analyze, and approve a pipeline crossing of the ANST on its lands.\n   <em>\n    Because of this legislative process, Atlantic considered locations where the ANST was located on lands acquired and administered by the [Forest Service]\n   </em>\n   , which significantly constrained the pipeline route and severely limits opportunities for avoiding and/or minimizing the use of [National Forest System] lands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   J.A. 3207-08 (emphasis supplied). Regarding the environmental impact on forest resources, the DEIS further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [W]e acknowledge that a shorter pipeline route could conceptually have significantly greater qualitative impacts to sensitive resources than a longer route, which could make the longer route preferable. In this instance, we have not identified or received any information that suggests the shorter pipeline route through the National Forests has significantly greater impacts to sensitive resources than the alternative,\n   <em>\n    but acknowledge that ground resource surveys have not been conducted\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    at 3208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 17, 2017, Atlantic and the Forest Service met again to discuss the ten requested site-specific stabilization designs. During this meeting, Atlantic informed the Forest Service that the two earlier site designs were for demonstration purposes, and the remaining eight sites were not currently being designed. The Forest Service stated that it was \"not comfortable\" with not seeing the remaining designs, and that it was the Forest Service's understanding that specific designs for all ten sites were still needed. J.A. 2939. Significantly, the Forest Service stated, it \"want[ed] to see actual information, including specs on the actual controls and protocol on how they will be installed, not conceptual drawings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 6, 2017, the Forest Service provided comments on FERC's DEIS. In multiple places, the Forest Service's comments stated that FERC's conclusions in the DEIS were premature given the incomplete information used to make them -- this was particularly the case regarding the extent of impacts to national forest resources and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 2444 (\"This statement [in the DEIS] acknowledges deficiencies in information needed to conduct an appropriate effects analysis for at least some sensitive species.

For example, Atlantic's draft biologic evaluation contained the following statement: \"Construction activities may displace certain sensitive species from within and areas adjacent to the right-of-way, but the impact is expected to be short-term and limited to the period of construction. After construction, Atlantic will restore the right-of-way as near as practicable to preconstruction contours and conditions ....\" J.A. 2324. In response, the Forest Service stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Restoration will consist of erosion control, some NNIS [non-native invasive species] control, and some native plant re-introduction, so it will create habitat of some sort,\n   <em>\n    but the impact to sensitive species should be expected to be long-term\n   </em>\n   . Restoration plantings will take many years to establish and flourish, will in most cases consist of different species than were present before, and will in many cases not re-create the conditions sensitive species need to survive. NNIS introductions, given the current lack of plans to conduct treatment along access roads,\n   <em>\n    likely will create long-term\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    negative impacts to the ecosystem, including potentially to sensitive species\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, in response to a statement in the draft biologic evaluation that the loss of potential roosting habitat for the little brown bat (caused by construction of the pipeline and the resulting permanent right of way) would be \"offset,\" since the species could use the right of way as foraging habitat, the Forest Service stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A potential increase in foraging habitat (which is not really proven here) does not offset the long-term loss of good roosting habitat -- they apply to different life history needs and an increase in one does not offset loss of the other. Also, the loss of forested habitat would be a long-term impact given the time period required for recovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   J.A. 2333. The Forest Service further noted, \"Bats utilizing the more open areas (such as the [right of way] and road corridors) for foraging are also more vulnerable to predators. This offset is counteracted by an increase in potential predation, which negates the [right of way] and roads as potentially beneficial to the bat.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    at 2332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Change of Course\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Despite the Forest Service's clearly stated concerns regarding the adverse impacts of the ACP project, as Atlantic's deadlines for the agency's decisions drew closer, its tenor began to change. On May 14, 2017, the Forest Service sent a letter to FERC and Atlantic in which it stated -- for the first time -- that it would not require the remaining eight site-specific stabilization designs before authorizing the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Specifically, the letter stated: \"If the ACP project is authorized, the site-specific designs for the remaining eight sites identified in our October 24, 2016 letter must be reviewed and approved by the [Forest Service] before construction at those locations could begin.\" J.A. 2307. The letter did not acknowledge that the agency was changing its position from its original request for all ten site designs prior to granting approval for the ACP nor did it provide any further explanation regarding the reason for the Forest Service's change in position. On July 5, 2017, the Forest Service sent a letter to Atlantic \"acknowledg[ing]\" that the two site-specific stabilization designs that had so far been provided (MNF01 and GWNF02) and the subsequent information about those sites provided by Atlantic \"w[ere] adequate for the purposes of disclosing the environmental effects\" associated with the ACP project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    at 1881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The letter did not provide any explanation as to why the two plans were \"adequate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On July 21, 2017, FERC released the FEIS. On the very same day, and in line with Atlantic's timeline, the Forest Service released its draft ROD proposing to adopt the FEIS, grant the SUP, and exempt Atlantic from several forest plan standards. The FEIS's \"National Forest Avoidance Route Alternatives\" section, which the Forest Service commented on previously (as explained above), is identical to the DEIS. Regarding the alternatives analysis, the Forest Service's draft ROD states: \"FERC's evaluation concluded that the major pipeline route alternatives and variations do not offer a significant environmental advantage when compared to the proposed route or would not be economically practical.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    at 1411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Regarding the COM Plan, on October 6, 2017, the Forest Service sent a letter to Atlantic stating that Atlantic's June 30 responses to the Forest Service's second draft COM Plan comments \"largely addressed our comments except for a limited number of items needing further explanation or clarification.\" J.A. 847. The letter requested an updated COM Plan incorporating these responses. Atlantic filed this third (and final) draft of the COM Plan on October 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   FERC issued the Certificate of Convenience and Public Necessity to ACP for construction of the pipeline on October 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Shortly after, on October 27, 2017, the Forest Service filed its responses to objections to the draft ROD. In response to an objection regarding the range of non-national forest route alternatives, the Forest Service stated that FERC \"adequate[ly] consider[ed] the route across the National Forests\" and \"concluded these alternatives would not provide a significant environmental advantage over a shorter route that passes through National Forests.\" J.A. 676.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On November 16, 2017, the Forest Service sent a letter to Atlantic regarding Atlantic's updated biologic evaluation, which had been filed on August 4, 2017. That biologic evaluation stated that the ACP project was likely to result in a \"loss of viability\" for three Regional Forester Sensitive Species (\"RFSS\") in the MNF, a conclusion which, we note, was in line with the Forest Service's April 24, 2017 comments on the draft biologic evaluation. Nonetheless, in an about-face, the Forest Service's letter amended the updated biologic evaluation to conclude that, in fact, the project was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   likely to result in a loss of viability to the three RFSS. This conclusion is significant, because the Forest Service cannot authorize uses of national forests that are likely to result in a loss of viability for a species.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 64 (\"Per [Forest Service Manual] 2670.32, activities or decisions on [National Forest System]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   lands 'must not result in a loss of species viability or create significant trends towards federal listing.' \").

Relaxing, lessening, loosening -- regardless of the Forest Service's verb preference, the purpose of the Forest Plan amendments is to reduce the Plans' environmental protections for certain resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Further, this is not a situation where a proposed project-specific amendment may have an\n   <em>\n    incidental\n   </em>\n   effect on a Forest Plan standard; rather, the amendments' entire purpose is to weaken existing environmental standards in order to accommodate the ACP, which cannot meet the current standards. To say that a 2012 Planning Rule requirement protecting water resources\n   (as one example) is not \"directly related\" to a Forest Plan amendment specifically relaxing protection for water resources is nonsense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Meanwhile, Atlantic conflates the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    amendments\n   </em>\n   to the Forest Plans with, first, the overall purpose of the ACP\n   <em>\n    project\n   </em>\n   (to \"serve the growing energy needs of multiple public utilities and local distribution companies, and Virginia and North Carolina,\" Intervenor's Br. 25), and second, the Forest Service's reason for taking action at all (to \"respond to Atlantic's application for a special use permit,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20219.8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Both interpretations of \"purpose\" are facially incorrect applications of the 2012 Planning Rule's \"directly related\" analysis, and neither address the Forest Service's purpose for amending the GWNF and MNF Plans. First, the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    plan amendment\n   </em>\n   , not the ACP project, is the focus of this analysis. Second, the Forest Service's need to respond to Atlantic's application for the SUP is overly broad and does not address the need for amending the Forest Plans -- clearly, the Forest Service could have \"responded\" to Atlantic's application without the amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, both the Forest Service and Atlantic suggest that only amendments changing a management standard for the forest as a whole -- and not project-specific amendments -- can trigger the substantive requirements of the 2012 Planning Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't's Br. 18-20 (\"A substantive requirement is directly related to the purpose for an amendment when the amendment's objective is to adjust the management of the corresponding forest resource.\"); Intervenor's Br. 26 (\"[T]he proposed amendments for ACP did not change any of the generally applicable standards or guidelines in the forest plans.\").

And it is even more remarkable that the agency is unable to say what\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   constitute a substantial adverse effect on the forest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Indeed, counsel's response did not answer the court's question, and the Forest Service has never explained (in its briefing nor at argument) what makes an adverse effect \"substantial.\" Even more telling, however, is that the \"rarely, if ever\" language used by counsel is\n   <em>\n    nowhere to be found\n   </em>\n   in the preamble to the 2012 Planning Rule, nor in\n   <em>\n    any other\n   </em>\n   Forest Service guidance that the court could find. The closest language to counsel's assertion that the court could identify is in the preamble to the\n   <em>\n    2016 Amendment\n   </em>\n   to the 2012 Planning Rule, which states, \"[i]t is unlikely that a change in land allocation for a small area would have substantial adverse effects.\" 2016 Amendment to 2012 Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2090%2C723\">\n    81 Fed.

This language was a response by the Forest Service to a public comment which was concerned that the proposed rule (the 2016 Amendment) might impose a burden on small changes to land allocation. The Forest Service's full response was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   The 2012 rule did not require that every resource or use be present in every area. The Department clarifies in this final rule that directly related specific\n   substantive requirements within \u00a7\u00a7 219.8 through 219.11 apply within the scope and scale of the amendment. Changes in land allocation for a small area would likely require a similarly narrow application of the directly related substantive requirements, depending on the purpose and effects of the changes. It is unlikely that a change in land allocation for a small area would have substantial adverse effects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Even assuming that this language from the 2016 Amendment's preamble is what counsel was referring to during argument, it still does not provide any support for the Forest Service's interpretation of \"substantial adverse effects.\" A \"change in land allocation for a small area\" is plainly not the same as generalizing to any project-specific amendment, and \"unlikely\" is a far cry from \"rarely, if ever.\" Perhaps this is why counsel struggled to define what \"rarely, if ever\" would mean in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Thus, we find no basis in the law for the Forest Service's assertion that \"rarely, if ever, will a project-specific amendment rise to the level of having a substantial adverse effect\" on the natural forests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In any event, the Forest Service's application of the \"effects\" prong of the directly related test was still flawed. In each instance in the ROD where the Forest Service concluded that the 2012 Planning Rule's substantive requirements were not \"directly related\" to the Plan amendments, the ROD states that the amendment \"will not cause substantial\n   <em>\n    long-term\n   </em>\n   adverse effects.\" J.A. 39, 41, 43 (emphasis supplied).

In fact, the ROD suggests just the opposite is true: in its analysis of the amendments' compliance with the 2012 Planning Rule's substantive requirements, the Forest Service explicitly stated when an amendment met the applicable substantive requirement. For example, regarding the GWNF Plan amendment for utility corridors, the ROD states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   The FEIS evaluated a variety of options to transport natural gas and adequately analyzed the appropriate placement and sustainable management of the ACP. Consequently,\n   <em>\n    I find this amendment meets the 36 CFR 219.10(a)(3) planning rule requirement\n   </em>\n   .

According to the ROD, conducting the directly related analysis would have been unnecessary if the amendment in fact satisfied the substantive requirement: where \"the amendment meets the rule requirement,\n   <em>\n    there is no need to make a further determination as to whether the rule requirement is directly related to it\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 41-42 (emphasis supplied) ).

Nevertheless, as Atlantic's deadlines drew near, the Forest Service disregarded these concerns and adopted the FEIS -- including its conclusions that landslide risks, erosion impacts, and degradation of water quality remained unknown -- the very same day FERC issued it. To support its decision to approve the project and grant the SUP, the Forest Service relied on the very mitigation measures it previously found unreliable.

It meant the Forest Service approved the pipeline without information it previously determined was necessary to making its decision, and it did so without acknowledging, much less explaining, its change in position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Forest Service's reversal is particularly puzzling considering the reason it requested the site-specific stabilization designs in the first place: to demonstrate that Atlantic's BIC program could actually work in particular conditions, rather than simply being a \"cookbook with generalities.\" J.A. 2514. The Forest Service also conducted a literature review on Atlantic's BIC incremental controls to attempt to determine the effectiveness of these measures. Far from proving the effectiveness of the BIC program, the literature review concluded: \"[T]he majority of these BIC incremental controls are either too new to provide any real insight to the effectiveness on erosion control, especially on steep slopes, or there has not been any research to prove the effectiveness of these incremental controls for adequate erosion control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Thus, despite its own well-documented concerns with Atlantic's mitigation plans, the Forest Service abandoned its request for the eight site-specific stabilization designs and adopted the FEIS, all without science-based evidence of the BIC program's effectiveness. This falls far short of NEPA's hard look requirement, and the Forest Service's brief, conclusory letter stating that the information provided by Atlantic was \"adequate\" is insufficient to show that the Forest Service's concerns had been addressed as NEPA requires. J.A. 1881.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Perhaps nothing demonstrates the dangers of the Forest Service's insufficient analysis of landslide risks clearer than the FEIS's use of the Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline as an example of an existing pipeline in the Appalachian Mountains that safely crosses karst terrain.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 1589, 1609 (\"There are differences between ACP and corridor and the Columbia pipeline project and corridor, and so, there can be more potential for project-induced slope failures in the ACP corridor. But the decades of slope stability performance of the Columbia pipeline corridor on slopes generally similar to those along the ACP pipeline route is relevant information to consider.\"). Significantly, during the briefing of this case, a landslide in Marshall County, West Virginia, caused the Columbia pipeline -- highlighted by the Forest Service for its safety and stability -- to rupture and explode.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clearly, the Forest Service's concerns\n   about landslide risks and pipeline safety highlighted in its October 24, 2016 letter deserve serious consideration, for the protection of both the environment and the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    Erosion Impacts and Degradation of Water Quality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   In adopting the FEIS and approving the pipeline, the Forest Service concluded that because of \"mitigation measures, impacts on groundwater and surface waters will be effectively minimized or mitigated.\" J.A. 25. However, as explained above, the Forest Service had previously expressed serious concerns about the extensive erosion and sedimentation that the ACP project could cause, and it additionally questioned the mitigation techniques that Atlantic relied on to reduce those impacts. This is particularly true regarding the overly high efficiency rate of erosion control devices used in the sedimentation analysis (96 percent), the use of water bars as a mitigation technique, and the use of averaged versus episodic sediment calculations to analyze water resource impacts in the sedimentation analysis. Despite these concerns, and the FEIS's conclusion that \"specific [erosion] effects [remained] unknown,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1659, the Forest Service nevertheless relied on the incomplete analysis in the FEIS and disregarded its concerns about the effectiveness of the mitigation techniques.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   For example, in the draft biologic evaluation, Atlantic asserted that installation of erosion control devices would \"reduce erosion by about 96 percent.\" J.A. 2633. The Forest Service criticized this conclusion in its March 10, 2017 comments to the draft biologic evaluation, stating, \"Use of lab testing and efficiency rates are inappropriate for steep slope pipeline construction. Update model with more conservative assumptions about containment efficiencies. Document the literature references that apply to efficiencies in the field, particularly mountainous terrain in WV and VA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   However, Atlantic did not comply with the Forest Service's request, and the 96 percent erosion control efficiency rate remained in Atlantic's August 2017 Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Modeling Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 909 (\"Installation of [erosion control devices] was predicted to reduce erosion by about 96 percent.\"). We note that this report was issued five months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Forest Service directed Atlantic to update its erosion efficiency rate, one month after the Forest Service issued its draft ROD, just two months before the final version of the COM Plan was issued, and only three months before the Forest Service issued the final ROD. Accordingly, we see no evidence in the record that the Forest Service's concerns regarding the 96 percent erosion control efficiency rate were ever resolved; nonetheless, the Forest Service ultimately relied on this figure to determine that Atlantic's proposed mitigation measures would effectively reduce erosion and sedimentation impacts from the ACP project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   During oral argument, Atlantic claimed that the Forest Service's concern about the 96 percent efficiency rate was resolved because Atlantic agreed not to use silt fences as a mitigation technique in certain areas, which it claims were the cause of the \"overly optimistic\" efficiency rate. Oral Argument at 37:50-39:41. As counsel for Atlantic stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   The Forest Service never accepted the 96 percent efficiency. Indeed, that model was predicated on a standard erosion\n   and sediment control device called the silt fence. Instead of debating ... over the percent effectiveness of the silt fence, the Forest Service made a much more direct and compelling move, which was to prohibit the use of silt fences in the areas over which it had concern ... Atlantic committed not to use the silt fences that were the subject of the overly optimistic erosion sediment model.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Modeling Report attributes the 96 percent erosion control efficiency rate to all erosion control devices \"such as silt fences, waterbars, and mulch application,\" not just silt fences. J.A. 929. Additionally, the final draft of the COM Plan is riddled with uses of silt fences as proposed mitigation techniques.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 303, 409, 473, 475, 586, 587.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   However, even if Atlantic is correct that it committed not to use silt fences in certain areas, this is beside the point. The use of silt fences was not the problem. The problem, as the Forest Service itself pointed out, was assuming that these devices would function nearly perfectly to reduce erosion and sediment, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary. This assumption remained in the August 2017 Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Modeling Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 908 n.2 (\"The effectiveness predicted by the model is influenced by slope, soil, groundcover, and type of erosion control device;\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    model assumes perfect installation, soil retention, and maintenance\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis supplied) ). This assumption infected the sedimentation model -- the model that produced the \"200 to 800 percent above baseline erosion\" estimate cited in in the ROD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Crucially, we can identify no other more conservative efficiency rate used to correct the sedimentation model which drove the Forest Service's erosion and sedimentation analysis. Indeed, the use of the 96 percent efficiency rate in the August 2017 Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Modeling Report, which was issued only three months before the Forest Service's final ROD, suggests that the Forest Service's concern with Atlantic's overly high efficiency rate for erosion control devices was never resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 908-09 (\"Installation of [erosion control devices] was predicted to reduce erosion by about 96 percent.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Additionally, the FEIS relied on the use of water bars as a mitigation technique that would reduce the environmental impacts of the ACP project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1662 (\"The use of water bars (i.e., slope breakers) was assumed on long slopes ....\"). The Forest Service had previously stated in its comments on Atlantic's updated biologic evaluation that further analysis was needed to determine whether water bars would be effective: \"Slope breaker locations relative to pertinent habitat features need to be disclosed[.] It is important to be sure that they are not potentially directing water into habitats (in which case they would actually do more harm than good).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2337. Nevertheless, the FEIS candidly acknowledged that this further analysis was never done:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   [W]ater bars create concentrated flows where they discharge adjoining off right-of-way areas.\n   <em>\n    The [Forest Service] has stated that Atlantic has not assessed how or whether the adjoining areas can receive concentrated\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    flows, or whether measures would be implemented to allow these areas to safely receive and convey the concentrated flows\n   </em>\n   . In addition, the slopes to be encountered in the MNF and GWNF would require several water bars to be \"stacked\" along their length, creating multiple points of discharge.\n   <em>\n    The [Forest Service] has stated the potential impacts of multiple points\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    of concentrated discharges onto the adjoining areas has not been assessed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1663 (emphasis supplied). Once again, the Forest Service adopted the FEIS (including its use of water bars as a mitigation technique), issued its ROD, and granted the SUP based on an erosion and sedimentation analysis using water bars as a mitigation technique, despite the clear evidence in the record that (1) the Forest Service had concerns with this technique; (2) the Forest Service's concerns were not resolved in the FEIS; and (3) the effectiveness of water bars for this project was never analyzed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Finally, the record further reflects that the Forest Service believed Atlantic used an incorrect calculation to analyze how sedimentation from the ACP project would impact aquatic species. In its draft biologic evaluation, Atlantic analyzed the total sediment that would erode a stream in a year divided by the volume of water that would flow through the stream in a year -- to create an\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   sediment level over an entire year -- rather than analyzing sediment levels in terms of discrete episodic events, where the sediment levels vary based on precipitation events that cause larger amounts of erosion to enter the stream. In other words, Atlantic employed a simplistic (and unrealistic) calculation that made in-stream sedimentation levels look much lower than they would be during construction. Of note, the Forest Service sharply criticized this approach in its comments on the draft biologic report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   This entire paragraph has false rationale and needs to be deleted or modified extensively. Erosion and sediment transport to streams cannot be averaged evenly over a year, rather it happens in discrete episodic events. It is not appropriate to minimize impacts by making a comparison of total load evenly spread over time. The point of the load calculation is to address impacts to sensitive aquatic species which are impacted by flow and timing of sediment during these erosion events.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   J.A. 2358. However, despite the Forest Service's concerns with Atlantic's calculations in the sedimentation analysis, the record does not indicate that Atlantic ever updated its calculation to reflect actual conditions. Nevertheless, the Forest Service adopted Atlantic's updated biologic report and the FEIS, and it concluded that erosion and sedimentation from the ACP project would not substantially adversely affect sensitive aquatic species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The Forest Service argues -- correctly -- that NEPA does not require a fully formed mitigation plan to be in place. As this court has noted, \"it would be inconsistent with NEPA's reliance on procedural mechanisms -- as opposed to substantive, result-based standards -- to demand the presence of a fully developed plan that will mitigate environmental harm before an agency can act.\"\n   <em>\n    Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p350\">\n    490 U.S. at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p350\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in this case, the Forest Service adopted the FEIS and issued its draft ROD\n   <em>\n    in reliance on a mitigation plan that had not been established\n   </em>\n   , and one that, as demonstrated by the Forest Service's own concerns, had not been proven effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   To satisfy NEPA in this case, the Forest Service needed to resolve its own concerns with the EIS -- which, for the reasons we have explained, it did not do -- and it needed to have a reasonable basis for concluding that the mitigation plan, once fully formed,\n   <em>\n    would be effective\n   </em>\n   . Here, the Forest Service relied on the generalities of the BIC program and other techniques proposed by Atlantic to achieve particular mitigating results, with neither actual site designs nor science-based evidence demonstrating such results were likely. This is precisely the sort of uninformed agency action that NEPA prohibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Audubon Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928598\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/174/#p185\">\n    422 F.3d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the Forest Service took a hard look at the environmental consequences of its decision.

Upon remand, the Forest Service should explain its decision that receiving only two of the eight site-specific stabilization designs was \"adequate\" to determine the environmental effects of the ACP project, and it should also explain how it took a \"hard look\" at the erosion, sedimentation, and water quality issues discussed here considering the Forest Service's numerous concerns that were not addressed in the FEIS.

To the contrary, the draft ROD characterizes the decision to be made as \"[W]hether to authorize the use and occupancy of\n   <em>\n    NFS\n   </em>\n   lands for [Atlantic] to construct, operate, maintain, and eventually decommission a natural gas pipeline that crosses\n   <em>\n    NFS lands administered by the MNF and GWNF\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 1378 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Because (1) the draft ROD purported to be considering granting right of way through\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   Forest Service \"lands administered by the MNF and GWNF\" and (2) the FEIS, upon which the draft ROD relied, stated that NPS \"administered\" the entire ANST and that the entire ANST is a \"unit\" of the National Park System, there was no reason for Petitioners, or any other public commenter, to believe that the ROD or the SUP would grant right of way across the ANST. To be sure, Petitioners may have been on notice from the FEIS that the pipeline would require a right of way across the ANST from some agency at some point, but Petitioners had no way to know that such right of way would be granted by the Forest Service through the ROD. Indeed, the plain language of the SUP authorizes Atlantic \"to use or occupy\" only \"\n   <em>\n    National Forest System lands\n   </em>\n   in the [MNF] and the [GWNF]\n   <em>\n    of the National Forest System\n   </em>\n   .\" Put simply, the Forest Service never notified the public that it intended to grant Atlantic right of way through a unit of the National Park System like the ANST.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Furthermore, and significantly, the draft ROD nowhere mentions that the Forest Service intended to rely on the MLA as the basis of its authority to grant the right of way across the ANST.
