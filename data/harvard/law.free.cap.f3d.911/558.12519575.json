Federal agencies issued two interim final rules (IFRs) exempting employers with religious and moral objections from this requirement. Several states sued to enjoin the enforcement of the IFRs, and the district court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To contextualize the issues raised on appeal, we briefly recount the history of the ACA's contraceptive coverage requirement. The ACA provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for ... with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings ... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4).

The three agencies responsible for implementing the ACA-the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury (collectively, agencies)-issued regulations requiring coverage of all preventive services contained in HRSA's guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20147.130\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(iv) (DHSS regulation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The agencies also recognized that religious organizations may object to the use of contraceptive care and offering health insurance that covers such care.

The district court held that venue was proper and that the states had standing to challenge the IFRs. The district court then issued a nationwide preliminary injunction based on the states' likelihood of success on their APA claim-that the IFRs were procedurally invalid for failing to follow notice and comment rulemaking.

They argue that the deprivation of this procedural right affected their economic interests. According to the states, the IFRs expanded the number of employers categorically exempt from the ACA's contraceptive coverage requirement, and states will incur significant costs as a result of their residents' reduced access to contraceptive care. The states specifically identify three ways in which the IFRs will economically harm them. First, women who lose coverage will seek contraceptive care through state-run programs or programs that the states are responsible for reimbursing. Second, women who do not qualify for or cannot afford such programs will be at risk for unintended pregnancies, which impose financial costs on the state. Third, reduced access to contraceptive care will negatively affect women's educational attainment and ability to participate in the labor force, affecting their contributions as taxpayers.

The agencies' own regulatory impact analysis (RIA)-which explains the anticipated costs, benefits, and effects of the IFRs-estimates that between 31,700 and 120,000 women nationwide will lose some coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 47,821, 47,823. Importantly, when making these estimates, the agencies accounted for key factors likely to skew the estimate, including that some objecting employers will continue to use the accommodation instead of the new, expanded exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47,818 (estimating that 109 entities-of the 209 entities who have litigated the contraceptive care requirement and are currently using the accommodation process-would seek exemption);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"We expect the 122 nonprofit entities that specifically challenged the accommodation in court to use the expanded exemption\"). The record also includes names of specific employers identified by the RIA as likely to use the expanded exemptions, including those operating in the plaintiff states like Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. Appellants fault the states for failing to identify a specific woman likely to lose coverage. Such identification is not necessary to establish standing. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman\n   </em>\n   , California challenged a forest-management plan that changed the standards governing logging on a parcel of land.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3418432\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1161/#p1171\">\n    646 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1171-72 (9th Cir. 2011). The state's standing to do so was based on future injury resulting from any logging under the plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3418432\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1161/#p1171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3418432\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1161/#p1171\">\n    at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (maj. op. of Fisher, J.). We emphasized that the state's standing to challenge the plan \"is not defeated by its not having submitted affidavits establishing approval of specific logging projects under\" the plan because \"there is no real possibility that the [relevant agency] will ... decline to adopt\" any project under the plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3418432\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1161/#p1171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3418432\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1161/#p1171\">\n    at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true here. Evidence supports that, with reasonable probability, some women residing in the plaintiff states will lose coverage due to the IFRs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, it is reasonably probable that loss of coverage will inflict economic harm to the states. The RIA estimates the direct cost of filling the coverage loss as $18.5 or $63.8 million per year, depending on the method of estimating. 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,821, 47,824. More importantly, the RIA identifies that state and local programs \"provide free or subsidized contraceptives for low-income women\" and concludes that this \"existing inter-governmental structure for obtaining contraceptives significantly diminishes\" the impact of the expanded exemptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47,803. The RIA itself thus assumed that state and local governments will bear additional economic costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The declarations submitted by the states further show that women losing coverage from their employers will turn to state-based programs or programs reimbursed by the state. For example, California offers the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) program to provide contraceptive care to those below 200% of the federal poverty level. As attested\n   to by program administrators, loss of coverage due to the IFRs will result in increased enrollment to Family PACT. Increased enrollment translates into, for example, the state reimbursing Planned Parenthood about $74.96 for each enrollee who receives contraceptive care. The states provided similar evidence for New York, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia, which all have state-funded family planning programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Appellants dispute various factual findings underlying standing, but they do not explain how those findings are clearly erroneous. Appellants also argue that four of the plaintiff states-California, Delaware, Maryland, and New York-will not suffer harm because they have state laws that independently require certain employer-provided plans to cover contraceptive care. Those state laws do not apply to self-insured (also called self-funded) plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (preempting \"any and all state laws\" on this subject).

It would prevent the economic harm extensively detailed in the record. Indeed, while the record before the district court was voluminous on the harm to the plaintiffs, it was not developed as to the economic impact on other states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517815\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/1225/#p1244\">\n    897 F.3d at 1231, 1244-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the district court abused its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction because the plaintiffs' \"tendered evidence is limited to the effect of the Order on their governments and the State of California\" and because \"the record is not sufficiently developed on the nationwide impact of the Executive Order\").

The plaintiff state governments lack standing, so the district court lacked jurisdiction. The reason they lack standing is that their injury is what the Supreme Court calls \"self-inflicted,\" because it arises solely from their legislative decisions to pay these moneys. Under the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   we are compelled to reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Pennsylvania sued New Jersey on the theory that a new New Jersey tax law caused the Pennsylvania fisc to collect less money.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pennsylvania granted a tax credit for income taxes paid to other states, and New Jersey under its new tax law had begun taxing the New Jersey-derived income of nonresidents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont sued New Hampshire on similar grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The concrete financial injury was plain in all these cases. Like the plaintiff states' injury in the case before us, the reason why was the plaintiff states' laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   invoked the long established principle that under\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v. Missouri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the injuries for which redress was sought had to be \"directly caused\" by the defendant states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   They were held not to be \"directly caused\" in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , because the monetary losses resulted from the plaintiff states' own laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though it was undisputed that the defendant states' tax schemes had cost the plaintiff states money, the defendant states were held not to have \"inflicted any injury,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the monetary harms were \"self-inflicted:\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   The injuries to the plaintiffs' fiscs were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions made by their respective state legislatures. Nothing required Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont to extend a tax credit to their residents for income taxes paid to New Hampshire, and nothing prevents Pennsylvania from withdrawing that credit for taxes paid to New Jersey. No state can be heard to complain about damage inflicted by its own hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   California and the other plaintiff states in the case before us have pointed out that their legislative schemes were in place before the federal regulatory change that will cost them money. But\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   does not leave room for such a \"first in time, first in right\" argument. Vermont's law, for instance, long preceded New Hampshire's, but the court held that any \"injury\" was \"self-inflicted\" because Vermont need not have extended tax credits to its residents at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The states could also have prevented their financial injury by changing their laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the concurring opinion put it, \"[t]he appellants therefore, [we]re really complaining about their own statute[s].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   differs from the case before us because the dispute was between coequal sovereigns in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , heard under the Court's original jurisdiction, and here it is between state governments and the federal government. But\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   's rejection of \"self-inflicted\" injury has been applied outside the original jurisdiction context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no conflict between the federal and state laws, so the sovereign rights of the plaintiff states cannot establish standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though the plaintiff states may under their own laws spend additional money to provide benefits to some women that they would not have had to pay for before the federal change, they remain free to decide whether to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As the majority acknowledges, the \"irreducible minimum\" for standing is that \"the plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   All three minima are perhaps debatable, but causation, that is, \"traceability,\" is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   . That case establishes that harm to the fisc of a plaintiff state because of its own statute is \"self-inflicted,\" and therefore not \"traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Traceability fails if the expense to the state results from its own law and without that state legislative choice, could be avoided. The federal regulatory change itself imposes no obligation on the states to provide money for contraception. The plaintiff states choose to provide some contraception benefits to employees of employers exempted by the federal insurance requirement, so the narrowing of the federal mandate may lead to the states spending more because some employers may spend less. Nor can\n   the plaintiff states invoke the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   to gain standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   I recognize that the Fifth Circuit took a different view in different circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Texas v. United States\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, the Fifth Circuit held that states did indeed have standing to challenge a new federal program relating to immigration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Texas was held to have standing because federal regulatory change on its administration of drivers' licenses - requiring it to issue drivers' licenses to illegal aliens - would cost it money.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit rejected application of the\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   \"self-inflicted injury\" rule, but stressed that its decision \"is limited to these facts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not plain that the Fifth Circuit would extend its view of standing to the quite different facts before us. The regulatory change regarding contraception poses no challenge to the sovereign authority of California to provide contraceptive benefits or not, but the regulatory change in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   did limit the legislative choices Texas could make without \"running afoul of preemption or the Equal Protection Clause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor can we be sure that\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   is good law. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question whether \"a State that voluntarily provides a subsidy\" has standing to challenge a federal change that would expand its subsidy, and other issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court was \"equally divided,\" so the questions were not answered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The majority errs in treating\n   <em>\n    Wyoming v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   as though it overruled\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   It does not say so. And the Court doubtlessly would have said so had that been its intent. Nor is the self-inflicted injury doctrine even relevant to\n   <em>\n    Wyoming\n   </em>\n   , which is doubtless why\n   <em>\n    Wyoming\n   </em>\n   does not discuss\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff states could have avoided any lost revenue by changing their own laws granting tax credits for taxes paid to the defendant states. By contrast, Wyoming could not prevent the expense to its fisc by changing its own law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wyoming lost severance tax revenue because the new Oklahoma law required major Oklahoma coal consumers to replace a substantial part of the Wyoming coal they burned with Oklahoma coal, so less coal was mined in Wyoming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the Wyoming legislature could not change the Oklahoma law, the harm to Wyoming's fisc was not self-inflicted. The Oklahoma law, which expressly targeted Wyoming, caused the injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   In our case, as in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff states elected to pay money in certain circumstances, and can avoid the harm to their fiscs by choosing not to pay the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   I agree with the federal position that the plaintiff states lack standing to bring this case in federal court. Because such a conclusion would preclude us from reaching the other issues in the case, I do not speak to them in this dissent. Nor do I address additional reasons why the plaintiff states may lack standing, since the \"self-inflicted injury\" disposes of the question without them.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    In addition to establishing constitutional standing, \"[a] plaintiff must also satisfy the non-constitutional standing requirements of the statute under which [it] seeks to bring suit.\"\n    <em>\n     City of Sausalito\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155144\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/386/1186/#p1197\">\n     386 F.3d at 1199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
