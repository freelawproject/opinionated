Gomez-Diaz appeals, challenging the district court's denial of a lesser-included-offense instruction, its denial of his motion for a mistrial, and its application of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement\n   at sentencing. We affirm in part and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Twenty-one-year-old Gomez-Diaz had been sexually abusing his girlfriend's eight-year-old brother, M., for several months. The sexual conduct went unnoticed until his girlfriend, looking through Gomez-Diaz's phone one night, found six pictures of him and M. performing oral sex on each other, which had been taken earlier that evening. The girlfriend called the police, and Gomez-Diaz was promptly arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Gomez-Diaz never denied engaging in sexual contact with M. But his defense theory at trial was that he did not engage in sexual contact for the purpose of producing child pornography-an element of \u00a7 2251(a). To that end, Gomez-Diaz asked the district court to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of possession of child pornography under \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). The district court refused, reasoning that possession of child pornography is not a lesser-included offense of production of child pornography. Reviewing the district court's decision de novo,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Soriano-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432621\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/310/1099/#p1103\">\n    310 F.3d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1103 (8th Cir. 2002), we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A defendant's proper request for a lesser-included-offense instruction will be granted when, among other things, \"the elements of the lesser offense are identical to part of the elements of the greater offense,\" that is, when the lesser offense contains no elements that the greater offense does not.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rainbow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088624\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/1097/#p1105\">\n    813 F.3d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1105 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Possession of child pornography includes at least one element that production of child pornography does not: possession. Gomez-Diaz does not dispute this, but he argues that in practice, it is impossible to produce child pornography without necessarily possessing it. Gomez-Diaz may be right that a person who produces child pornography often also possesses it, but that is not always the case. For example, any person who \"persuades\" a minor to engage in \"sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction\" or \"transports\" a minor for that purpose may be convicted under \u00a7 2251(a). Because \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) requires an element not required for \u00a7 2251(a), the district court correctly refused to issue a lesser-included-offense instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During trial, Gomez-Diaz's counsel explained to the jury that he was \"the voice\" for his client. During closing arguments, the prosecutor reminded the jury of that comment and stated, \"You are the voice for\" the victim. This statement elicited an immediate objection from the defense; the district court did not rule on the objection initially, and the prosecutor repeated her statement. The defense objected again, explaining, \"That's improper argument, your Honor. The jury is not a voice for anybody.\" The district court then sustained the objection and instructed the prosecutor to move on. Later, Gomez-Diaz moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's statement. The district court denied the motion. But Gomez-Diaz also requested and received the following curative instruction: \"You are not to make a decision on behalf of [the victim]. You are to make the decision based upon the evidence in this case as it applies to the Defendant in this case.\" On appeal, Gomez-Diaz contends that the district court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review the denial of a motion for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct\n   for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the obstruction-of-justice enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 is a two-level enhancement, without it, Gomez-Diaz's offense level would be 49.

The majority's concern that the obstruction-of-justice enhancement may have been considered by the district court in its final sentencing decision is misplaced because, in this appeal, Gomez-Diaz does not challenge the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Instead, he raises only a procedural claim that the district court miscalculated his offense level. Further, the harmlessness of the error is reinforced by the fact that the district court varied 10 years below the Guidelines range of 360 months to impose the 240-month sentence, and the court did not mention the obstruction-of-justice enhancement in explaining the reasons for the sentence. Because the harmlessness of the error is certain and remanding would be futile, I would affirm the district court's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Specifically, the report stated,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    The defendant's trial testimony included statements that contradicted information reported to law enforcement by [the victim] regarding the length of the sexual abuse, the occurrence of anal-genital penetration, the previous production of photographic images on his phone, and the threatening statements made to [the victim].
