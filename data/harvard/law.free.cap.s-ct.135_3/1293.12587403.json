When that happens, the decision of the first tribunal usually must be followed by the second, at least if the issue is really the same. Allowing the same issue to be decided more than once wastes litigants' resources and adjudicators' time, and it\n   encourages parties who lose before one tribunal to shop around for another. The doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion is designed to prevent this from occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case concerns the application of issue preclusion in the context of trademark law. Petitioner, B &amp; B Hardware, Inc. (B &amp; B), and respondent Hargis Industries, Inc. (Hargis), both use similar trademarks; B &amp; B owns SEALTIGHT while Hargis owns SEALTITE. Under the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20427\">\n    60 Stat. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201051\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   an applicant can seek to register a trademark through an administrative process within the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). But if another party believes that the PTO should not register a mark because it is too similar to its own, that party can oppose registration before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB). Here, Hargis tried to register the mark SEALTITE, but B &amp; B opposed SEALTITE's registration. After a lengthy proceeding, the TTAB agreed with B &amp; B that SEALTITE should not be registered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to permitting a party to object to the registration of a mark, the Lanham Act allows a mark owner to sue for trademark infringement. Both a registration proceeding and a suit for trademark infringement, more-over, can occur at the same time. In this case, while the TTAB was deciding whether SEALTITE should be registered, B &amp; B and Hargis were also litigating the SEALTIGHT versus SEALTITE dispute in federal court. In both registration proceedings and infringement litigation, the tribunal asks whether a likelihood of confusion exists between the mark sought to be protected (here, SEALTIGHT) and the other mark (SEALTITE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The question before this Court is whether the District Court in this case should have applied issue preclusion to the TTAB's decision that SEALTITE is confusingly similar to SEALTIGHT. Here, the Eighth Circuit rejected issue preclusion for reasons that would make it difficult for the doctrine ever to apply in trademark disputes. We disagree with that narrow understanding of issue preclusion. Instead, consistent with principles of law that apply in innumerable contexts, we hold that a court should give preclusive effect to TTAB decisions if the ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Trademark law has a long history, going back at least to Roman times. See Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 9, Comment\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   (1993). The principle underlying trademark protection is that distinctive marks-words, names, symbols, and the like-can help distinguish a particular artisan's goods from those of others.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   One who first uses a distinct mark in commerce thus acquires rights to that mark. See 2 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 16:1 (4th ed. 2014)(hereinafter McCarthy). Those rights include preventing others from using the mark. See 1 A. LaLonde, Gilson on Trademarks \u00a7 3.02[8] (2014) (hereinafter Gilson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Though federal law does not create trademarks, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Trade-Mark Cases,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4618\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/100/82/#p92\">\n    100 U.S. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4618,4660\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed/25/550/\">\n    25 L.Ed. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1879), Congress has long played a role in protecting them. In 1946, Congress enacted the Lanham Act, the current federal trademark scheme. As relevant here, the Lanham Act creates at least two adjudicative mechanisms to help protect marks. First,\n   a trademark owner can register its mark with the PTO. Second, a mark owner can bring a suit for infringement in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Registration is significant. The Lanham Act confers \"important legal rights and benefits\" on trademark owners who register their marks. 3 McCarthy \u00a7 19:3, at 19-21see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19:9, at 19-34 (listing seven of the \"procedural and substantive legal advantages\" of registration). Registration, for instance, serves as \"constructive notice of the registrant's claim of ownership\" of the mark.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201072\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also is \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the owner's ownership of the mark, and of the owner's exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate.\" \u00a7 1057(b). And once a mark has been registered for five years, it can become \"incontestable.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1065, 1115(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To obtain the benefits of registration, a mark owner files an application with the PTO.\u00a7 1051. The application must include, among other things, \"the date of the applicant's first use of the mark, the date of the applicant's first use of the mark in commerce, the goods in connection with which the mark is used, and a drawing of the mark.\" \u00a7 1051(a)(2). The usages listed in the application-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   those goods on which the mark appears along with, if applicable, their channels of distribution-are critical. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   3 McCarthy \u00a7 20:24, at 20-83(\"[T]he applicant's right to register must be made on the basis of the goods described in the application\");\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20:15, at 20-85 (explaining that if an \"application does not delimit any specific trade channels of distribution, no limitation will be\" applied). The PTO generally cannot register a mark which \"so resembles\" another mark \"as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   If a trademark examiner believes that registration is warranted, the mark is published in the Official Gazette of the PTO. \u00a7 1062. At that point, \"[a]ny person who believes that he would be damaged by the registration\" may \"file an opposition.\" \u00a7 1063(a). Opposition proceedings occur before the TTAB (or panels thereof). \u00a7 1067(a). The TTAB consists of administrative trademark judges and high-ranking PTO officials, including the Director of the PTO and the Commissioner of Trademarks. \u00a7 1067(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Opposition proceedings before the TTAB are in many ways \"similar to a civil action in a federal district court.\" TTAB Manual of Procedure \u00a7 102.03 (2014) (hereinafter TTAB Manual), online at http://www.uspto.gov (as visited Mar. 20, 2015, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). These proceedings, for instance, are largely governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Evidence. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202.116\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 2.122(a) (2014). The TTAB also allows discovery and depositions. See \u00a7\u00a7 2.120, 2.123(a). The party opposing registration bears the burden of proof, see \u00a7 2.116(b), and if that burden cannot be met, the opposed mark must be registered, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201063\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The primary way in which TTAB proceedings differ from ordinary civil litigation is that \"proceedings before the Board are conducted in writing, and the Board's actions in a particular case are based upon the written record therein.\" TTAB Manual \u00a7 102.03. In other words, there is no live testimony. Even so, the TTAB allows parties to submit transcribed testimony, taken under oath and subject to cross-examination, and to request oral argument. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202.123\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2.129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When a party opposes registration because it believes the mark proposed to be registered is too similar to its own, the TTAB evaluates likelihood of confusion by applying some or all of the 13 factors set out in\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.I.

After the TTAB decides whether to register the mark, a party can seek review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or it can file a new action in district court. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The owner of a mark, whether registered or not, can bring suit in federal court if another is using a mark that too closely resembles the plaintiff's. The court must decide whether the defendant's use of a mark in commerce \"is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\" with regards to the plaintiff's mark. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a)(registered marks); \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A)(unregistered marks). In infringement litigation, the district court considers the full range of a mark's usages, not just those in the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioner B &amp; B and respondent Hargis both manufacture metal fasteners. B &amp; B manufactures fasteners for the aerospace industry, while Hargis manufactures fasteners for use in the construction trade. Although there are obvious differences between space shuttles and A-frame buildings, both aerospace and construction engineers prefer fasteners that seal things tightly. Accordingly, both B &amp; B and Hargis want their wares associated with tight seals. A feud of nearly two decades has sprung from this seemingly commonplace set of facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1993 B &amp; B registered SEALTIGHT for \"threaded or unthreaded metal fasteners and other related hardwar[e]; namely, self-sealing nuts, bolts, screws, rivets and washers, all having a captive o-ring, for use in the aerospace industry.\" App. 223a (capitalization omitted). In 1996, Hargis sought to register SEALTITE for \"self-piercing and self-drilling metal screws for use in the manufacture of metal and post-frame buildings.\" App. 70a (capitalization omitted). B &amp; B opposed Hargis' registration because, although the two companies sell different products, it believes that SEALTITE is confusingly similar to SEALTIGHT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The twists and turns in the SEALTIGHT versus SEALTITE controversy are labyrinthine. The question whether either of these marks should be registered, and if so, which one, has bounced around within the PTO for about two decades; related infringement litigation has been before the Eighth Circuit three times; and two separate juries have been empaneled and returned verdicts. The full story could fill a long, unhappy book.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For purposes here, we pick up the story in 2002, when the PTO published SEALTITE in the Official Gazette. This prompted opposition proceedings before the TTAB, complete with discovery, including depositions. B &amp; B argued that SEALTITE could not be registered because it is confusingly similar to SEALTIGHT. B &amp; B explained, for instance, that both companies have an online presence, the largest distributor of fasteners sells both companies' products, and consumers sometimes call the wrong company\n   to place orders. Hargis rejoined that the companies sell different products, for different uses, to different types of consumers, through different channels of trade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Invoking a number of the\n   <em>\n    DuPont\n   </em>\n   factors, the TTAB sided with B &amp; B. The Board considered, for instance, whether SEALTIGHT is famous (it's not, said the Board), how the two products are used (differently), how much the marks resemble each other (very much), and whether customers are actually confused (perhaps sometimes). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a-71a. Concluding that \"the most critical factors in [its] likelihood of confusion analysis are the similarities of the marks and the similarity of the goods,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 70a, the TTAB determined that SEALTITE-when \"used in connection with 'self-piercing and self-drilling metal screws for use in the manufacture of metal and post-frame buildings' \"-could not be registered because it \"so resembles\" SEALTIGHT when \"used in connection with fasteners that provide leakproof protection from liquids and gases, fasteners that have a captive o-ring, and 'threaded or unthreaded metal fastners and other related hardware ... for use in the aerospace industry' as to be likely to cause confusion,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 71a. Despite a right to do so, Hargis did not seek judicial review in either the Federal Circuit or District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   All the while, B &amp; B had sued Hargis for infringement. Before the District Court ruled on likelihood of confusion, however, the TTAB announced its decision. After a series of proceedings not relevant here, B &amp; B argued to the District Court that Hargis could not contest likelihood of confusion because of the preclusive effect of the TTAB decision. The District Court disagreed, reasoning that the TTAB is not an Article III court. The jury returned a verdict for Hargis, finding no likelihood of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B &amp; B appealed to the Eighth Circuit. Though accepting for the sake of argument that agency decisions can ground issue preclusion, the panel majority affirmed for three reasons: first, because the TTAB uses different factors than the Eighth Circuit to evaluate likelihood of confusion; second, because the TTAB placed too much emphasis on the appearance and sound of the two marks; and third, because Hargis bore the burden of persuasion before the TTAB, while B &amp; B bore it before the District Court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570883\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1020/\">\n    716 F.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

Otherwise, Hargis warns, the Court would have to confront \" 'grave and doubtful questions' as to the Lanham Act's consistency with the Seventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution.\" Brief for Respondent 38 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the outset, we note that Hargis does not argue that giving issue preclusive effect to the TTAB's decision would be unconstitutional. Instead, Hargis contends only that we should read the Lanham Act narrowly because a broad reading\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be unconstitutional. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Brief for Respondent 37, 39, 40, 41-42. The likely reason that Hargis has not directly advanced a constitutional argument is that, at least as to a jury trial right, Hargis did not even list the Seventh Amendment as an authority in its appellee brief to the Eighth Circuit. Moreover, although Hargis pressed an Article III argument below, in its opposition to certiorari in this Court, Hargis seemingly conceded that TTAB decisions\n   <em>\n    can sometimes\n   </em>\n   ground issue preclusion, though it now protests otherwise. See Supplemental Brief in Opposition 2. To the extent, if any, that there could be a meritorious constitutional objection, it is not before us. See\n   <em>\n    Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339497\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/211/#p231\">\n    514 U.S. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231-232,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339497\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/211/#p231\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339497\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/211/#p231\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We reject Hargis' statutory argument that we should jettison administrative preclusion in whole or in part to avoid potential constitutional concerns. As to the Seventh Amendment, for instance, the Court has already held that the right to a jury trial does not negate the issue-preclusive effect of a judgment, even if that judgment was entered by a juryless tribunal. See\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330171\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/322/#p337\">\n    439 U.S. 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330171\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/322/#p337\">\n    99 S.Ct. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330171\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/322/#p337\">\n    58 L.Ed.2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). It would seem to follow naturally that although the Seventh Amendment creates a jury trial right in suits for trademark damages, see\n   <em>\n    Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168796\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/469/#p477\">\n    369 U.S. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477, 479-480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168796\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/469/#p477\">\n    82 S.Ct. 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168796\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/469/#p477\">\n    8 L.Ed.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962), TTAB decisions still can have preclusive effect in such suits. Hargis disputes this reasoning even though it admits that in 1791 \" 'a party was not entitled to have a jury determine issues that had been previously adjudicated by a chancellor in equity.' \" Brief for Respondent 39 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 333,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330171\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/322/#p337\">\n    99 S.Ct. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Instead, Hargis contends that issue preclusion should not apply to TTAB registration decisions because there were no agencies at common law. But our precedent holds that the Seventh Amendment does not strip competent tribunals of the power to issue judgments with preclusive effect; that logic would not seem to turn on the nature of the competent tribunal. And at the same time, adopting Hargis' view would dramatically undercut agency preclusion, despite what the Court has already said to the contrary. Nothing in Hargis' avoidance argument is weighty enough to overcome these weaknesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The claim that we should read the Lanham Act narrowly to avoid Article III concerns is equally unavailing-and for similar reasons. Hargis argues that because it might violate Article III if an agency could make a decision with preclusive effect in a later proceeding before a federal court, we should conclude, as a statutory matter, that issue preclusion is unavailable. Such a holding would not fit with our precedent. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Elliott,\n   </em>\n   the Court, relying on\n   <em>\n    Utah Construction,\n   </em>\n   explained that absent a contrary indication, Congress presumptively intends that an agency's determination (there, a state agency) has preclusive effect.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213232\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/788/#p797\">\n    478 U.S., at 796-799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213232\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/788/#p797\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Astoria,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108159\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/104/#p107\">\n    501 U.S., at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108159\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/104/#p107\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing the \"presumption\"). To be sure, the Court has never addressed whether such preclusion offends Article III. But because this Court's cases are so clear, there is no ambiguity for this Court to sidestep through constitutional avoidance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The next question is whether there is an \"evident\" reason why Congress would not want TTAB decisions to receive preclusive effect, even in those cases in which the ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met.\n   <em>\n    Astoria, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 108,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108159\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/104/#p107\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that nothing in the Lanham Act bars the application of issue preclusion in such cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Lanham Act's text certainly does not forbid issue preclusion. Nor does the Act's structure. Granted, one can seek judicial review of a TTAB registration decision in a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   district court action, and some courts have concluded from this that Congress does not want unreviewed TTAB decisions to ground issue preclusion. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192991\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/494/3/#p9\">\n    494 F.2d 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9-10 (C.A.5 1974). But that conclusion does not follow. Ordinary preclusion law teaches that if a party to a court proceeding does not challenge an adverse decision, that decision can have preclusive effect in other cases, even if it would have been reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   and Illustration 1 (explaining that the failure to pursue an appeal does not undermine issue preclusion and including an example of an apparently unappealed district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim); cf.\n   <em>\n    Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313660\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/394/#p398\">\n    452 U.S. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313660\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/394/#p398\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313660\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/394/#p398\">\n    69 L.Ed.2d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981)(noting \"the res judicata consequences of a final, unappealed judgment on the merits\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This case is also unlike\n   <em>\n    Astoria,\n   </em>\n   where a plaintiff claiming discrimination first went to an agency and then sued in court about the same alleged conduct. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108159\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/104/#p107\">\n    501 U.S., at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108159\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/104/#p107\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concluded, quite sensibly, that the structure of that scheme indicated that the agency decision could not ground issue preclusion. When exhausting an administrative process is a prerequisite to suit in court, giving preclusive effect to the agency's determination in that very administrative process could render the judicial suit \"strictly\n   <em>\n    pro forma\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Elliott, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 795-796,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213232\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/788/#p797\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similar analysis). Here, if a party urged a district court reviewing a TTAB registration decision to give preclusive effect to the very TTAB decision under review,\n   <em>\n    Astoria\n   </em>\n   would apply. But that is not this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   What matters here is that registration is not a prerequisite to an infringement action. Rather, it is a separate proceeding to decide separate rights. Neither is issue preclusion a one-way street. When a district court, as part of its judgment,\n   decides an issue that overlaps with part of the TTAB's analysis, the TTAB gives preclusive effect to the court's judgment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a-55a (giving preclusive effect to the District Court's earlier decision regarding SEALTIGHT's distinctiveness because the issue \"was actually litigated and necessarily determined\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Hargis also argues that allowing TTAB decisions to have issue-preclusive effect will adversely affect the registration process. Because of the TTAB's \" 'limited jurisdiction' \" and \" 'the narrowness of the issues' \" before it, Hargis contends, the Court should infer that TTAB proceedings are supposed to be more streamlined than infringement litigation. See Brief for Respondent 30 (quoting TTAB Manual \u00a7 402.01). But, the argument goes, if TTAB decisions can have issue-preclusive effect in infringement litigation, parties may spend more time and energy before the TTAB, thus bogging down the registration process. This concern does not change our conclusion. Issue preclusion is available unless it is \"evident,\"\n   <em>\n    Astoria, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 108, 111 S.Ct. 2166that Congress does not want it. Here, if a streamlined process in all registration matters was particularly dear to Congress, it would not have authorized\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   challenges for those \"dissatisfied\" with TTAB decisions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201071\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Plenary review serves many functions, but ensuring a streamlined process is not one of them. Moreover, as explained below, for a great many registration decisions issue preclusion obviously will not apply because the ordinary elements will not be met. For those registrations, nothing we say today is relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At last we turn to whether there is a categorical reason why registration decisions can never meet the ordinary elements of issue preclusion,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   those elements set out in \u00a7 27 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments. Although many registrations will not satisfy those ordinary elements, that does not mean that none will. We agree with Professor McCarthy that issue preclusion applies where \"the issues in the two cases are indeed identical and the other rules of collateral estoppel are carefully observed.\" 6 McCarthy \u00a7 32:99, at 32-244; see also 3 Gilson \u00a7 11.08[4][i][iii][B], p. 11-319 (\"Ultimately, Board decisions on likelihood of confusion ... should be given preclusive effect on a case-by-case basis\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Eighth Circuit's primary objection to issue preclusion was that the TTAB considers different factors than it does. Whereas the TTAB employs some or all of the\n   <em>\n    DuPont\n   </em>\n   factors to assess likelihood of confusion, the Eighth Circuit looks to similar, but not identical, factors identified in\n   <em>\n    SquirtCo v. Seven-Up Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292734\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1086/#p1091\">\n    628 F.2d 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1091 (C.A.8 1980). The court's instinct was sound: \"[I]ssues are not identical if the second action involves application of a different legal standard, even though the factual setting of both suits may be the same.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 4417, p. 449 (2d ed. 2002)(hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). Here, however, the same likelihood-of-confusion standard applies to both registration and infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To begin with, it does not matter that registration and infringement are governed by different statutory provisions. Often a single standard is placed in different statutes; that does not foreclose issue preclusion. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Bayer Corp.,\n   </em>\n   564 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450490,4335674\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2368/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2376,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450490,4335674\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2368/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Neither\n   does it matter that the TTAB and the Eighth Circuit use different factors to assess likelihood of confusion. For one thing, the factors are not fundamentally different, and \"[m]inor variations in the application of what is in essence the same legal standard do not defeat preclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----, n. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450490,4335674\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2368/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2378, n. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More important, if federal law provides a single standard, parties cannot escape preclusion simply by litigating anew in tribunals that apply that one standard differently. A contrary rule would encourage the very evils that issue preclusion helps to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The real question, therefore, is whether likelihood of confusion for purposes of registration is the same standard as likelihood of confusion for purposes of infringement. We conclude it is, for at least three reasons. First, the operative language is essentially the same; the fact that the registration provision separates \"likely\" from \"to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\" does not change that reality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See 2 Gilson \u00a7 5.01[2][a], at 5-17 (explaining that \"the same statutory test\" applies). Second, the likelihood-of-confusion language that Congress used in these Lanham Act provisions has been central to trademark registration since at least 1881. See Act of Mar. 3, 1881, ch. 138, \u00a7 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Stat.%20503\">\n    21 Stat. 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (using a \"likely to cause confusion\" standard for registration). That could hardly have been by accident. And third, district courts can cancel registrations during infringement litigation, just as they can adjudicate infringement in suits seeking judicial review of registration decisions. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201119\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 3 McCarthy \u00a7 21:20. There is no reason to think that the same district judge in the same case should apply two separate standards of likelihood of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Hargis responds that the text is not actually the same because the registration provision asks whether the marks \"resemble\" each other,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), while the infringement provision is directed towards the \"use in commerce\" of the marks, \u00a7 1114(1). Indeed, according to Hargis, the distinction between \"resembl[ance]\" and \"use\" has been key to trademark law for over a century. There is some force to this argument. It is true that \"a party opposing an application to register a mark before the Board often relies only on its federal registration, not on any common-law rights in usages not encompassed by its registration,\" and \"the Board typically analyzes the marks, goods, and channels of trade only as set forth in the application and in the opposer's registration, regardless of whether the actual usage of the marks by either party differs.\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   23; see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 5 (explaining that \"the Board typically reviews only the usages encompassed by the registration\") (citing 3 Gilson \u00a7 9.03[2][a][ii] ); 3 McCarthy \u00a7 20:15, at 20-45(explaining that for registration \"it is the mark as shown in the application and as used on the goods described in the application which must be considered, not the mark as actually used\"). This means\n   that unlike in infringement litigation, \"[t]he Board's determination that a likelihood of confusion does or does not exist will not resolve the confusion issue with respect to non-disclosed usages.\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Hargis' argument falls short, however, because it mistakes a reason not to apply issue preclusion in some or even many cases as a reason never to apply issue preclusion. Just because the TTAB does not always consider the\n   <em>\n    same usages\n   </em>\n   as a district court does, it does not follow that the Board applies a\n   <em>\n    different standard\n   </em>\n   to the usages it does consider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a mark owner uses its mark in ways that are materially the same as the usages included in its registration application, then the TTAB is deciding the same likelihood-of-confusion issue as a district court in infringement litigation. By contrast, if a mark owner uses its mark in ways that are materially unlike the usages in its application, then the TTAB is not deciding the same issue. Thus, if the TTAB does not consider the marketplace usage of the parties' marks, the TTAB's decision should \"have no later preclusive effect in a suit where actual usage in the marketplace is the paramount issue.\" 6 McCarthy \u00a7 32:101, at 32-246.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Materiality, of course, is essential-trivial variations between the usages set out in an application and the use of a mark in the marketplace do not create different \"issues,\" just as trivial variations do not create different \"marks.\" See generally 4\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 23:50, at 23-265 (explaining that \"adding descriptive or non-distinctive\" elements to another's mark generally will not negate confusion).

Cooper, Administrative Agencies and the Courts 241-242 (1951) (taking the position that agencies\n   \"are not courts, and their determinations are not judgments\"). This distinction stems from the Constitution itself, which vests the \"judicial Power\" not in administrative agencies, but in federal courts, whose independence is safeguarded by certain constitutional requirements. Art. III, \u00a7 1. One of the consequences of this allocation of judicial power is that agencies possess limited ability to act in a judicial capacity in cases resolving traditional disputes between private parties.

In\n   <em>\n    Pearson,\n   </em>\n   for example, this Court declined to recognize any preclusive effect of a decision of an immigration board.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646578\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/202/281/\">\n    202 U.S., at 284-285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646578\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/202/281/\">\n    26 S.Ct. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Writing for the Court, Justice Holmes explained that \"[t]he board is an instrument of the executive power, not a court\"; that it consisted of officials \"whose duties are declared to be administrative by\" statute; and that \"[d]ecisions of a similar type long have been recognized as decisions of the executive department, and cannot constitute\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   in a technical sense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646578\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/202/281/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Other courts likewise declined to apply general preclusion principles to decisions of administrative agencies. For example, as late as 1947, the D.C. Circuit would rely on the \"well settled doctrine that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and equitable estoppel do not ordinarily apply to decisions of administrative tribunals.\"\n   <em>\n    Churchill Tabernacle v.

It rejected the idea of any consistent practice in favor of administrative preclusion, noting that \"the question whether the decisions of a particular tribunal are binding in subsequent controversies depends upon the character of the tribunal and the nature of its procedure and the construction of the statute creating the tribunal and conferring powers upon it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1119509\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/160/244/#p246\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Consistent with that comment, federal courts approved of administrative preclusion in narrow circumstances arguably involving only claims against the Government, over which Congress exercises a broader measure of control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the 19th century, for instance, this Court effectively gave preclusive effect to the decisions of the U.S. Land Department with respect to land patents when it held such patents unreviewable in federal court \"for mere errors of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Smelting Co. v.

Commentators explained that these cases could not truly be understood to involve an application of res judicata or collateral estoppel-for, after all, administrative agencies are not courts-but rather a \"species of equitable estoppel.\" Cooper,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 242; see also 2 A. Freeman, Law of Judgments\n   \u00a7 633, p. 1335 (5th ed. rev. 1925) (explaining that \"the immunity from judicial review\" for certain administrative decisions was \"not based upon the doctrine of res judicata nor ... governed by exactly the same rules\"). As one commentator put it, res judicata could \"not apply, in any strict or technical sense, to the decisions of administrative agencies.\" Cooper,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 241.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   This history undercuts any suggestion in\n   <em>\n    Utah Construction\n   </em>\n   that administrative preclusion was widely accepted at common law. Accordingly, at least for statutes passed before\n   <em>\n    Astoria,\n   </em>\n   I would reject the presumption of administrative preclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In light of this history, I cannot agree with the majority's decision to apply administrative preclusion in the context of the Lanham Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   To start, the Lanham Act was enacted in 1946, 20 years before this Court said-even in dictum-that administrative preclusion was an established common-law principle. Thus, even if one thought that the dictum in\n   <em>\n    Utah Construction\n   </em>\n   were sufficient to establish a common-law principle in favor of preclusion, that conclusion would not warrant applying\n   <em>\n    Astoria\n   </em>\n   's presumption to this enactment from the 1940's. And, construing the Act on its own terms, I see no reason to conclude that Congress intended administrative preclusion to apply to TTAB findings of fact in a subsequent trademark infringement suit. The Act says nothing to indicate such an intent, and several features of the Act support the contrary inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The first feature indicating that Congress did not intend preclusion to apply is the limited authority the Act gives the TTAB. The Act authorizes the TTAB only to \"determine and decide the respective rights of [trademark] registration,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201067\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), thereby withholding any authority from the TTAB to \"determine the right to use\" a trademark or to \"decide broader questions of infringement or unfair competition,\" TTAB Manual of Procedure \u00a7 102.01 (2014). This limited job description indicates that TTAB's conclusions regarding registration were never meant to become decisive-through application of administrative preclusion-in subsequent\n   infringement suits. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(providing that registration of a mark \"shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark\" but \"shall not preclude another person from proving any legal or equitable defense or defect\"). Giving preclusive effect to the TTAB's decision on likelihood of confusion would be an end-run around the statutory limitation on its authority, as all parties agree that likelihood of confusion is the central issue in a subsequent infringement suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   A second indication that Congress did not intend administrative preclusion to apply is the Lanham Act's provision for judicial review. After the TTAB issues a registration decision, a party \"who is dissatisfied with the decision\" may either appeal to the Federal Circuit or file a civil action in district court seeking review. \u00a7\u00a7 1071(a)(1), (b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And it is undisputed that a civil action in district court would entail\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the TTAB's decision.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1300 - 1301. Although under ordinary preclusion principles \"the failure to pursue an appeal does not undermine issue preclusion,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1305, the availability of\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   judicial review of an administrative decision does. That is true both because the judicial review afforded by the Act marks the first opportunity for consideration of the issue by an Article III court and because Congress has deviated from the usual practice of affording deference to the factfindings of an initial tribunal in affording\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the TTAB's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The decision to provide this\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review is even more striking in light of the historical background of the choice: Congress passed the Lanham Act the same year it passed the Administrative Procedure Act, following a lengthy period of disagreement in the courts about what deference administrative findings of fact were entitled to receive on direct review. The issue had been the subject of debate for over 50 years, with varying results. See generally 2 J. Dickinson, Administrative Justice and the Supremacy of Law 39-75 (1927).

Humphries,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673844\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/442/#p469\">\n     553 U.S. 442\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 469-470,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673844\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/442/#p469\">\n     128 S.Ct. 1951\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673844\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/442/#p469\">\n     170 L.Ed.2d 864\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008)(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\"\n    <em>\n     [S]tare decisis,\n    </em>\n    designed to be a principle of stability or repose, [should not] become a vehicle of change whereby an error in one area metastasizes into others, thereby distorting the law\"). As for the parties' lack of argument, I would not treat tools of statutory interpretation as claims that can be forfeited. If, for example, one party peppered its brief with legislative history, and the opposing party did not challenge the propriety of using legislative history, I still would not consider myself bound to rely upon it. The same is true here: Although the Court has commented in the past that the presumption of administrative preclusion would apply to other statutes, we are not bound to apply it now to the Lanham Act, even if the parties have assumed we would.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The original 1946 Lanham Act provided for appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
