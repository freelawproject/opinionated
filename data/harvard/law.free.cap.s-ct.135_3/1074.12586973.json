A fish is no doubt an object that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, and handled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable to destruction. But it would cut \u00a7 1519loose from its financial-fraud mooring to hold that it encompasses any and all objects, whatever their size or significance, destroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and accounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a matching construction of \u00a7 1519is in order: A tangible object captured by \u00a7 1519, we hold, must be one used to record or preserve information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 23, 2007, the\n   <em>\n    Miss Katie,\n   </em>\n   a commercial fishing boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of Mexico. Her crew numbered three, including Yates, the captain. Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect both recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John Jones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission decided to board the\n   <em>\n    Miss Katie\n   </em>\n   to check on the vessel's compliance with fishing rules. Although the\n   <em>\n    Miss Katie\n   </em>\n   was far enough from the Florida coast to be in exclusively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer Jones's jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a federal agent by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Officer Jones had authority to enforce federal, as well as state, fishing laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Upon boarding the\n   <em>\n    Miss Katie,\n   </em>\n   Officer Jones noticed three red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging from a hook on the deck. At the time, federal conservation regulations required immediate release of red grouper less than 20 inches long.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20622.37\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 622.37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(ii)(effective April 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil offense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201857\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on board, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship's catch, setting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to him to be shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones ultimately determined that 72 fish fell short of the 20-inch mark. A fellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized fish on a catch measurement verification form. With few exceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20 inches; three were less than 19 inches; none were less than 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring below 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them in wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the fish, thus segregated, in the crates until the\n   <em>\n    Miss Katie\n   </em>\n   returned to port. Before departing, Officer Jones issued Yates a citation for possession of undersized fish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Four days later, after the\n   <em>\n    Miss Katie\n   </em>\n   had docked in Cortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained in the wooden crates. This time, however, the measured fish, although still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded the lengths recorded on board. Jones surmised that the fish brought to port were not the same as those he had detected during his initial inspection. Under questioning, one of the crew members admitted that, at Yates's direction, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had measured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the tossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more than 32 months passed before criminal charges were lodged against Yates. On May 5, 2010, he was indicted for destroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in violation of \u00a7 2232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in violation of \u00a7 1519.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the time of the indictment, the minimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been lowered from 20 inches to 18 inches. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20622.37\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 622.37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(iv)(effective May 18, 2009). No measured fish in Yates's catch fell below that limit. The record does not reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his possession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201858\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011. At the end of the Government's case in chief, he moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \u00a7 1519charge. Pointing to \u00a7 1519's title and its origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets forth \"a documents offense\" and that its reference to \"tangible object[s]\" subsumes \"computer hard drives, logbooks, [and] things of that nature,\" not fish. App. 91-92. Yates acknowledged that the Criminal Code contains \"sections that would have been appropriate for the [G]overnment to pursue\" if it wished to prosecute him for tampering with evidence. App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, fit that description. But \u00a7 1519, Yates insisted, did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Government countered that a \"tangible object\" within \u00a7 1519's compass is \"simply something other than a document or record.\" App. 93. The trial judge expressed misgivings about reading \"tangible object\" as broadly as the Government urged: \"Isn't there a Latin phrase [about] construction of a statute.... The gist of it is ... you take a look at [a] line of words, and you interpret the words consistently. So if you're talking about documents, and records, tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature of a document or a record, as opposed to a fish.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The first-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent. While recognizing that \u00a7 1519was passed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the Court of Appeals had instructed that \"the broad language of \u00a7 1519is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and 'Congress is free to pass laws with language covering areas well beyond the particular crisis\n   <em>\n    du jour\n   </em>\n   that initially prompted legislative action.' \" No. 2:10-cr-66-FtM-29SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hunt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577285\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/739/#p744\">\n    526 F.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (C.A.11 2008)). Accordingly, the trial court read \"tangible object\" as a term \"independent\" of \"record\" or \"document.\" App. 116. For violating \u00a7 1519and \u00a7 2232(a), the court sentenced Yates to imprisonment for\n   30 days, followed by supervised release for three years. App. 118-120. For life, he will bear the stigma of having a federal felony conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of \u00a7 1519 \"plain.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713869\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/1059/#p1064\">\n    733 F.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1064 (2013).

The Government acknowledges that \u00a7 1519was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing. Brief for United States 46. Prior law made it an offense to \"intimidat[e], threate[n], or corruptly persuad[e]\n   <em>\n    another person\n   </em>\n   \" to shred documents. \u00a7 1512(b) (emphasis added). Section 1519cured a conspicuous omission by imposing liability on a person who destroys records himself. See S.Rep. No. 107-146, p. 14(2002) (describing \u00a7 1519as \"a new general anti shredding provision\" and explaining that \"certain current provisions make it a crime to persuade another person to destroy documents, but not a crime to actually destroy the same documents yourself\"). The new section also expanded prior law by including within the provision's reach \"any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the Government's view, \u00a7 1519extends beyond the principal evil motivating its passage. The words of \u00a7 1519, the Government argues, support reading the provision as a general ban on the spoliation of evidence, covering all physical items that might be relevant to any matter under federal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Yates urges a contextual reading of \u00a7 1519, tying \"tangible object\" to the surrounding words, the placement of the provision within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related provisions enacted at the same time, in particular \u00a7 1520 and \u00a7 1512(c)(1), see\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   at 1083, 1084 - 1085. Section 1519, he maintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but records, documents, and tangible objects used to preserve them,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   computers, servers, and other media on which information is stored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We agree with Yates and reject the Government's unrestrained reading. \"Tangible object\" in \u00a7 1519, we conclude, is better read to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ordinary meaning of an \"object\" that is \"tangible,\" as stated in dictionary definitions, is \"a discrete ... thing,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1555 (2002), that \"possess[es] physical form,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014). From this premise, the Government concludes that \"tangible object,\" as that term appears in \u00a7 1519, covers the waterfront, including fish from the sea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however, does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words. Rather, \"[t]he plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined\n   [not only] by reference to the language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

That Rule requires the prosecution to\n   grant a defendant's request to inspect \"tangible objects\" within the Government's control that have utility for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rule 16's reference to \"tangible objects\" has been interpreted to include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 20.3(g), pp. 405-406, and n. 120 (3d ed. 2007). Rule 16is a discovery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the prosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material to the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive construction of \"tangible objects\" is fitting. In contrast, \u00a7 1519is a penal provision that refers to \"tangible object\" not in relation to a request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of every kind, including those not yet begun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commissioner v.

(\"words are chameleons, which reflect the color of their environment\"). Just as the context of Rule 16supports giving \"tangible object\" a meaning as broad as its dictionary definition, the context of \u00a7 1519tugs strongly in favor of a narrower reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the words \"tangible object\" as they appear in \u00a7 1519.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We note first \u00a7 1519's caption: \"Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.\" That heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records. Neither does the title of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which \u00a7 1519was placed, \u00a7 802: \"Criminal penalties for altering documents.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20800\">\n    116 Stat. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, \u00a7 1520, the only other provision passed as part of \u00a7 802, is titled \"Destruction of corporate audit records\" and addresses only that specific subset of records and documents. While these headings are not commanding, they supply cues that Congress did not intend \"tangible object\" in \u00a7 1519to sweep within its reach physical objects of every kind, including things no one would describe as records, documents, or devices closely associated with them.

Congress placed \u00a7 1519(and its companion provision \u00a7 1520) at the end of the chapter, following immediately after the pre-existing \u00a7 1516, \u00a7 1517, and \u00a7 1518, each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific contexts. See \u00a7 1516 (audits of recipients of federal funds); \u00a7 1517 (federal examinations of financial institutions); \u00a7 1518 (criminal investigations of federal health care offenses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   See also S.Rep. No. 107-146, at 7(observing that \u00a7 1517 and \u00a7 1518 \"apply to obstruction in certain limited types of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud, examinations of financial institutions, and healthcare fraud\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But Congress did not direct codification of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's other additions to Chapter 73 adjacent to these specialized provisions. Instead, Congress directed placement of those additions within or alongside retained provisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to official proceedings and criminal trials: Section 806, \"Civil Action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,\" was codified as \u00a7 1514A and inserted between the pre-existing \u00a7 1514, which addresses civil actions to restrain harassment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and \u00a7 1515, which defines terms used in \u00a7 1512 and \u00a7 1513. Section 1102, \"Tampering with a record or otherwise impeding an official proceeding,\" was codified as \u00a7 1512(c) and inserted within the pre-existing \u00a7 1512, which addresses tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to impede any official proceeding. Section 1107, \"Retaliation against informants,\" was codified as \u00a7 1513(e) and inserted within the pre-existing \u00a7 1513, which addresses retaliation against a victim, witness, or informant in any official proceeding. Congress thus ranked \u00a7 1519, not among the broad proscriptions, but together with specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits. This placement accords with the view that Congress' conception of \u00a7 1519's coverage was considerably more limited than the Government's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The contemporaneous passage of \u00a7 1512(c)(1), which was contained in a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discrete from the section embracing \u00a7 1519and \u00a7 1520, is also instructive. Section 1512(c)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"(c) Whoever corruptly-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   . . . . .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The legislative history reveals that \u00a7 1512(c)(1) was drafted and proposed after \u00a7 1519. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518, 13088-13089 (2002). The Government argues, and Yates does not dispute, that \u00a7 1512(c)(1)'s reference to \"other object\" includes any and every physical object. But if \u00a7 1519's reference to \"tangible object\" already included all physical objects, as the Government and the dissent contend, then Congress had no reason to enact \u00a7 1512(c)(1): Virtually any act that would violate \u00a7 1512(c)(1) no doubt would violate \u00a7 1519as well, for \u00a7 1519applies to \"the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United\n   States ... or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter,\" not just to \"an official proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Government acknowledges that, under its reading, \u00a7 1519and \u00a7 1512(c)(1)\"significantly overlap.\" Brief for United States 49. Nowhere does the Government explain what independent function \u00a7 1512(c)(1)would serve if the Government is right about the sweeping scope of \u00a7 1519.

See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014) (\" 'Records, documents, or\n   tangible objects' includes (A) records, documents, or tangible objects that are stored on, or that are, magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, or other storage mediums or devices; and (B) wire or electronic communications.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This moderate interpretation of \"tangible object\" accords with the list of actions \u00a7 1519proscribes. The section applies to anyone who \"alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up,\n   <em>\n    falsifies,\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    makes a false entry in\n   </em>\n   any record, document, or tangible object\" with the requisite obstructive intent. (Emphasis added.) The last two verbs, \"falsif[y]\" and \"mak[e] a false entry in,\" typically take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"falsify\" as \"[t]o make deceptive; to counterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a document, record, etc.)\"). It would be unnatural, for example, to describe a killer's act of wiping his fingerprints from a gun as \"falsifying\" the murder weapon. But it would not be strange to refer to \"falsifying\" data stored on a hard drive as simply \"falsifying\" a hard drive. Furthermore, Congress did not include on \u00a7 1512(c)(1)'s list of prohibited actions \"falsifies\" or \"makes a false entry in.\" See \u00a7 1512(c)(1)(making it unlawful to \"alte[r], destro [y], mutilat[e], or concea[l] a record, document, or other object\" with the requisite obstructive intent).

The MPC provision and proposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on anyone who \"alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or removes a record, document or thing.\" See ALI, MPC \u00a7 241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were understood to refer to all physical evidence. See MPC \u00a7 241.7, Comment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision \"applies to any physical object\"). Accordingly, the Government reasons, and the dissent exuberantly agrees,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, Congress must have intended \u00a7 1519to apply to the universe of physical evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC provision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical evidence. But unlike \u00a7 1519, the MPC provision did not prohibit actions that specifically relate to records, documents, and objects used to record or preserve information. The MPC provision also ranked the offense as a misdemeanor and limited liability to instances in which the actor \"believ[es] that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted.\" MPC \u00a7 241.7(1), at 175.

And though the question is close, traditional tools of statutory construction confirm that John Yates has the better of the argument. Three features of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519stand out to me: the statute's list of nouns, its list of verbs, and its title. Although perhaps none of these features by itself would tip the case in favor of Yates, the three combined do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Start with the nouns. Section 1519refers to \"any record, document, or tangible object.\" The\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   canon instructs that when a statute contains a list, each word in that list presumptively has a \"similar\" meaning. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1330581\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/561/#p575\">\n    513 U.S. 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1330581\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/561/#p575\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1330581\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/561/#p575\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). A related canon,\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   teaches that general words following a list of specific words should usually be read in light of those specific words to mean something \"similar.\" See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n   </em>\n   567 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p2171\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2171,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p2171\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Applying these canons to \u00a7 1519's list of nouns, the term \"tangible object\" should refer to something similar to records or documents. A fish does not spring to mind-nor does an antelope, a colonial farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an oil derrick. All are \"objects\" that are \"tangible.\" But who wouldn't raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to identify something similar to a \"record\" or \"document,\" said \"crocodile\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For instance, this is an imperfect\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   case because \"record\" and \"document\" are themselves quite general. And there is a risk that \"tangible object\" may be made superfluous-what is similar to a \"record\" or \"document\" but yet is not one? An e-mail, however, could be such a thing. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2J1.2and comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading \"records, documents, or tangible objects\" to \"includ[e]\" what is found on \"magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, or other storage mediums or devices\"). An e-mail, after all, might not be a \"document\" if, as was \"traditionally\" so, a document was a \"piece of paper with information on it,\" not \"information stored on a computer, electronic storage device, or any other medium.\" Black's Law Dictionary 587-588 (10th ed. 2014). E-mails might also not be \"records\" if records are limited to \"minutes\" or other formal writings \"designed to memorialize [past] events.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1465. A hard drive, however, is tangible and can contain files that are precisely akin to even these narrow definitions. Both \"record\" and \"document\" can be read more expansively, but adding \"tangible object\" to \u00a7 1519would ensure beyond question that electronic files are included. To be sure, \"tangible object\" presumably can capture more than just e-mails; Congress enacts \"catchall[s]\" for \"known unknowns.\"\n   <em>\n    Republic of Iraq v. Beaty,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653654\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/848/#p860\">\n    556 U.S. 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653654\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/848/#p860\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653654\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/848/#p860\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). But where\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   apply, \"known unknowns\" should be similar to known knowns,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   here, records and documents. This is especially true because reading \"tangible object\" too broadly could render \"record\" and \"document\" superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, consider \u00a7 1519's list of verbs: \"alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although many of those verbs could apply to nouns as far-flung as salamanders, satellites, or sand dunes, the last phrase in the list-\"makes a false entry in\"-makes no sense outside of filekeeping. How does one make a false entry in a fish? \"Alters\" and especially \"falsifies\" are also closely associated with filekeeping. Not one of the verbs, moreover,\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be applied to filekeeping-certainly not in the way that \"makes a false entry in\" is always inconsistent with the aquatic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Again, the Government is not without a response. One can imagine Congress trying to write a law so broadly that not every verb lines up with every noun. But failure to \"line up\" may suggest that something has gone awry in one's interpretation of a text. Where, as here, each of a statute's verbs applies to a certain category of nouns, there is some reason to think that Congress had that category in mind. Categories, of course, are often underinclusive or overinclusive-\u00a7 1519, for instance, applies to a bomb-threatening letter but not a bomb. But this does not mean that categories are not useful or that Congress does not enact them. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vance v. Bradley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179984\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/93/#p108\">\n    440 U.S. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108-109,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179984\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/93/#p108\">\n    99 S.Ct. 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179984\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/93/#p108\">\n    59 L.Ed.2d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). Here, focusing on the verbs, the category of nouns appears to be filekeeping. This observation is not dispositive, but neither is it nothing. The Government also contends that \u00a7 1519's verbs cut both ways because it is unnatural to apply \"falsifies\" to tangible objects, and that is certainly true. One does not falsify the outside casing of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data physically recorded on that hard drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, my analysis is influenced by \u00a7 1519's title: \"Destruction, alteration, or falsification of\n   <em>\n    records\n   </em>\n   in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.\" (Emphasis added.) This too points toward filekeeping, not fish. Titles can be useful devices to resolve \" 'doubt about the meaning of a statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

The title is especially valuable here because it reinforces what the text's nouns and verbs independently suggest-that no matter how other statutes might be read, this particular one does not cover every noun in the universe with tangible form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the list of nouns did not already suggest that \"tangible object\" should mean something similar to records or documents, especially when read in conjunction with \u00a7 1519's peculiar list of verbs with their focus on filekeeping, then the title would not be enough on its own. In conjunction with those other two textual features, however, the Government's argument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to accept.

This case\n   raises the question whether the term \"tangible object\" means the same thing in \u00a7 1519as it means in everyday language-any object capable of being touched. The answer should be easy: Yes. The term \"tangible object\" is broad, but clear. Throughout the U.S. Code and many States' laws, it invariably covers physical objects of all kinds. And in \u00a7 1519, context confirms what bare text says: All the words surrounding \"tangible object\" show that Congress meant the term to have a wide range. That fits with Congress's evident purpose in enacting \u00a7 1519: to punish those who alter or destroy physical evidence-\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   physical evidence-with the intent of thwarting federal law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The plurality instead interprets \"tangible object\" to cover \"only objects one can use to record or preserve information.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1081. The concurring opinion similarly, if more vaguely, contends that \"tangible object\" should refer to \"something similar to records or documents\"-and shouldn't include colonial farmhouses, crocodiles, or fish.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). In my view, conventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a more conventional result: A \"tangible object\" is an object that's tangible. I would apply the statute that Congress enacted and affirm the judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While the plurality starts its analysis with \u00a7 1519's heading, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1083 (\"We note first \u00a7 1519's caption\"), I would begin with \u00a7 1519's text. When Congress has not supplied a definition, we generally give a statutory term its ordinary meaning. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schindler Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel.

So the ordinary meaning of the term \"tangible object\" in \u00a7 1519, as no one here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red grouper).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   That interpretation accords with endless uses of the term in statute and rule books as construed by courts. Dozens of federal laws and rules of procedure (and hundreds of state enactments) include the term \"tangible object\" or its first cousin \"tangible thing\"-some in association with documents, others not.

Section 1512, both in its original version (preceding \u00a7 1519) and today, repeatedly uses the phrase \"record, document, or other object\"-most notably, in a provision prohibiting the use of force or threat to induce another person to withhold any of those materials from an official proceeding. \u00a7 4(a) of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Stat.%201249\">\n    96 Stat. 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

Context thus again confirms what text indicates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts extra icing on a cake already frosted. Section 1519, as the plurality notes, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1079, 1081, was enacted after the Enron Corporation's collapse, as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20745\">\n    116 Stat. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

S.Rep. No. 107-146, pp. 2, 11(2002). The primary \"loophole[ ]\" Congress identified, see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 14, arose from limits in the part of \u00a7 1512just described: That provision, as uniformly construed, prohibited a person from inducing another to destroy \"record[s], document[s], or other object[s]\"-of every type-but not from doing so himself. \u00a7 1512(b)(2); see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1093. Congress (as even the plurality agrees, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1081) enacted \u00a7 1519to close that yawning gap. But \u00a7 1519could fully achieve that goal only if it covered all the records, documents, and objects \u00a7 1512did, as well as all the means of tampering with them. And so \u00a7 1519was written to do exactly that-\"to apply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical evidence,\" as long as performed with the\n   requisite intent. S.Rep.

A person who hides a murder victim's body is no less culpable than one who burns the victim's diary. A fisherman, like John Yates, who dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less blameworthy than one who shreds his vessel's catch log for the same reason. Congress thus treated both offenders in the same way.

Presumably, the plurality would not refuse to apply \u00a7 1519when a person only conceals evidence rather than destroying, altering, or falsifying it; instead, the plurality would say that a title is just a title, which cannot \"undo or limit\" more specific statutory text.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Trainmen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    331 U.S., at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

But that move is yet odder than the last. As far as I can tell, this Court has never once suggested that the section number assigned to a law bears upon its meaning. Cf. Scalia,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at xi-xvi (listing more than 50 interpretive principles and canons without mentioning the plurality's new number-in-the-Code theory). And even on its own terms, the plurality's argument is hard to fathom. The plurality claims that if \u00a7 1519applied to objects generally, Congress would not have placed it \"after the pre-existing \u00a7 1516, \u00a7 1517, and \u00a7 1518\" because those are \"specialized provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1084. But search me if I can find a better place for a broad ban on evidence-tampering. The plurality seems to agree that the law properly goes in Chapter 73-the criminal code's chapter on \"obstruction of justice.\" But the provision does not logically fit into any of that chapter's pre-existing sections. And with the first 18 numbers of the chapter already taken (starting with \u00a7 1501 and continuing through \u00a7 1518), the law naturally took the 19th place. That is standard operating procedure. Prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all of Chapter 73 was ordered chronologically: Section 1518 was later enacted than \u00a7 1517, which was later enacted than \u00a7 1516, which was ... well, you get the idea. And after Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress has continued in the same vein. Section 1519is thus right where you would expect it (as is the contemporaneously passed \u00a7 1520)-between \u00a7 1518 (added in 1996) and \u00a7 1521 (added in 2008).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The plurality's third argument, relying on the surplusage canon, at least invokes a known tool of statutory construction-but it too comes to nothing. Says the plurality: If read naturally, \u00a7 1519\"would render superfluous\" \u00a7 1512(c)(1), which Congress passed \"as part of the same act.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1085. But that is not so: Although the two provisions significantly overlap, each applies to conduct the other does not. The key difference between the two is that \u00a7 1519protects the integrity of \"matter [s] within the jurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency\" whereas \u00a7 1512(c)(1)safeguards \"official proceeding[s]\" as defined in \u00a7 1515(a)(1)(A). Section 1519's language often applies more broadly than \u00a7 1512(c)(1)'s, as the plurality notes. For example, an FBI investigation counts as a matter within a federal department's jurisdiction, but falls outside the statutory definition of \"official proceeding\" as construed by courts. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gabriel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910585\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/89/#p105\">\n    125 F.3d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105, n. 13 (C.A.2 1997). But conversely, \u00a7 1512(c)(1)sometimes reaches more widely than \u00a7 1519. For example, because an \"official proceeding\" includes any \"proceeding before a judge or court of the United States,\" \u00a7 1512(c)(1)prohibits tampering with evidence in federal litigation between private parties. See \u00a7 1515(a)(1)(A);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

By contrast, \u00a7 1519wouldn't ordinarily operate in that context because\n   a federal court isn't a \"department or agency.\" See\n   <em>\n    Hubbard v.

Germain,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225793\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/249/#p253\">\n    503 U.S. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6513849,6225793\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/1146/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225793\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/249/#p253\">\n    117 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   And the legislative history to which the plurality appeals, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1081, only cuts against it because those materials show that lawmakers knew that \u00a7 1519and \u00a7 1512(c)(1)share much common ground. Minority Leader Lott introduced the amendment that included \u00a7 1512(c)(1)(along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions) late in the legislative process, explaining that he did so at the specific request of the President. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12509, 12512 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Lott). Not only Lott but several other Senators noted the overlap between the President's package and provisions already in the bill, most notably \u00a7 1519. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 12512 (remarks of Sen. Lott);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 12513 (remarks of Sen. Biden);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 12517 (remarks of Sens. Hatch and Gramm). The presence of both \u00a7 1519 and \u00a7 1512(c)(1) in the final Act may have reflected belt-and-suspenders caution: If \u00a7 1519contained some flaw, \u00a7 1512(c)(1)would serve as a backstop. Or the addition of \u00a7 1512(c)(1)may have derived solely from legislators' wish \"to satisfy audiences other than courts\"-that is, the President and his Justice Department. Gluck &amp; Bressman, Statutory Interpretation from the Inside,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Stan.%20L.%20Rev.%20901\">\n    65 Stan. L.Rev. 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935 (2013)(emphasis deleted). Whichever the case, Congress's consciousness of overlap between the two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast aside \u00a7 1519's ordinary meaning in service of preventing some statutory repetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Indeed, the inclusion of \u00a7 1512(c)(1)in Sarbanes-Oxley creates a far worse problem for the plurality's construction of \u00a7 1519than for mine. Section 1512(c)(1)criminalizes the destruction of any \"record, document, or other object\"; \u00a7 1519of any \"record, document, or tangible object.\" On the plurality's view, one \"object\" is really an object, whereas the other is only an object that preserves or stores information. But \"[t]he normal rule of statutory construction assumes that identical words used in different parts of the same act,\" passed at the same time, \"are intended to have the same meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Sorenson v.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Treasury,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210455\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/851/#p860\">\n    475 U.S. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210455\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/851/#p860\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210455\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/851/#p860\">\n    89 L.Ed.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986)(internal quotation marks omitted). And that is especially true when the different provisions pertain to the same subject. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1083. The plurality doesn't-really, can't-explain why it instead interprets the same words used in two provisions of the same Act addressing the same basic problem to mean fundamentally different things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches canons, hoping that\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   will save it. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1085 - 1087; see also\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The first of those related canons advises that words grouped in a list be given similar meanings. The second counsels that a general term following specific words embraces only things of a similar kind. According to the plurality, those Latin maxims change the English meaning of \"tangible object\" to only things, like records and documents, \"used to record or preserve information.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1085.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But understood as this Court always has, the canons have no such transformative effect on the workaday language Congress chose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As an initial matter, this Court uses\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   to resolve ambiguity, not create it.

But when words have a clear definition, and all other contextual clues support that meaning, the canons cannot properly defeat Congress's decision to draft broad legislation. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ali,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p219\">\n    552 U.S., at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p219\">\n    128 S.Ct. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the invocation of these canons as an \"attempt to create ambiguity where the statute's text and structure suggest none\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Anyway, assigning \"tangible object\" its ordinary meaning comports with\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   when applied, as they should be, with attention to \u00a7 1519's subject and purpose. Those canons require identifying a common trait that links all the words in a statutory phrase. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447670,3581774\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/280/\">\n    559 U.S. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289, n. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447670,3581774\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/280/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581774,12447670\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/225/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010);\n   <em>\n    Ali,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p219\">\n    552 U.S., at 224-226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p219\">\n    128 S.Ct. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In responding to that demand, the plurality characterizes records and documents as things that preserve information-and so they are. But just as much, they are things that provide information, and thus potentially serve as evidence relevant to matters under review. And in a statute pertaining to obstruction of federal investigations, that evidentiary function comes to the fore. The destruction of records and documents prevents law enforcement agents from gathering facts relevant to official inquiries. And so too does the destruction of tangible objects-of whatever\n   kind. Whether the item is a fisherman's ledger or an undersized fish, throwing it overboard has the identical effect on the administration of justice. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1094. For purposes of \u00a7 1519, records, documents, and (all) tangible objects are therefore alike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Indeed, even the plurality can't fully credit its\n   <em>\n    noscitur\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    ejusdem\n   </em>\n   argument. The same reasoning would apply to\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   law placing the word \"object\" (or \"thing\") after \"record\" and \"document.\" But as noted earlier, such statutes are common: The phrase appears (among other places) in many state laws based on the Model Penal Code, as well as in multiple provisions of \u00a7 1512. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1092 - 1093. The plurality accepts that in those laws \"object\" means object; its argument about superfluity positively\n   <em>\n    depends\n   </em>\n   on giving \u00a7 1512(c)(1)that broader reading. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1085, 1087. What, then, is the difference here? The plurality proposes that some of those statutes describe less serious offenses than \u00a7 1519. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1087. How and why that distinction affects application of the\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   canons is left obscure: Count it as one more of the plurality's never-before-propounded, not-readily-explained interpretive theories. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1094, 1094 - 1095, 1096 - 1097. But in any event, that rationale cannot support the plurality's willingness to give \"object\" its natural meaning in \u00a7 1512, which (like \u00a7 1519) sets out felonies with penalties of up to 20 years. See \u00a7\u00a7 1512(a)(3)(C), (b), (c). The canons, in the plurality's interpretive world, apparently switch on and off whenever convenient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   And the plurality's invocation of \u00a7 1519's verbs does nothing to buttress its canon-based argument. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1085 - 1086;\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089 - 1090 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The plurality observes that \u00a7 1519prohibits \"falsif[ying]\" or \"mak[ing] a false entry in\" a tangible object, and no one can do those things to, say, a murder weapon (or a fish).\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1085. But of course someone can alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, or cover up such a tangible object, and \u00a7 1519prohibits those actions too. The Court has never before suggested that all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all the nouns. See\n   <em>\n    Robers v. United States,\n   </em>\n   572 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707000,12580250\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1854/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1858,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707000,12580250\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1854/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014)(\"[T]he law does not require legislators to write extra language specifically exempting, phrase by phrase, applications in respect to which a portion of a phrase is not needed\"). And for good reason. It is exactly when Congress sets out to draft a statute broadly-to include every imaginable variation on a theme-that such mismatches will arise.

No such doubt lingers here. The plurality points to the breadth of \u00a7 1519, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1087, as though breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is not. Section 1519\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   very broad. It is also very clear. Every traditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the same direction, toward \"object\" meaning object. Lenity offers no\n   proper refuge from that straightforward (even though capacious) construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The concurring opinion is a shorter, vaguer version of the plurality's. It relies primarily on the\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   canons, tries to bolster them with \u00a7 1519's \"list of verbs,\" and concludes with the section's title. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1094, 1097 - 1098, 1098 (addressing each of those arguments). (Notably, even the concurrence puts no stock in the plurality's section-number and superfluity claims.) From those familiar materials, the concurrence arrives at the following definition: \" 'tangible object' should mean something similar to records or documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1090 (opinion of ALITO, J.). In amplifying that purported guidance, the concurrence suggests applying the term \"tangible object\" in keeping with what \"a neighbor, when asked to identify something similar to record or document,\" might answer.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089. \"[W]ho wouldn't raise an eyebrow,\" the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said \"crocodile\"?\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089. Courts sometimes say, when explaining the Latin maxims, that the \"words of a statute should be interpreted consistent with their neighbors.\" See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Locke,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508214\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/89/#p105\">\n    529 U.S. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508214\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/89/#p105\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508214\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/89/#p105\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). The concurrence takes that expression literally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   But \u00a7 1519's meaning should not hinge on the odd game of Mad Libs the concurrence proposes. No one reading \u00a7 1519needs to fill in a blank after the words \"records\" and \"documents.\" That is because Congress, quite helpfully, already did so-adding the term \"tangible object.\" The issue in this case is what that term means. So if the concurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I'd recommend a more pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the concurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a \"tangible object\"? As to that query, \"who wouldn't raise an eyebrow\" if the neighbor said \"no\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In insisting on its different question, the concurrence neglects the proper function of catchall phrases like \"or tangible object.\" The reason Congress uses such terms is precisely to reach things that, in the concurrence's words, \"do[ ] not spring to mind\"-to my mind, to my neighbor's, or (most important) to Congress's.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089 (opinion of ALITO, J.). As this Court recently explained: \"[T]he whole value of a generally phrased residual [term] is that it serves as a catchall for matters not specifically contemplated-known unknowns.\"\n   <em>\n    Beaty,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653654\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/848/#p860\">\n    556 U.S., at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653654\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/848/#p860\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress realizes that in a game of free association with \"record\" and \"document,\" it will never think of all the other things-including crocodiles and fish-whose destruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as effectively) thwart law enforcement. Cf.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stubbs,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11317662\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/632/#p637\">\n    11 F.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 637-638 (C.A.6 1993)(dead crocodiles used as\n   evidence to support smuggling conviction). And so Congress adds the general term \"or tangible object\"-again, exactly because such things \"do[ ] not spring to mind.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The concurrence suggests that the term \"tangible object\" serves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to \"ensure beyond question\" that e-mails and other electronic files fall within \u00a7 1519's compass.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089. But that claim is eyebrow-raising in its own right. Would a Congress wishing to make certain that \u00a7 1519applies to e-mails add the phrase \"tangible object\" (as opposed, say, to \"electronic communications\")? Would a judge or jury member predictably find that \"tangible object\" encompasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say, with something as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer is not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe for e-mails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The concurrence acknowledges that no one of its arguments can carry the day; rather, it takes the Latin canons plus \u00a7 1519's verbs plus \u00a7 1519's title to \"tip the case\" for Yates.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1089. But the sum total of three mistaken arguments is ... three mistaken arguments. They do not get better in the combining. And so the concurrence ends up right where the plurality does, except that the concurrence, eschewing the rule of lenity, has nothing to fall back on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   If none of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation can produce today's result, then what accounts for it? The plurality offers a clue when it emphasizes the disproportionate penalties \u00a7 1519imposes if the law is read broadly. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1087 - 1088. Section 1519, the plurality objects, would then \"expose[ ] individuals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   physical object that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have evidentiary value in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   federal investigation into\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1088. That brings to the surface the real issue: overcriminalization and excessive punishment in the U.S. Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Now as to this statute, I think the plurality somewhat-though only somewhat-exaggerates the matter. The plurality omits from its description of \u00a7 1519the requirement that a person act \"knowingly\" and with \"the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence\" federal law enforcement. And in highlighting \u00a7 1519's maximum penalty, the plurality glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum. (Let's not forget that Yates's sentence was not 20 years, but 30 days.) Congress presumably enacts laws with high maximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited conduct may run the gamut from major to minor. That is assuredly true of acts obstructing justice. Compare this case with the following, all of which properly come within, but now fall outside, \u00a7 1519:\n   <em>\n    McRae,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645907\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/806/#p834\">\n    702 F.3d, at 834-838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (burning human body to thwart murder investigation);\n   <em>\n    Maury,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528189\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/227/#p243\">\n    695 F.3d, at 243-244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (altering cement mixer to impede inquiry into amputation of employee's fingers);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Most district judges, as Congress knows, will recognize differences between such cases and prosecutions like this one,\n   and will try to make the punishment fit the crime. Still and all, I tend to think, for the reasons the plurality gives, that \u00a7 1519is a bad law-too broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum penalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and sentencers too much discretion.

Notably, in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress added \u00a7 1512(c)(1), \"a broad ban on evidence-spoliation,\" cf.\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1095, n. 2, to \u00a7 1512, even though \u00a7 1512's preexisting title and provisions all related to witness-tampering.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Despite this sweeping \"in relation to\" language, the dissent remarkably suggests that \u00a7 1519does not \"ordinarily operate in th[e] context [of] federal court[s],\" for those courts are not \"department[s] or agenc[ies].\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1095.

See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Ala.Code \u00a7 34-17-1(3) (2010)(defining \"landscape architecture\" to include the design of certain \"tangible objects and features\"); Alaska Rule Civ. Proc. 34(a)(1) (2014) (allowing litigants to \"inspect, copy, test, or sample any tangible things\" that constitute or contain discoverable material);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20804.09\">\n     Wis. Stat. \u00a7 804.09\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1)(2014) (requiring the production of \"designated tangible things\" in civil proceedings); Wyo. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(h)(2014) (defining \"property\" for purposes of a search-and-seizure statute to include \"documents, books, papers and any other tangible objects\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The lonesome exception to Chapter 73's chronological order is \u00a7 1514A, added in Sarbanes-Oxley to create a civil action to protect whistleblowers. Congress decided to place that provision right after the only other section in Chapter 73 to authorize a civil action (that one to protect victims and witnesses). The plurality, seizing on the \u00a7 1514 example, says it likewise \"would have made more sense for Congress to codify the substance of \u00a7 1519within \u00a7 1512or in a new \u00a7 1512A.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1084, n. 4. But \u00a7 1512is titled \"Tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant,\" and its provisions almost all protect witnesses from intimidation and harassment. It makes perfect sense that Congress wanted a broad ban on evidence-spoliation to stand on its own rather than as part of-or an appendage to-a witness-tampering provision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The plurality's objection to this statement is difficult to understand. It cannot take issue with\n    <em>\n     Hubbard\n    </em>\n    's holding that \"a federal court is neither a 'department' nor an 'agency' \" in a statute referring, just as \u00a7 1519does, to \"any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339980\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/695/#p715\">\n     514 U.S., at 698, 715\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6113992,1339980\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1754/\">\n     115 S.Ct. 1754\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . So the plurality suggests that the phrase \"in relation to ... any such matter\" in \u00a7 1519somehow changes\n    <em>\n     Hubbard\n    </em>\n    's result. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1084 - 1085, and n. 5. But that phrase still demands that evidence-tampering relate to a \"matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency\"-excluding courts, as\n    <em>\n     Hubbard\n    </em>\n    commands. That is why the federal government, as far as I can tell, has never once brought a prosecution under \u00a7 1519for evidence-tampering in litigation between private parties. It instead uses \u00a7 1512(c)(1)for that purpose.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Section 1512(c)(1)also applies more broadly than \u00a7 1519in proceedings relating to insurance regulation. The term \"official proceeding\" in \u00a7 1512(c)(1)is defined to include \"proceeding[s] involving the business of insurance whose activities affect interstate commerce before any insurance regulatory official or agency.\" \u00a7 1515(a)(1)(D). But \u00a7 1519wouldn't usually apply in that context because state, not federal, agencies handle most insurance regulation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The plurality seeks support for this argument in the Sentencing Commission's construction of the phrase \"records, documents, or tangible objects,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1086, but to no avail. The plurality cites a note in the Commission's Manual clarifying that this phrase, as used in the Sentencing Guidelines, \"includes\" various electronic information, communications, and storage devices. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014) (USSG). But \"includes\" (following its ordinary definition) \"is not exhaustive,\" as the Commission's commentary makes explicit. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment., n. 2. Otherwise, the Commission's construction wouldn't encompass\n    <em>\n     paper\n    </em>\n    documents. All the note does is to make plain that \"records, documents, or tangible objects\" embraces stuff relating to the digital (as well as the material) world.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    As part of its lenity argument, the plurality asserts that Yates did not have \"fair warning\" that his conduct amounted to a felony.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1088; see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1087 (stating that \"Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a felony prosecution\" when throwing fish overboard). But even under the plurality's view, the dumping of fish is potentially a federal felony-just under \u00a7 1512(c)(1), rather than \u00a7 1519. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1084 - 1085. In any event, the plurality itself acknowledges that the ordinary meaning of \u00a7 1519covers Yates's conduct, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1081: That provision, no less than \u00a7 1512(c)(1), announces its broad scope in the clearest possible terms. And when an ordinary citizen seeks notice of a statute's scope, he is more likely to focus on the plain text than (as the plurality would have it) on the section number, the superfluity principle, and the\n    <em>\n     noscitur\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     ejusdem\n    </em>\n    canons.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The concurrence contends that when the\n    <em>\n     noscitur\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     ejusdem\n    </em>\n    canons are in play, \" 'known unknowns' should be similar to known knowns,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    here, records and documents.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1089. But as noted above, records and documents\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    similar to crocodiles and fish as far as \u00a7 1519is concerned: All are potentially useful as evidence in an investigation. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1097. The concurrence never explains why\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    similarity isn't the relevant one in a statute aimed at evidence-tampering.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </summary>\n</casebody>\n"
