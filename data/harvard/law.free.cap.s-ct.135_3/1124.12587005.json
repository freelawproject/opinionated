We must decide whether the Tax Injunction Act, which provides that federal district courts \"shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , bars a suit to enjoin the enforcement of this law.

Colorado imposes both a 2.9 percent tax on the sale of tangible personal property within the State, Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 39-26-104(1)(a), 39-26-106(1)(a)(II) (2014), and an equivalent use tax for any property stored, used, or consumed in Colorado on which a sales tax was not paid to a retailer, \u00a7\u00a7 39-26-202(1)(b), 39-26-204(1). Retailers with a physical presence in Colorado must collect the sales or use tax from consumers at the point of sale and remit the proceeds to the Colorado Department of Revenue (Department). \u00a7\u00a7 39-26-105(1), 39-26-106(2)(a). But under our negative Commerce Clause precedents, Colorado may not require retailers who lack a physical presence in the State to collect these taxes on behalf of the Department. See\n   <em>\n    Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728988\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/298/#p315\">\n    504 U.S. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315-318,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728988\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/298/#p315\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728988\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/298/#p315\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Thus, Colorado requires its consumers who purchase tangible personal property from a retailer that does not collect these taxes (a \"noncollecting retailer\") to fill out a return and remit the taxes to the Department directly. \u00a7 39-26-204(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Voluntary compliance with the latter requirement is relatively low, leading to a significant loss of tax revenue, especially as Internet retailers have increasingly displaced their brick-and-mortar kin. In the decade before this suit was filed in 2010, e-commerce more than tripled. App. 28. With approximately 25 percent of taxes unpaid on Internet sales, Colorado estimated in 2010 that its revenue loss attributable\n   to noncompliance would grow by more than $20 million each year. App. 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In hopes of stopping this trend, Colorado enacted legislation in 2010 imposing notice and reporting obligations on noncollecting retailers whose gross sales in Colorado exceed $100,000. Three provisions of that Act, along with their implementing regulations, are at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, noncollecting retailers must \"notify Colorado purchasers that sales or use tax is due on certain purchases ... and that the state of Colorado requires the purchaser to file a sales or use tax return.\"\u00a7 39-21-112(3.5)(c)(I); see also 1 Colo.Code Regs. \u00a7 201-1:39-21-112.3.5(2) (2014), online at http://www.sos.co.us/CRR (as visited Feb. 27, 2015, and available in the Clerk of Court's case file). The retailer must provide this notice during each transaction with a Colorado purchaser,\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   and is subject to a penalty of $5 for each transaction in which it fails to do so, Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 39-21-112(3.5)(c)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, by January 31 of each year, each noncollecting retailer must send a report to all Colorado purchasers who bought more than $500 worth of goods from the retailer in the previous year. \u00a7 39-21-112(3.5)(d)(I); 1 Colo.Code Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 201-1:39-21-112.3.5(3)(a), (c). That report must list the dates, categories, and amounts of those purchases. Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 39-21-112(3.5)(d)(I); see also 1 Colo.Code Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 201-1:39-21-112.3.5(3)(a), (c).

The retailer is subject to a penalty of $10 for each report it fails to send. \u00a7 39-21-112(3.5)(d)(III)(A); see also 1 Colo.Code Regs. \u00a7 201-1:39-21-112.3.5(3)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, by March 1 of each year, noncollecting retailers must send a statement to the Department listing the names of their Colorado customers, their known addresses, and the total amount each Colorado customer paid for Colorado purchases in the prior calendar year. Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 39-21-112(3.5)(d)(II)(A); 1 Colo.Code Regs. \u00a7 201-1:39-21-112.3.5(4). A noncollecting retailer that fails to make this report is subject to a penalty of $10 for each customer that it should have listed in the report.

Many of its members have no physical presence in Colorado and choose not to collect Colorado sales and use taxes on Colorado purchases. As a result, they are subject to Colorado's notice and reporting requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2010, Direct Marketing Association brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against the Executive Director of the Department, alleging that the notice and reporting requirements violate provisions of the United States and Colorado Constitutions. As relevant here, Direct Marketing Association alleged that the provisions (1) discriminate against interstate commerce and (2) impose undue burdens on interstate commerce, all in violation of this Court's negative Commerce Clause precedents. At the request of both parties, the District Court stayed all challenges except these two, in\n   order to facilitate expedited consideration. It then granted partial summary judgment to Direct Marketing Association and permanently enjoined enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements. App. to Pet. for Cert.

Without reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the suit because of the Tax Injunction Act (TIA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Acknowledging that the suit \"differs from the prototypical TIA case,\" the Court of Appeals nevertheless found it barred by the TIA because, if successful, it \"would limit, restrict, or hold back the state's chosen method of enforcing its tax laws and generating revenue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722204\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/904/#p913\">\n    735 F.3d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913 (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319480\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/134/2901/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12583003,12583030,12583001,12583035,12583036,12583037,12583006\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/855/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), and now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Enacted in 1937, the TIA provides that federal district courts \"shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\" \u00a7 1341. The question before us is whether the relief sought here would \"enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law.\" Because we conclude that it would not, we need not consider whether \"a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of\" Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District Court enjoined state officials from enforcing the notice and reporting requirements. Because an injunction is clearly a form of equitable relief barred by the TIA, the question becomes whether the enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements is an act of \"assessment, levy or collection.\" We need not comprehensively define these terms to conclude that they do not encompass enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In defining the terms of the TIA, we have looked to federal tax law as a guide.

Although the TIA does not concern federal taxes, it was modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act (AIA), which does. See\n   <em>\n    Jefferson County v. Acker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248520\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/423/#p434\">\n    527 U.S. 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434-435,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248520\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/423/#p434\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248520\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/423/#p434\">\n    144 L.Ed.2d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999).

We assume that words used in both Acts are generally used in the same way, and we discern the meaning of the terms in the AIA by reference to the broader Tax Code.\n   <em>\n    Hibbs, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 102-105,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p100\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p100\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Read in light of the Federal Tax Code at the time the TIA was enacted (as well as today), these three terms refer to discrete phases of the taxation process that do not include informational notices or private reports of information relevant to tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To begin, the Federal Tax Code has long treated information gathering as a phase of tax administration procedure that occurs before assessment, levy, or collection. See \u00a7\u00a7 6001-6117; \u00a7\u00a7 1500-1524 (1934 ed.); see also \u00a7 1533 (\"All provisions of law for the ascertainment of liability to any tax, or the assessment or collection thereof, shall be held to apply ...\"). This step includes private reporting of information used to determine tax liability, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1511(a), including reports by third parties who do not owe the tax, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6041\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2012 ed.); see also \u00a7\u00a7 1512(a)-(b) (1934 ed.) (authorizing a collector or the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, when a taxpayer fails to file a return, to make a return \"from his own knowledge and from such information as he can obtain through testimony or otherwise\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Assessment\" is the next step in the process, and it refers to the official recording of a taxpayer's liability, which occurs after information relevant to the calculation of that liability is reported to the taxing authority. See \u00a7 1530. In\n   <em>\n    Hibbs,\n   </em>\n   the Court noted that \"assessment,\" as used in the Internal Revenue Code, \"involves a 'recording' of the amount the taxpayer owes the Government.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p100\">\n    542 U.S., at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p100\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting \u00a7 6203 (2000 ed.)). It might also be understood more broadly to encompass the process by which that amount is calculated. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Galletti,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5932581\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/114/#p122\">\n    541 U.S. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9269073\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/124/1548/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5932581\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/114/#p122\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004); see also\n   <em>\n    Hibbs,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 100, n. 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p100\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But even understood more broadly, \"assessment\" has long been treated in the Tax Code as an official action taken based on information already reported to the taxing authority. For example, not many years before it passed the TIA, Congress passed a law providing that the filing of a return would start the running of the clock for a timely assessment. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Revenue Act of 1924, Pub.L. 68-176, \u00a7 277(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Stat.%20299\">\n    43 Stat. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, assessment was understood as a step in the taxation process that occurred after, and was distinct from, the step of reporting information pertaining to tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Levy,\" at least as it is defined in the Federal Tax Code, refers to a specific mode of collection under which the Secretary of the Treasury distrains and seizes a recalcitrant taxpayer's property. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206331\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012 ed.); \u00a7 1582 (1934 ed.). Because the word \"levy\" does not appear in the AIA, however, one could argue that its meaning in the TIA is not tied to the meaning of the term as used in federal tax law. If that were the case, one might look to contemporaneous dictionaries, which defined \"levy\" as the legislative function of laying or imposing a tax and the executive functions of assessing, recording, and collecting the amount a taxpayer owes. See Black's Law Dictionary 1093 (3d ed. 1933) (Black's); see also Webster's New International Dictionary 1423 (2d ed. 1939) (\"To raise or collect, as by assessment, execution, or other legal process, etc.; to exact or impose by authority ...\"); \u00a7\u00a7 1540, 1544 (using \"levying\" and \"levied\" in the more general sense of an executive imposition of a tax liability). But under any of these definitions, \"levy\" would be limited to an official governmental action imposing, determining the amount of, or securing payment on a tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, \"collection\" is the act of obtaining payment of taxes due. See Black's 349 (defining \"collect\" as \"to obtain payment or liquidation\" of a debt or claim). It might be understood narrowly as a step in the taxation process that occurs after a formal assessment. Consistent with this understanding, we have previously described it as part of the \"enforcement process ... that 'assessment' sets in motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Hibbs,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 102, n. 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p100\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Tax Code at the time the TIA was enacted provided for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to certify a list of assessments \"to the proper collectors ... who [would] proceed to collect and account for the taxes and penalties so certified.\" \u00a7 1531. That collection process began with the collector \"giv[ing] notice to each person liable to pay any taxes stated [in the list] ... stating the amount of such taxes and demanding payment thereof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00a7 1545(a). When a person failed to pay, the Government had various means to collect the amount due, including liens, \u00a7 1560, distraint, \u00a7 1580, forfeiture, and other legal proceedings, \u00a7 1640. Today's Tax Code continues to authorize collection of taxes by these methods. \u00a7 6302 (2012 ed.). \"Collection\" might also be understood more broadly to encompass the receipt of a tax payment before a formal assessment occurs. For example, at the time the TIA was enacted, the Tax Code provided for the assessment of money already received by a person \"required to\n   <em>\n    collect\n   </em>\n   or withhold any internal-revenue tax from any other person,\" suggesting that at least some act of collection might occur before a formal assessment. \u00a7 1551 (1934 ed.) (emphasis added). Either way, \"collection\" is a separate step in the taxation process from assessment and the reporting on which assessment is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   So defined, these terms do not encompass Colorado's enforcement of its notice and reporting requirements. The Executive Director does not seriously contend that the provisions at issue here involve a \"levy\"; instead she portrays them as part of the process of assessment and collection. But the notice and reporting requirements precede the steps of \"assessment\" and \"collection.\" The notice given to Colorado consumers, for example, informs them of their use-tax liability and prompts them to keep a record of taxable purchases that they will report to the State at some future point. The annual summary that the retailers send to consumers provides them with a reminder of that use-tax liability and the information they need to fill out their annual returns. And the report the retailers file with the Department facilitates audits to determine tax deficiencies. After each of these notices or reports is filed, the State still needs to take further action to assess the taxpayer's use-tax liability and to collect payment from him. See Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 39-26-204(3)(describing the procedure for \"assessing and collecting [use] taxes\" on the basis of returns filed by consumers and collecting retailers). Colorado law provides for specific assessment and collection procedures that are triggered after the State has received the returns and made the deficiency determinations that the notice and reporting requirements are meant to facilitate. See \u00a7 39-26-210; 1 Colo.Code Regs. \u00a7 201-1:39-21-107(1) (\"The statute of limitations on assessments of ... sales [and] use ... tax ... shall be three years from the date the return was filed ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements may improve Colorado's ability to assess and ultimately collect its sales and use taxes from consumers, but the TIA is not keyed to all activities that may improve a State's ability to assess and collect taxes. Such a rule would be inconsistent not only with the text of the statute, but also with our rule favoring clear boundaries in the interpretation of jurisdictional statutes. See\n   <em>\n    Hertz Corp. v. Friend,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n    559 U.S. 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

Instead, it adopted a broad definition of the word \"restrain\" in the TIA, which bars not only suits to \"enjoin ... assessment, levy or collection\" of a state tax but also suits to \"suspend or restrain\" those activities. Specifically, the Court of Appeals concluded that the TIA bars any suit that would \"limit, restrict, or hold back\" the assessment, levy, or collection of state taxes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722204\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/904/#p913\">\n    735 F.3d, at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One is the broad meaning given by the Court of Appeals, which captures orders that merely\n   <em>\n    inhibit\n   </em>\n   acts of \"assessment, levy and collection.\" See Black's 1548. Another, narrower meaning, however, is \"[t]o prohibit from action; to put compulsion upon ... to enjoin,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   which captures only those orders that stop (or perhaps compel) acts of \"assessment, levy and collection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To resolve this ambiguity, we look to the context in which the word is used.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

In other words, the\n   <em>\n    Quill\n   </em>\n   majority acknowledged the prospect that its conclusion was wrong when the case was decided.

There is a powerful case to be made that a retailer doing extensive business within a State has a sufficiently \"substantial nexus\" to justify imposing some minor tax-collection duty, even if that business is done through mail or the Internet. After all, \"interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    D.H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209320\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/24/#p31\">\n    486 U.S. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209320\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/24/#p31\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209320\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/24/#p31\">\n    100 L.Ed.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). This argument has grown stronger, and the cause more urgent, with time. When the Court decided\n   <em>\n    Quill,\n   </em>\n   mail-order sales in the United States totaled $180 billion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728988\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/298/#p315\">\n    504 U.S., at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728988\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/298/#p315\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But in 1992, the Internet was in its infancy. By 2008, e-commerce sales alone totaled $3.16 trillion per year in the United States. App. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because of\n   <em>\n    Quill\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bellas Hess,\n   </em>\n   States have been unable to collect many of the taxes due on these purchases. California, for example, has estimated that it is able to collect only about 4% of the use taxes due on sales from out-of-state vendors. See California State Board of Equalization, Revenue Estimate: Electronic Commerce and Mail Order Sales, Rev. 8/13, p. 7 (2013) (Table 3). The result has been a startling revenue shortfall in many States, with concomitant unfairness to local retailers and their customers who do pay taxes at the register. The facts of this case exemplify that trend: Colorado's losses in 2012 are estimated to be around $170 million. See D. Bruce, W. Fox, &amp; L. Luna, State and Local Government Sales Tax Revenue Losses from Electronic Commerce 11 (2009) (Table 5). States' education systems, healthcare services, and infrastructure are weakened as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Internet has caused far-reaching systemic and structural changes in the economy, and, indeed, in many other societal dimensions. Although online businesses may not have a physical presence in some States, the Web has, in many ways, brought the average American closer to most major retailers. A connection to a shopper's favorite store is a click away-regardless of how close or far the nearest storefront. See PricewaterhouseCoopers, Understanding How U.S. Online Shoppers Are Reshaping the Retail Experience 3 (Mar. 2012) (nearly 70% of American consumers shopped online in 2011). Today buyers have almost instant access to most retailers via cell phones, tablets, and laptops. As a result, a business may be present in a State in a meaningful way without that presence being physical in the traditional sense of the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Given these changes in technology and consumer sophistication, it is unwise to delay any longer a reconsideration of the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Quill\n   </em>\n   . A case questionable even when decided,\n   <em>\n    Quill\n   </em>\n   now harms States to a degree far greater than could have been anticipated earlier. See\n   <em>\n    Pearson v. Callahan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p233\">\n    555 U.S. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p233\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p233\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009)(\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   weakened where \"experience has pointed up the precedent's shortcomings\"). It should be left in place only if a powerful showing can be made that its rationale is still correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The instant case does not raise this issue in a manner appropriate for the Court to address it. It does provide, however, the means to note the importance of reconsidering doubtful authority.

This suit does not implicate that congressional objective. The Direct Marketing Association is not challenging its own or anyone else's tax liability or tax collection responsibilities. And the claim is not one likely to be pursued in a state refund action. A different question would be posed, however, by a suit to enjoin reporting obligations imposed on a taxpayer or tax collector,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   an employer or an in-state retailer, litigation in lieu of a direct challenge to an \"assessment,\" \"levy,\" or \"collection.\" The Court does not reach today the question whether the claims in such a suit,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   claims suitable for a refund action, are barred by the Tax Injunction Act.
