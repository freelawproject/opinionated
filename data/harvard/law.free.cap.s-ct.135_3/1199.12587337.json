The absence of a notice-and-comment obligation makes the process of issuing interpretive rules comparatively easier for agencies than issuing legislative rules.

Certain classes of employees, however, are exempt from these provisions.

As relevant here, the 2004 regulations differed from the previous regulations in that they contained a new section providing several examples of exempt administrative employees. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.203\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See Opinion Letter, Loan Officers/Exempt Status, 6A LRR, Wages and Hours Manual 99:8351 (Feb. 16, 2001); Opinion Letter, Mortgage Loan Officers/Exempt Status,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 99:8249. (May\n   17, 1999). In other words, the Department concluded that the FLSA's minimum wage and maximum hour requirements applied to mortgage-loan officers. When the Department promulgated its current FLSA regulations in 2004, respondent Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), a national trade association representing real estate finance companies, requested a new opinion interpreting the revised regulations. In 2006, the Department issued an opinion letter finding that mortgage-loan officers fell within the administrative exemption under the 2004 regulations. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13-1041, pp. 70a-84a. Four years later, however, the Wage and Hour Division again altered its interpretation of the FLSA's administrative exemption as it applied to mortgage-loan officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 49a-69a. Reviewing the provisions of the 2004 regulations and judicial decisions addressing the administrative exemption, the Department's 2010 Administrator's Interpretation concluded that mortgage-loan officers \"have a primary duty of making sales for their employers, and, therefore, do not qualify\" for the administrative exemption.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 49a, 69a. The Department accordingly withdrew its 2006 opinion letter, which it now viewed as relying on \"misleading assumption[s] and selective and narrow analysis\" of the exemption example in \u00a7 541.203(b).\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 68a.

MBA contended that the document was inconsistent with the 2004 regulation it purported to interpret, and thus arbitrary and capricious in violation of \u00a7 10 of the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More pertinent to this case, MBA also argued that the Administrator's Interpretation was procedurally invalid in light of the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707604,11967316\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/579/\">\n    117 F.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   doctrine, if \"an agency has given its regulation a definitive interpretation, and later significantly revises that interpretation, the agency has in effect amended its rule, something it may not accomplish\" under the APA \"without notice and comment.\"\n   <em>\n    Alaska Professional Hunters Assn., Inc. v.

Though it accepted the parties' characterization of the Administrator's Interpretation as an interpretive rule,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 203, n. 7, the District Court determined that the\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   doctrine was inapplicable because MBA had failed to establish its reliance on the contrary interpretation expressed in the Department's 2006 opinion letter. The Administrator's Interpretation, the District Court further determined, was fully supported by the text of the 2004 FLSA regulations. The court accordingly held that the 2010 interpretation was not arbitrary or capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The D.C.

Section 4 of the APA provides that \"notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). When such notice is required by the APA, \"the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making.\" \u00a7 553(c). But \u00a7 4 further states that unless \"notice or hearing is required by statute,\" the Act's notice-and-comment requirement \"does not apply ... to interpretative rules.\" \u00a7 553(b)(A). This exemption of interpretive rules from the notice-and-comment process is categorical, and it is fatal to the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rather than examining the exemption for interpretive rules contained in \u00a7 4(b)(A) of the APA, the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   focused its attention on \u00a7 1 of the Act. That section defines \"rule making\" to include not only the initial issuance of new rules, but also \"repeal[s]\" or \"amend[ments]\" of existing rules. See \u00a7 551(5). Because notice-and-comment requirements may apply even to these later agency actions, the court reasoned, \"allow[ing] an agency to make a fundamental change in its interpretation of a substantive regulation without notice and comment\" would undermine the APA's procedural framework.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707604,11967316\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/579/\">\n    117 F.3d, at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This reading of the APA conflates the differing purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Act. Section 1 defines what a rulemaking is. It does not, however, say what procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking. That is the purpose of \u00a7 4. And \u00a7 4 specifically exempts interpretive rules from the notice-and-comment requirements that apply to legislative rules. So, the D.C. Circuit correctly read \u00a7 1 of the APA to mandate that agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance.

Circuit's reading of the APA. \"\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans,\n   </em>\n   \" MBA contends, \"simply acknowledges the reality that where an agency significantly alters a prior, definitive interpretation of a regulation, it has effectively amended the regulation itself,\" something that under the APA requires use of notice-and-comment procedures. Brief for Respondent 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The act of \"amending,\" however, in both ordinary parlance and legal usage, has its own meaning separate and apart from the act of \"interpreting.\" Compare Black's Law Dictionary 98 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"amend\" as \"[t]o change the wording of\" or \"formally alter ... by striking out, inserting, or substituting words\"), with\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 943 (defining \"interpret\" as \"[t]o ascertain the meaning and significance of\n   thoughts expressed in words\"). One would not normally say that a court \"amends\" a statute when it interprets its text. So too can an agency \"interpret\" a regulation without \"effectively amend[ing]\" the underlying source of law. MBA does not explain\n   <em>\n    how,\n   </em>\n   precisely, an interpretive rule changes the regulation it interprets, and its assertion is impossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpretive rules do not have the force and effect of law.

Recall that the rule of\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   applies only when an agency has previously adopted an interpretation of its regulation. Yet in that initial interpretation as much as all that come after, the agency is giving a definite meaning to an ambiguous text-the very act MBA insists requires notice and comment.

Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   did not address a change in agency interpretation. Instead, we there refused to give deference to an agency's interpretation of an unambiguous regulation, observing that to defer in such a case would allow the agency \"to create\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   a new regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508888\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/576/\">\n    529 U.S., at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508888\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/576/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently,\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   held that the agency interpretation at issue was substantively invalid because it conflicted with the text of the regulation the agency purported to interpret. That holding is irrelevant to this suit and to the\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   rule, which assesses whether an agency interpretation is\n   <em>\n    procedurally\n   </em>\n   invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As for\n   <em>\n    Guernsey,\n   </em>\n   that case is fully consistent with-indeed, confirms-what the text of the APA makes plain: \"Interpretive rules do not require notice and comment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340264\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/87/#p99\">\n    514 U.S., at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340264\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/87/#p99\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the statement on which MBA relies is dictum. Worse, it is dictum taken out of context. The \"regulations\" to which the Court referred were two provisions of the Medicare reimbursement scheme. And it is apparent from the Court's description of these regulations in Part II of the opinion that they were legislative rules, issued through the notice-and-comment process. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 91-92,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340264\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/87/#p99\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the disputed regulations were codified in the Code of Federal Regulations). Read properly, then, the cited passage from\n   <em>\n    Guernsey\n   </em>\n   merely means that \"an agency may only change its interpretation if the revised interpretation is consistent with the underlying regulations.\" Brief for Petitioners in No. 13-1052, p. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the main, MBA attempts to justify the\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   doctrine on practical and policy grounds. MBA contends that the doctrine reinforces the APA's goal of \"procedural fairness\" by preventing agencies from unilaterally and unexpectedly altering their interpretation of important regulations. Brief for Respondent 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There may be times when an agency's decision to issue an interpretive rule, rather than a legislative rule, is driven primarily by a desire to skirt notice-and-comment provisions. But regulated entities are not without recourse in such situations. Quite the opposite. The APA contains a variety of constraints on agency decisionmaking-the arbitrary and capricious standard being among the most notable. As we held in\n   <em>\n    Fox Television Stations,\n   </em>\n   and underscore again today, the APA requires an agency to provide more substantial justification when \"its new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account. It would be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n    556 U.S., at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted); see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 535,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, Congress is aware that agencies sometimes alter their views in ways that upset settled reliance interests. For that reason, Congress sometimes includes in the statutes it drafts safe-harbor provisions that shelter regulated entities from liability when they act in conformance with previous agency interpretations. The FLSA includes one such provision: As amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20251\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   the FLSA provides that \"no employer shall be subject to any liability\" for failing \"to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation\" if it demonstrates that the \"act or omission complained of was in good faith in conformity with and in reliance on any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation\" of the Administrator of the Department's Wage and Hour Division, even when the guidance is later \"modified or rescinded.\" \u00a7\u00a7 259(a), (b)(1). These safe harbors will often protect parties from liability when an agency adopts an interpretation that conflicts with its previous position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   MBA changes direction in the second half of its brief, contending that if the Court overturns the\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   rule, the D.C. Circuit's judgment should nonetheless be affirmed. That is so, MBA says, because the agency interpretation at issue-the 2010 Administrator's Interpretation-should in fact be classified as a legislative rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We will not address this argument. From the beginning, the parties litigated this suit on the understanding that the Administrator's Interpretation was-as its name suggests-an interpretive rule. Indeed, if MBA did not think the Administrator's Interpretation was an interpretive rule, then its decision to invoke the\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   doctrine in attacking the rule is passing strange. After all,\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   applied only to interpretive rules. Consequently, neither the District Court nor the D.C. Circuit considered MBA's current claim that the Administrator's Interpretation is actually a legislative rule. Beyond that, and more important still, MBA's brief in opposition to certiorari did not dispute petitioners' assertions-in their framing of the question presented and in the substance of their petitions-that the Administrator's Interpretation is an interpretive rule. Thus, even assuming MBA did not waive the argument below, it has done so in this Court. See this Court's Rule 15.2;\n   <em>\n    Carcieri v.

The creation of that doctrine may have been prompted by an understandable concern about the aggrandizement of the power of administrative agencies as a result of the combined effect of (1) the effective delegation to agencies by Congress of huge swaths of lawmaking authority, (2) the exploitation by agencies of the uncertain boundary between legislative and interpretive rules, and (3) this Court's cases holding that courts must ordinarily defer to an agency's interpretation of its own ambiguous regulations.

The Act guards against excesses in rulemaking by requiring notice and comment. Before an agency makes a rule, it normally must notify the public of the proposal, invite them to comment on its shortcomings, consider and respond to their arguments, and explain its final decision in a statement of the rule's basis and purpose.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)-(c);\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1203 - 1204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The APA exempts interpretive rules from these requirements. \u00a7 553(b)(A). But this concession to agencies was meant to be more modest in its effects than it is today. For despite exempting interpretive rules from notice and comment, the Act provides that \"the\n   <em>\n    reviewing court\n   </em>\n   shall ... interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.\" \u00a7 706(emphasis added). The Act thus contemplates that courts, not agencies, will authoritatively resolve ambiguities in statutes and regulations. In such a regime, the exemption for interpretive rules does not add much to agency power. An agency may use interpretive rules to\n   <em>\n    advise\n   </em>\n   the public by explaining its interpretation of the law. But an agency may not use interpretive rules to\n   <em>\n    bind\n   </em>\n   the public by making law, because it remains the responsibility of the court to decide whether the law means what the agency says it means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Heedless of the original design of the APA, we have developed an elaborate law of deference to agencies' interpretations of statutes and regulations.

After all, if an interpretive rule gets deference, the people are bound to obey it on pain of sanction, no less surely than they are bound to obey substantive rules, which are accorded similar deference. Interpretive rules that command deference\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   have the force of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court's reasons for resisting this obvious point would not withstand a gentle breeze. Even when an agency's interpretation gets deference, the Court argues, \"it is the court that ultimately decides whether [the text] means what the agency says.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1208, n. 4. That is not quite so. So long as the agency does not stray beyond the ambiguity in the text being interpreted, deference\n   <em>\n    compels\n   </em>\n   the reviewing court to \"decide\" that the text means what the agency says. The Court continues that \"deference is not an inexorable command in all cases,\" because (for example) it does not apply to plainly erroneous interpretations.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   True, but beside the point. Saying\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   interpretive rules lack force of law because plainly erroneous interpretations do not bind courts is like saying\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   substantive rules lack force of law because arbitrary and capricious rules do not bind courts. Of course an interpretive rule must meet certain conditions before it gets deference-the interpretation must, for instance, be reasonable-but once it does so it is every bit as binding as a substantive rule. So the point stands: By deferring to interpretive rules, we have allowed agencies to make binding rules unhampered by notice-and-comment procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The problem is bad enough, and perhaps insoluble if\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   is not to be uprooted, with respect to interpretive rules setting forth agency interpretation of statutes. But an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is another matter. By giving that category of interpretive rules\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, we do more than allow the agency to make binding regulations without notice and comment. Because the agency (not Congress) drafts the substantive rules that are the object of those interpretations, giving them deference allows the agency to control the extent of its notice-and-comment-free domain. To expand this domain, the agency need only write substantive rules more broadly and vaguely, leaving plenty of gaps to be filled in later, using interpretive rules unchecked by notice and comment. The APA does not remotely contemplate this regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Still and all, what are we to do about the problem? The\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans\n   </em>\n   doctrine is a courageous (indeed, brazen) attempt to limit the mischief by requiring an interpretive rule to go through notice and comment if it revises an earlier definitive interpretation of a regulation. That solution is unlawful for the reasons set forth in the Court's opinion: It contradicts the APA's unqualified exemption of interpretive rules from notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   But I think there is another solution-one unavailable to the D.C. Circuit since it involves the overruling of one this Court's decisions (that being even a greater fault than merely ignoring the APA). As I have described elsewhere, the rule of\n   <em>\n    Chevron,\n   </em>\n   if it did not comport with the APA, at least was in conformity with the long history of judicial review of executive action, where \"[s]tatutory ambiguities ... were left to reasonable resolution by the Executive.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mead Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p243\">\n    533 U.S. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p243\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p243\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001)(SCALIA, J., dissenting). I am unaware of any such history justifying deference to agency interpretations of its own regulations. And there are weighty reasons to deny a lawgiver the power to write ambiguous laws and then be the judge of what\n   the ambiguity means. See\n   <em>\n    Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center,\n   </em>\n   568 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407704\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/597/#p1339\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1339-1342,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407704\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/597/#p1339\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013)(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). I would therefore restore the balance originally struck by the APA with respect to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, not by rewriting the Act in order to make up for\n   <em>\n    Auer,\n   </em>\n   but by abandoning\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   and applying the Act as written. The agency is free to interpret its own regulations with or without notice and comment; but courts will decide-with no deference to the agency-whether that interpretation is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   I concur in the Court's holding that the doctrine first announced in\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans of America v.

An agency's substantial revision of its interpretation of a regulation does not amount to an \"amendment\" of the regulation as that word is used in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   I write separately because these cases call into question the legitimacy of our precedents requiring deference to administrative interpretations of regulations. That line of precedents, beginning with\n   <em>\n    Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156543\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/325/410/\">\n    325 U.S. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156543\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/325/410/\">\n    65 S.Ct. 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156543\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/325/410/\">\n    89 L.Ed. 1700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1945), requires judges to defer to agency interpretations of regulations, thus, as happened in these cases, giving legal effect to the interpretations rather than the regulations themselves. Because this doctrine effects a transfer of the judicial power to an executive agency, it raises constitutional concerns. This line of precedents undermines our obligation to provide a judicial check on the other branches, and it subjects regulated parties to precisely the abuses that the Framers sought to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The doctrine of deference to an agency's interpretation of regulations is usually traced back to this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock, supra,\n   </em>\n   which involved the interpretation of a war-time price control regulation,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 411,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156543\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/325/410/\">\n    65 S.Ct. 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In setting out the approach it would apply to the case, the Court announced-without citation or explanation-that an administrative interpretation of an ambiguous regulation was entitled to \"controlling weight\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"Since this involves an interpretation of an administrative regulation a court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt. The intention of Congress or the principles of the Constitution in some situations may be relevant in the first instance in choosing between various constructions.

As the history shows, that approach runs the risk of compromising our constitutional structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Constitution's particular blend of separated powers and checks and balances was informed by centuries of political thought and experiences. See M. Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 38, 168-169 (2d ed. 1998) (Vile). Though the theories of the separation of powers and checks and balances have roots in the ancient world, events of the 17th and 18th centuries played a crucial role in their development and informed the men who crafted and ratified the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Over a century before our War of Independence, the English Civil War catapulted the theory of the separation of powers to prominence. As political theorists of the day witnessed the conflict between the King and Parliament, and the dangers of tyrannical government posed by each, they began to call for a clear division of authority between the two.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 44-45, 48-49. A 1648 work titled The Royalist's Defence offered perhaps the first extended account of the theory of the separation of powers: \"[W]hilst the\n   <em>\n    Supreamacy,\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Power\n   </em>\n   to Judge the Law, and\n   <em>\n    Authority\n   </em>\n   to make new Lawes, are kept in\n   <em>\n    severall hands,\n   </em>\n   the known Law is\n   <em>\n    preserved,\n   </em>\n   but\n   <em>\n    united,\n   </em>\n   it is\n   <em>\n    vanished,\n   </em>\n   instantly thereupon, and\n   <em>\n    Arbytrary\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tyrannicall\n   </em>\n   power is introduced.\" The Royalist's Defence 80 (1648) (italics in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   John Locke and Baron de Montesquieu endorsed and expanded on this concept. See Vile 63-64. They agreed with the general theory set forth in The Royalist's Defence, emphasizing the need for a separation of powers to protect individual liberty. J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7\u00a7 143-144, p. 72 (J. Gough ed. 1947); Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151-152 (O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949). But they also advocated a system of checks and balances to\n   reinforce that separation. Vile 72-73, 102. For instance, they agreed that the executive should have the power to assemble and dismiss the legislature and to consent to laws passed by it. See Locke,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 151, 156, at 75, 77-78; Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws, at 157, 159. Montesquieu warned that \"power should be a check to power\" lest the legislature \"arrogate to itself what authority it pleased ... [and] soon destroy all the other powers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 150, 157.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The experience of the States during the period between the War of Independence and the ratification of the Constitution confirmed the wisdom of combining these theories. Although many State Constitutions of the time included language unequivocally endorsing the separation of powers, they did not secure that separation with checks and balances, Vile 147, and actively placed traditional executive and judicial functions in the legislature, G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787, pp. 155-156 (1969). Under these arrangements, state legislatures arrogated power to themselves and began to confiscate property, approve the printing of paper money, and suspend the ordinary means for the recovery of debts.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 403-409.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   When the Framers met for the Constitutional Convention, they understood the need for greater checks and balances to reinforce the separation of powers. As Madison remarked, \"experience has taught us a distrust\" of the separation of powers alone as \"a sufficient security to each [branch] [against] encroachments of the others.\" 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 77 (M. Farrand rev. 1966). \"[I]t is necessary to introduce such a balance of powers and interests, as will guarantee the provisions on paper.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The Framers thus separated the three main powers of Government-legislative, executive, and judicial-into the three branches created by Articles I, II, and III. But they also created checks and balances to reinforce that separation. For example, they gave Congress specific enumerated powers to enact legislation, Art. I, \u00a7 8, but gave the President the power to veto that legislation, subject to congressional override by a supermajority vote, Art. I, \u00a7 7, cls. 2, 3. They gave the President the power to appoint principal officers of the United States, but gave the Senate the power to give advice and consent to those appointments. Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. They gave the House and Senate the power to agree to adjourn for more than three days, Art. I, \u00a7 5, cl. 4, but gave the President the power, \"in Case of Disagreement between them,\" to adjourn the Congress \"to such Time as he shall think proper.\" Art. II, \u00a7 3, cl. 3. During the ratification debates, Madison argued that this structure represented \"the great security\" for liberty in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 51, p. 321 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   To the Framers, the separation of powers and checks and balances were more than just theories. They were practical and real protections for individual liberty in the new Constitution. See\n   <em>\n    Mistretta v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p426\">\n    488 U.S. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p426\">\n    109 S.Ct. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494660\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/361/#p426\">\n    102 L.Ed.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989)(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"[The Constitution] is a prescribed structure, a framework, for the conduct of government. In designing that structure, the Framers\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   considered how much commingling [of governmental\n   powers] was, in the generality of things, acceptable, and set forth their conclusions in the document\"). The Judiciary-no less than the other two branches-has an obligation to guard against deviations from those principles. The\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   line of precedent is one such deviation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   raises two related constitutional concerns.

As James Madison explained, \"All new laws, though penned with the greatest technical skill and passed on the fullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal....\" The Federalist No. 37, at 229.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The judicial power was understood to include the power to resolve these ambiguities over time. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   Alexander Hamilton lauded this power, arguing that \"[t]he interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%20519\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No. 78, at 467. It is undoubtedly true that the other branches of Government have the authority and obligation to interpret the law, but only the judicial interpretation would be considered authoritative in a judicial proceeding. Vile 360.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Although the Federalists and Anti-Federalists engaged in a public debate about this interpretive power, that debate centered on the dangers inherent in the power, not on its allocation under the Constitution. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Letters from The Federal Farmer XV (Jan. 18, 1788), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 315-316 (H. Storing ed. 1981) (arguing that the interpretive power made the Judiciary the most dangerous branch). Writing as \"Brutus,\" one leading anti-Federalist argued that judges \"w[ould] not confine themselves to any fixed or established rules, but w[ould] determine, according to what appears to them, the reason and spirit of the constitution.\" Essays of Brutus (Jan. 31, 1788), in 2\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 420. The Federalists rejected these arguments, assuring the public that judges would be guided \"by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.\" The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A. Hamilton). Those rules included principles of interpretation that had been set out by jurists for centuries. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   2 S. von Pufendorf, De Officio Hominis Et Civis Juxta Legem Naturalem Libri Duo 83-86 (1682) (F. Moore transl. 1927); see also 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 59-61 (1765).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   One of the key elements of the Federalists' arguments in support of the allocation of power to make binding interpretations of the law was that Article III judges would exercise independent judgment. Although\n   \"judicial independence\" is often discussed in terms of independence from external threats, the Framers understood the concept to also require independence from the \"internal threat\" of \"human will.\" P. Hamburger, Law and Judicial Duty 507, 508 (2008); see also The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (A. Hamilton) (\"The judiciary ... may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment ...\"). Independent judgment required judges to decide cases in accordance with the law of the land, not in accordance with pressures placed upon them through either internal or external sources. Internal sources might include personal biases, while external sources might include pressure from the political branches, the public, or other interested parties. See Hamburger,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 508-521.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Framers made several key decisions at the Convention with these pressures in mind. For example, they rejected proposals to include a federal council of revision after several participants at the Convention expressed concern that judicial involvement in such a council would foster internal biases. Rufus King of Maryland, for example, asserted that \"the Judges ought to be able to expound the law as it should come before them, free from the bias of having participated in its formation.\" 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 98. Alexander Hamilton repeated these concerns in The Federalist, arguing that \"the judges, who are to be interpreters of the law, might receive an improper bias from having given a previous opinion in their revisionary capacities\" or \"be induced to embark too far in the political views of [the Executive]\" from too much association with him. The Federalist No. 73, at 446; see also Hamburger,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 508-512.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Framers also created structural protections in the Constitution to free judges from external influences. They provided, for example, that judges should \"hold their Offices during good Behaviour\" and receive \"a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\" Art. III, \u00a7 1. Hamilton noted that such unequivocal language had been shown necessary by the experience of the States, where similar state constitutional protections for judges had not been \"sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions\" of the separation of the judicial power. The Federalist No. 79, at 472. Because \"power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will,\" he argued that Article III's structural protections would help ensure that judges fulfilled their constitutional role.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis deleted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Framers made the opposite choice for legislators and the Executive. Instead of insulating them from external pressures, the Constitution tied them to those pressures. It provided for election of Members of the House of Representatives every two years, Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 1; and selection of Members of the Senate every six years, Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 1. It also provided for the President to be subject to election every four years. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. \"The President is [thus] directly dependent on the people, and since there is only\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   President,\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   is responsible.

Just as it is critical for judges to exercise independent judgment in applying statutes, it is critical for judges to exercise independent judgment in determining that a regulation properly covers the conduct of regulated parties. Defining the legal meaning of the regulation is one aspect of that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   deference, however, precludes judges from independently determining that meaning. Rather than judges' applying recognized tools of interpretation to determine the best meaning of a regulation, this doctrine demands that courts accord \"controlling weight\" to the agency interpretation of a regulation, subject only to the narrow exception for interpretations that are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. That deference amounts to a transfer of the judge's exercise of interpretive judgment to the agency. See 1 S. Johnson, Dictionary of the\n   English Language 499 (4th ed. 1773) (defining \"[d]efer\" as \"to leave to another's judgment\"). But the agency, as part of the Executive Branch, lacks the structural protections for independent judgment adopted by the Framers, including the life tenure and salary protections of Article III. Because the agency is thus not properly constituted to exercise the judicial power under the Constitution, the transfer of interpretive judgment raises serious separation-of-powers concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   is constitutionally questionable for an additional reason: It undermines the judicial \"check\" on the political branches. Unlike the Legislative and Executive Branches, each of which possesses several political checks on the other, the Judiciary has one primary check on the excesses of political branches. That check is the enforcement of the rule of law through the exercise of judicial power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Judges have long recognized their responsibility to apply the law, even if they did not conceive of it as a \"check\" on political power. During the 17th century, for example, King James I sought to pressure Chief Justice Coke to affirm the lawfulness of his efforts to raise revenue without the participation of Parliament. Hamburger, Law and Judicial Duty, at 200-201. Coke sought time to confer with his fellow jurists to \"make an advised answer according to law and reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Case of Proclamations,\n   </em>\n   12 Co. Rep. 74, 75, 77 Eng.

But the King's representative, Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, responded that \"he would advise the Judges to maintain the power and prerogative of the King\" and suggested that, \"in cases in which there is no authority and precedent,\" the judiciary should \"leave it to the King to order in it according to his wisdom.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407133\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/239/#p2314\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407133\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/239/#p2314\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Coke famously responded, \"[T]he King cannot change any part of the common law, nor create any offence by his proclamation, which was not an offence before, without Parliament.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   When James I later attempted to do just that, Coke declared the proclamations \" 'utterly against Law and reason, and for that void.' \" Hamburger,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Framers expected Article III judges to engage in similar efforts, by applying the law as a \"check\" on the excesses of both the Legislative and Executive Branches.

In each case, the Judiciary is called upon to exercise its independent judgment and apply the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   But we have not consistently exercised the judicial check with respect to administrative agencies. Even though regulated parties have repeatedly challenged agency interpretations as inconsistent with existing regulations, we have just as repeatedly declined to exercise independent judgment as to those claims. Instead, we have deferred to the executive agency that both promulgated the regulations and enforced them. Although an agency's interpretation of a regulation might be the best interpretation, it also might not. When courts refuse even to decide what the best interpretation is under the law, they abandon the judicial check. That abandonment permits precisely the accumulation of governmental powers that the Framers warned against. See The Federalist No. 47, at 302 (J. Madison).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This accumulation of governmental powers allows agencies to change the meaning of regulations at their discretion and without any advance notice to the parties. It is precisely this problem that the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit attempted to address by requiring agencies to undertake notice and comment procedures before substantially revising definitive interpretations of regulations.\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans, supra\n   </em>\n   . Though legally erroneous, the Court of Appeals' reasoning was practically sound. When courts give \"controlling weight\" to an administrative interpretation of a regulation-instead of to the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   interpretation of it-they effectively give the interpretation-and not the regulation-the force and effect of law. To regulated parties, the new interpretation might as well be a new regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   These cases provide a classic example of the problem. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 establishes federal minimum wage and overtime requirements, but exempts from these requirements \"any employee engaged in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity ..., or in the capacity of outside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

In 2006, the Department concluded that the officers are not employees whose primary duty is selling financial products. But in 2010, the Department reversed course, concluding exactly the opposite. If courts accord \"controlling weight\" to both the 2006 and 2010 interpretations, the regulated entities are subject to two opposite legal rules imposed under the same regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This practice turns on its head the principle that the United States is \"a government of laws, and not of men.\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 163.

As this Court has explained, the \"essential balance\" of the Constitution is that the Legislature is \"possessed of power to 'prescrib[e] the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated,' but the power of '[t]he interpretation of the laws' [is] 'the proper and peculiar province of the courts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 222,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339497\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/211/#p221\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted; third brackets added). Although the Constitution imposes a duty on all three branches to interpret the laws within their own spheres, the power to create legally binding interpretations rests with the Judiciary. See\n   <em>\n    Marbury,\n   </em>\n   1 Cranch, at 177, 179-180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   A final proposed justification for\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   deference is that too much oversight of administrative matters would imperil the \"independence and esteem\" of\n   judges. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Charles Evans Hughes, Speech before the Elmira Chamber of Commerce, May 3, 1907, in Addresses of Charles Evans Hughes, 1906-1916, p. 185 (2d ed. 1916). The argument goes that questions of administration are those which \"lie close to the public impatience,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 186, and thus the courts' resolution of such questions could \"expose them to the fire of public criticism,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 187.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   But this argument, which boils down to a policy judgment of questionable validity, cannot vitiate the constitutional allocation of powers. The Judicial Branch is separate from the political branches for a reason: It has the obligation to apply the law to cases and controversies that come before it, and concerns about the popular esteem of individual judges-or even the Judiciary as a whole-have no place in that analysis. Our system of Government could not long survive absent adherence to the written Constitution that formed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Although on the surface these cases require only a straightforward application of the APA, closer scrutiny reveals serious constitutional questions lurking beneath.

But while it is easy to see the promulgation of interpretative rules as an \"executive\" function-executive officials necessarily interpret the laws they enforce-it is difficult to see what authority the President has \"to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated parties.\" That definition suggests something much closer to the legislative power, which our Constitution does not permit the Executive to exercise in this manner. Because these troubling questions are not directly implicated here, I leave them for another case. See\n    <em>\n     Department of Transportation v.

Although almost all rulemaking is today accomplished through informal notice and comment, the APA actually contemplated a much more formal process for most rulemaking. To that end, it provided for elaborate trial-like hearings in which proponents of particular rules would introduce evidence and bear the burden of proof in support of those proposed rules. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20556\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    Today, however, formal rulemaking is the Yeti of administrative law. There are isolated sightings of it in the ratemaking context, but elsewhere it proves elusive. It is somewhat ironic for the Court so adamantly to insist that agencies be subject to no greater procedures than those required by the APA when we have not been adamant in requiring agencies to comply with even those baseline procedures.

This argument has its root in the support for administrative agencies that developed during the Progressive Era in this country. The Era was marked by a move from the individualism that had long characterized American society to the concept of a society organized for collective action. See A. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era 1910-1917, p. 1 (1954). That move also reflected a deep disdain for the theory of popular sovereignty. As Woodrow Wilson wrote before he attained the presidency, \"Our peculiar American difficulty in organizing administration is not the danger of losing liberty, but the danger of not being able or willing to separate its essentials from its accidents. Our success is made doubtful by that besetting error of ours, the error of trying to do too much by vote.\" Wilson, The Study of Administration, 2 Pol. Sci. Q. 197, 214 (1887). In President Wilson's view, public criticism would be beneficial in the formation of overall policy, but \"a clumsy nuisance\" in the daily life of Government-\"a rustic handling delicate machinery.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 215. Reflecting this belief that bureaucrats might more effectively govern the country than the American people, the progressives ushered in significant expansions of the administrative state, ultimately culminating in the New Deal. See generally M. Keller, Regulating a New Economy: Public Policy and Economic Change in America, 1900-1933 (1990).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
