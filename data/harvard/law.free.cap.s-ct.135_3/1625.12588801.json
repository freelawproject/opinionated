In each of the two cases we resolve here, the claimant missed one of those deadlines, but requested equitable tolling on the ground that she had a good reason for filing late. The Government responded that \u00a7 2401(b)'s time limits are not subject to tolling because they are jurisdictional restrictions. Today, we reject the Government's argument and conclude that courts may toll both of the FTCA's limitations periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the first case, respondent Kwai Fun Wong asserts that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) falsely imprisoned her for five days in 1999. As the FTCA requires, Wong first presented that claim to the INS within two years of the alleged unlawful action. See \u00a7 2401(b); \u00a7 2675(a). The INS denied the administrative complaint on December 3, 2001. Under the Act, that gave Wong six months, until June 3, 2002, to bring her tort claim in federal court. See \u00a7 2401(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several months prior to the INS's decision, Wong had filed suit in federal district court asserting various\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -FTCA claims against the Government arising out of the same alleged misconduct. Anticipating the INS's ruling, Wong moved in mid-November 2001 to amend the complaint in that suit by adding her tort claim. On April 5, 2002, a Magistrate Judge recommended granting Wong leave to amend. But the District Court did not finally adopt that proposal until June 25-three weeks\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the FTCA's 6-month deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Government moved to dismiss the tort claim on the ground that it was filed late. The District Court at first rejected the motion. It recognized that Wong had managed to add her FTCA claim only after \u00a7 2401(b)'s 6-month time period had expired. But the court equitably tolled that period for all the time between the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and its own order allowing amendment, thus\n   bringing Wong's FTCA claim within the statutory deadline. Several years later, the Government moved for reconsideration of that ruling based on an intervening Ninth Circuit decision. This time, the District Court dismissed Wong's claim, reasoning that \u00a7 2401(b)'s 6-month time bar was jurisdictional and therefore not subject to equitable tolling. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed to hear the case en banc to address an intra-circuit conflict on the issue. The en banc court held that the 6-month limit is not jurisdictional and that equitable tolling is available.\n   <em>\n    Kwai Fun Wong v. Beebe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709533\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1030/\">\n    732 F.3d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). It then confirmed the District Court's prior ruling that the circumstances here justify tolling because Wong \"exercis [ed] due diligence\" in attempting to amend her complaint before the statutory deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second case before us arises from a deadly highway accident. Andrew Booth was killed in 2005 when a car in which he was riding crossed through a cable median barrier and crashed into oncoming traffic. The following year, respondent Marlene June, acting on behalf of Booth's young son, filed a wrongful death action alleging that the State of Arizona and its contractor had negligently constructed and maintained the median barrier. Years into that state-court litigation, June contends, she discovered that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) had approved installation of the barrier knowing it had not been properly crash tested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relying on that new information, June presented a tort claim to the FHWA in 2010, more than five years after the accident. The FHWA denied the claim, and June promptly filed this action in federal district court. The court dismissed the suit because June had failed to submit her claim to the FHWA within two years of the collision. The FTCA's 2-year bar, the court ruled, is jurisdictional and therefore not subject to equitable tolling; accordingly, the court did not consider June's contention that tolling was proper because the Government had concealed its failure to require crash testing. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed in light of its recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Wong,\n   </em>\n   thus holding that \u00a7 2401(b)'s 2-year deadline, like its 6-month counterpart, is not jurisdictional and may be tolled.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=550%20Fed.%20Appx.%20505\">\n    550 Fed.Appx. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We granted certiorari in both cases, 573 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582840,12582841,12582842,12582843,12582844,12582845\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2873/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582984,12582985,12582986,12582987,12582839,12582841,12582844\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/831/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (2014), to resolve a circuit split about whether courts may equitably toll \u00a7 2401(b)'s two time limits.

It states that \"[a] tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented [to the agency] within two years ... or unless action is begun within six months\" of the agency's denial of the claim. That is mundane statute-of-limitations language, saying only what every time bar, by definition, must: that after a certain time a claim is barred. See\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   at 1634, n. 7 (citing many similarly worded limitations statutes). The language is mandatory-\"shall\" be barred-but (as just noted) that is true of most such statutes, and we have consistently found it of no consequence.

So too here. Whereas \u00a7 2401(b)houses the FTCA's time limitations, a different section of Title 28 confers power on federal district courts to hear FTCA claims. See \u00a7 1346(b)(1)(\"district courts ... shall have exclusive jurisdiction\" over tort claims against the United States). Nothing conditions the jurisdictional grant on the limitations periods, or otherwise links those separate provisions. Treating \u00a7 2401(b)'s time bars as jurisdictional would thus disregard the structural divide built into the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, even assuming legislative history alone could provide a clear statement (which we doubt), none does so here. The report accompanying the FTCA did not discuss whether \u00a7 2401(b)'s time limits are jurisdictional. See S.Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946). And in amending \u00a7 2401(b)four times after its enactment, Congress declined again (four times over) to say anything specific about whether the statute of limitations imposes a jurisdictional bar. Congress thus failed to provide anything like the clear statement this Court has demanded before deeming a statute of limitations to curtail a court's power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   And so we wind up back where we started, with\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   's \"general rule\" that equitable tolling is available in suits against the Government.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p95\">\n    498 U.S., at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p95\">\n    111 S.Ct. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The justification the Government offers for departing from that principle fails: Section 2401(b)is not a jurisdictional requirement. The time limits in the FTCA are just time limits, nothing more. Even though they govern litigation against the Government, a court can toll them on equitable grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Government balks at that straightforward analysis, claiming that it overlooks\n   two reasons for thinking \u00a7 2401(b)jurisdictional. But neither of those reasons is persuasive. Indeed, our precedents in this area foreclose them both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Government principally contends that \u00a7 2401(b)is jurisdictional because it includes the same language as the statute of limitations governing contract (and some other non-tort) suits brought against the United States under the Tucker Act.

When Congress drafted the FTCA's time bar, it used the same \"shall be forever barred\" language (though selecting a shorter limitations period). \"In these circumstances,\" the Government maintains, \"the only reasonable conclusion is that Congress intended the FTCA's identically worded time limit to be a jurisdictional bar.\" Brief for United States in\n   <em>\n    Wong\n   </em>\n   21-22.

To the contrary, we have construed the very same \"shall be forever barred\" language in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b, the Clayton Act's statute of limitations, to be subject to tolling; nothing in that provision, we found, \"restrict[s] the power of the federal courts\" to extend a limitations period when circumstances warrant.\n   <em>\n    American Pipe &amp; Constr.

Tr. of Oral Arg. in\n   <em>\n    Irwin,\n   </em>\n   O.T. 1990, No. 89-5867, p. 30. Or, put just a bit differently: Congress's inclusion of a phrase endemic to limitations statutes of that era, at least some of which allow tolling, cannot provide the requisite clear statement that a time bar curtails a court's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Indeed, in two decisions directly addressing the Tucker Act's statute of limitations, this Court dismissed the idea that the language the Government relies on here has jurisdictional significance. Twice we described the words in that provision as not meaningfully different from those in a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations. And twice we made clear that the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act's time bar has precious little to do with its phrasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We first did so in\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   . Using our newly minted presumption, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1631, we decided there that the limitations period governing Title VII suits against the Government, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1988 ed.), allowed equitable tolling. In reaching that conclusion, we compared \u00a7 2000e-16(c)'s text (then stating that an employee \"may file a civil action\" within 30 days of an agency's denial of her claim) with the language of the Tucker Act's time bar. We noted that we had formerly held the Tucker Act's limitations statute to \"jurisdictionally bar[ ]\" late claims, and we acknowledged the possibility of justifying that different treatment by characterizing its \"language [as] more stringent than\" \u00a7 2000e-16(c)'s.\n   <em>\n    Irwin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p95\">\n    498 U.S., at 94-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p95\">\n    111 S.Ct. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But we rejected that reasoning, instead finding that the two formulations were materially alike. \"[W]e are not persuaded,\" we stated, \"that the difference between them is enough to manifest a different congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p95\">\n    111 S.Ct. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Leaving for another day the question of what\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   account for the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act's time bar, the Court thus ruled out reliance on its language. In other words, on the core question the Government raises here-whether the phrase \"shall be forever barred,\" as used in both the Tucker Act and the FTCA, manifests a congressional decision to preclude tolling-\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   said no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   More recently,\n   <em>\n    John R. Sand\n   </em>\n   reaffirmed that conclusion, even as it refused to overturn our century-old view that the Tucker Act's time bar is jurisdictional. No less than three times,\n   <em>\n    John R. Sand\n   </em>\n   approvingly repeated\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   's statement that the\n   textual differences between the Tucker Act's time bar and \u00a7 2000e-16(c)were insignificant-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that the language of the two provisions could not explain why the former was jurisdictional and the latter not.

Yes, we have held that the Tucker Act's time bar, which includes those same words, constrains a court's power to hear late claims.

The words on which the Government pins its hopes are just the words of a limitations statute of a particular era. And nothing else supports the Government's claim that Congress, when enacting the FTCA, wanted to incorporate this Court's view of the Tucker Act's time bar-much less that Congress expressed that purported intent with the needed clear statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Government next contends that at the time of the FTCA's enactment, Congress thought that\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   limitations statute applying to suits against the United States, however framed or worded, cut off a court's jurisdiction over untimely claims. On that view, the particular language of those statutes makes no difference. All that matters is that such time limits function as conditions on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity. In that era-indeed, up until\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   was decided-those conditions were generally supposed to be \"strictly observed.\"\n   <em>\n    Soriano,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160625\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/352/270/#p273\">\n    352 U.S., at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160625\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/352/270/#p273\">\n    77 S.Ct. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That meant, the Government urges, that all time limits on actions against the United States \"carr[ied] jurisdictional consequences.\" Brief for United States in\n   <em>\n    Wong\n   </em>\n   34. Accordingly, the Government concludes, Congress \"would have expected courts to apply [\u00a7 2401(b)] as a jurisdictional requirement-just as conditions on waivers\n   of sovereign immunity had always been applied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Irwin,\n   </em>\n   however, forecloses that argument.

And the Court doubted that the former approach so well reflected congressional intent: On the contrary, because equitable tolling \"amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver,\" we thought that a rule generally\n   <em>\n    allowing\n   </em>\n   tolling is the more \"realistic assessment of legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219498\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/89/#p95\">\n    111 S.Ct. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1631.

But the rebuttal cannot rely on what\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   itself deemed irrelevant-that Congress passed the statute in an earlier era, when this Court often attached jurisdictional consequence to conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity. Rather, the rebuttal must identify something distinctive about the time limit at issue, whether enacted then or later-a reason for thinking Congress wanted\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   limitations statute (not all statutes passed in an earlier day) to curtail a court's jurisdiction. On the Government's contrary view,\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   would effectively become only a prospective decision.

As compared to other waivers of immunity (prominently including the Tucker Act), the FTCA treats the United States more like a commoner than like the Crown. The FTCA's jurisdictional provision states that courts may hear suits \"under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). And when\n   defining substantive liability for torts, the Act reiterates that the United States is accountable \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual.\" \u00a7 2674. In keeping with those provisions, this Court has often rejected the Government's calls to cabin the FTCA on the ground that it waives sovereign immunity-and indeed, the Court did so in the years immediately after the Act's passage, even as it was construing\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   waivers of immunity narrowly.

Congress can provide that signal by making a statute of limitations jurisdictional. But that requires its own plain statement; otherwise, we treat a time bar as a mere claims-processing rule.

Long before the FTCA, Congress authorized suits against the Government for contract and property claims under the Tucker Act and a number of predecessor statutes, but the Tucker Act excluded tort claims from its waiver of sovereign immunity. The concern was obvious: As opposed to the more predictable nature of contractual and property claims, tort-based harms are sometimes unperceived and open-ended. Even frivolous claims require the Federal Government to expend administrative and litigation costs, which ultimately fall upon society at-large. For every dollar spent to defend against or to satisfy a tort claim against the United States, the Government must either raise taxes or shift funds originally allocated to different public programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To reduce these risks, Congress placed strict limits on the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity.

If not filed with the agency within two years, or with a federal court within six months, a claim \"shall be\" \"barred\" \"forever.\" \"Shall be forever barred\" is not generally understood to mean \"should be allowed sometimes.\" The statute brooks no exceptions.

It says unequivocally that untimely tort claims against the United States \"shall be forever barred.\" Although it does not use the word \"jurisdiction,\" it speaks at least as much to the courts (who are \"forever barred\" from considering untimely claims) as it does to claimants (who are \"forever barred\" from bringing stale claims). More important, though, the words in \u00a7 2401(b)have a well-known meaning that\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   labels cannot overcome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The majority tells us this \"old 'ad hoc,' law-by-law approach\"-also known as\n   <em>\n    statutory interpretation\n   </em>\n   -has been replaced with a broad presumption in favor of equitable tolling and a judicial preference against jurisdictional labels.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1630 - 1631. I dispute the premise. But in any event, as I explained above, and as six Members of the current Court held in\n   <em>\n    John R.

Even if we would rather not call \u00a7 2401(b)'s deadlines \"jurisdictional,\" with all that label entails, we must nonetheless recognize that Congress never meant to allow equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The majority avoids this latter point by declining to give it any separate attention. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1631, n. 2. But we cannot conflate the two questions because, though the relevant evidence is the same, the analysis is different. In particular, the majority is wrong to rely on\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   when assessing the jurisdictional question, which is the only question it really decides. We do not indulge\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   's presumption when determining whether a requirement is jurisdictional.

But the Government makes no independent arguments in support of that position; instead, it relies (and even then implicitly) on the same indicia of congressional intent that, in its view, show that \u00a7 2401(b)'s time limits are jurisdictional. See\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1633 - 1634, 1636 - 1637.

See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1644 - 1645 (opinion of ALITO, J.). We do not understand the point-or more precisely, why the dissent thinks the ordering matters. When Congress makes a time bar in a suit against the Government jurisdictional, one could say (as the dissent does) that\n    <em>\n     Irwin\n    </em>\n    does not apply, or one could say (as we do) that\n    <em>\n     Irwin\n    </em>\n    's presumption is conclusively rebutted. The bottom line is the same: Tolling is not available. We frame the inquiry as we do in part because that is how the Government presented the issue. See Brief for United States in\n    <em>\n     Wong\n    </em>\n    19 (\"One way to show that [\n    <em>\n     Irwin\n    </em>\n    's presumption is rebutted] is to establish that the statutory time limit is a 'jurisdictional' restriction\"). And we think that choice makes especially good sense in these cases because various aspects of\n    <em>\n     Irwin\n    </em>\n    's reasoning are central to considering the parties' positions on whether \u00a7 2401(b)is jurisdictional. See\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1635 - 1638.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The dissent argues that nonjurisdictional time limits typically mention claimants, whereas \u00a7 2401(b)does not. See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1643. But none of our precedents have either said or suggested that such a difference matters-that, for example, a statute barring a \"tort claim\" is jurisdictional, but one barring a \"person's tort claim\" is not.
