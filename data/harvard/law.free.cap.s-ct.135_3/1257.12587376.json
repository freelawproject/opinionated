We find that the District Court applied incorrect legal standards in evaluating the claims. We consequently vacate its decision\n   and remand the cases for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Alabama Constitution requires the legislature to reapportion its State House and Senate electoral districts following each decennial census. Ala. Const., Art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 199-200. In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the State's 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts. 2012 Ala. Acts no. 602 (House plan);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at no. 603 (Senate plan) (Acts). In doing so, Alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting objectives, such as compactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and protecting incumbents. But it placed yet greater importance on achieving two other goals. See Alabama Legislature Reapportionment Committee Guidelines in No. 12-cv-691, Doc. 30-4, pp. 3-5 (Committee Guidelines).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, it sought to minimize the extent to which a district might deviate from the theoretical ideal of precisely equal population. In particular, it set as a goal creating a set of districts in which no district would deviate from the theoretical, precisely equal ideal by more than 1%-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a more rigorous deviation standard than our precedents have found necessary under the Constitution. See\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Thomson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194994\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/835/#p842\">\n    462 U.S. 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194994\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/835/#p842\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194994\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/835/#p842\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983)(5% deviation from ideal generally permissible). No one here doubts the desirability of a State's efforts generally to come close to a one-person, one-vote ideal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, it sought to ensure compliance with federal law, and, in particular, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Stat.%20439\">\n    79 Stat. 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .At the time of the redistricting Alabama was a covered jurisdiction under that Act. Accordingly \u00a7 5 of the Act required Alabama to demonstrate that an electoral change, such as redistricting, would not bring about retrogression in respect to racial minorities' \"ability ... to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010304\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Specifically, Alabama believed that, to avoid retrogression under \u00a7 5, it was required to maintain roughly the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority districts. See Appendix B,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Compliance with these two goals posed particular difficulties with respect to many of the State's 35 majority-minority districts (8 in the Senate, 27 in the House). That is because many of these districts were (compared with the average district) underpopulated. In order for Senate District 26, for example, to meet the State's no-more-than-1% population-deviation objective, the State would have to add about 16,000 individuals to the district. And, prior to redistricting, 72.75% of District 26's population was black. Accordingly, Alabama's plan added 15,785 new individuals, and only 36 of those newly added individuals were white.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This suit, as it appears before us, focuses in large part upon Alabama's efforts to achieve these two goals. The Caucus and the Conference basically claim that the State, in adding so many new minority voters to majority-minority districts (and to others), went too far. They allege the State created a constitutionally forbidden \"racial gerrymander\"-a gerrymander that (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   when the State adds more minority voters than needed for a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice) might, among other things, harm the very minority voters that Acts such as the Voting Rights Act sought to help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After a bench trial, the Federal District Court held in favor of the State,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   against the Caucus and the Conference, with respect to their racial gerrymandering\n   claims as well as with respect to several other legal claims that the Caucus and the Conference had made. With respect to racial gerrymandering, the District Court recognized that electoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when (1) race is the \"dominant and controlling\" or \"predominant\" consideration in deciding \"to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Such evidence is perfectly relevant. We have said that the plaintiff's burden in a racial gerrymandering case is \"to show, either through circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   515 U.S., at 916,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563963\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/900/#p913\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That Alabama expressly adopted and applied a policy of prioritizing mechanical racial targets above all other districting criteria (save one-person, one-vote) provides evidence that race motivated the drawing of particular lines in multiple districts in the State. And neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show widespread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts into a separate, general claim that the legislature racially gerrymandered the State \"as\" an undifferentiated \"whole.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We, like the principal dissent, recognize that the plaintiffs could have presented their district-specific claims more clearly,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1277 - 1278, 1279 - 1280 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), but the dissent properly concedes that its objection would weaken had the Conference \"developed such a claim in the course of discovery and trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1277. And that is just what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the past few pages and in Appendix A, we set forth the many record references that establish this fact. The Caucus helps to explain the complaint omissions when it tells us that the plaintiffs unearthed the\n   factual basis for their racial gerrymandering claims when they deposed the committee's redistricting expert. See Brief for Appellants in No. 13-895, pp. 12-13. The State neither disputes this procedural history nor objects that plaintiffs' pleadings failed to conform with the proof. Indeed, throughout, the plaintiffs litigated these claims not as if they were wholly separate entities but as if they were a team. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Caucus Post-Trial Brief 1 (\"[We] support the additional claims made by the [Conference] plaintiffs\"); but cf.\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1275 - 1280 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (treating separately Conference claims from Caucus claims). Thus we, like the dissenting judge below (who also lived with these cases through trial), conclude that the record as a whole shows that the plaintiffs brought, and their argument rested significantly upon, district-specific claims. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314207\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/989/1227/#p1287\">\n    989 F.Supp.2d, at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Thompson, J., dissenting) (construing plaintiffs as also challenging \"each majority-Black House and Senate District\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The principal dissent adds that the Conference waived its district-specific claims on appeal. Cf.\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1278. But that is not so. When asked specifically about its position at oral argument, the Conference stated that it was relying on statewide evidence to prove its district-specific challenges. Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16. Its counsel said that \"the exact same policy was applied in every black-majority district,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 15, and \"[b]y statewide, we simply mean a common policy applied to every district in the State,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 16. We accept the Conference's clarification, which is consistent with how it presented these claims below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We consequently conclude that the District Court's analysis of racial gerrymandering of the State \"as a whole\" was legally erroneous. We find that the appellants did not waive their right to consideration of their claims as applied to particular districts. Accordingly, we remand the cases. See\n   <em>\n    Pullman-Standard v.

Dr. Reed's testimony supports, and nothing in that record undermines, the Conference's own statement, in its post-trial brief, that it is a \"statewide political caucus founded in 1960.\" Conference Post-Trial Brief 3. It has the \"purpose\" of \"endors[ing] candidates for political office who will be responsible to the needs of the blacks and other minorities and poor people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. These two statements (the second of which the principal dissent ignores), taken together with Dr. Reed's testimony, support an inference that the organization has members in all of the State's majority-minority districts, other things being equal, which is sufficient to meet the Conference's burden of establishing standing. That is to say, it seems highly likely that a \"statewide\" organization with members in \"almost every county,\" the purpose of which is to help \"blacks and other minorities and poor people,\" will have members in each majority-minority district. But cf\n   <em>\n    . post,\n   </em>\n   at 1275 - 1277 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At the very least, the common sense inference is strong enough to lead the Conference reasonably to believe that, in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for more detailed information, it need not provide additional information such as a specific membership list. We have found nothing in the record, nor has the State referred us to anything in the record, that suggests the contrary. Cf. App. 204-205, 208 (State arguing lack of standing, not because of inadequate member residency but because an association \"lives\" nowhere and that the Conference should join individual members). The most the State argued was that \"[n]one of the\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   [p]laintiffs [who brought the case with the Conference] claims to live in\" Senate District 11,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 205 (emphasis added), but the Conference would likely not have understood that argument as a request that\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   provide a membership list. In fact, the Conference might have understood the argument as an indication that the State did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contest its membership in every district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To be sure, the District Court had an independent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction, even in the absence of a state challenge. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1276 - 1277 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But, in these circumstances, elementary principles of procedural fairness required that the District Court, rather than acting\n   <em>\n    sua sponte,\n   </em>\n   give the Conference an opportunity to provide evidence of member residence.

In our view, however, the District Court did not properly calculate \"predominance.\" In particular, it judged race to lack \"predominance\" in part because it placed in the balance, among other nonracial factors, legislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal population.

And there is a reason for that omission. The reason that equal population objectives do not appear on this list of \"traditional\" criteria is that equal population objectives play a different role in a State's redistricting process. That role is not a minor one. Indeed, in light of the Constitution's demands, that role may often prove \"predominant\" in the ordinary sense of that word. But, as the United\n   States points out, \"predominance\" in the context of a racial gerrymandering claim is special. It is not about whether a legislature believes that the need for equal population takes ultimate priority. Rather, it is, as we said, whether the legislature \"placed\" race \"above traditional districting considerations in determining\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   persons were placed\n   <em>\n    in appropriately apportioned districts\n   </em>\n   .\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   19 (some emphasis added). In other words, if the legislature must place 1,000 or so additional voters in a particular district in order to achieve an equal population goal, the \"predominance\" question concerns\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   voters the legislature decides to choose, and specifically whether the legislature predominately uses race as opposed to other, \"traditional\" factors when doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Consequently, we agree with the United States that the requirement that districts have approximately equal populations is a background rule against which redistricting takes place.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 12. It is not a factor to be treated like other nonracial factors when a court determines whether race predominated over other, \"traditional\" factors in the drawing of district boundaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Had the District Court not taken a contrary view of the law, its \"predominance\" conclusions, including those concerning the four districts that the Conference specifically challenged, might well have been different. For example, once the legislature's \"equal population\" objectives are put to the side-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   seen as a background principle-then there is strong, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26, the one district that the parties have discussed here in depth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The legislators in charge of creating the redistricting plan believed, and told their technical adviser, that a primary redistricting goal was to maintain existing racial percentages in each majority-minority district, insofar as feasible. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1278 - 1279 (compiling extensive record testimony in support of this point). There is considerable evidence that this goal had a direct and significant impact on the drawing of at least some of District 26's boundaries. See 3 Tr. 175-180 (testimony of Hinaman); Appendix C,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   (change of district's shape from rectangular to irregular). Of the 15,785 individuals that the new redistricting laws added to the population of District 26, just 36 were white-a remarkable feat given the local demographics. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   2 Tr. 127-128 (testimony of Senator Quinton Ross); 3 Tr. 179 (testimony of Hinaman). Transgressing their own redistricting guidelines, Committee Guidelines 3-4, the drafters split seven precincts between the majority-black District 26 and the majority-white District 25, with the population in those precincts clearly divided on racial lines. See Exh. V in Support of Newton Plaintiffs' Opposition to Summary Judgment in No. 12-cv-691, Doc. 140-1, pp. 91-95. And the District Court conceded that race \"was a factor in the drawing of District 26,\" and that the legislature \"preserved\" \"the percentage of the population that was black.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314207\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/989/1227/#p1287\">\n    989 F.Supp.2d, at 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We recognize that the District Court also found, with respect to District 26, that \"preservi[ng] the core of the existing [d]istrict,\" following \"county lines,\" and following \"highway lines\" played an important boundary-drawing role.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314207\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/989/1227/#p1287\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314207\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/989/1227/#p1287\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   But the first of these (core preservation) is not directly relevant to the origin of the\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   district inhabitants; the second (county lines) seems of marginal importance since virtually all Senate District 26 boundaries departed from county lines; and the third (highways) was not mentioned in the legislative\n   redistricting guidelines. Cf. Committee Guidelines 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   All this is to say that, with respect to District 26 and likely others as well, had the District Court treated equal population goals as background factors, it might have concluded that race was the predominant boundary-drawing consideration. Thus, on remand, the District Court should reconsider its \"no predominance\" conclusions with respect to Senate District 26 and others to which our analysis is applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, we note that our discussion in this section is limited to correcting the District Court's misapplication of the \"predominance\" test for strict scrutiny discussed in\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   515 U.S., at 916,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563963\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/900/#p913\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 5, which covered particular States and certain other jurisdictions, does not require a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage. It requires the jurisdiction to maintain a minority's ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice. That is precisely what the language of the statute says. It prohibits a covered jurisdiction from adopting any change that \"has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of [the minority group] to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010304\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b); see also \u00a7 10304(d)(the \"purpose of subsection (b) ... is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   That is also just what Department of Justice Guidelines say.

We agree. Section 5 does not require maintaining the same population percentages in majority-minority districts as in the prior plan. Rather, \u00a7 5 is satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The history of \u00a7 5 further supports this view.

Ashcroft,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898256\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/461/#p480\">\n    539 U.S. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898256\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/461/#p480\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898256\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/461/#p480\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003)(holding that it is not necessarily retrogressive for a State to replace safe majority-minority districts with crossover or influence districts), and it adopted the views of the dissent. H.R.Rep. No. 109-478, pp. 68-69, and n. 183(2006). While the thrust of Justice Souter's dissent was that, in a \u00a7 5 retrogression case, courts should ask whether a new voting provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to elect a candidate of their choice-language that Congress adopted in revising \u00a7 5-his dissent also made clear that courts should not mechanically rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all significant circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Georgia v. Ashcroft, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 493, 498, 505, 509,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898256\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/461/#p480\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while the revised language of \u00a7 5 may raise some interpretive questions-\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   its application to coalition, crossover, and influence districts-it is clear that Congress did not mandate that a 1% reduction in a 70% black population district would be necessarily retrogressive. See Persily, The Promises and Pitfalls of the New Voting Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20Yale%20L.J.%20174\">\n    117 Yale L.J. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (2007). Indeed, Alabama's mechanical interpretation of \u00a7 5 can raise serious constitutional concerns. See\n   <em>\n    Miller, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 926,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563963\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/900/#p913\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The record makes clear that both the District Court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression. See Appendix B,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . And the difference between that view and the more purpose-oriented view reflected in the statute's language can matter. Imagine a majority-minority district with a 70% black population. Assume also that voting in that district, like that in the State itself, is racially polarized. And assume that the district has long elected to office black voters' preferred candidate. Other things being equal, it would seem highly unlikely that a redistricting plan that, while increasing the numerical size of the district, reduced the percentage of the black population from, say, 70% to 65% would have a significant impact on the black voters' ability to elect their preferred candidate. And, for that reason, it would be difficult to explain just why a plan that uses racial criteria predominately to maintain the black population at 70% is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve a \"compelling state interest,\" namely the interest in preventing \u00a7 5 retrogression. The circumstances of this hypothetical example, we add, are close to those characterizing Senate District 26, as set forth in the District Court's opinion and throughout the record. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   1 Tr. 131-132 (testimony of Dial); 3 Tr. 180 (testimony of Hinaman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In saying this, we do not insist that a legislature guess precisely what percentage reduction a court or the Justice Department might eventually find to be retrogressive. The law cannot insist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine\n   <em>\n    precisely\n   </em>\n   what percent minority population \u00a7 5 demands. The standards of \u00a7 5 are complex; they often require evaluation of controverted claims about voting behavior; the evidence may be unclear; and, with respect to any particular district, judges may disagree about the proper outcome. The law cannot lay a\n   trap for an unwary legislature, condemning its redistricting plan as either (1) unconstitutional racial gerrymandering should the legislature place a few too many minority voters in a district or (2) retrogressive under \u00a7 5 should the legislature place a few too few. See\n   <em>\n    Vera,\n   </em>\n   517 U.S., at 977,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11747615\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/952/#p958\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (principal opinion). Thus, we agree with the United States that a court's analysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a \"strong basis in evidence\" in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.

These cases were consolidated before a three-judge District Court. Even after a full trial, the District Court lamented that \"[t]he filings and arguments made by the plaintiffs on these claims were mystifying at best.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314207\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/989/1227/#p1287\">\n    989 F.Supp.2d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1287 (M.D.Ala.2013).

However, rather than holding appellants to the misguided legal theory they presented to the District Court, it allows them to take a mulligan, remanding the case with orders that the District Court consider whether some (all?) of Alabama's 35 majority-minority districts result from impermissible racial gerrymandering. In doing this, the Court disregards the detailed findings and thoroughly reasoned conclusions of the District Court-in particular its determination, reached after watching the development of the case from complaint to trial, that no appellant proved (or even pleaded) district-specific claims with respect to the majority-minority districts. Worse still, the Court ignores the Democratic Conference's express waiver of these claims before this Court. It does this on the basis of a few stray comments, cherry-picked from district-court filings that are more Rorschach brief than Brandeis brief, in which the vague outline of what could be district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims begins to take shape only with the careful, post-hoc nudging of appellate counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Racial gerrymandering strikes at the heart of our democratic process, undermining the electorate's confidence in its government as representative of a cohesive body politic in which all citizens are equal before the law. It is therefore understandable, if not excusable, that the Court balks at denying merits review simply because appellants pursued a flawed litigation strategy. But allowing appellants a second bite at the apple invites lower courts similarly to depart from the premise that ours is an adversarial system whenever they deem the stakes sufficiently high.

Yet the Court concludes that this fact, combined with the Conference's self-description as a \" 'statewide political caucus' \" that endorses candidates for political office, \"supports an inference that the organization has members in all of the State's majority-minority districts, other things being equal.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1269. The Court provides no support for this theory of jurisdiction by illogical inference, perhaps because this Court has rejected other attempts to peddle more-likely-than-not standing.

Moreover, even in those counties in which the Conference does have members, we have no basis for concluding (or inferring) that those members vote in majority-minority districts. The Conference had plenty of opportunities, including at trial, to demonstrate that this was the case, and failed to do so. This failure lies with the Democratic Conference, and the consequences should be borne by it, not by the people of Alabama, who must now shoulder the expense of further litigation and the uncertainty that attends a resuscitated constitutional challenge to their legislative districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Incredibly, the Court thinks that \"elementary principles of procedural fairness\"\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   giving the Democratic Conference the opportunity to prove on appeal what it neglected to prove at trial.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1269 - 1270.

The circumstances in that case, however, are far afield. The organization of parents in that case had established organizational standing in the lower court by showing that it had members with children who would be subject to the school district's \"integration tiebreaker,\" which was applied at ninth grade. Brief for Respondents, O.T. 2006, No. 05-908, p. 16. By the time the case reached this Court, however, the youngest of these children had entered high school, and so would no longer be subject to the challenged policy.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we accepted a lodging that provided names of additional, younger children in order to show that the organization had not\n   <em>\n    lost\n   </em>\n   standing as a result of the long delay that often accompanies federal litigation. Here, by contrast, the Democratic Conference's lodging in the Supreme Court is its first attempt to show that it has members in the majority-minority districts. This is too little, too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But that is just the start. Even if the Democratic Conference\n   <em>\n    had standing to bring\n   </em>\n   district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims, there remains the question whether it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   bring them. Its complaint alleged three counts: (1) Violation of \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act, (2) Racial gerrymandering in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, and (3) \u00a7 1983 violations of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Complaint in No. 2:12-cv-1081, Doc. 1, pp. 17-18. The racial gerrymandering count alleged that \"Alabama Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 were drawn for the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportunity of minority voters to participate effectively in the political process,\" and that this \"racial gerrymandering by Alabama Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 violates the rights of Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 17. It made no reference to specific districts that were racially gerrymandered; indeed, the only particular jurisdictions mentioned\n   <em>\n    anywhere\n   </em>\n   in the complaint were Senate District 11, Senate District 22, Madison County Senate Districts, House District 73, and Jefferson and Montgomery County House Districts. None of the Senate Districts is majority-minority. Nor is House District 73. Jefferson County does, admittedly, contain 8 of the 27 majority-minority House Districts in Alabama, and Montgomery County contains another 4, making a total of 12. But they also contain 14 majority-white House Districts between them. In light of this, it is difficult to understand the Court's statement that appellants' \"evidence and ... arguments embody the claim that individual majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1266.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   That observation would, of course, make sense if the Democratic Conference had developed such a claim in the course of discovery and trial. But in its post-trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Conference hewed to its original charge of statewide racial gerrymandering-or, rather, it did so as much as it reasonably could without actually proposing that the Court find\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   racial gerrymandering, statewide or otherwise. Instead, the Conference chose only to pursue claims that Alabama violated \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act under two theories. See Democratic Conference Post-Trial Brief 91-103 (alleging a violation of the results prong of Voting Rights Act \u00a7 2) and 103-124 (alleging a violation of the purpose prong of Voting Rights Act \u00a7 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To be sure, the Conference employed language and presented factual claims at various points in its 126-page post-trial brief that are evocative of a claim of racial gerrymandering. But in clinging to these\n   stray comments to support its conclusion that the Conference made district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1266 - 1267, the Court ignores the context in which these comments appear-the context of a clear Voting Rights Act \u00a7 2 claim. Voting Rights Act claims and racial-gerrymandering claims share some of the same elements. See\n   <em>\n    League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p514\">\n    548 U.S. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p514\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p514\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006)(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Thus, allegations made in the course of arguing a \u00a7 2 claim will often be indistinguishable from allegations that would be made in support of a racial-gerrymandering claim. The appearance of such allegations in one of the Conference's briefs might support reversal if this case came to us on appeal from the District Court's grant of a motion to dismiss. See\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. City of Shelby,\n   </em>\n   574 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592388\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/346/#p346\">\n    135 S.Ct. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592388\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/346/#p346\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014)(\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ) (noting that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \"do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted\"). But here the District Court held a full trial before concluding that the Conference failed to make or prove any district-specific racial-gerrymandering claims with respect to the majority-minority districts. In this posture, and on this record, I cannot agree with the Court that the Conference's district-specific evidence, clearly made in the course of arguing a \u00a7 2 theory, should be read to give rise to district-specific claims of racial gerrymandering with respect to Alabama's majority-minority districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court attempts to shift responsibility for the Democratic Conference's ill-fated statewide theory from the Conference to the District Court, implying that it was the \"legally erroneous\" analysis of the District Court,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1268, rather than the arguments made by the Conference, that conjured this \"legal unicorn,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1265 - 1266, so that the Conference did not forfeit the claims that the Court now attributes to it,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1268. I suspect this will come as a great surprise to the Conference. Whatever may have been presented to the District Court, the Conference unequivocally stated in its opening brief: \"Appellants challenge Alabama's race-based statewide redistricting policy,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the design of any one particular election district.\" Brief for Appellants in No. 13-1138, p. 2 (emphasis added). It drove the point home in its reply brief: \"[I]f the Court were to apply a predominant-motive and narrow-tailoring analysis, that analysis should be applied to the state's\n   <em>\n    policy,\n   </em>\n   not to the design of each particular district one-by-one.\" Reply Brief in No. 11-1138, p. 7. How could anything be clearer? As the Court observes, the Conference attempted to walk back this unqualified description of its case at oral argument.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1267 - 1268. Its assertion that what it\n   <em>\n    really\n   </em>\n   meant to challenge was the policy as applied to every district (\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   every majority-minority district, mind you) is not \"clarification,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1268, but an entirely new argument-indeed, the same argument it expressly disclaimed in its briefing. \"We will not revive a forfeited argument simply because the petitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief.\"\n   <em>\n    Republic of Argentina v.

The Alabama Legislative Black Caucus\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court does not bother to disentangle the independent claims brought by the Black Caucus from those of the Democratic Conference, but it strongly implies that both parties asserted racial-gerrymandering\n   claims with respect to Alabama's 35 majority-minority districts. As we have described, the Democratic Conference brought no such claims; and the Black Caucus's filings provide even weaker support for the Court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Black Caucus complaint contained three counts: (1) Violation of One Person, One Vote, see\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Sims,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/\">\n    377 U.S. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/\">\n    12 L.Ed.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964); (2) Dilution and Isolation of Black Voting Strength in violation of \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act; and (3) Partisan Gerrymandering. Complaint in No. 2:12-cv-691, Doc. 1, pp. 15-22. The failure to raise\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   racial-gerrymandering claim was not a mere oversight or the consequence of inartful pleading. Indeed, in its amended complaint the Black Caucus specifically cited this Court's leading racial-gerrymandering case for the proposition that \"traditional or neutral districting principles may not be subordinated in a dominant fashion by\n   <em>\n    either racial or partisan interests\n   </em>\n   absent a compelling state interest for doing so.\" Amended Complaint in No. 2:12-cv-691, Doc. 60, p. 23 (citing\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

This quote appears in the first paragraph under the \"Partisan Gerrymandering\" heading, and claims of subordination to\n   <em>\n    racial\n   </em>\n   interests are notably absent from the Black Caucus complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Racial gerrymandering was not completely ignored, however. In a brief introductory paragraph to the amended complaint, before addressing jurisdiction and venue, the Black Caucus alleged that \"Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 are racial gerrymanders that unnecessarily minimize population deviations and violate the whole-county provisions of the Alabama Constitution with both the purpose and effect of minimizing black voting strength and isolating from influence in the Alabama Legislature legislators chosen by African Americans.\" Amended Complaint, at 3. This was the first and last mention of racial gerrymandering, and like the Democratic Conference's complaint, it focused exclusively on the districting maps as a whole rather than individual districts. Moreover, even this allegation appears primarily concerned with the use of racially motivated districting as a means of violating one person, one vote (by splitting counties), and \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act (by minimizing and isolating black voters and legislators).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   To the extent the Black Caucus cited particular districts in the body of its complaint, it did so only with respect to its enumerated one-person, one-vote, Voting Rights Act, and partisan-gerrymandering counts. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 13-14 (alleging that the \"deviation restriction and disregard of the 'whole county' requirements ... facilitated the Republican majority's efforts to gerrymander the district boundaries in Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 for partisan purposes. By packing the majority-black House and Senate districts, the plans remove reliable Democratic voters from adjacent majority-white districts ...\");\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 36 (\"The partisan purpose of [one] gerrymander was to remove predominately black Madison County precincts to SD 1, avoiding a potential crossover district\");\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 44-45 (asserting that \"splitting Jefferson County among 11 House and Senate districts\" and \"increasing the size of its local legislative delegation and the number of other counties whose residents elect members\" of the delegation \"dilut[es] the votes of Jefferson County residents\" by diminishing their ability to control county-level legislation in the state legislature). And even these claims were made with a statewide scope in mind.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 55 (\"Viewed in their entirety, the plans in Acts 2012-602 and 2012-603 have the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportunities\n   for black and white voters who support the Democratic Party to elect candidates of their choice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Here again, discovery and trial failed to produce any clear claims with respect to the majority-minority districts. In a curious inversion of the Democratic Conference's practice of pleading racial gerrymandering and then effectively abandoning the claims, the Black Caucus, which failed to plead racial gerrymandering, did clearly advance the theory after the trial. See Alabama Legislative Black Caucus Plaintiffs' Post-Trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 2:12-cv-691, Doc. 194, pp. 48-51 (Black Caucus Post-Trial Brief). The Black Caucus asserted racial-gerrymandering claims in its post-trial brief, but they all had a clear statewide scope. It charged that Alabama \"started their line drawing with the majority-black districts\" so as to maximize the size of their black majorities, which \"impacted the drawing of majority-white districts in nearly every part of the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48-49. \"[R]ace was the predominant factor in drafting both plans,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 49, which \"drove nearly every districting decision,\" \"dilut [ing] the influence of black voters in the majority-white districts,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Black Caucus did present district-specific evidence in the course of developing its other legal theories. Although this included evidence that Alabama manipulated the racial composition of certain majority-minority districts, it also included evidence that Alabama manipulated racial distributions with respect to the districting maps as a whole,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 6 (\"Maintaining the same high black percentages had a predominant impact on the entire plan\"), and with respect to majority-white districts,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (\"Asked why [majority-white] SD 11 was drawn in a semi-donut-shape that splits St. Clair, Talladega, and Shelby Counties, Sen. Dial blamed that also on the need to preserve the black majorities in Jefferson County Senate districts\"), and 43-44 (\"Sen. Irons' quick, 'primative' [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] analysis of the new [majority-white] SD 1 convinced her that it was designed to 'shed' the minority population of Sen. Sanford's [majority-white] SD 7 to SD 1\" in order to \"crack a minority influence district\"). The Black Caucus was attacking the legislative districts from every angle. Nothing gives rise to an inference that it ever homed in on majority-minority districts-or, for that matter, any particular set of districts. Indeed, the fair reading of the Black Caucus's filings is that it was presenting illustrative evidence in particular districts-majority-minority, minority-influence, and majority-white-in an effort to make out a claim of statewide racial gerrymandering. The fact that the Court now concludes that this is not a valid legal theory does not justify its repackaging the claims for a second round of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Frankly, I do not know what to make of appellants' arguments. They are pleaded with such opacity that, squinting hard enough, one can find them to contain just about anything. This, the Court believes, justifies demanding that the District Court go back and squint harder, so that it may divine some new means of construing the filings. This disposition is based, it seems, on the implicit premise that plaintiffs only plead legally correct theories. That is a silly premise. We should not reward the practice of litigation by obfuscation, especially when we are dealing with a well-established legal claim that numerous plaintiffs have successfully brought in the past. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint and Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction in\n   <em>\n    Cromartie v. Hunt,\n   </em>\n   No. 4:96-cv-104 (EDNC), Doc. 21, p. 9 (\"Under the\n   March 1997 redistricting plan, the Twelfth District and First District have boundaries which were drawn pursuant to a predominantly racial motivation,\" which were \"the fruit of [earlier] racially gerrymandered plans\"). Even the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Shaw,\n   </em>\n   which established a cause of action for racial gerrymandering, displayed greater lucidity than appellants', alleging that defendants \"creat[ed] two amorphous districts which embody a scheme for segregation of voters by race in order to meet a racial quota\" \"totally unrelated to considerations of compactness, contiguous, and geographic or jurisdictional communities of interest.\" Complaint and Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction and for Temporary Restraining Order in\n   <em>\n    Shaw v. Barr,\n   </em>\n   No. 5:92-cv-202 (EDNC), Doc. 1, pp. 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court seems to acknowledge that appellants never focused their racial-gerrymandering claims on Alabama's majority-minority districts. While remanding to consider whether the majority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered, it admits that plaintiffs \"basically claim that the State, in adding so many new minority voters to majority-minority districts (\n   <em>\n    and to others\n   </em>\n   ), went too far.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1263 (emphasis added). It further concedes that appellants \"relied heavily upon statewide evidence,\" and that they \"also sought to prove that the use of race to draw the boundaries of the majority-minority districts affected the boundaries of other districts as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1267.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The only reason I see for the Court's selection of the majority-minority districts as the relevant set of districts for the District Court to consider on remand is that this was the set chosen by appellants after losing on the claim they actually presented in the District Court. By playing along with appellants' choose-your-own-adventure style of litigation, willingly turning back the page every time a strategic decision leads to a dead-end, the Court discourages careful litigation and punishes defendants who are denied both notice and repose. The consequences of this unprincipled decision will reverberate far beyond the narrow circumstances presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-111\">\n   Justice THOMAS, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \"[F]ew devices could be better designed to exacerbate racial tensions than the consciously segregated districting system currently being constructed in the name of the Voting Rights Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Holder v.

It began with racially segregated district maps that were inherited from previous decades. The maps produced by the 2001 redistricting contained 27 majority-black House districts and 8 majority-black Senate districts-both at the time they\n   were drawn, App. to Juris. Statement 47-48, and at the time of the 2010 Census, App. 103-108. Many of these majority-black districts were over 70% black when they were drawn in 2001, and even more were over 60% black. App. to Juris. Statement 47-48. Even after the 2010 Census, the population remained above 60% black in the majority of districts. App. 103-108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Under the 2006 amendments to \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Alabama was also under a federal command to avoid drawing new districts that would \"have the effect of diminishing the ability\" of black voters \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010304\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). To comply with \u00a7 5, the legislature adopted a policy of maintaining the same percentage of black voters within each of those districts as existed in the 2001 plans. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1270 - 1271. This, the districting committee thought, would preserve the ability of black voters to elect the same number of preferred candidates. App. to Juris. Statement 174-175. The Department of Justice (DOJ) apparently agreed. Acting under its authority to administer \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the DOJ precleared Alabama's plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Appellants-including the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and the Alabama Democratic Conference-saw matters differently. They sued Alabama, and on appeal they argue that the State's redistricting plans are racially gerrymandered because many districts are highly packed with black voters. According to appellants, black voters would have more voting power if they were spread over more districts rather than concentrated in the same number of districts as in previous decades. The DOJ has entered the fray in support of appellants, arguing that the State's redistricting maps fail strict scrutiny because the State focused too heavily on a single racial characteristic-the number of black voters in majority-minority districts-which potentially resulted in impermissible packing of black voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Like the DOJ, today's majority sides with appellants, faulting Alabama for choosing the wrong percentage of blacks in the State's majority-black districts, or at least for arriving at that percentage using the wrong reasoning. In doing so, the Court-along with appellants and the DOJ-exacerbates a problem many years in the making. It seems fitting, then, to trace that history here. The practice of creating highly packed-\"safe\"-majority-minority districts is the product of our erroneous jurisprudence, which created a system that forces States to segregate voters into districts based on the color of their skin. Alabama's current legislative districts have their genesis in the \"max-black\" policy that the DOJ itself applied to \u00a7 5 throughout the 1990's and early 2000's. The 2006 amendments to \u00a7 5 then effectively locked in place Alabama's max-black districts that were established during the 1990's and 2000's. These three problems-a jurisprudence requiring segregated districts, the distortion created by the DOJ's max-black policy, and the ossifying effects of the 2006 amendments-are the\n   primary culprits in this case, not Alabama's redistricting policy. Nor does this Court have clean hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This Court created the current system of race-based redistricting by adopting expansive readings of \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Both \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 5 prohibit States from implementing voting laws that \"den[y] or abridg[e] the right to vote on account of race or color.\" \u00a7\u00a7 10304(a), 10301(a). But both provisions extend to only certain types of voting laws: any \"voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   As I have previously explained, the terms \" 'standard, practice, or procedure' ... refer only to practices that affect minority citizens' access to the ballot,\" such as literacy tests.\n   <em>\n    Holder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39493\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/874/#p907\">\n    512 U.S. at 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39493\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/874/#p907\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion concurring in judgment).

Richard Pildes, who argued on behalf of the Alabama Democratic Conference in these cases, testified in congressional hearings on the 2006 amendments. He explained that\n   <em>\n    Georgia v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   \"recognizes room ... for some modest flexibility in Section 5,\" and warned that if \"Congress overturns\n   <em>\n    Georgia v.

Pildes also observed that the proposed standard of \"no 'diminished ability to elect' ... has a rigidity and a mechanical quality that can lock into place minority districts in the south at populations that do not serve minority voters' interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 12. Although this testimony says nothing about how \u00a7 5 ought to be interpreted, it tells us that the Alabama Democratic Conference's own attorney believes that the State was subject to a \"rigi[d]\" and \"mechanical\" standard in determining the number of black voters that must be maintained in a majority-black district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   All of this history explains Alabama's circumstances when it attempted to redistrict after the 2010 Census. The legislature began with the max-black district maps that it inherited from the days of Reed-Buskey. Using these inherited maps, combined with population data from the 2010 Census, many of the State's majority-black House and Senate districts were between 60% and 70% black, and some were over 70%. App. to Juris. Statement 103-108. And the State was prohibited from drawing new districts that would \"have the effect of diminishing the ability\" of blacks \"to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\" \u00a7 10304(b). The legislature\n   thus adopted a policy of maintaining the same number of majority-black districts and roughly the same percentage of blacks within each of those districts. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1270 - 1271.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The majority faults the State for taking this approach. I do not pretend that Alabama is blameless when it comes to its sordid history of racial politics. But, today the State is not the one that is culpable. Its redistricting effort was indeed tainted, but it was tainted by our voting rights jurisprudence and the uses to which the Voting Rights Act has been put. Long ago, the DOJ and special-interest groups like the ACLU hijacked the Act, and they have been using it ever since to achieve their vision of maximized black electoral strength, often at the expense of the voters they purport to help. States covered by \u00a7 5 have been whipsawed, first required to create \"safe\" majority-black districts, then told not to \"diminis[h]\" the ability to elect, and now told they have been too rigid in preventing any \"diminishing\" of the ability to elect.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1271 - 1272.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Worse, the majority's solution to the appellants' gerrymandering claims requires States to analyze race even\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   exhaustively, not less, by accounting for black voter registration and turnout statistics.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1271 - 1272.
