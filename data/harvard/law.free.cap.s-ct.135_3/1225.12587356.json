Later, Congress granted Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue \"metrics and standards\" that address the performance and scheduling of passenger railroad services. Alleging that the metrics and standards have substantial and adverse effects upon its members' freight services, respondent-the Association of American Railroads-filed this suit to challenge their validity. The defendants below, petitioners here, are the Department of Transportation, the FRA, and two individuals sued in their official capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondent alleges the metrics and standards must be invalidated on the ground that Amtrak is a private entity and it was therefore unconstitutional for Congress to allow and direct it to exercise joint authority in their issuance. This argument rests on the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause and the constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers. The District Court rejected both of respondent's claims. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, finding that, for purposes of this dispute, Amtrak is a private entity and that Congress violated nondelegation principles in its grant of joint authority to Amtrak and the FRA. On that premise the Court of Appeals invalidated the metrics and standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having granted the petition for writ of certiorari, 573 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582786,12582787,12582788,12582789,12582790,12582791\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2865/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582624,12582789,12582791,12582638,12582610\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/805/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), this Court now holds that, for purposes of determining the validity of the metrics and standards, Amtrak is a governmental entity. Although Amtrak's actions here were governmental, substantial questions respecting the lawfulness of the metrics and standards-including questions implicating the Constitution's structural separation of powers and the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2-may still remain in the case.

Congress recognized that Amtrak, of necessity, must rely for most of its operations on track systems owned by the freight railroads. So, as a condition of relief from their common-carrier duties, Congress required freight railroads to allow Amtrak to use their tracks and facilities at rates agreed to by the parties-or in the event of disagreement to be set by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20561\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562 (1970 ed.).

Since 1973, Amtrak has received a statutory preference over freight transportation in using rail lines, junctions, and crossings. See \u00a7 24308(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The metrics and standards at issue here are the result of a further and more recent enactment. Concerned by poor service, unreliability, and delays resulting from freight traffic congestion, Congress passed the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA) in 2008. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%204907\">\n    122 Stat. 4907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 207(a) of the PRIIA provides for the creation of the metrics and standards:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak shall jointly, in consultation with the Surface Transportation Board, rail carriers over whose rail lines Amtrak trains operate, States, Amtrak employees, nonprofit employee organizations representing Amtrak employees, and groups representing Amtrak passengers, as appropriate, develop new or improve existing metrics and minimum standards for measuring the performance and service quality of intercity passenger train operations, including cost recovery, on-time performance and minutes of delay, ridership, on-board services, stations, facilities, equipment, and other services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 4916.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 207(d) of the PRIIA further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"If the development of the metrics and standards is not completed within the 180-day period required by subsection (a), any party involved in the development of those standards may petition the Surface Transportation Board to appoint an arbitrator to assist the parties in resolving their disputes through binding arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 4917.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The PRIIA specifies that the metrics and standards created under \u00a7 207(a) are to be used for a variety of purposes. Section 207(b) requires the FRA to \"publish a quarterly report on the performance and service quality of intercity passenger train operations\" addressing the specific elements to be measured by the metrics and standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 4916-4917. Section 207(c) provides that, \"[t]o the extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carriers shall incorporate the metrics and standards developed under subsection (a) into their access and service agreements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 4917. And \u00a7 222(a) obliges Amtrak, within one year after the metrics and standards are established, to \"develop and implement a plan to improve on-board service pursuant to the metrics and standards for such service developed under [\u00a7 207(a) ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 4932.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under \u00a7 213(a) of the PRIIA, the metrics and standards also may play a role in prompting investigations by the STB and in subsequent enforcement actions. For instance, \"[i]f the on-time performance of any intercity passenger train averages less than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive calendar quarters,\" the STB may initiate an investigation \"to determine whether and to what extent delays ... are due to causes that could reasonably be addressed ... by\n   Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail operators.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 4925-4926. While conducting an investigation under \u00a7 213(a), the STB \"has authority to review the accuracy of the train performance data and the extent to which scheduling and congestion contribute to delays\" and shall \"obtain information from all parties involved and identify reasonable measures and make recommendations to improve the service, quality, and on-time performance of the train.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 4926. Following an investigation, the STB may award damages if it \"determines that delays or failures to achieve minimum standards ... are attributable to a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak over freight transportation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The STB is further empowered to \"order the host rail carrier to remit\" damages \"to Amtrak or to an entity for which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%204907\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In March 2009, Amtrak and the FRA published a notice in the Federal Register inviting comments on a draft version of the metrics and standards. App. 75-76. The final version of the metrics and standards was issued jointly by Amtrak and the FRA in May 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 129-144. The metrics and standards address, among other matters, Amtrak's financial performance, its scores on consumer satisfaction surveys, and the percentage of passenger-trips to and from underserved communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Of most importance for this case, the metrics and standards also address Amtrak's on-time performance and train delays caused by host railroads. The standards associated with the on-time performance metrics require on-time performance by Amtrak trains at least 80% to 95% of the time for each route, depending on the route and year.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 133-135. With respect to \"host-responsible delays\"-that is to say, delays attributed to the railroads along which Amtrak trains travel-the metrics and standards provide that \"[d]elays must not be more than 900 minutes per 10,000 Train-Miles.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 138. Amtrak conductors determine responsibility for particular delays.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.,\n   </em>\n   n. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the District Court for the District of Columbia, respondent alleged injury to its members from being required to modify their rail operations, which mostly involve freight traffic, to satisfy the metrics and standards. Respondent claimed that \u00a7 207 \"violates the nondelegation doctrine and the separation of powers principle by placing legislative and rulemaking authority in the hands of a private entity [Amtrak] that participates in the very industry it is supposed to regulate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 176-177, Complaint \u00b6 51. Respondent also asserted that \u00a7 207 violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause by \"[v]esting the coercive power of the government\" in Amtrak, an \"interested private part[y].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 177, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. In its prayer for relief respondent sought, among other remedies, a declaration of \u00a7 207's unconstitutionality and invalidation of the metrics and standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 177.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners on both claims. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4009261\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/865/22/\">\n    865 F.Supp.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.2012). Without deciding whether Amtrak must be deemed private or governmental, it rejected respondent's nondelegation argument on the ground that the FRA, the STB, and the political branches exercised sufficient control over promulgation and enforcement of the metrics and standards so that \u00a7 207 is constitutional. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court as to the nondelegation and separation of powers claim, reasoning\n   in central part that because \"Amtrak is a private corporation with respect to Congress's power to delegate ... authority,\" it cannot constitutionally be granted the \"regulatory power prescribed in \u00a7 207.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665203,5756092\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/666/\">\n    721 F.3d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (2013). The Court of Appeals did not reach respondent's due process claim. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665203,5756092\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/666/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In holding that Congress may not delegate to Amtrak the joint authority to issue the metrics and standards-authority it described as \"regulatory power,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   -the Court of Appeals concluded Amtrak is a private entity for purposes of determining its status when considering the constitutionality of its actions in the instant dispute. That court's analysis treated as controlling Congress' statutory command that Amtrak \" 'is not a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 675(quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2024301\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 24301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)). The Court of Appeals also relied on Congress' pronouncement that Amtrak \" 'shall be operated and managed as a for-profit corporation.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665203,5756092\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/666/\">\n    721 F.3d, at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting \u00a7 24301(a)(2)); see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 677(\"Though the federal government's involvement in Amtrak is considerable, Congress has both designated it a private corporation and instructed that it be managed so as to maximize profit. In deciding Amtrak's status for purposes of congressional delegations, these declarations are dispositive\"). Proceeding from this premise, the Court of Appeals concluded it was impermissible for Congress to \"delegate regulatory authority to a private entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 670; see also\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   (holding\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1486232\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/298/238/\">\n    298 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1486232\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/298/238/\">\n    56 S.Ct. 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1486232\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/298/238/\">\n    80 L.Ed. 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1936), prohibits any such delegation of authority).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   That premise, however, was erroneous. Congressional pronouncements, though instructive as to matters within Congress' authority to address, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9211789,3434071\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/488/\">\n    380 F.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491-492 (C.A.D.C.2004)(Roberts, J.), are not dispositive of Amtrak's status as a governmental entity for purposes of separation of powers analysis under the Constitution. And an independent inquiry into Amtrak's status under the Constitution reveals the Court of Appeals' premise was flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is appropriate to begin the analysis with Amtrak's ownership and corporate structure. The Secretary of Transportation holds all of Amtrak's preferred stock and most of its common stock. Amtrak's Board of Directors is composed of nine members, one of whom is the Secretary of Transportation. Seven other Board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2024302\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 24302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). These eight Board members, in turn, select Amtrak's president. \u00a7 24302(a)(1)(B); \u00a7 24303(a). Amtrak's Board members are subject to salary limits set by Congress, \u00a7 24303(b); and the Executive Branch has concluded that all appointed Board members are removable by the President without cause, see 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 163 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under further statutory provisions, Amtrak's Board members must possess certain qualifications. Congress has directed that the President make appointments based on an individual's prior experience in the transportation industry, \u00a7 24302(a)(1)(C), and has provided that not more than five of the seven appointed Board members be from the same political party, \u00a7 24302(a)(3). In selecting Amtrak's Board members, moreover, the President must consult with leaders of both parties in both Houses of Congress in order to \"provide adequate and balanced representation of the major geographic regions\n   of the United States served by Amtrak.\" \u00a7 24302(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In addition to controlling Amtrak's stock and Board of Directors the political branches exercise substantial, statutorily mandated supervision over Amtrak's priorities and operations. Amtrak must submit numerous annual reports to Congress and the President, detailing such information as route-specific ridership and on-time performance. \u00a7 24315. The Freedom of Information Act applies to Amtrak in any year in which it receives a federal subsidy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which thus far has been every year of its existence. Pursuant to its status under the Inspector General Act of 1978 as a \" 'designated Federal entity,' \" 5 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 8G(a)(2), p. 521, Amtrak must maintain an inspector general, much like governmental agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, Congress conducts frequent oversight hearings into Amtrak's budget, routes, and prices. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Hearing on Reviewing Alternatives to Amtrak's Annual Losses in Food and Beverage Service before the Subcommittee on Government Operations of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (2013) (statement of Thomas J. Hall, chief of customer service, Amtrak); Hearing on Amtrak's Fiscal Year 2014 Budget: The Starting Point for Reauthorization before the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6 (2013) (statement of Joseph H. Boardman, president and chief executive officer, Amtrak).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is significant that, rather than advancing its own private economic interests, Amtrak is required to pursue numerous, additional goals defined by statute. To take a few examples: Amtrak must \"provide efficient and effective intercity passenger rail mobility,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2024101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 24101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b); \"minimize Government subsidies,\" \u00a7 24101(d); provide reduced fares to the disabled and elderly, \u00a7 24307(a); and ensure mobility in times of national disaster, \u00a7 24101(c)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition to directing Amtrak to serve these broad public objectives, Congress has mandated certain aspects of Amtrak's day-to-day operations. Amtrak must maintain a route between Louisiana and Florida. \u00a7 24101(c)(6). When making improvements to the Northeast corridor, Amtrak must apply seven considerations in a specified order of priority. \u00a7 24902(b). And when Amtrak purchases materials worth more than $1 million, these materials must be mined or produced in the United States, or manufactured substantially from components that are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, unless the Secretary of Transportation grants an exemption. \u00a7 24305(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, Amtrak is also dependent on federal financial support. In its first 43 years of operation, Amtrak has received more than $41 billion in federal subsidies. In recent years these subsidies have exceeded $1 billion annually. See Brief for Petitioners 5, and n. 2, 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Given the combination of these unique features and its significant ties to the Government, Amtrak is not an autonomous private enterprise. Among other important considerations, its priorities, operations, and decisions are extensively supervised and substantially funded by the political branches. A majority of its Board is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate and is understood by the Executive to be removable by the President at will. Amtrak was created by the Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the Government's benefit. Thus, in its joint\n   issuance of the metrics and standards with the FRA, Amtrak acted as a governmental entity for purposes of the Constitution's separation of powers provisions. And that exercise of governmental power must be consistent with the design and requirements of the Constitution, including those provisions relating to the separation of powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Respondent urges that Amtrak cannot be deemed a governmental entity in this respect.

Under the Constitution, all officers of the United States must take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution and must receive a commission. See Art. VI, cl. 3 (\"[A]ll executive and judicial Officers ... shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution\"); Art. II, \u00a7 3, cl. 6 (The President \"shall Commission all the Officers of the United States\"). There is good reason to think that those who have not sworn an oath cannot exercise significant authority of the United States. See 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 406, 408 (1874) (\"[A] Representative ... does not become a member of the House until he takes the oath of office\"); 15 Op. Atty. Gen. 280, 281 (1877) (similar).\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this Court certainly has never treated a commission from the President as a mere wall ornament.

Because they exercise greater power, they are subject to special restraints. There should never be a question whether someone is an officer of the United States because, to be an officer, the person should have sworn an oath and possess a commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Here, respondent tells the Court that \"Amtrak's board members do not take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, as do Article II officers vested with rulemaking authority.\" Brief for Respondent 47. The Government says not a word in response. Perhaps there is an answer. The rule, however, is clear. Because Amtrak is the Government,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1233, those who run it need to satisfy basic constitutional requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   I turn next to the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008's (PRIIA) arbitration provision.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%204907\">\n    122 Stat. 4907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, \u00a7 207(c) commands that \"[t]o the extent practicable, Amtrak and its host rail carriers shall incorporate [those] metrics and standards ... into their access and service agreements.\" Under \u00a7 213(a) of the PRIIA, moreover, \"the metrics and standards also may play a role in prompting investigations by the [Surface Transportation Board (STB) ] and in subsequent enforcement actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1229.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This scheme is obviously regulatory.

Even the United States concedes, with understatement, that there is \"perhaps some incentivizing effect associated with the metrics and standards.\" Brief for Petitioners 30. Because obedience to the metrics and standards materially reduces the risk of liability, railroads face powerful incentives to obey. See\n   <em>\n    Bennett, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 169-171,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p169\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is regulatory power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The language from \u00a7 207 quoted thus far should raise red flags. In one statute, Congress says Amtrak is not an \"agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2024301\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 24301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). But then Congress commands Amtrak to act like an agency, with effects on private rail carriers. No wonder the D.C. Circuit ruled as it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The oddity continues, however. Section 207(d) of the PRIIA also provides that if the FRA and Amtrak cannot agree about what the regulatory standards should say, then \"any party involved in the development of those standards may petition the Surface Transportation Board to appoint an arbitrator to assist the parties in resolving their disputes through binding arbitration.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%204917\">\n    122 Stat. 4917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute says nothing more about this \"binding arbitration,\" including who the arbitrator should be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Looking to Congress' use of the word \"arbitrator,\" respondent argues that because the arbitrator can be a private person, this provision by itself violates the private nondelegation doctrine. The United States, for its part, urges the Court to read the term \"arbitrator\" to mean \"public arbitrator\" in the interests of constitutional avoidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   No one disputes, however, that the arbitration provision is fair game for challenge, even though no arbitration occurred. The obvious purpose of the arbitration provision was to force Amtrak and the FRA to compromise, or else a third party would make the decision for them. The D.C. Circuit is correct that when Congress enacts a compromise-forcing mechanism, it is no good to say that the mechanism cannot be challenged because the parties compromised.

No private arbitrator can promulgate binding metrics and standards for the railroad industry. Thus, if the term \"arbitrator\" refers to a private arbitrator, or even the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of a private arbitrator, the Constitution is violated.

Rather than trying to defend a private arbitrator, the Government argues that the Court, for reasons of constitutional avoidance, should read the word \"arbitrator\" to mean \"public arbitrator.\" The Government's argument, however, lurches into a new problem: Constitutional avoidance works only if the statute is susceptible to an alternative reading and that such an alternative reading would itself be constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, the Government's argument that the word \"arbitrator\" does not mean \"private arbitrator\" is in some tension with the ordinary meaning of the word. Although Government arbitrators are not unheard of, we usually think of arbitration as a form of \"private dispute resolution.\" See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v.

Unless an \"inferior Office[r]\" is at issue, Article II of the Constitution demands that the President appoint all \"Officers of the United States\" with the Senate's advice and consent. Art.

As the Court observes, \"Amtrak's Board of Directors is composed of nine members, one of whom is the Secretary of Transportation. Seven other Board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. These eight Board members, in turn, select Amtrak's president.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1231 (citation omitted). In other words, unlike everyone else on the Board, Amtrak's president has not been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As explained above, accountability demands that principal officers be appointed by the President. See Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. The President, after all, must have \"the general administrative control of those executing the laws,\"\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

Unsurprisingly then, the United States defends the non-Presidential appointment of Amtrak's president on the ground that the Amtrak president is merely an inferior officer. Given Article II, for the Government to argue anything else would be surrender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This argument, however, is problematic. Granted, a multimember body may head an agency. See\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 512-513,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But those who head agencies must be principal officers. See\n   <em>\n    Edmond, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 663,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652680\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/651/#p663\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would seem to follow that because agency heads must be principal officers, every member of a multimember body heading an agency must also be a principal officer. After all, every member of a multimember body could cast the deciding vote with respect to a particular decision. One would think that anyone who has the unilateral authority to tip a final decision one way or the other cannot be an inferior officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Government's response is tucked away in a footnote. It contends that because Amtrak's president serves at the pleasure of the other Board members, he is only an inferior officer. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14, n. 6. But the Government does not argue that the president of Amtrak cannot cast tie-breaking votes. Assuming he can vote when the Board of Directors is divided, it makes no sense to think that the side with which the president\n   <em>\n    agrees\n   </em>\n   will demand his removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In any event, even assuming that Amtrak's president could be an inferior officer, there would still be another problem: Amtrak's Board may lack constitutional authority to appoint inferior officers. The Appointments Clause provides an exception from the ordinary rule of Presidential appointment for \"inferior Officers,\" but that exception has accountability limits of its own, namely, that Congress may only vest the appointment power \"in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\" Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Although a multimember body like Amtrak's Board\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   head a Department, here it is not at all clear that Amtrak\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A \"Department\" may not be \"subordinate to or contained within any other such component\" of the Executive Branch.\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    561 U.S., at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As explained above, however, in jointly creating metrics and standards, Amtrak may have to give way to an arbitrator appointed by the STB. Does that mean that Amtrak is \"subordinate to\" the STB?

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 24302(a)(1), 24309(d)(2). The Secretary of Transportation also has authority to exempt Amtrak from certain statutory requirements. See \u00a7 24305(f)(4). Does that mean that Amtrak is \"subordinate to or contained within\" the Department of Transportation? (The STB, of course, also may be \"subordinate to or contained within\" the Department of Transportation. If so, this may further suggest that that Amtrak is not a Department, and also further undermine the STB's ability to appoint an arbitrator). All of these are difficult questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, while I entirely agree with the Court that Amtrak must be regarded as a federal actor for constitutional purposes, it does not by any means necessarily follow that the present structure of Amtrak is consistent with the Constitution.

We never even glance at the Constitution to see what it says about how this authority must be exercised and by whom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I agree with the Court that the proper disposition in this case is to vacate the decision below and to remand for further consideration of respondent's constitutional challenge to the metrics and standards. I cannot join the majority's analysis, however, because it fails to fully correct the errors that require us to vacate the Court of Appeals' decision. I write separately to describe the framework that I believe should guide our resolution of delegation challenges and to highlight serious constitutional defects in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) that are properly presented for the lower courts' review on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Constitution does not vest the Federal Government with an undifferentiated \"governmental power.\" Instead, the Constitution identifies three types of governmental power and, in the Vesting Clauses, commits them to three branches of Government. Those Clauses provide that \"[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,\" Art. I, \u00a7 1, \"[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States,\" Art.

For example, Congress improperly \"delegates\" legislative power when it authorizes an entity other than itself to make a determination that requires an exercise of legislative power. See\n   <em>\n    Whitman, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 472,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p474\">\n    121 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, I do not purport to offer a comprehensive description of these powers. My purpose is to identify principles relevant to today's dispute, with an eye to offering guidance to the lower courts on remand. At issue in this case is the proper division between legislative and executive powers. An examination of the history of those powers reveals how far our modern separation-of-powers jurisprudence has departed from the original meaning of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The allocation of powers in the Constitution is absolute,\n   <em>\n    Perez,\n   </em>\n   135 S.Ct., at 1214 - 1218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20998535\">\n    2015 WL 998535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15-17(opinion of THOMAS, J.), but it does not follow that there is no overlap between the three categories of governmental power. Certain functions may be performed by two or more branches without either exceeding its\n   enumerated powers under the Constitution. Resolution of claims against the Government is the classic example. At least when Congress waives its sovereign immunity, such claims may be heard by an Article III court, which adjudicates such claims by an exercise of judicial power. See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Bakelite Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907706\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/438/#p452\">\n    279 U.S. 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907706\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/438/#p452\">\n    49 S.Ct. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907706\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/438/#p452\">\n    73 L.Ed. 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1929). But Congress may also provide for an executive agency to adjudicate such claims by an exercise of executive power. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   Or Congress may resolve the claims itself, legislating by special Act. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   The question is whether the particular function requires the exercise of a certain type of power; if it does, then only the branch in which that power is vested can perform it. For example, although this Court has long recognized that it does not necessarily violate the Constitution for Congress to authorize another branch to make a determination that it could make itself, there are certain core functions that require the exercise of legislative power and that only Congress can perform.\n   <em>\n    Wayman v.

Under the original understanding of the Constitution, that function requires the exercise of legislative power. By corollary, the discretion inherent in executive power does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   comprehend the discretion to formulate generally applicable rules of private conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The idea that the Executive may not formulate generally applicable rules of private conduct emerged even before the theory of the separation of powers on which our Constitution was founded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The idea has ancient roots in the concept of the \"rule of law,\" which has been understood since Greek and Roman times to mean that a ruler must be subject to the law in exercising his power and may not govern by will alone. M. Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers 25 (2d ed. 1998); 2 Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 33 (G. Woodbine ed., S. Thorne transl. 1968). The principle that a ruler must govern according to law \"presupposes at least two distinct operations, the making of law, and putting it into effect.\" Vile,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 24. Although it was originally thought \"that the rule of law was satisfied if a king made good laws and always acted according to them,\" it became increasingly apparent over time that the rule of law demanded that the operations of \"making\" law and of \"putting it into effect\" be kept separate. W. Gwyn, The Meaning of the Separation of Powers 35 (1965); see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. But when the King's power was at its height, it was still accepted that his \"principal duty ... [was], to govern\n   <em>\n    his people\n   </em>\n   according to\n   <em>\n    law\n   </em>\n   .\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 226 (1765) (Commentaries) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   An early expression of this idea in England is seen in the \"constitutional\" law concerning crown proclamations. Even before a more formal separation of powers came about during the English Civil War, it was generally thought that the King could not use his proclamation power to alter the rights and duties of his subjects. P. Hamburger, Is Administrative Law Unlawful? 33-34 (2014) (Hamburger). This power could be exercised by the King only in conjunction with Parliament and was exercised through statutes.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see also M. Hale, The Prerogatives of the King 141, 171-172 (D. Yale ed. 1976). The King\n   might participate in \"the legislative power\" by giving his \"assent\" to laws created by the \"concurrence\" of \"lords and commons assembled in parliament,\" but he could not of his own accord \"make a law or impose a charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In 1539, King Henry VIII secured what might be called a \"delegation\" of the legislative power by prevailing on Parliament to pass the Act of Proclamations. Hamburger 35-36. That Act declared that the King's proclamations would have the force and effect of an Act of Parliament.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 37. But the Act did not permit the King to deprive his subjects of their property, privileges and franchises, or their lives, except as provided by statutory or common law.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 37-38. Nor did the Act permit him to invalidate \" 'any acts, [or] common laws standing at [that] time in strength and force.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 38 (quoting An Act that Proclamations Made by the King Shall be Obeyed, 31 Hen. VIII, ch. 8, in Eng. Stat. at Large 263 (1539)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Even this limited delegation of lawmaking power to the King was repudiated by Parliament less than a decade later. Hamburger 38. Reflecting on this period in history, David Hume would observe that, when Parliament \"gave to the king's proclamation the same force as to a statute enacted by parliament,\" it \"made by one act a total subversion of the English constitution.\" 3 D. Hume, The History of England from the Invasion of Julius Ceasar to the Revolution in 1688, p. 266 (1983). By the 17th century, when English scholars and jurists began to articulate a more formal theory of the separation of powers, delegations of the type afforded to King Henry VIII were all but unheard of. Hale,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 172-173.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This is not to say that the Crown did not endeavor to exercise the power to make rules governing private conduct. King James I made a famous attempt, see\n   <em>\n    Perez,\n   </em>\n   135 S.Ct., at 1219 - 1221,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20998535\">\n    2015 WL 998535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19-20(opinion of THOMAS, J.), prompting the influential jurist Chief Justice Edward Coke to write that the King could not \"change any part of the common law, nor create any offence by his proclamation, which was not an offence before, without Parliament.\"\n   <em>\n    Case of Proclamations,\n   </em>\n   12 Co. Rep. 74, 75, 77 Eng. Rep. 1352, 1353 (K.B. 1611). Coke associated this principle with Chapter 39 of the Magna Carta,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which he understood to guarantee that no subject would be deprived of a private right-that is, a right of life, liberty, or property-except in accordance with \"the law of the land,\" which consisted only of statutory and common law. Chapman &amp; McConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20Yale%20L.J.%201672\">\n    121 Yale L.J. 1672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1688 (2012). When the King attempted to fashion rules of private conduct unilaterally, as he did in the\n   <em>\n    Case of Proclamations,\n   </em>\n   the resulting enforcement action could not be said to accord with \"the law of the land.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   John Locke echoed this view. \"[F]reedom of men under government,\" he wrote, \"is to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the\n   <em>\n    legislative power\n   </em>\n   erected in it ... and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man.\" J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7 22, p. 13 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (Locke) (emphasis added). It followed that this freedom required that the power to make the standing rules and the power to enforce them not lie in the same hands. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 143, at 72. He further\n   concluded that \"[t]he legislative c[ould not] transfer the power of making laws to any other hands: for it being but a delegated power from the people, they who have it [could not] pass it over to others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 141, at 71.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   William Blackstone, in his Commentaries, likewise maintained that the English Constitution required that no subject be deprived of core private rights except in accordance with the law of the land. See 1 Commentaries 129, 134, 137-138. He defined a \"law\" as a generally applicable \"rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). And he defined a tyrannical government as one in which \"the right both of\n   <em>\n    making\n   </em>\n   and of\n   <em>\n    enforcing\n   </em>\n   the laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men,\" for \"wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 142. Thus, although Blackstone viewed Parliament as sovereign and capable of changing the constitution,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 156, he thought a delegation of lawmaking power to be \"disgrace[ful],\" 4\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 424; see also Hamburger 39, n. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   These principles about the relationship between private rights and governmental power profoundly influenced the men who crafted, debated, and ratified the Constitution. The document itself and the writings surrounding it reflect a conviction that the power to make the law and the power to enforce it must be kept separate, particularly with respect to the regulation of private conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Framers' dedication to the separation of powers has been well-documented, if only half-heartedly honored. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mistretta v.

Most famously, in The Federalist 47, Madison wrote that \"[n]o political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty than\" the separation of powers. The Federalist No. 47, p. 301 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, ... may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Perez,\n   </em>\n   135 S.Ct., at 1216 - 1218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20998535\">\n    2015 WL 998535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16-17(opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This devotion to the separation of powers is, in part, what supports our enduring conviction that the Vesting Clauses are exclusive and that the branch in which a power is vested may not give it up or otherwise reallocate it. The Framers were concerned not just with the starting allocation, but with the \"gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department.\" The Federalist No. 51, at 321 (J. Madison). It was this fear that prompted the Framers to build checks and balances into our constitutional structure,\n   so that the branches could defend their powers on an ongoing basis.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Perez,\n   </em>\n   135 S.Ct., at 1216 - 1217,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20998535\">\n    2015 WL 998535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16(opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In this sense, the founding generation did not subscribe to Blackstone's view of parliamentary supremacy.

Congress creates the rule of private conduct, and the President makes the\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   determination that causes that rule to go into effect. That type of factual determination seems similar to the type of factual determination on which an enforcement action is conditioned: Neither involves an exercise of policy discretion, and both are subject to review by a court.

He may do so expressly-by setting out regulations specifying what conduct jeopardizes \"the public safety,\" for example-or implicitly-by drawing distinctions on an ad hoc basis. In either event, he does so based on a policy judgment that is not reviewable by the courts, at least to the extent that the judgment falls within the range of discretion permitted him by the law.

Although it upheld a statute authorizing courts to set rules governing the execution of their own judgments,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 50, its reasoning strongly suggests that rules of private conduct were not the proper subject of rulemaking by the courts. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall surveyed a number of choices that could be left to rulemaking by the courts, explaining that they concerned only \"the regulation of the conduct of the officer of the Court in giving effect to its judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 45. When it came to specifying \"the mode of obeying the mandate of a writ,\" however, he lamented that \"so much of that which may be done by the judiciary, under the authority of the legislature, seems to be blended with that for which the legislature must expressly and directly provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   This important passage reflects two premises that Chief Justice Marshall took for granted, but which are disregarded in later decisions relying on this precedent: First, reflected in his discussion of \"blending\" permissible with impermissible discretion, is the premise that it is not the\n   <em>\n    quantity,\n   </em>\n   but the\n   <em>\n    quality,\n   </em>\n   of the discretion that determines whether an authorization is constitutional. Second, reflected in the contrast Chief Justice Marshall draws between the two types of rules, is the premise that the rules \"for which the legislature must expressly and directly provide\" are those regulating private conduct rather than those regulating the conduct of court officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Thus, when Chief Justice Marshall spoke about the \"difficulty in discerning the exact limits within which the legislature may avail itself of the agency of its Courts,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   he did not refer to the difficulty in discerning whether the Legislature's policy guidance is \"sufficiently defined,\" see\n   <em>\n    Panama Refining, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 429,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3925804\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/293/388/\">\n    55 S.Ct. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but instead the difficulty in discerning which rules affected substantive private rights and duties and which did not.

To understand the \"intelligible principle\" test as permitting Congress to delegate policy judgment in this context is to divorce that test from its history.

I accept that this would inhibit the Government from acting with the speed and efficiency Congress has sometimes found desirable. In anticipating that result and accepting it, I am in good company. John Locke, for example, acknowledged that a legislative body \"is usually too numerous, and so too slow for the dispatch requisite to execution.\" Locke \u00a7 160, at 80.

Because a private entity is neither Congress, nor the President or one of his agents, nor the Supreme Court or an inferior court established by Congress, the Vesting Clauses would categorically preclude it from exercising the legislative, executive, or judicial powers of the Federal Government. In short, the \"private nondelegation doctrine\" is merely one application of the provisions of the Constitution that forbid Congress to allocate power to an ineligible entity, whether governmental or private.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   For this reason, a conclusion that Amtrak is private-that is, not part of the Government at all-would necessarily mean that it cannot exercise these three categories of governmental power. But the converse is not true: A determination that Amtrak acts as a governmental entity in crafting the metrics and standards says nothing about whether it properly exercises governmental power when it does so. An entity that \"was created by the Government, is controlled by the Government, and operates for the Government's benefit,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1232 (majority opinion), but that is not properly constituted to exercise a power under one of the Vesting Clauses, is no better qualified to be a delegatee of that power than is a purely private one. To its credit, the majority does not hold otherwise. It merely refutes the Court of Appeals' premise that Amtrak is private.

Host railroads may enter into contracts with Amtrak under \u00a7\u00a7 10908and 24308to fulfill their common-carrier obligations. The metrics and standards shape the types of contracts that satisfy the common-carrier obligations because \u00a7 207 provides that \"Amtrak and its host rail carriers\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   \" include the metrics and standards in their contracts \"[t]o the extent practicable.\" PRIIA \u00a7 207(c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2024101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 24101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (note)(emphasis added). As Justice ALITO explains, it matters little that the railroads may avoid incorporating the metrics and standards by arguing that incorporation is impracticable; the point is that they have a legal duty to try-a duty the substance of which is defined by the metrics and standards. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1235 - 1236 (concurring opinion). And that duty is backed up by the Surface Transportation Board's coercive power to impose \"reasonable terms\" on host railroads when they fail to come to an agreement with Amtrak. \u00a7 24308(a)(2)(A)(ii).

In any event, these precedents are directly contrary to our more recent holding that a discretionary \"veto\" necessarily involves an exercise of legislative power. See\n   <em>\n    INS v.

As such,\n   <em>\n    Currin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rock Royal\n   </em>\n   have been discredited and lack any force as precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Section 207 therefore violates the Constitution. Article I, \u00a7 1, vests the legislative power in Congress, and Amtrak is not Congress. The procedures that \u00a7 207 sets forth for enacting the metrics and standards also do not comply with bicameralism and presentment. Art. I, \u00a7 7. For these reasons, the metrics and standards promulgated under this provision are invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   I recognize, of course, that the courts below will be bound to apply our \"intelligible principle\" test. I recognize, too, that that test means so little that the courts are likely to conclude that \u00a7 207 calls for nothing more than the exercise of executive power. Having made that determination, the Court of Appeals must then determine whether Amtrak is constitutionally eligible to exercise executive power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   As noted, Article II of the Constitution vests the executive power in a \"President of the United States of America.\" Art. II, \u00a7 1. Amtrak, of course, is not the President of the United States, but this fact does not immediately disqualify it from the exercise of executive power. Congress may authorize subordinates of the President to exercise such power, so long as they remain subject to Presidential control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The critical question, then, is whether Amtrak is adequately subject to Presidential control. See\n   <em>\n    Myers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501270\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/52/#p164\">\n    272 U.S., at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501270\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/52/#p164\">\n    47 S.Ct. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our precedents treat appointment and removal powers as the primary devices of executive control,\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    561 U.S., at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that should be the starting point of the Court of Appeals' analysis. As Justice ALITO's concurrence demonstrates, however, there are other constitutional requirements that the Court of Appeals should also scrutinize in deciding whether Amtrak is constitutionally eligible to exercise the power \u00a7 207 confers on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In this case, Congress has permitted a corporation subject only to limited control by the President to create legally binding rules. These rules give content to private railroads' statutory duty to share their private infrastructure with Amtrak. This arrangement raises serious constitutional questions to which the majority's holding that Amtrak is a governmental entity is all but a non sequitur. These concerns merit close consideration by the courts below and by this Court if the case reaches us again. We have too long abrogated our duty to enforce the separation of powers required by our Constitution. We have overseen and sanctioned the growth of an administrative system that concentrates the power to make laws and the power to enforce them in the hands of a vast and unaccountable administrative apparatus that finds no comfortable home in our constitutional\n   structure. The end result may be trains that run on time (although I doubt it), but the cost is to our Constitution and the individual liberty it protects.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
