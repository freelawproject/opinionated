We hold that a police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution's shield against unreasonable seizures.

Nebraska law prohibits driving on highway shoulders, see Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 60-6,142 (2010), and on that basis, Struble pulled the Mountaineer over at 12:06 a.m. Struble is a K-9 officer with the Valley Police Department in Nebraska, and his dog Floyd was in his patrol car that night. Two men were in the Mountaineer: the driver, Dennys Rodriguez, and a front-seat passenger, Scott Pollman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Struble approached the Mountaineer on the passenger's side. After Rodriguez identified himself, Struble asked him why he had driven onto the shoulder. Rodriguez replied that he had swerved to avoid a pothole. Struble then gathered Rodriguez's license, registration, and proof of insurance, and asked Rodriguez to accompany him to the patrol car. Rodriguez asked if he was required to do so, and Struble answered that he was not. Rodriguez decided to wait in his own vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After running a records check on Rodriguez, Struble returned to the Mountaineer. Struble asked passenger Pollman for his driver's license and began to question him about where the two men were coming from and where they were going. Pollman replied that they had traveled to Omaha, Nebraska, to look at a Ford Mustang that was for sale and that they were returning to Norfolk, Nebraska. Struble returned again to his patrol car, where he completed a records check on Pollman, and called for a second officer. Struble then began writing a warning ticket for Rodriguez for driving on the shoulder of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Struble returned to Rodriguez's vehicle a third time to issue the written warning. By 12:27 or 12:28 a.m., Struble had finished explaining the warning to Rodriguez, and had given back to Rodriguez and Pollman the documents obtained from them. As Struble later testified, at that point, Rodriguez and Pollman \"had all their documents back and a copy of the written warning. I got all the reason[s] for the stop out of the way[,] ... took care of all the business.\" App. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nevertheless, Struble did not consider Rodriguez \"free to leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 69-70. Although justification for the traffic stop was \"out of the way,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 70, Struble asked for permission to walk his dog around Rodriguez's vehicle. Rodriguez said no. Struble then instructed Rodriguez to turn off the ignition, exit the vehicle, and stand in front of the patrol car to wait for the second officer. Rodriguez complied. At 12:33 a.m., a deputy sheriff arrived. Struble retrieved his dog and led him twice around the Mountaineer. The dog alerted to the presence of drugs halfway through Struble's second pass. All told, seven or eight minutes had elapsed from the time Struble issued the written warning until the dog indicated the presence of drugs. A search of the vehicle revealed a large bag of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rodriguez was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska on one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)and (b)(1). He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground, among others, that Struble had prolonged the traffic stop without reasonable suspicion in order to conduct the dog sniff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After receiving evidence, a Magistrate Judge recommended that the motion be denied. The Magistrate Judge found no probable cause to search the vehicle independent of the dog alert. App. 100 (apart from \"information given by the dog,\" \"Officer Struble had [no]thing other than a rather large hunch\"). He further found that no reasonable suspicion supported the detention once Struble issued the written warning. He concluded, however, that under Eighth Circuit precedent, extension of the stop by \"seven to eight minutes\" for the dog sniff was only a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   intrusion on Rodriguez's Fourth Amendment rights and was therefore permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's factual findings and legal conclusions and denied Rodriguez's motion to suppress. The court noted that, in the Eighth Circuit, \"dog sniffs that occur within a short time following the completion of\n   a traffic stop are not constitutionally prohibited if they constitute only de minimis intrusions.\" App. 114 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alexander,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046952\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1014/#p1016\">\n    448 F.3d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1016 (C.A.8 2006)). The court thus agreed with the Magistrate Judge that the \"7 to 10 minutes\" added to the stop by the dog sniff \"was not of constitutional significance.\" App. 114. Impelled by that decision, Rodriguez entered a conditional guilty plea and was sentenced to five years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Eighth Circuit affirmed. The \"seven- or eight-minute delay\" in this case, the opinion noted, resembled delays that the court had previously ranked as permissible.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898384\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/905/#p907\">\n    741 F.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 907 (2014). The Court of Appeals thus ruled that the delay here constituted an acceptable \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   intrusion on Rodriguez's personal liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 908. Given that ruling, the court declined to reach the question whether Struble had reasonable suspicion to continue Rodriguez's detention after issuing the written warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a division among lower courts on the question whether police routinely may extend an otherwise-completed traffic stop, absent reasonable suspicion, in order to conduct a dog sniff.573 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592880,12592881,12592882,12592883,12592884\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/43/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592881,12592882,12592883,12592920,12592921,12593054\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/896/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

But cf.\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1624 - 1625 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Thus, even assuming that the imposition here was no more intrusive than the exit order in\n   <em>\n    Mimms,\n   </em>\n   the dog sniff could not be justified on the same basis. Highway and officer safety are interests different in kind from the Government's endeavor to detect crime in general or drug trafficking in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Government argues that an officer may \"incremental[ly]\" prolong a stop to conduct a dog sniff so long as the officer is reasonably diligent in pursuing the traffic-related purpose of the stop, and the overall duration of the stop remains reasonable in relation to the duration of other traffic stops involving similar circumstances. Brief for United States 36-39. The Government's argument, in effect, is that by completing all traffic-related tasks expeditiously, an officer can earn bonus time to pursue an unrelated criminal investigation. See also\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1617 - 1619 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (embracing the Government's argument).

In this regard, the Government acknowledges that \"an officer always has to be reasonably diligent.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 49.

If an officer can complete traffic-based inquiries expeditiously, then that is the amount of \"time reasonably required to complete [the stop's] mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Caballes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    543 U.S., at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court's holding to the contrary cannot be reconciled with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   or a number of common police practices.

See Brief for Appellant in No. 13-1176 (CA8), p. 4, n. 2. I easily conclude that it was. Approximately 29 minutes passed from the time Officer Struble stopped Rodriguez until his narcotics-detection dog alerted to the presence of drugs. That amount of time is hardly out of the ordinary for a traffic stop by a single officer of a vehicle containing multiple occupants even when no dog sniff is involved.

During that time, Officer Struble conducted the ordinary activities of a traffic stop-he approached the vehicle, questioned Rodriguez about the observed violation, asked Pollman about their travel plans, ran serial warrant checks on Rodriguez and Pollman, and issued a written warning to Rodriguez. And when he decided to conduct a dog sniff, he took the precaution of calling for backup out of concern for his safety.

We explained that no Fourth Amendment violation had occurred in\n   <em>\n    Caballes,\n   </em>\n   where the \"duration of the stop ... was entirely justified by the traffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such a stop,\" but suggested a different result might attend a case \"involving a dog sniff that occurred during an\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   prolonged traffic stop.\" 543 U.S., at 407-408,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Yet its reasoning suggests the opposite. Such warrant checks look more like they are directed to \"detecting evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing\" than to \"ensuring that vehicles on the road are operated safely and responsibly.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1615 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Perhaps one could argue that the existence of an outstanding warrant might make a driver less likely to operate his vehicle safely and responsibly on the road, but the same could be said about a driver in possession of contraband. A driver confronted by the police in either case might try to flee or become violent toward the officer. But under the majority's analysis, a dog sniff, which is directed at uncovering that problem, is not treated as a traffic-based inquiry. Warrant checks, arguably, should fare no better. The majority suggests that a warrant check is an ordinary inquiry incident to a traffic stop because it can be used \" 'to determine whether the apparent traffic violator is wanted for one or more previous traffic offenses.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1615 (quoting 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.3(c), p. 516 (5th ed. 2012)). But as the very treatise on which the majority relies notes, such checks are a \"manifest[ation of] the 'war on drugs' motivation so often underlying [routine traffic] stops,\" and thus are very much like the dog sniff in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.3(c), at 507-508.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Investigative questioning rests on the same basis as the dog sniff. \"Asking questions is an essential part of police investigations.\"\n   <em>\n    Hiibel v.

And the lower courts have routinely upheld such questioning during routine traffic stops. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rivera,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664424\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/1009/#p1013\">\n    570 F.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1013 (C.A.8 2009);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In doing so, it renders the difference between probable cause and reasonable suspicion virtually meaningless in this context. That shift is supported neither by the Fourth Amendment nor by our precedents interpreting it. And, it results in a constitutional framework that lacks predictability. Had Officer Struble arrested, handcuffed, and taken Rodriguez to the police station for his traffic violation, he would have complied with the Fourth Amendment. See\n   <em>\n    Atwater,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301256\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/318/#p326\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301256\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/318/#p326\">\n    at 354-355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301256\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/318/#p326\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rodriguez suffered no Fourth Amendment violation here for an entirely independent reason: Officer Struble had reasonable suspicion to continue to hold him for investigative purposes. Our precedents make clear that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to conduct an investigative traffic stop when that officer has \"a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Prado Navarette,\n   </em>\n   572 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2482\">\n    134 S.Ct., at 1687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

When he approached the vehicle, he smelled an \"overwhelming odor of air freshener coming from the vehicle,\" which is, in his experience, \"a common attempt to conceal an odor that [people] don't want ... to be smelled by the police.\" App. 20-21. He also observed, upon approaching the front window on the passenger side of the vehicle, that Rodriguez's passenger, Scott Pollman, appeared nervous. Pollman pulled his hat down low, puffed nervously on a cigarette, and refused to make eye contact with him. The officer thought he was \"more nervous than your typical passenger\" who \"do[esn't] have anything to worry about because [t]hey didn't commit a [traffic] violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Officer Struble's interactions with the vehicle's occupants only increased his suspicions. When he asked Rodriguez why he had driven onto the shoulder, Rodriguez claimed that he swerved to avoid a pothole. But that story could not be squared with Officer Struble's observation of the vehicle slowly driving off the road before being jerked back onto it. And when Officer Struble asked Pollman where they were coming from and where they were going, Pollman told him they were traveling from Omaha, Nebraska, back to Norfolk, Nebraska, after looking at a vehicle they were considering purchasing. Pollman told the officer that he had neither seen pictures of the vehicle nor confirmed title before the trip. As Officer Struble explained, it \"seemed suspicious\" to him \"to drive ... approximately two hours ... late at night to see a vehicle\n   sight unseen to possibly buy it,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 26, and to go from Norfolk to Omaha to look at it because \"[u]sually people leave Omaha to go get vehicles, not the other way around\" due to higher Omaha taxes,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   These facts, taken together, easily meet our standard for reasonable suspicion. \"[N]ervous, evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion,\"\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

The officer also recognized heavy use of air freshener, which, in his experience, indicated the presence of contraband in the vehicle. \"[C]ommonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior\" further support the officer's conclusion that Pollman's story about their trip was likely a cover story for illegal activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p124\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Officer Struble possessed probable cause to stop Rodriguez for driving on the shoulder, and he executed the subsequent stop in a reasonable manner. Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   requires no more. The majority's holding to the contrary is irreconcilable with\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   and a number of other routine police practices, distorts the distinction between traffic stops justified by probable cause and those justified by reasonable suspicion, and abandons reasonableness as the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-72\">\n   Justice ALITO, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This is an unnecessary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   impractical, and arbitrary decision. It addresses a purely hypothetical question: whether the traffic stop in this case\n   <em>\n    would be\n   </em>\n   unreasonable if the police officer, prior to leading a drug-sniffing dog around the exterior of petitioner's car, did not already have reasonable suspicion that the car contained drugs. In fact, however, the police officer\n   <em>\n    did have\n   </em>\n   reasonable suspicion, and, as a result, the officer was justified in detaining the occupants for the short period of time (seven or eight minutes) that is at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The relevant facts are not in dispute. Officer Struble, who made the stop, was the only witness at the suppression hearing, and his testimony about what happened was not challenged. Defense counsel argued that the facts recounted by Officer Struble were insufficient to establish\n   reasonable suspicion, but defense counsel did not dispute those facts or attack the officer's credibility. Similarly, the Magistrate Judge who conducted the hearing did not question the officer's credibility. And as Justice THOMAS's opinion shows, the facts recounted by Officer Struble \"easily meet our standard for reasonable suspicion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1623 (dissenting opinion); see also, e.g., United\n   <em>\n    States v. Carpenter,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465173\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/981/#p986\">\n    462 F.3d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 986-987 (C.A.8 2006)(finding reasonable suspicion for a dog sniff based on implausible travel plans and nervous conduct);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court refuses to address the real Fourth Amendment question: whether the stop was unreasonably prolonged. Instead, the Court latches onto the fact that Officer Struble delivered the warning prior to the dog sniff and proclaims that the authority to detain based on a traffic stop ends when a citation or warning is handed over to the driver. The Court thus holds that the Fourth Amendment was violated, not because of the length of the stop, but simply because of the sequence in which Officer Struble chose to perform his tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This holding is not only arbitrary; it is perverse since Officer Struble chose that sequence for the purpose of protecting his own safety and possibly the safety of others. See App. 71-72. Without prolonging the stop, Officer Struble could have conducted the dog sniff while one of the tasks that the Court regards as properly part of the traffic stop was still in progress, but that sequence would have entailed unnecessary risk. At approximately 12:19 a.m., after collecting Pollman's driver's license, Officer Struble did two things. He called in the information needed to do a records check on Pollman (a step that the Court recognizes was properly part of the traffic stop), and he requested that another officer report to the scene. Officer Struble had decided to perform a dog sniff but did not want to do that without another officer present. When occupants of a vehicle who know that their vehicle contains a large amount of illegal drugs see that a drug-sniffing dog has alerted for the presence of drugs, they will almost certainly realize that the police will then proceed to search the vehicle, discover the drugs, and make arrests. Thus, it is reasonable for an officer to believe that an alert will increase the risk that the occupants of the vehicle will attempt to flee or perhaps even attack the officer. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dawdy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414369\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/1427/#p1429\">\n    46 F.3d 1427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1429 (C.A.8 1995)(recounting scuffle between officer and defendant after drugs were discovered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In this case, Officer Struble was concerned that he was outnumbered at the scene, and he therefore called for backup and waited for the arrival of another officer before conducting the sniff. As a result, the sniff was not completed until seven or eight minutes after he delivered the warning. But Officer Struble could have proceeded with the dog sniff while he was waiting for the results of the records check on Pollman and before the arrival of the second officer. The drug-sniffing dog was present in Officer Struble's car. If he had chosen that riskier sequence of events, the dog sniff would have been completed before the point in time when, according to the Court's analysis, the authority to detain for the traffic stop ended. Thus, an action that would have been lawful had the\n   officer made the\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   decision to risk his life became unlawful when the officer made the\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   decision to wait a few minutes for backup. Officer Struble's error-apparently-was following prudent procedures motivated by legitimate safety concerns. The Court's holding therefore makes no practical sense. And nothing in the Fourth Amendment, which speaks of\n   <em>\n    reasonableness,\n   </em>\n   compels this arbitrary line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The rule that the Court adopts will do little good going forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is unlikely to have any appreciable effect on the length of future traffic stops. Most officers will learn the prescribed sequence of events even if they cannot fathom the reason for that requirement. (I would love to be the proverbial fly on the wall when police instructors teach this rule to officers who make traffic stops.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For these reasons and those set out in Justice THOMAS's opinion, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    See Brief in Opposition 11-14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    It is important to note that the Court's decision does not affect procedures routinely carried out during traffic stops, including \"checking the driver's license, determining whether there are outstanding warrants against the driver, and inspecting the automobile's registration and proof of insurance.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1615. And the Court reaffirms that police \"may conduct certain unrelated checks during an otherwise lawful traffic stop.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    Thus, it remains true that police may ask questions aimed at uncovering other criminal conduct and may order occupants out of their car during a valid stop.
