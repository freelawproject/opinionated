N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 90-22(a) (2013). Under the Act, the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is \"the agency of the State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.\" \u00a7 90-22(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board's principal duty is to create, administer, and enforce a licensing system for dentists. See \u00a7\u00a7 90-29 to 90-41. To perform that function it has broad authority over licensees. See \u00a7 90-41. The Board's authority with respect to unlicensed persons, however, is more restricted: like \"any resident citizen,\" the Board may file suit to \"perpetually enjoin any person from ... unlawfully practicing dentistry.\" \u00a7 90-40.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Act provides that six of the Board's eight members must be licensed dentists engaged in the active practice of dentistry. \u00a7 90-22. They are elected by other licensed dentists in North Carolina, who cast their ballots in elections conducted by the Board.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The seventh member must be a licensed and practicing dental hygienist, and he or she is elected by other licensed hygienists.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The final member is referred to by the Act as a \"consumer\" and is appointed by the Governor.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   All members serve 3-year terms, and no person may serve more than two consecutive terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Act does not create any mechanism for the removal of an elected member of the Board by a public official.

Many of those who did so, including 8 of the Board's 10 members during the period at issue in this case, earned substantial fees for that service. By 2003, nondentists arrived on the scene. They charged lower prices for their services than the dentists did. Dentists soon began to complain to the Board about their new competitors. Few complaints warned of possible harm to consumers. Most expressed a principal concern with the low prices charged by nondentists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Responding to these filings, the Board opened an investigation into nondentist teeth whitening. A dentist member was placed in charge of the inquiry. Neither the Board's hygienist member nor its consumer member participated in this undertaking. The Board's chief operations officer remarked that the Board was \"going forth to do battle\" with nondentists. App. to Pet. for Cert. 103a. The Board's concern did not result in a formal rule or regulation reviewable by the independent Rules Review Commission, even though the Act does not, by its terms, specify that teeth whitening is \"the practice of dentistry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Starting in 2006, the Board issued at least 47 cease-and-desist letters on its official letterhead to nondentist teeth whitening service providers and product manufacturers. Many of those letters directed the recipient to cease \"all activity constituting the practice of dentistry\"; warned that the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime; and strongly implied (or expressly stated) that teeth whitening constitutes \"the practice of dentistry.\" App. 13, 15. In early 2007, the Board persuaded the North Carolina Board of Cosmetic Art Examiners to warn cosmetologists against providing teeth whitening services. Later that year, the Board sent letters to mall operators, stating that kiosk teeth whiteners were violating the Dental Practice Act and advising that the malls consider expelling violators from their premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   These actions had the intended result. Nondentists ceased offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an administrative complaint charging the Board with violating \u00a7 5 of\n   the Federal Trade Commission Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Stat.%20719\">\n    38 Stat. 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FTC alleged that the Board's concerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition. The Board moved to dismiss, alleging state-action immunity. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied the motion. On appeal, the FTC sustained the ALJ's ruling. It reasoned that, even assuming the Board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition, the Board is a \"public/private hybrid\" that must be actively supervised by the State to claim immunity. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. The FTC further concluded the Board could not make that showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following other proceedings not relevant here, the ALJ conducted a hearing on the merits and determined the Board had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law. On appeal, the FTC again sustained the ALJ. The FTC rejected the Board's public safety justification, noting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   \"a wealth of evidence ... suggesting that non-dentist provided teeth whitening is a safe cosmetic procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 123a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The FTC ordered the Board to stop sending the cease-and-desist letters or other communications that stated nondentists may not offer teeth whitening services and products. It further ordered the Board to issue notices to all earlier recipients of the Board's cease-and-desist orders advising them of the Board's proper sphere of authority and saying, among other options, that the notice recipients had a right to seek declaratory rulings in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the FTC in all respects.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576176\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/359/#p370\">\n    717 F.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370 (2013).

If every duly enacted state law or policy were required to conform to the mandates of the Sherman Act, thus promoting competition at the expense of other values a State may deem fundamental, federal antitrust law would impose an impermissible burden on the States' power to regulate.

And as the Court observed three years after\n   <em>\n    Hallie,\n   </em>\n   \"[t]here is no doubt that the members of such associations often have economic incentives to restrain competition and that the product standards set by such associations have a serious potential for anticompetitive harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Allied Tube,\n   </em>\n   486 U.S., at 500,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219741\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/492/#p501\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When a State empowers a group of active market participants to decide who can participate in its market, and on what terms, the need for supervision is manifest. See Areeda &amp; Hovencamp \u00b6 227, at 226. The Court holds today that a state board on which a controlling number of decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupation the board regulates must satisfy\n   <em>\n    Midcal\n   </em>\n   's active supervision requirement in order to invoke state-action antitrust immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand will discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state agencies that regulate their own occupation. If this were so-and, for reasons to be noted, it need not be so-there would be some cause for concern. The States have a sovereign interest in structuring their governments, see\n   <em>\n    Gregory v. Ashcroft,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p460\">\n    501 U.S. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p460\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p460\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), and may conclude there are substantial benefits to staffing their agencies with experts in complex and technical subjects, see\n   <em>\n    Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v.

There is, moreover, a long tradition of citizens esteemed by their professional colleagues devoting time, energy, and talent to enhancing the dignity of their calling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Adherence to the idea that those who pursue a calling must embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty separate from the dictates of the State reaches back at least to the Hippocratic Oath. See generally S. Miles, The Hippocratic Oath and the Ethics of Medicine (2004). In the United States, there is a strong tradition of professional self-regulation, particularly with respect to the development of ethical rules. See generally R. Rotunda &amp; J. Dzienkowski, Legal Ethics: The Lawyer's Deskbook on Professional Responsibility (2014); R. Baker, Before Bioethics: A History of American Medical Ethics From the Colonial Period to the Bioethics Revolution (2013). Dentists are no exception. The American Dental Association, for example, in an exercise of \"the privilege and obligation of self-government,\" has \"call[ed] upon dentists to follow high ethical standards,\" including \"honesty, compassion, kindness, integrity, fairness and charity.\" American Dental Association, Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct 3-4 (2012). State laws and institutions are sustained by this tradition when they draw upon the expertise and commitment of professionals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Today's holding is not inconsistent with that idea. The Board argues, however, that the potential for money damages will discourage members of regulated occupations from participating in state government. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Filarsky v. Delia,\n   </em>\n   566 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189305\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/377/#p1666\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1666,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189305\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/377/#p1666\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012)(warning in the context of civil rights suits that the \"the most talented candidates will decline public engagements if they do not receive the same immunity enjoyed by their public employee counterparts\"). But this case, which does not present a claim for money damages, does not offer occasion to address the question whether agency officials, including board members, may, under some circumstances, enjoy immunity from damages liability. See\n   <em>\n    Goldfarb,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541902\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/773/#p791\">\n    421 U.S., at 792, n. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541902\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/773/#p791\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also Brief for Respondent 56. And, of course, the States may provide for the defense and indemnification of agency members in the event of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   States, furthermore, can ensure\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity is available to agencies by adopting clear policies to displace competition; and, if agencies controlled by active market participants interpret or enforce those policies, the States may provide active supervision. Precedent confirms this principle. The Court has rejected the argument that it would be unwise to apply the antitrust laws to professional regulation absent compliance with the prerequisites for invoking\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"[Respondents] contend that effective peer review is essential to the provision of quality medical care and that any threat of antitrust liability will prevent physicians from participating openly and\n   actively in peer-review proceedings. This argument, however, essentially challenges the wisdom of applying the antitrust laws to the sphere of medical care, and as such is properly directed to the legislative branch. To the extent that Congress has declined to exempt medical peer review from the reach of the antitrust laws, peer review is immune from antitrust scrutiny only if the State effectively has made this conduct its own.\"\n   <em>\n    Patrick,\n   </em>\n   486 U.S. at 105-106,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210918\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/94/#p100\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Patrick v.

The Act, however, says nothing about teeth whitening, a practice that did not exist when it was passed. After receiving complaints from other dentists about the nondentists' cheaper services, the Board's dentist members-some of whom offered whitening services-acted to expel the dentists' competitors from the market. In so doing the Board relied upon cease-and-desist letters threatening criminal liability, rather than any of the powers at its disposal that would invoke oversight by a politically accountable official. With no active supervision by the State, North Carolina officials may well have been unaware that the Board had decided teeth whitening constitutes \"the practice of dentistry\" and sought to prohibit those who competed against dentists from participating in the teeth whitening market. Whether or not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina law, cf.\n   <em>\n    Omni,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318959\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/365/#p374\">\n    499 U.S., at 371-372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318959\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/365/#p374\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , there is no evidence here of any decision by the State to initiate or concur with the Board's actions against the nondentists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Board does not claim that the State exercised active, or indeed any, supervision over its conduct regarding nondentist teeth whiteners; and, as a result, no specific supervisory systems can be reviewed here. It suffices to note that the inquiry regarding active supervision is flexible and context-dependent. Active supervision need not entail day-to-day involvement in an agency's operations or micromanagement of its every decision. Rather, the question is whether the State's review mechanisms provide \"realistic assurance\" that a nonsovereign actor's anticompetitive conduct \"promotes state policy, rather than merely the party's individual interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Patrick, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 100-101,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210918\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/94/#p100\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Ticor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730354\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/621/#p632\">\n    504 U.S., at 639-640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730354\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/621/#p632\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court has identified only a few constant requirements of active supervision: The supervisor must review the substance of the anticompetitive decision, not merely the procedures followed to produce it, see\n   <em>\n    Patrick,\n   </em>\n   486 U.S., at 102-103,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210918\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/94/#p100\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the supervisor must have the power to veto or modify particular decisions to ensure they accord with state policy, see\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; and the \"mere potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for a decision by the State,\"\n   <em>\n    Ticor, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 638,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730354\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/621/#p632\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The case now before us involves precisely this type of state regulation-North Carolina's laws governing the practice of dentistry, which are administered by the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners (Board).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Today, however, the Court takes the unprecedented step of holding that\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the North Carolina Board because the Board is not structured in a way that merits a good-government seal of approval; that is, it is made up of practicing dentists who have a financial incentive to use the licensing laws to further the financial interests of the State's dentists. There is nothing new about the structure of the North Carolina Board. When the States first created medical and dental boards, well before the Sherman Act was enacted, they began to staff them in this way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is there anything new about the suspicion that the North Carolina Board-in attempting to prevent persons other than dentists from performing teeth-whitening procedures-was serving the interests of dentists and not the public.

The question, instead, is whether this case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   and the answer to that question is clear.

By straying from this simple path, the Court has not only distorted\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ; it has headed into a morass. Determining whether a state agency is structured in a way that militates against regulatory capture is no easy task, and there is reason to fear that today's decision will spawn confusion. The Court has veered off course, and therefore I cannot go along.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In order to understand the nature of\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   state-action immunity, it is helpful to recall the constitutional landscape in 1890 when the Sherman Act was enacted. At that time, this Court and Congress had an understanding of the scope of federal and state power that is very different from our understanding today. The States were understood to possess the exclusive authority to regulate \"their purely internal affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Leisy v.

In exercising their police power in this area, the States had long enacted measures, such as price controls and licensing requirements, that had the effect of restraining trade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Sherman Act was enacted pursuant to Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce, and in passing the Act, Congress wanted to exercise that power \"to the utmost extent.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But in 1890, the understanding of the commerce power was far more limited than it is today. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kidd v.

As a result, the Act did not pose a threat to traditional state regulatory activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   By 1943, when\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   was decided, however, the situation had changed dramatically. This Court had held that the commerce power permitted Congress to regulate even local activity if it \"exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Wickard v. Filburn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303868\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/111/#p125\">\n    317 U.S. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303868\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/111/#p125\">\n    63 S.Ct. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"303868\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/111/#p125\">\n    87 L.Ed. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1942). This meant that Congress could regulate many of the matters that had once been thought to fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the States. The new interpretation of the commerce power brought about an expansion of the reach of the Sherman Act. See\n   <em>\n    Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181950\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/738/#p743\">\n    425 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 743, n. 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181950\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/738/#p743\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181950\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/738/#p743\">\n    48 L.Ed.2d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976)(\"[D]ecisions by this Court have permitted the reach of the Sherman Act to expand along with expanding notions of congressional power\"). And the expanded reach of the Sherman Act raised an important question. The Sherman Act does not expressly exempt States from its scope. Does that mean that the Act applies to the States and that it potentially outlaws many traditional state regulatory measures? The Court confronted that question in\n   <em>\n    Parker.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   a raisin producer challenged the California Agricultural Prorate Act, an agricultural price support program. The California Act authorized the creation of an Agricultural Prorate Advisory Commission (Commission) to establish marketing plans for certain agricultural commodities within the State. 317 U.S., at 346-347,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Raisins were among the regulated commodities, and so the Commission\n   established a marketing program that governed many aspects of raisin sales, including the quality and quantity of raisins sold, the timing of sales, and the price at which raisins were sold.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    ., at 347-348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   Court assumed that this program would have violated \"the Sherman Act if it were organized and made effective solely by virtue of a contract, combination or conspiracy of private persons,\" and the Court also assumed that Congress could have prohibited a State from creating a program like California's if it had chosen to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    ., at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the Court concluded that the California program did not violate the Sherman Act because the Act did not circumscribe state regulatory power.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    ., at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   was not based on either the language of the Sherman Act or anything in the legislative history affirmatively showing that the Act was not meant to apply to the States. Instead, the Court reasoned that \"[i]n a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to ify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress.\" 317 U.S., at 351,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the Congress that enacted the Sherman Act in 1890, it would have been a truly radical and almost certainly futile step to attempt to prevent the States from exercising their traditional regulatory authority, and the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   Court refused to assume that the Act was meant to have such an effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   When the basis for the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   state-action doctrine is understood, the Court's error in this case is plain. In 1890, the regulation of the practice of medicine and dentistry was regarded as falling squarely within the States' sovereign police power. By that time, many States had established medical and dental boards, often staffed by doctors or dentists,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had given those boards the authority to confer and revoke licenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was quintessential police power legislation, and although state laws were often challenged during that era under the doctrine of substantive due process, the licensing of medical professionals easily survived such assaults. Just one year before the enactment of the Sherman Act, in\n   <em>\n    Dent v. West Virginia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299212\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/129/114/#p128\">\n    129 U.S. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299212\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/129/114/#p128\">\n    9 S.Ct. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299212\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/129/114/#p128\">\n    32 L.Ed. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1889), this Court rejected such a challenge to a state law requiring all physicians to obtain a certificate from the state board of health attesting to their qualifications. And in\n   <em>\n    Hawker v. New York,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3599429\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/170/189/#p192\">\n    170 U.S. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3599429,3600862\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/18/573/\">\n    18 S.Ct. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3599429\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/170/189/#p192\">\n    42 L.Ed. 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1898), the Court reiterated that a law specifying the qualifications to practice medicine was clearly a proper exercise of the police power. Thus, the North Carolina statutes establishing and specifying the powers of the State Board of Dental Examiners represent precisely the kind of state regulation that the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   exemption was meant to immunize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As noted above, the only question in this case is whether the North Carolina Board\n   of Dental Examiners is really a state agency, and the answer to that question is clearly yes.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 The North Carolina Legislature determined that the practice of dentistry \"affect[s] the public health, safety and welfare\" of North Carolina's citizens and that therefore the profession should be \"subject to regulation and control in the public interest\" in order to ensure \"that only qualified persons be permitted to practice dentistry in the State.\" N.C.

And if the Board fails to file the required report, state law demands that it be automatically suspended until it does so.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As this regulatory regime demonstrates, North Carolina's Board of Dental Examiners is unmistakably a state agency created by the state legislature to serve a prescribed regulatory purpose and to do so using the State's power in cooperation with other arms of state government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Board is not a private or \"nonsovereign\" entity that the State of North Carolina has attempted to immunize from federal antitrust scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   made it clear that a State may not \" 'give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1111 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   317 U.S., at 351,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). When the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   Court disapproved of any such attempt, it cited\n   <em>\n    Northern Securities Co. v.

In that case, the Court held that a State's act of chartering a corporation did not shield the corporation's monopolizing activities from federal antitrust law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630311\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/193/197/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630311\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/193/197/\">\n    ., at 344-345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing similar is involved here. North Carolina did not authorize a private entity to enter into an anticompetitive arrangement; rather, North Carolina\n   <em>\n    created a state agency\n   </em>\n   and gave that agency the power to regulate a particular subject affecting public health and safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   supports the type of inquiry that the Court now prescribes. The Court crafts a test under which state agencies that are \"controlled by active\n   market participants,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1114, must demonstrate active state supervision in order to be immune from federal antitrust law. The Court thus treats these state agencies like private entities. But in\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   the Court did not examine the structure of the California program to determine if it had been captured by private interests. If the Court had done so, the case would certainly have come out differently, because California conditioned its regulatory measures on the participation and approval of market actors in the relevant industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Establishing a prorate marketing plan under California's law first required the petition of at least 10 producers of the particular commodity.\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   317 U.S., at 346,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the Commission then agreed that a marketing plan was warranted, the Commission would \"select a program committee\n   <em>\n    from among nominees chosen by the qualified producers\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). That committee would then formulate the proration marketing program, which the Commission could modify or approve. But even after Commission approval, the program became law (and then, automatically) only if it gained the approval of 65 percent of the relevant producers, representing at least 51 percent of the acreage of the regulated crop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    ., at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This scheme gave decisive power to market participants. But despite these aspects of the California program,\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   held that California was acting as a \"sovereign\" when it \"adopt[ed] and enforc[ed] the prorate program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    ., at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court requires the North Carolina Board to satisfy the two-part test set out in\n   <em>\n    California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.

Such an entity is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   immunity,\n   <em>\n    Midcal\n   </em>\n   held, only if the anticompetitive conduct at issue was both \" 'clearly articulated' \" and \" 'actively supervised by the State itself.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777810\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/97/#p105\">\n    445 U.S., at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777810\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/97/#p105\">\n    100 S.Ct. 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those requirements are needed where a State authorizes private parties to engage in anticompetitive conduct. They serve to identify those situations in which conduct\n   <em>\n    by private parties\n   </em>\n   can be regarded as the conduct of a State.

But that is essentially what the Court has done here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Not only is the Court's decision inconsistent with the underlying theory of\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ; it will create practical problems and is likely to have far-reaching effects on the States' regulation of professions. As previously noted, state medical and dental boards have been staffed by practitioners since they were first created, and there are obvious advantages to this approach. It is reasonable for States to decide that the individuals best able to regulate technical professions are practitioners with expertise in those very professions. Staffing the State Board of Dental Examiners with certified public accountants would certainly lessen the risk of actions that place the well-being of dentists over those of the public, but this would also compromise the State's interest in sensibly regulating a technical profession in which lay people have little expertise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As a result of today's decision, States may find it necessary to change the composition\n   of medical, dental, and other boards, but it is not clear what sort of changes are needed to satisfy the test that the Court now adopts. The Court faults the structure of the North Carolina Board because \"active market participants\" constitute \"a controlling number of [the] decisionmakers,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1114, but this test raises many questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   What is a \"controlling number\"? Is it a majority? And if so, why does the Court eschew that term? Or does the Court mean to leave open the possibility that something less than a majority might suffice in particular circumstances? Suppose that active market participants constitute a voting bloc that is generally able to get its way? How about an obstructionist minority or an agency chair empowered to set the agenda or veto regulations?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Who is an \"active market participant\"? If Board members withdraw from practice during a short term of service but typically return to practice when their terms end, does that mean that they are not active market participants during their period of service?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   What is the scope of the market in which a member may not participate while serving on the board? Must the market be relevant to the particular regulation being challenged or merely to the jurisdiction of the entire agency? Would the result in the present case be different if a majority of the Board members, though practicing dentists, did not provide teeth whitening services? What if they were orthodontists, periodontists, and the like? And how much participation makes a person \"active\" in the market?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The answers to these questions are not obvious, but the States must predict the answers in order to make informed choices about how to constitute their agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   I suppose that all this will be worked out by the lower courts and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but the Court's approach raises a more fundamental question, and that is why the Court's inquiry should stop with an examination of the structure of a state licensing board. When the Court asks whether market participants control the North Carolina Board, the Court in essence is asking whether this regulatory body has been captured by the entities that it is supposed to regulate. Regulatory capture can occur in many ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   So why ask only whether the members of a board are active market participants? The answer may be that determining when regulatory capture has occurred is no simple task. That answer provides a reason for relieving courts from the obligation to make such determinations at all. It does not explain why it is appropriate for the Court to adopt the rather crude test for capture that constitutes the holding of today's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Court has created a new standard for distinguishing between private and state actors for purposes of federal antitrust immunity. This new standard is not true to the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   doctrine; it diminishes our traditional respect for federalism and state sovereignty; and it will be difficult to apply.
