The pipelines' behavior affected\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   federally regulated\n   <em>\n    wholesale\n   </em>\n   natural-gas prices\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   nonfederally regulated\n   <em>\n    retail\n   </em>\n   natural-gas prices. The question is whether the federal Natural Gas Act pre-empts these lawsuits. We have said that, in passing the Act, \"Congress occupied the field of matters relating to wholesale sales and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13729\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/293/#p305\">\n    485 U.S. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13729\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/293/#p305\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13729\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/293/#p305\">\n    99 L.Ed.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Nevertheless, for the reasons given below, we conclude that the Act does not pre-empt the state-law antitrust suits at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Supremacy Clause provides that \"the Laws of the United States\" (as well as treaties and the Constitution itself) \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land\n   ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" Art. VI, cl. 2. Congress may consequently pre-empt,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   invalidate, a state law through federal legislation. It may do so through express language in a statute. But even where, as here, a statute does not refer expressly to pre-emption, Congress may implicitly pre-empt a state law, rule, or other state action. See\n   <em>\n    Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190636\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/51/#p64\">\n    537 U.S. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190636\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/51/#p64\">\n    123 S.Ct. 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190636\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/51/#p64\">\n    154 L.Ed.2d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It may do so either through \"field\" pre-emption or \"conflict\" pre-emption. As to the former, Congress may have intended \"to foreclose any state regulation in the\n   <em>\n    area,\n   </em>\n   \" irrespective of whether state law is consistent or inconsistent with \"federal standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. United States,\n   </em>\n   567 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p2502\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2502,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p2502\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012)(emphasis added). In such situations, Congress has forbidden the State to take action in the\n   <em>\n    field\n   </em>\n   that the federal statute pre-empts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By contrast, conflict pre-emption exists where \"compliance with both state and federal law is impossible,\" or where \"the state law 'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' \"\n   <em>\n    California v.

In either situation, federal law must prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   No one here claims that any relevant federal statute expressly pre-empts state antitrust lawsuits. Nor have the parties argued at any length that these state suits conflict with federal law. Rather, the interstate pipeline companies (petitioners here) argue that Congress implicitly \" 'occupied\n   <em>\n    the field of matters\n   </em>\n   relating to wholesale sales and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.' \" Brief for Petitioners 18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schneidewind, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 305,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13729\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/293/#p305\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added)). And they contend that the state antitrust claims advanced by their direct-sales customers (respondents here) fall within that field. The United States, supporting the pipelines, argues similarly. See Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   15. Since the parties have argued this case almost exclusively in terms of field pre-emption, we consider only the field pre-emption question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Federal regulation of the natural-gas industry began at a time when the industry was divided into three segments. See 1 Regulation of the Natural Gas Industry \u00a7 1.01 (W. Mogel ed. 2008) (hereinafter Mogel);\n   <em>\n    General Motors Corp. v. Tracy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p283\">\n    519 U.S. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p283\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p283\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). First, natural-gas producers sunk wells in large oil and gas fields (such as the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico). They gathered the gas, brought it to transportation points, and left it to interstate gas pipelines to transport the gas to distant markets. Second, interstate pipelines shipped the gas from the field to cities and towns across the Nation. Third, local gas distributors bought the gas from the interstate pipelines and resold it to business and residential customers within their localities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Originally, the States regulated all three segments of the industry. See 1 Mogel \u00a7 1.03. But in the early 20th century, this Court held that the Commerce Clause forbids the States to regulate the second part of the business-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the interstate shipment and sale of gas to local distributors for resale. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Public Util. Comm'n of R.I. v. Attleboro Steam &amp; Elec.

These holdings left a regulatory gap.

That authority allows FERC to determine whether \"any rate, charge, or classification ... collected by any natural-gas company in connection with any transportation or sale of natural gas,\n   <em>\n    subject to the jurisdiction of\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    FERC\n   </em>\n   ],\" or \"any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   rate, charge, or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d(a)(emphasis added). As the italicized words make clear, \u00a7 5(a) limits the scope of FERC's authority to activities \"in connection with any transportation or sale of natural gas,\n   <em>\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%201035\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). And the Act, in \u00a7 1(b), limits FERC's \"jurisdiction\" to (1) \"the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce,\" (2) \"the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale,\" and (3) \"natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale.\" \u00a7 717(b). The Act leaves regulation of other portions of the industry-such as production, local distribution facilities, and direct sales-to the States. See\n   <em>\n    Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. v.

Similarly, we shall refer to the sales over which FERC has jurisdiction as \"jurisdictional sales\" or \"wholesale sales.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Until the 1970's, natural-gas regulation roughly tracked the industry model we described above. Interstate pipelines would typically buy gas from field producers and resell it to local distribution companies for resale. See\n   <em>\n    Tracy, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 283,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p283\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . FERC (or FPC), acting under the authority of the Natural Gas Act, would set interstate pipeline wholesale rates using classical \"cost-of-service\" ratemaking methods. See\n   <em>\n    Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y. v. Mid-Louisiana Gas Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194743\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/319/#p328\">\n    463 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194743\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/319/#p328\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194743\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/319/#p328\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). That is, FERC would determine a pipeline's revenue requirement by calculating the costs of providing its services, including operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, taxes, and a reasonable profit. See FERC, Cost-of-Service Rates Manual 6 (June 1999). FERC would then set wholesale rates at a level designed to meet the pipeline's revenue requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Deregulation of the natural-gas industry, however, brought about changes in FERC's approach. In the 1950's, this Court had held that the Natural Gas Act required regulation of prices at the interstate pipelines'\n   <em>\n    buying\n   </em>\n   end-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the prices at which field producers sold natural gas to interstate pipelines.\n   <em>\n    Phillips Petroleum Co., supra,\n   </em>\n   at 682, 685,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11302432\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/672/#p682\">\n    74 S.Ct. 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By the 1970's, many in Congress thought that such efforts to regulate field prices\n   had jeopardized natural-gas supplies in an industry already dependent \"on the caprice of nature.\"\n   <em>\n    FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143691\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/320/591/#p630\">\n    320 U.S. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143691\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/320/591/#p630\">\n    64 S.Ct. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143691\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/320/591/#p630\">\n    88 L.Ed. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944)(opinion of Jackson, J.); see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 629,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143691\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/320/591/#p630\">\n    64 S.Ct. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that \"the wealth of Midas and the wit of man cannot produce ... a natural gas field\"). Hoping to avoid future shortages, Congress enacted forms of field price deregulation designed to rely upon competition, rather than regulation, to keep field prices low. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%203409\">\n    92 Stat. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , codified in part at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203301\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (phasing out regulation of wellhead prices charged by producers of natural gas); Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Stat.%20157\">\n    103 Stat. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (removing price controls on wellhead sales as of January 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   FERC promulgated new regulations designed to further this process of deregulation. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines after Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 50 Fed.Reg. 42408 (1985)(allowing \"open access\" to pipelines so that consumers could pay to ship their own gas). Most important here, FERC adopted an approach that relied on the competitive marketplace, rather than classical regulatory rate-setting, as the main mechanism for keeping\n   <em>\n    wholesale\n   </em>\n   natural-gas rates at a reasonable level. Order No. 636, issued in 1992, allowed FERC to issue blanket certificates that permitted jurisdictional sellers (typically interstate pipelines) to charge market-based rates for gas, provided that FERC had first determined that the sellers lacked market power. See 57 Fed.Reg. 57957-57958 (1992);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 13270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the issuance of this order, FERC's oversight of the natural-gas market largely consisted of (1) ex ante examinations of jurisdictional sellers' market power, and (2) the availability of a complaint process under \u00a7 717d(a). See Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   4. The new system also led many large gas consumers-such as industrial and commercial users-to buy their own gas directly from gas producers, and to arrange (and often pay separately) for transportation from the field to the place of consumption. See\n   <em>\n    Tracy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p283\">\n    519 U.S., at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p283\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Insofar as interstate pipelines sold gas to such consumers, they sold it for direct consumption rather than resale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The free-market system for setting interstate pipeline rates turned out to be less than perfect. Interstate pipelines, distributing companies, and many of the customers who bought directly from the pipelines found that they had to rely on privately published price indices to determine appropriate prices for their natural-gas contracts. These indices listed the prices at which natural gas was being sold in different (presumably competitive) markets across the country. The information on which these indices were based was voluntarily reported by natural-gas traders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In 2003, FERC found that the indices were inaccurate, in part because much of the information that natural-gas traders reported had been false. See FERC, Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets (Mar. 2003), App. 88-89. FERC found that false reporting had involved \"inflating the volume of trades, omitting trades, and adjusting the price of trades.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 88. That is, sometimes those who reported information simply fabricated it. Other times, the information reported reflected \"wash trades,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    prearranged\n   </em>\n   pair[s] of trades of the same good between the same parties, involving no economic risk and no net change in beneficial ownership.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 215. FERC concluded that these \"efforts to manipulate\n   price indices compiled by trade publications\" had helped raise \"to extraordinary levels\" the prices of both jurisdictional sales (that is, interstate pipeline sales for resale) and nonjurisdictional direct sales to ultimate consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 86, 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After issuing its final report on price manipulation in western markets, FERC issued a Code of Conduct. That code amended all blanket certificates to prohibit jurisdictional sellers \"from engaging in actions without a legitimate business purpose that manipulate or attempt to manipulate market conditions, including wash trades and collusion.\" 68 Fed.Reg. 66324 (2003). The code also required jurisdictional companies, when they provided information to natural-gas index publishers, to \"provide accurate and factual information, and not knowingly submit false or misleading information or omit material information to any such publisher.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 66337. At the same time, FERC issued a policy statement setting forth \"minimum standards for creation and publication of any energy price index,\" and \"for reporting transaction data to index developers.\"\n   <em>\n    Price Discovery in Natural Gas and Elec. Markets,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C121\">\n    104 FERC \u00b6 61,121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , pp. 61,407, 61,408 (2003). Finally, FERC, after finding that certain jurisdictional sellers had \"engaged in wash trading ... that resulted in the manipulation of [natural-gas] prices,\" terminated those sellers' blanket marketing certificates.\n   <em>\n    Enron Power Marketing, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C343\">\n    103 FERC \u00b6 61,343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , p. 62,303 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Congress also took steps to address these problems.

And it held that respondents' claims, which were \"aimed at\" these sellers' \"alleged practices of false price reporting, wash trades, and anticompetitive collusive behavior\" were pre-empted because \"such practices,\" not only affected nonjurisdictional direct-sale prices but also \"directly affect[ed]\" jurisdictional (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   wholesale) rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed.

The Court drew this inference from the law's purpose and legislative history, though it could just as easily have relied on the law's terms and structure.

The Natural Gas Act empowers the Commission to regulate \"practice[s] ... affecting [wholesale] rate[s].\" \u00a7 717d. Nothing in the Act suggests that the States share power to regulate these practices. The Commission has reasonably determined that this power allows it\n   to regulate the behavior involved in this case, pipelines' use of sham trades and false reports to manipulate gas price indices.

That is an unprecedented decision. The Court does not identify a single case-not one-in which we have sustained state regulation of behavior already regulated by the Commission.

The Act does not give the Commission the power to aim at particular effects; it gives it the power to regulate particular activities. When the Commission regulates those activities, it may consider their effects on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   parts of the gas trade, not just on wholesale sales. It may, for example, set wholesale rates with the aim of encouraging producers to conserve gas supplies-even though production is a state-regulated activity.

Or it may regulate wholesale sales with an eye toward blunting the sales' anticompetitive effects in the retail market-even though retail prices are controlled by the States. See\n   <em>\n    FPC v.

The Court's ad hoc partition of authority over index manipulation-leaving it to the Commission to control the practice's consequences for wholesale sales, but allowing the States to target its consequences for retail sales-thus clashes with the design of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   To justify its fixation on aims, the Court stresses that this case involves regulation of \"background marketplace conditions\" rather than regulation of wholesale rates or sales themselves.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1602. But the Natural Gas Act empowers the Commission to regulate wholesale rates\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"background\" practices affecting such rates. It grants both powers in the same clause: \"Whenever the Commission ... find[s] that a [wholesale] rate, charge, or classification ... [or] any rule, regulation,\n   <em>\n    practice,\n   </em>\n   or contract affecting such rate, charge, or classification is unjust [or] unreasonable, ... the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation,\n   <em>\n    practice,\n   </em>\n   or contract to be thereafter observed.\" \u00a7 717d(a)(emphasis added). Nothing in this provision, and for that matter nothing in the Act, suggests that federal authority over practices is a second-class power, somehow less exclusive than the authority over rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court persists that the background conditions in this case affect\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   wholesale and retail sales.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1599. This observation adds atmosphere, but nothing more. The Court concedes that index manipulation's dual effect does not weaken the Commission's power to regulate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1599. So too should the Court have seen that this simultaneous effect does not strengthen the claims of the States. It is not at all unusual for an activity controlled by the Commission to have effects in the States' field; production, wholesale, and retail are after all interdependent stages of a single trade. We have never suggested that the rules of field preemption change in such situations. For example, producers' ability to pass production taxes on to pipelines no doubt affects both producers and pipelines. Yet we had no trouble concluding that a state law restricting producers' ability to pass these taxes impermissibly attempted to manage \"a matter within the sphere of FERC's regulatory authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Exxon, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 185-186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186809\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/176/#p185\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court's approach makes a snarl of our precedents.

Our precedents demand, in other words, that the Court focus in the present case upon\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   the State seeks to regulate (a pipeline practice that is subject to regulation by the Commission), not\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the State seeks to regulate it (to curb the practice's effects on retail rates).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Trying to turn liabilities into assets, the Court brandishes statements from\n   <em>\n    Northern Natural\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Northwest Central\n   </em>\n   that (in its view) discuss where state law was \"aimed\" or \"directed.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1600.

So what? No principle of our natural-gas preemption jurisprudence distinguishes particularized state laws from state laws of general applicability. We have never suggested, for example, that a State may use general price-gouging laws to fix wholesale rates, or general laws about unfair trade practices to control wholesale contracts, or general common-carrier laws to administer interstate pipelines. The Court in any event could not have chosen a worse setting in which to attempt a distinction between general and particular laws. Like their federal counterpart, state antitrust laws tend to use the rule of reason to judge the lawfulness of challenged practices. Legal Aspects of Buying and Selling \u00a7 10:12 (P.

Nothing in the Act and nothing in our cases suggests that Congress protected state power in the way imagined by today's decision: by licensing state sorties into the Commission's domain whenever judges conclude that an incursion would not be too disruptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court's preoccupation with the purpose of preserving state authority is all the more inexpiable because that is not the Act's only purpose. The Act also has competing purposes, the most important of which is promoting \"uniformity of regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Northern Natural, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765351\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/84/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's decision impairs\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   objective. Before today, interstate pipelines knew that their practices relating to price indices had to comply with one set of regulations promulgated by the Commission. From now on, however, pipelines will have to ensure that their behavior conforms to the discordant regulations of 50 States-or more accurately, to the discordant verdicts of untold state antitrust juries. The Court's reassurance that pipelines may still invoke conflict preemption, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1602, provides little comfort on this front. Conflict preemption will resolve only discrepancies between state and federal regulations, not the discrepancies among differing state regulations to which today's opinion subjects the industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \"The Natural Gas Act was designed ... to produce a harmonious and comprehensive regulation of the industry. Neither state nor federal regulatory body was to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the other.\"\n   <em>\n    FPC v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572349\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/498/#p513\">\n    337 U.S. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572349\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/498/#p513\">\n    69 S.Ct. 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%201499\">\n    93 L.Ed. 1499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949)(footnote omitted). Today, however, the Court allows the States to encroach. Worse still, it leaves pipelines guessing about when States will be allowed to encroach again. May States aim at retail rates under laws that share none of the features of antitrust law advertised today? Under laws that share only some of those features? May States apply their antitrust laws to pipelines\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   aiming at retail rates? But that is just the start. Who knows what other \"considerations that weigh against a finding of preemption\" remain to be unearthed in future cases? The Court's all-things-considered test does not make for a stable background against which to carry on the natural gas trade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I would stand by the more principled and more workable line traced by our precedents. The Commission may regulate the practices alleged in this case; the States therefore may not. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
