Here, we address the meaning of these two quoted phrases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The first question in this case is who is the \"comparison class\" for purposes of a subsection (b)(4) claim. Alabama argues that the only appropriate comparison class for a subsection (b)(4) claim is all general commercial and industrial taxpayers. We disagree. While all general and commercial taxpayers is\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   appropriate comparison class, it is not the only one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word \"discrimination\" suggests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the population at large. If, for example, a State offers free college education to all returning combat veterans, but arbitrarily excepts those who served in the Marines, we would say that Marines have experienced discrimination. That would remain the case even though the Marines are treated the same way as members of the general public, who have to pay for their education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Context confirms that the comparison class for subsection (b)(4) is not limited as Alabama suggests. The 4-R Act is an \"asymmetrical statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 296,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsections (b)(1) to (b)(3) contain three specific prohibitions directed towards property taxes. Each requires comparison of railroad property to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction. The Act therefore limits the comparison class for challenges under those provisions. Even if the jurisdiction treats railroads less favorably than residential property, no violation of these subsections has occurred. Subsection (b)(4) contains no such limitation, leaving the comparison class to be determined as it is normally determined with respect to discrimination claims. And we think that depends on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim. When a railroad alleges that a tax targets it for worse treatment than local businesses, all other commercial and industrial taxpayers are the comparison class. When a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared to its competitors in the transportation industry, the railroad's competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   So, picking a comparison class is extraordinarily easy. Unlike under subsections (b)(1)-(3), the railroad is not limited to all commercial and industrial taxpayers; all the world, or at least all the world within the taxing jurisdiction, is its comparison-class oyster. But that is not as generous a concession as might seem. What subsection (b)(4) requires, and subsections (b)(1)-(3) do not, is a showing of\n   <em>\n    discrimination\n   </em>\n   -of a failure to treat similarly situated persons alike. A comparison class will thus support a discrimination claim only if it consists of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   That raises the question of when a proposed comparison class qualifies as similarly situated. In the Equal Protection Clause context, very few taxpayers are regarded as similarly situated and thus entitled to equal treatment. There, a State may tax different lines of businesses differently with near-impunity, even if they are apparently similar.

As one treatise has observed, we recognize a \"wide latitude state legislatures enjoy in drawing tax classifications under the Equal Protection Clause.\" 1 J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation \u00b6 3.03[1], p. 3-5 (3d ed. 2001-2005). This includes the power to impose \"widely different taxes on various trades or professions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 3-5 to 3-6. It would be permissible-as far as the Equal Protection Clause is concerned-for a State to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier, despite the seeming similarity in their lines of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The concept of \"similarly situated\" individuals cannot be so narrow here. That would deprive subsection (b)(4) of all real-world effect, providing protection that the Equal Protection Clause already provides. Moreover, the category of \"similarly situated\" (b)(4) comparison classes must include commercial and industrial taxpayers. There is no conceivable reason why the statute would forbid property taxes higher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class vis-\u00e0-vis railroads. And we think the competitors of railroads can be another \"similarly situated\" comparison class, since discrimination in favor of that class most obviously frustrates the purpose of the 4-R Act, which was to \"restore the financial stability of the railway system of the United States,\" \u00a7 101(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Stat.%2033\">\n    90 Stat. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while \"foster[ing] competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation,\" \u00a7 101(b)(2). We need not, and thus do not, express any opinion on what other comparison classes may qualify. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Alabama claims that because subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3) (and (b)(2) through reference to (b)(1)) establish a comparison class of \"commercial and industrial property,\" subsection (b)(4) must establish a comparison class of \"general commercial and industrial taxpayers.\" This inverts normal rules of interpretation, which would say that the explicit limitation to \"commercial and industrial\" in the first three provisions, and the absence of such a limitation in the fourth, suggests that no such limitation applies to the fourth. Moreover, Alabama's interpretation would require us to dragoon the modifier \"commercial and industrial\"-but not the noun \"property\"-from the first three provisions, append \"general\" in front of it and \"taxpayers\" after, both words foreign to the preceding\n   subsections. We might also have to strip away the restrictions in the definition of \"commercial and industrial property,\" which excludes land primarily used for agricultural purposes and timber growing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). This is not our concept of fidelity to a statute's text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Alabama responds that the introductory clause of \u00a7 11501(b)-which declares that the \"following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce,\"-\"binds its four subsections together,\" Brief for Petitioners 23 (emphasis deleted), and gives them a common object and scope. The last time this case appeared before us, Alabama made a similar argument in support of the claim that, because subsections (b)(1)-(3) cover only property taxes, so too does subsection (b)(4). See Brief for Respondents in\n   <em>\n    CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue,\n   </em>\n   O.T. 2010, No. 09-520, p. 25-26. We rejected this argument then, and we reject it again now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Alabama persists that a case-specific inquiry allows a railroad to \"hand-pick [its] comparison class,\" Brief for Petitioners 41, which would be unfair-a \"windfall\" to railroads.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011501\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011501\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   As we have described above, picking a class is easy, but it is not easy to establish that the selected class is \"similarly situated\" for purposes of discrimination in taxation. The Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that, in light of CSX Transportation's complaint and the parties' stipulation, a comparison class of competitors consisting of motor carriers and water carriers was appropriate, and differential treatment vis-\u00e0-vis that class would constitute discrimination. We therefore turn to the court's refusal to consider Alabama's alternative tax justifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A State's tax discriminates only where the State cannot sufficiently justify differences in treatment between similarly situated taxpayers. As we have discussed above, a rail carrier and its competitors can be considered similarly situated for purposes of this provision. But what about the claim that those competitors are subject to\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   taxes that the railroads avoid? We think Alabama can justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use tax through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-excise tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt. If that were true,\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   competitors could claim to be disfavored-discriminated against-relative to each other. Our negative Commerce Clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.\n   <em>\n    Gregg Dyeing Co. v.

We think that an alternative, roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that renders a tax disparity nondiscriminatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CSX claims that because the statutory prohibition forbids \"impos[ing] another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)-\"tax\" in the singular-the appropriate inquiry is whether the challenged\n   <em>\n    tax\n   </em>\n   discriminates, not whether the tax code as a whole does so. It is undoubtedly correct that the \"tax\" (singular) must discriminate-but it does not discriminate unless it treats railroads differently from other\n   <em>\n    similarly situated\n   </em>\n   taxpayers\n   <em>\n    without sufficient justification\n   </em>\n   . A comparable tax levied on a competitor may justify not extending that competitor's exemption from a general tax to a railroad. It is easy to display the error of CSX's single-tax-provision approach. Under that\n   model, the following tax would violate the 4-R Act: \"(1) All railroads shall pay a 4% sales tax.

We are inclined to agree, but that cannot carry the day. Congress assigned this task to the courts by drafting an antidiscrimination command in such sweeping terms. There is simply no discrimination when there are roughly comparable taxes. If the task of determining when that is so is \"Sisyphean,\" as the Eleventh Circuit called it,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057791\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/863/\">\n    720 F.3d, at 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is a Sisyphean task that the statute imposes. We therefore cannot approve of the Eleventh Circuit's refusal to consider Alabama's tax-based justification, and remand for that court to consider whether Alabama's fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of Alabama's sales tax as applied to diesel fuel, and therefore justifies the motor carrier sales-tax exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While the State argues that the existence of a fuel-excise tax justifies its decision to exempt motor carriers from the sales and use tax, it cannot offer a similar defense with respect to its exemption for water carriers. Water carriers pay neither tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State, however, offers other justifications for the water carrier exemption-for example, that such an exemption is compelled by federal law. The Eleventh Circuit failed to examine these justifications, asserting that the water carriers were the beneficiaries of a discriminatory tax regime. We do not consider whether Alabama's alternative rationales justify its exemption, but leave that question for the Eleventh Circuit on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice GINSBURGjoins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In order to violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), \"a tax exemption scheme must target or single out railroads by comparison to general commercial and industrial taxpayers.\"\n   <em>\n    CSX Transp., Inc. v.

Both the structure and background of the statute indicate that subsection (b)(4) prohibits only taxes that single out railroads as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Subsection (b)(4) is a residual clause, the meaning of which is best understood by\n   reference to the provisions that precede it. Subsection (b) begins by announcing that \"[t]he following acts ... discriminate against interstate commerce\" and are prohibited. \u00a7 11501(b). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) then list three tax-related actions that single out rail carriers by treating rail property differently from all other commercial and industrial property. \u00a7\u00a7 11501(b)(1)-(3);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 300,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3) explicitly identify \"commercial and industrial property\" as the comparison class, and subsection (b)(2) incorporates that comparison class by reference. \u00a7 11501(b);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 300,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsection (b)(4) refers back to these provisions when it forbids \"[i]mpos[ing]\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.\" \u00a7 11501(b)(4)(emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 300,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statutory structure therefore supports the conclusion that a tax \"discriminates against a rail carrier\" within the meaning of subsection (b)(4) if it singles out railroads for unfavorable treatment as compared to the general class of commercial and industrial taxpayers.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 300-301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The statutory background supports the same conclusion. When Congress enacted the 4-R Act, it was apparent that railroads were \"easy prey for State and local tax assessors in that they are nonvoting, often nonresident, targets for local taxation, who cannot easily remove themselves from the locality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Subsections (b)(1) through (3) thus \"establish a political check\" by preventing States from imposing excessive property taxes on railroads \"without imposing the same taxes more generally on voting, resident local businesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Subsection (b)(4) is best understood as addressing the same problem in the same way.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 301-302,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Alabama's tax scheme cannot be said to \"discriminat[e] against a rail carrier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 302,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To begin, the scheme does not single out rail carriers. Although one would not know it from the majority opinion, the tax is not directed at rail carriers, their property, their activity, or goods uniquely consumed by them. It is instead a generally applicable sales tax. It applies (with other exemptions not at issue here) to all goods purchased, used, or stored in the State of Alabama. Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 40-23-2(1), 40-23-61(a) (2011). The only relevant good exempted from the tax is diesel on which the motor fuel tax has been paid, \u00a7 40-17-325(b), and no provision of law prevents rail carriers from buying such diesel. See Brief for Respondent 46, n. 13 (acknowledging that CSX pays the motor fuel tax on the diesel fuel it uses in trucks and other on-road vehicles). Water carriers, it is true, enjoy a special carve-out from this sales tax, \u00a7 40-23-4(a)(10) (Cum. Supp. 2014), but that exemption singles out\n   <em>\n    water\n   </em>\n   carriers, not\n   <em>\n    rail\n   </em>\n   carriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Even if this constellation of exemptions to Alabama's sales tax could be said to single out rail carriers from the general class of their interstate competitors, the tax surely does not single out rail carriers as compared to commercial and industrial taxpayers. Those taxpayers are subject to exactly the same generally applicable sales and use tax regime as are rail carriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court started off on the wrong track in\n   <em>\n    CSX I\n   </em>\n   when it relied on a generic dictionary definition of \"discriminates\" in the face of a statutory context suggesting a more specific definition.

The majority purports to derive this limitation from the dictionary, but then finds itself unable to proceed: After all, Black's Law Dictionary contains no entry defining what it means to be \"similarly situated\" for the purpose of subsection (b)(4).

See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1141 - 1142, 1142 - 1143. It asserts that defining the comparison class for the purpose of subsection (b)(4) by reference to the comparison class identified in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) \"would require us to dragoon the modifier 'commercial and industrial'-but not the noun 'property'-from the first three provisions, append 'general' in front of it and 'taxpayers' after, both words foreign to the preceding subsections.''\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1142 - 1143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The majority's accusation of grammatical conscription misses the point.

Where, as here, a residual clause includes an ambiguous word like \"discriminates,\" we must look to the clauses that precede it to guide our understanding of its scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In some sense, my task in giving meaning to the statutory term \"discriminates\" is no different from the majority's: to determine what type of differential treatment the statute forbids. The first three clauses provide important clues that the statute forbids singling out rail carriers from other commercial and industrial taxpayers because commercial and industrial taxpayers are the ones who pay taxes on \"commercial and industrial property.\" The majority pursues the same logical train of thought when it opines that \"the category of 'similarly situated' (b)(4) comparison classes must include commercial and industrial taxpayers\" because \"[t]here is no conceivable reason why the statute would forbid\n   property taxes higher than what that class enjoys (or suffers), but permit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class vis-\u00e0-vis railroads.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1142. Where we part ways is in the inferences we draw from the statutory context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Treating subsection (b)(4) as a residual clause does not require the grammatical distortions that the majority alleges. The word \"discriminates\" in subsection (b)(4) is not a referential phrase whose antecedent is uncertain. If it were, then it would be necessary to select an antecedent that would fit grammatically in place of \"discriminates.\" Instead, I look to (b)(1) to (3) merely to clarify an ambiguity in the\n   <em>\n    meaning\n   </em>\n   of \"discriminates,\" a task that does not require me to \"dragoon\" the language of the prior clauses into subsection (b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nor does my approach rely on the first three clauses of \u00a7 11501(b)to supply a general limitation on the independent prohibition that appears in subsection (b)(4).

The majority cherry-picks two of a number of stated goals of a complex piece of legislation over 100 pages long and assumes that this specific provision was assigned to those specific purposes. And then it interprets the statute to perform in the manner the majority believes is best designed to \"restore ... financial stability\" and \"foster ... competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1142 (alteration omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   I have no reason to doubt the economic soundness of the majority's conclusion that discrimination between rail carriers and their competitors threatens their financial stability and impedes competition, but I lack the majority's certitude that \u00a7 11501(b)(4)is designed to further\n   <em>\n    those goals\n   </em>\n   by combatting\n   <em>\n    that evil,\n   </em>\n   at least in\n   <em>\n    the way\n   </em>\n   the majority asserts. Instead, the first three subsections provide strong textual evidence that \u00a7 11501(b)was designed to stabilize rail carriers by protecting them from discrimination against interstate commerce. And they provide evidence of Congress' chosen mechanism for accomplishing that goal: tying the fate of interstate rail carriers to the broader class of commercial and industrial taxpayers. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The introductory clause of \u00a7 11501(b)provides further evidence that the evil at which subsection (b)(4) is targeted is not discrimination between rail carriers and their competitors, but \"acts [that] unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce.\" The majority's response to this evidence-that the Court rejected a similar argument when it refused to limit subsection (b)(4) to property taxes or their kin,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1142 - 1143-is a non sequitur. The introductory clause contains no reference to property taxes that \"binds its four subsections together\" as prohibitions on discriminatory property taxes.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   But it\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have a reference to discrimination against interstate commerce, which\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   tie the sections together to serve\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   common statutory purpose. This, in turn, weighs against the majority's inferences about how \u00a7 11501(b)relates to the stated purposes of the 4-R Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The majority's conclusion that competitors are a permissible comparison class completely ignores these contextual clues, permitting subsection (b)(4) to serve different statutory goals by a different mechanism than its three predecessor clauses. And it leads to odd inconsistencies. If we were to understand the provision as prohibiting\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   discrimination between rail carriers and their competitors, then it might well further the goal of promoting competition between interstate carriers. But the majority instead selects a shifting-comparison-class approach, requiring rail carriers to be treated at least as well as their competitors and\n   <em>\n    any other\n   </em>\n   similarly situated taxpayers. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1141 - 1142. This most-favored taxpayer status is a position the competitors do not enjoy, so the majority's position could result in tax schemes that\n   <em>\n    impede\n   </em>\n   competition between interstate carriers rather than promote it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Identifying \"similarly situated\" taxpayers by the undisciplined approach the majority endorses could well lead to other unanticipated consequences. This is why the policy judgments needed to link statutory mechanisms to statutory purposes are best left to Congress. If this Court is going to adopt a shifting-comparison-class approach to \u00a7 11501(b)(4), then it should at least demand a stronger textual link between the comparison class a claimant seeks to import into subsection (b)(4) and any purpose that the claimant argues it serves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because the majority adopts an interpretation of \u00a7 11501(b)(4)that is not grounded in the text, it should come as no surprise that this interpretation is difficult to apply, as this case demonstrates. It is easy to see how, accepting water carriers as a comparison class, the scheme treats water carriers and rail carriers differently when it grants water carriers, but not rail carriers, an exemption from the sales tax. Ala.Code \u00a7 40-23-4(a)(10). Identifying the difference in treatment between rail and motor carriers, by contrast, requires a good deal more imagination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The majority's approach exhibits that imagination. It glosses over the general applicability of the provisions that apply to rail and motor carriers, stating that \"[t]he State applies the [sales or use] tax, at the usual 4% rate, to railroads' purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail operations,\" but \"exempts from the tax purchases and uses of diesel fuel made by [motor carriers].\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1140. A quick glimpse at the code reveals that this is not quite the case. The applicability of the sales and use taxes does not depend on the identity of the purchaser, but on whether the purchaser pays another excise tax, \u00a7 40-17-325(b), which in turn depends on the nature of the product purchased and its use, \u00a7\u00a7 40-17-328, 40-17-329, which in turn merely correlates to the carriers' operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As far as I can tell, the rail carriers use dyed diesel that is exempt from the motor fuel tax-and therefore subject to the sales and use taxes-as a matter of choice rather than necessity. Dyed diesel has no special properties that make it more suitable for use in a train engine; the dye merely identifies it as exempt from the federal excise tax, \u00a7 40-17-322(21). And no law prohibits rail carriers from using undyed diesel. To the contrary, it is the motor carriers who are prohibited from using the dyed variant for on-road use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that state law provides that only dyed diesel may be used in rail operations, it becomes a little easier to make an argument that the State treats rail carriers differently\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   . But the majority still faces a line-drawing problem. Is it necessary that the good subject to the challenged tax be the same as the good on which the competitor enjoys an exemption? Could a rail carrier that relies on natural gas rather than diesel for motive power make the same claim of discrimination if natural gas is not entitled to the same sales-tax exemption as diesel? Is it necessary that the rail carrier and its competitor rely on the good for the same purpose? Could a rail carrier that uses diesel for motive power challenge a hypothetical provision that exempted from the sales and use taxes diesel that motor carriers use for refrigeration in refrigerated trailers?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority never answers these questions. \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\" it intones.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1142. \"That gets this case off our docket, sure enough. But it utterly fails to do what this Court is supposed to do: provide guidance concrete enough to ensure that the\" statute is applied consistently.\n   <em>\n    James,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p217\">\n    550 U.S., at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p217\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SCALIA, J., dissenting). We have demanded clarity from Congress when it comes to statutes that \"se[t] limits upon the taxation authority of state government, an authority we have recognized as central to state sovereignty.\"\n   <em>\n    Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p344\">\n    510 U.S. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344-345,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p344\">\n    114 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p344\">\n    127 L.Ed.2d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). We should demand the same of ourselves when we interpret those statutes. Yet after today's decision, lower courts, soon to be met with an oyster's shellful of comparison classes,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1141 - 1142, will have no\n   idea how to determine when a tax exemption that is not tied to the taxpayer's status constitutes differential treatment of two taxpayers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The majority's interpretation of \u00a7 11501(b)(1)derails ambiguous text from clarifying context. The result it reaches is predictably unworkable. And it prolongs Alabama's burden of litigating a baseless claim of discrimination that should have been dismissed long ago. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
