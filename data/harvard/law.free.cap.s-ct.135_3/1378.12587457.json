Like other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid offers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal funds in exchange for the States' agreement to spend them in accordance with congressionally imposed conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In order to qualify for Medicaid funding, the State of Idaho adopted, and the Federal Government approved, a Medicaid \"plan,\" \u00a7 1396a(a), which Idaho administers through its Department of Health and Welfare. Idaho's plan includes \"habilitation services\"-in-home care for individuals who, \"but for the provision of such services ... would require the level of care provided in a hospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan,\" \u00a7 1396n(c) and (c)(1).

They sued petitioners-two officials in Idaho's Department of Health and Welfare-in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho, claiming that Idaho violates \u00a7 30(A) by reimbursing providers of habilitation services at rates lower than \u00a7 30(A) permits. They asked the court to enjoin petitioners to increase these rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District Court entered summary judgment for the providers, holding that Idaho had not set rates in a manner consistent with \u00a7 30(A).\n   <em>\n    Inclusion, Inc. v.

It instructs courts what to do when state and federal law clash, but is silent regarding who may enforce federal laws in court, and in what circumstances they may do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hamilton wrote that the Supremacy Clause \"only declares a truth, which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a Federal Government.\" The Federalist No. 33, p. 207 (J. Cooke ed.1961). And Story described the Clause as \"a positive affirmance of that, which is necessarily implied.\" 3 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1831, p. 693 (1833). These descriptions would have been grossly inapt if the Clause were understood to give affected parties a constitutional (and hence congressionally unalterable) right to enforce federal laws against the States\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   And had it been understood to provide such significant private rights against the States, one would expect to find that mentioned in the preratification historical record, which contained ample discussion of the Supremacy Clause by both supporters and opponents of ratification. See C. Drahozal, The Supremacy Clause: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution 25 (2004); The Federalist No. 44, at 306 (J. Madison). We are aware of no such mention, and respondents have not provided any. Its conspicuous absence militates strongly against their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, it is important to read the Supremacy Clause in the context of the Constitution as a whole. Article I vests Congress with broad discretion over the manner of implementing its enumerated powers, giving it authority to \"make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying [them] into Execution.\" Art. I, \u00a7 8. We have said that this confers upon the Legislature \"that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers [the Constitution] confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it,\"\n   <em>\n    McCulloch v. Maryland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p421\">\n    4 Wheat. 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p421\">\n    4 L.Ed. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1819). It is unlikely that the Constitution gave Congress such broad discretion with regard to the enactment of laws, while simultaneously limiting Congress's\n   power over the manner of their implementation, making it impossible to leave the enforcement of federal law to federal actors. If the Supremacy Clause includes a private right of action, then the Constitution\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   Congress to permit the enforcement of its laws by private actors, significantly curtailing its ability to guide the implementation of federal law. It would be strange indeed to give a clause that makes federal law supreme a reading that\n   <em>\n    limits\n   </em>\n   Congress's power to enforce that law, by imposing mandatory private enforcement-a limitation unheard-of with regard to state legislatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To say that the Supremacy Clause does not confer a right of action is not to diminish the significant role that courts play in assuring the supremacy of federal law. For once a case or controversy properly comes before a court, judges are bound by federal law. Thus, a court may not convict a criminal defendant of violating a state law that federal law prohibits. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v. Nelson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033765\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/497/#p499\">\n    350 U.S. 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499, 509,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033765\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/497/#p499\">\n    76 S.Ct. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20L.%20Ed.%20640\">\n    100 L.Ed. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956). Similarly, a court may not hold a civil defendant liable under state law for conduct federal law requires. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett,\n   </em>\n   570 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698474\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/472/#p2476\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2476-2477,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698474\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/472/#p2476\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). And, as we have long recognized, if an individual claims federal law immunizes him from state regulation, the court may issue an injunction upon finding the state regulatory actions preempted.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/#p155\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155-156,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/#p155\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/#p155\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Respondents contend that our preemption jurisprudence-specifically, the fact that we have regularly considered whether to enjoin the enforcement of state laws that are alleged to violate federal law-demonstrates that the Supremacy Clause creates a cause of action for its violation. They are incorrect. It is true enough that we have long held that federal courts may in some circumstances grant injunctive relief against state officers who are violating, or planning to violate, federal law. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osborn v. Bank of United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421282\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/22/738/#p838\">\n    9 Wheat. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838-839, 844,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1421282\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/22/738/#p838\">\n    6 L.Ed. 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1824);\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 150-151,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/#p155\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

But that has been true not only with respect to violations of federal law by state officials, but also with respect to violations of federal law by federal officials. See\n   <em>\n    American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137405\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/187/94/#p110\">\n    187 U.S. 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137405\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/187/94/#p110\">\n    23 S.Ct. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137405\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/187/94/#p110\">\n    47 L.Ed. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1902); see generally L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 152-196 (1965). Thus, the Supremacy Clause need not be (and in light of our textual analysis above, cannot be) the explanation. What our cases demonstrate is that, \"in a proper case, relief may be given in a court of equity ... to prevent an injurious act by a public officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Carroll v. Safford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3317609\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/44/441/#p463\">\n    3 How. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3317609\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/44/441/#p463\">\n    11 L.Ed. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1845).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England. See Jaffe &amp; Henderson, Judicial Review and the Rule of Law: Historical Origins, 72 L.Q. Rev. 345 (1956). It is a judge-made remedy, and we have never held or even suggested that, in its application to state officers, it rests upon an implied right of action contained in the Supremacy Clause. That is because, as even the dissent implicitly acknowledges,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1391 - 1392 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) it does not.

The sheer complexity associated with enforcing \u00a7 30(A), coupled with the express provision of an administrative remedy, \u00a7 1396c, shows that the Medicaid Act precludes private enforcement of \u00a7 30(A) in the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The dissent agrees with us that the Supremacy Clause does not provide an implied right of action, and that Congress may displace the equitable relief that is traditionally available to enforce federal\n   law.

Section 30(A) was amended, on December 19, 1989, to include what the dissent calls the \"equal access mandate,\"\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1394-the requirement that reimbursement rates be \"sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.\" \u00a7 6402(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Stat.%202260\">\n    103 Stat. 2260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There existed at the time another provision, known as the \"Boren Amendment,\" that likewise imposed broad requirements on state Medicaid plans. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A)(1982 ed., Supp. V). Lower courts had interpreted the Boren Amendment to be privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983. From this, the dissent infers that, when Congress amended \u00a7 30(A), it could not \"have failed to anticipate\" that \u00a7 30(A)'s broad language-or at least that of the equal access mandate-would be interpreted as enforceable in a private action. Thus, concludes the dissent, Congress's failure to\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   preclude the private enforcement of \u00a7 30(A) suggests it intended\n   <em>\n    not to\n   </em>\n   preclude private enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1395.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This argument appears to rely on the prior-construction canon; the rule that, when \"judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute\" is presumed to incorporate that interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Bragdon v.

But that canon has no application here. The language of the two provisions is nowhere near identical; and even if it had been, the question whether the Boren Amendment permitted private actions was far from \"settled.\" When Congress amended \u00a7 30(A) in 1989, this Court had already granted certiorari to decide, but had not yet decided, whether the Boren Amendment could be enforced through a \u00a7 1983 suit.

That is not the case. Their relief must be sought initially through the Secretary rather than through the courts.

It is phrased as a directive to the federal agency charged with approving state Medicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries of the State's decision to participate in Medicaid. The Act says that the \"Secretary shall approve any plan which fulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a),\" the subsection that includes \u00a7 30(A). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(b).

The notion that respondents have a right to sue derives, perhaps, from the fact that they are beneficiaries of the federal-state Medicaid agreement, and that intended beneficiaries, in modern times at least, can sue to enforce the obligations of private contracting parties. See 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 37:12-37.13, pp. 123-135 (4th ed.2013). We doubt, to begin with, that providers are intended beneficiaries (as opposed to mere incidental beneficiaries) of the Medicaid agreement, which was concluded for the benefit of the infirm whom the providers were to serve, rather than for the benefit of the providers themselves.

Rather, I believe that several characteristics of the federal statute before us, when taken together, make clear that Congress intended to foreclose respondents from bringing this particular action for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For one thing, as the majority points out, \u00a7 30(A) of the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A), sets forth a federal mandate that is broad and nonspecific. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1385. But, more than that, \u00a7 30(A) applies its broad standards to the setting of rates. The history of ratemaking demonstrates that administrative agencies are far better suited to this task than judges. More than a century ago, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission, the first great federal regulatory rate-setting agency, and endowed it with authority to set \"reasonable\" railroad rates. Ch. 104,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Stat.%20379\">\n    24 Stat. 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1887). It did so in part because judicial efforts to maintain reasonable rate levels had proved inadequate. See I. Sharfman, Railway Regulation: An Analysis of the Underlying Problems in Railway Economics from the Standpoint of Government Regulation 43-44 (1915).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Reading \u00a7 30(A) underscores the complexity and nonjudicial nature of the rate-setting task. That provision requires State Medicaid plans to \"assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers\" to assure \"care and services\" equivalent to that \"available to the general population in the geographic area.\" \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A). The methods that a state agency, such as Idaho's Department of Health and Welfare, uses to make this kind of determination may involve subsidiary determinations of, for example, the actual cost of providing quality services, including personnel and total operating expenses; changes in public expectations with respect to delivery of services; inflation; a comparison of rates paid in neighboring States for comparable services; and a comparison of any rates paid for comparable services in other public or private capacities.

See Dept. of Health and Human Servs., Office of Inspector General, Access to Care: Provider Availability in Medicaid Managed Care 1, 5 (Dec.2014). And States engage in time-consuming efforts to obtain public input on proposed plan amendments. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Kansas Medicaid: Design and Implementation of a Public Input and Stakeholder Consult Process (Sept. 16, 2011) (prepared by Deloitte Consulting, LLP) (describing public input on Kansas' proposed Medicaid amendments).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I recognize that federal courts have long become accustomed to reviewing for reasonableness or constitutionality the rate-setting determinations made by agencies.

To find in the law a basis for courts to engage in such direct rate-setting could set a precedent for allowing other similar actions, potentially resulting in rates set by federal judges (of whom there are several hundred) outside the ordinary channel of federal judicial review of agency decisionmaking. The consequence, I fear, would be increased litigation, inconsistent results, and disorderly administration of highly complex federal programs that demand public consultation, administrative guidance and coherence for their success. I do not believe Congress intended to allow a statute-based injunctive action that poses such risks (and that has the other features I mention).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I recognize that courts might in particular instances be able to resolve rate-related requests for injunctive relief quite easily.

If the Secretary of Health and Human Services concludes that a State is failing to follow legally required federal rules, the Secretary can withhold federal funds. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1385 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c). If withholding funds does not work, the federal agency may be able to sue a State to compel compliance with federal rules.

To the contrary, this Court has adjudicated such requests for equitable relief since the early days of the Republic. Nevertheless, today the Court holds that Congress has foreclosed private parties from invoking the equitable powers of the federal courts to require States to comply with \u00a7 30(A) of the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A). It does so without pointing to the sort of detailed remedial scheme we have previously deemed necessary to establish congressional intent to preclude resort to equity. Instead, the Court relies on Congress' provision for agency enforcement of \u00a7 30(A)-an enforcement mechanism of the sort we have already definitively determined\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to foreclose private actions-and on the mere fact that \u00a7 30(A) contains relatively broad language.

See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1385 - 1386. But in striking contrast to the remedial provision set out in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, \u00a7 1396cprovides no specific procedure that parties actually affected by a State's violation of its statutory obligations may invoke in lieu of\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   -leaving them without any other avenue for seeking relief from the State. Nor will \u00a7 1396calways provide a particularly effective means for redressing a State's violations: If the State has violated \u00a7 30(A) by refusing to reimburse medical providers at a level \"sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available\" to Medicaid beneficiaries to the same extent as they are available to \"the general population,\" agency action resulting in a reduced flow of federal funds to that State will often be self-defeating. \u00a7 1396a(30)(A); see Brief for Former HHS Officials as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   18 (noting that HHS is often reluctant to initiate compliance actions because a \"state's non-compliance creates a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't scenario where the withholding of state funds will lead to depriving the poor of essential medical assistance\"). Far from rendering \u00a7 1396c\"superfluous,\" then,\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   actions would seem to be an anticipated and possibly necessary supplement to this limited agency-enforcement mechanism.\n   <em>\n    Seminole Tribe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/#p74\">\n    517 U.S., at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/#p74\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We expressed no hesitation in concluding that federal courts could require compliance with this obligation, explaining: \"It is ... peculiarly part of the duty of this tribunal, no less in the welfare field than in other areas of the law, to resolve disputes as to whether federal funds allocated to the States are being expended in consonance with the conditions that Congress has attached to their use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 422-423,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12054712\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/397/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Admittedly, the standard set out in \u00a7 30(A) is fairly broad, requiring that a state Medicaid plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available under the plan ... as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.\" \u00a7 1396a(a)(30)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   But mere breadth of statutory language does not require the Court to give up all hope of judicial enforcement-or, more important, to infer that Congress must have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In fact, the contention that \u00a7 30(A)'s language was intended to foreclose private enforcement actions entirely is difficult to square with the provision's history. The specific equal access mandate invoked by the plaintiffs in this case-that reimbursement rates be \"sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area\"-was added to \u00a7 30(A) in 1989.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Stat.%202260\">\n    103 Stat. 2260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At that time, multiple Federal Courts of Appeals had held that the so-called Boren Amendment to the Medicaid Act was enforceable pursuant\n   to \u00a7 1983-as we soon thereafter concluded it was. See\n   <em>\n    Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124224\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/498/\">\n    496 U.S. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 504-505, 524,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124224\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/498/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124224\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/498/\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). The Boren Amendment employed language quite similar to that used in \u00a7 30(A), requiring that a state plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"provide ... for payment ... of the hospital services, nursing facility services, and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan through the use of rates ... which the State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary, are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards and to assure that individuals eligible for medical assistance have reasonable access ... to inpatient hospital services of adequate quality.\" \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A)(1982 ed., Supp. V).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It is hard to believe that the Congress that enacted the operative version of \u00a7 30(A) could have failed to anticipate that it might be similarly enforceable. Even if, as the Court observes, the question whether the Boren Amendment was enforceable under \u00a7 1983was \"unsettled at the time,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1386 (emphasis deleted), surely Congress would have spoken with far more clarity had it actually intended to preclude private enforcement of \u00a7 30(A) through not just \u00a7 1983but also\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Of course, the broad scope of \u00a7 30(A)'s language is not irrelevant. But rather than compelling the conclusion that the provision is wholly unenforceable by private parties, its breadth counsels in favor of interpreting \u00a7 30(A) to provide substantial leeway to States, so that only in rare and extreme circumstances could a State actually be held to violate its mandate. The provision's scope may also often require a court to rely on HHS, which is \"comparatively expert in the statute's subject matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Douglas v.

Gambell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131543\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/531/#p542\">\n    480 U.S. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131543\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/531/#p542\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131543\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/531/#p542\">\n    94 L.Ed.2d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Given the courts' ability to both respect States' legitimate choices and defer to the federal agency when necessary, I see no basis for presuming that Congress believed the Judiciary to be completely incapable of enforcing \u00a7 30(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, far from identifying a \"carefully crafted ... remedial scheme\" demonstrating that Congress intended to foreclose\n   <em>\n    Ex parte\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   enforcement of \u00a7 30(A),\n   <em>\n    Seminole Tribe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744357\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/44/#p74\">\n    517 U.S., at 73-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116 S.Ct. 1114the Court points only to two provisions. The first is \u00a7 1396c, an agency-enforcement provision that, given our precedent, cannot preclude private actions. The second is \u00a7 30(A) itself, which, while perhaps broad, cannot be understood to manifest congressional intent to preclude judicial involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court's error today has very real consequences. Previously, a State that set reimbursement rates so low that providers were unwilling to furnish a covered service for those who need it could be compelled by those affected to respect the obligation imposed by \u00a7 30(A). Now, it must suffice that a federal agency, with many programs to oversee, has authority to address such violations through the drastic and often counterproductive measure of withholding the funds that pay for such services. Because a faithful application of our precedents would have led to a contrary result, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Indeed, there are good reasons to think the court construed \u00a7 30(A) to impose an overly stringent obligation on the States. While the Ninth Circuit has understood \u00a7 30(A) to compel States to \"rely on responsible cost studies,\" and to reimburse for services at rates that \"approximate the cost of quality care provided efficiently and economically,\"\n    <em>\n     Orthopaedic Hospital v.

See\n    <em>\n     Pennsylvania Pharmacists Assn. v. Houstoun,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9510408\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/531/#p538\">\n     283 F.3d 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 538 (C.A.3 2002);\n    <em>\n     Evergreen Presbyterian Ministries, Inc. v.

This Court declined to grant certiorari to address whether the Ninth Circuit's reading of \u00a7 30(A) is correct. See 573 U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264107\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/135/44/\">\n     135 S.Ct. 44\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592922,12592923\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/897/\">\n     189 L.Ed.2d 897\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014). But Justice BREYER, in his concurrence, appears to mistake that question about the merits of the Ninth Circuit's standard for the question this Court actually granted certiorari to address-that is, whether \u00a7 30 is judicially enforceable at all. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1389 - 1390 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). To answer that question, one need only recognize, as Justice BREYER does, that \"federal courts have long become accustomed to reviewing for reasonableness or constitutionality the rate-setting determinations made by agencies.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1389. A private party who invokes the jurisdiction of the federal courts in order to enjoin a state agency's implementation of rates that are so unreasonably low as to violate \u00a7 30(A) seeks a determination of exactly this sort.* * *\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
