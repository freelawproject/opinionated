The Circuit Court of the First Circuit agreed with the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations that the department had no jurisdiction over the matter because United was party to a collective bargaining agreement which prevented the continued employment or reemployment of Marie Flores. Upon a review of the record and relevant statutory provisions, we conclude the director and the circuit court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-15\">Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 378-32(2) renders it \u201cunlawful for any employer to suspend, discharge, or discriminate against any of the employer\u2019s employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-16\">(2) Solely because the employee has suffered a work injury which arose out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment with the employer and which is compensable under [the Hawaii Workers\u2019 Compensation Law] unless the employee is no longer capable of performing the employee\u2019s work as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>result of the work injury and the employer has no other available work which the employee is capable of performing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The subsection further provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">[a]ny employee who is discharged because of the work injury shall be given first preference of reemployment by the employer in any position which the employee is capable of performing and which becomes available after the discharge and during the period thereafter until the employee secures new employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The subsection, however, does</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">not apply to any employer in whose employment there are less than three employees at the time of the work injury or who is a party to a collective bargaining agreement which prevents the continued employment or reemployment of the injured employee!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Marie Flores suffered an injury to her right hand while working as a food service assistant in United\u2019s flight kitchen on August 6,1979. She was disabled as a consequence of the work injury, was treated by a physician of her choosing, and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from her employer through Pacific Insurance Company, who administered United\u2019s self-insured compensation plan in Hawaii. The insurance company acknowledged that she sustained a compensable injury and voluntarily paid her benefits. Her recovery from what the insurance company thought was a minor injury was slower than anticipated. Pacific therefore invoked the employer\u2019s statutory right to have her examined by a physician of its choice. The consulting physician concluded she was suffering from a carpal tunnel syndrome and recommended surgery to relieve the pain. The prescribed surgical procedure was performed by the physician in January of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">He deemed Mrs. Flores fit for work on July 9,1980. She returned to work as advised, but was soon sent home because of her complaints of disabling pain. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Division of the department then conducted a hearing and determined that Mrs. Flores was still totally disabled for work. The director therefore ordered the resumption of tern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>porary total disability compensation payments to her as of July 14,1980. Subsequent attempts to afford Mrs. Flores relief from pain through surgery by yet another physician were unsuccessful, and her status for compensation purposes remained as \u201ctemporarily totally disabled for work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">But on March 27, 1980, United placed her on \u201cExtended Illness Status\u201d pursuant to Article XIV of the collective bargaining agreement between itself and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the exclusive bargaining representative \u201cfor all classes and grades of Cooks, Bakers, Kitchen Stewards, Pantry Workers, Food Service Assistants, and Food Service Porters employed by the Company.\u201d After the abortive return to work in July, United again placed Mrs. Flores on \u201cExtended Illness Status\u201d on August 19,1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In May of 1982, Mrs. Flores\u2019 treating physician felt she should \u201creturn to light duty with no heavy lifting greater than 20 lbs. as of 6/3/82.\u201d United, however, was reluctant to have her return to duly. It referred Mrs. Flores for examination by another physician, whose opinion was that she would not be able to perform the work required of food service assistants. The treating physician therefore recommended the commencement of \u201cthe Vocational Rehabilitation process to find her a different kind of job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">On the strength of the medical advice that she could not return to work as a food service assistant, United informed Mrs. Flores on July 16, 1982 that \u201ccircumstances [did not] warrant any extension of extended illness status____\u201d And it advised her that \u201cin accordance with Article XIV, Paragraph D of the 1981-83 Agreement between UAL and IAMAW, [she was being] separated from United Airlines effective August 19, 1982.\u201d Mrs. Flores and her collective bargaining representative contested the separation by filing a grievance in accord with Article XVII of the collective bargaining agreement But the grievance was not resolved in their favor; at Step Three of the contractual procedure, United\u2019s representative denied the grievance on grounds that \u201cthe Company\u2019s actions were justified and not inappropriate under the particular circumstances ....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ap\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The terminated employee then turned elsewhere for relief, filing a complaint alleging a discharge in violation of HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) with the department\u2019s Enforcement Division. Though the complaint was filed on August 12, 1982, it was not heard until a year and a half went by. In the meantime, United and Pacific Insurance gave Mrs. Flores notice, in accord with HRS \u00a7 386-31(b), of their intention to terminate the payment of compensation on October 11, 1983 because they felt she was \u201cable to resume work.\u201d A hearing to determine whether compensation could be cut off was conducted by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, and the director subsequently ordered that Mrs. Flores \u201cshould remain on temporary total disability payments until the doctor rates her condition for permanent disability!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The complaint was set for hearing on March 16, 1984 before the Enforcement Division\u2019s hearing officer. But two months before the scheduled hearing, Mrs. Flores\u2019 attorney wrote United, asking that she be allowed to exercise \u201cher statutory right [under HRS \u00a7 378-32(2)] to first preference of re-employment in <em>any </em>position here which she is capable of performing and which becomes available.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The terse response was: \u201cMrs. Flores is no longer an employee of United Airlines and has exhausted all the remedies under her employment contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The hearing officer conducted a full hearing on the discharged employee\u2019s complaint and transmitted a recommended decision to the director, which was: \u201cRespondent did not violate HRS Section 378-32 by discharging Complainant from employment.\u201d He reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">The language of Article XIV, D\u201e of the collective bargaining agreement clearly states that the Respondent has the authority to terminate an injured employee at the end of the employee\u2019s extended illness status. The facts show that Respondent did discharge Complainant, pursuant to the authority granted to Respondent in the collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the State Department of Labor does not have jurisdiction over the instant complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">Further, even if the State Department of Labor has jurisdiction over the subject complaint, the facts do not support Complainant\u2019s allegation that she was able to return to work with Respondent and that Respondent had available work that she can perform.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">The findings made by the Disability Compensation Division at the hearing held on October 27,1983, clearly show that Complainant was totally disabled as a result of her injury of August 6,1979, and that she was permanently and totally disabled from employment from July 14,1980 until the Director of Labor deems otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The director considered the objections raised by Mrs. Flores to the recommended decision, but he adopted the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the Department has no jurisdiction over the claim [and did] not reach the merits of the complaint.\u201d He reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">Article XIV of the collective bargaining agreement makes it clear that ill or injured employees, including employees injured as a result of employment, are subject to discharge from employment at such time that the employee\u2019s extended illness status expires. By virtue of Article XIV, Respondent is prevented from continuing to employ injured employees. Thus, section 378-32(2) would not apply to this case and the Department has no jurisdiction to apply that section to Respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">He also cited the failure of the union and Mrs. Flores to process her grievance through the final step, the System Board of Adjustment, in ruling the department lacked jurisdiction to apply HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) against United, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">In this case, the collective bargaining agreement, specifically Article XIV, clearly covers the situation where an employee is discharged because of an injury. Thus, therecan be no question that Complainant\u2019s claim is a dispute arising under and concerning the interpretation of Article XIV of the Agreement. Consequently, this claim constitutes a minor dispute subject to compulsory arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Mrs. Flores moved for reconsideration of the decision, but the director stuck to his original position that he had no power to act on her complaint. He made it clear too that the decision did not include a ruling on her claim of first preference in reemployment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Mrs. Flores petitioned for judicial review of the unfavorable administrative ruling. Although it was given notice of the appeal, United chose not to appear in the circuit court. The director answered the appellant\u2019s Statement of the Case and defended his ruling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The case was submitted for decision on the record made before the agency, written briefs, and oral argument</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The circuit court concluded the department had \u201cno jurisdiction in [the] case pursuant to H.R.S. \u00a7 378-32(2),... the Director\u2019s finding that Appellant Flores was \u2018a party to a collective bargaining agreement which prevents the continued employment or reemployment of the injured employee\u2019 [was] based on substantial evidence on the whole record, and .. .the Director\u2019s decision [was] not clearly erroneous.\u201d Mrs. Flores ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>pealed to this court, but again United has chosen not to participate in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The issue before us is one of statutory interpretation. In the director\u2019s view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">The language of the statute [in question] is clear: if the collective bargaining agreement between United Airlines and [the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers] prevented the continued employment or re-employment of injured employees, [HRS \u00a7] 378-32(2) is not applicable and the Department would have no authority to exercise jurisdiction over Appellant Flores\u2019 complaint of unlawful discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We agree that the language of HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) is clear; we also believe the director has stated the issue fairly. But we cannot accept his thesis that \u201ca plain reading\u201d of the subsection can only lead to a conclusion that he had no authority to exercise jurisdiction over Mrs. Flores\u2019 complaint. For his reading comports with neither the plain language of HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) nor its beneficent purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Our analysis begins as it must with the words of HRS \u00a7 378-32(2). <em>State v. Lo, 66 </em>Haw. 653, 659, 675 P.2d 754, 758 (1983). As we noted at the outset, the subsection makes it \u201cunlawful for [an] employer to suspend, discharge, or discriminate against [an employee because she] has suffered a [compensable work injury,] unless [she can no longer perform her] work ... and the employer has no other available work which [she can perform.]\u201d But the injured employee is not left without a possible remedy even when the employer can justify the discharge under the foregoing provisions of the statute. For it still entitles her to \u201cfirst preference of reemployment by the employer in any position which [she] is capable of performing... which becomes available after the discharge!,]... until [she] secures . . . employment [elsewhere.]\u201d The dual protections provided by the legislature, however, cannot be enforced against an employer who is \u201cparty to a collective bargaining agreement which prevents the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>continued employment or reemployment of the injured employee[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 378-32(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The director argues a plain reading of these provisions \u201cwould lead to the result that section 378-32(2) would not apply if the collective bargaining agreement prevented either the continued employment or re-employment of the injured employee.\u201d Put another way, if the discharge of the injured employee did not violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, the statute would not afford her a right to subsequent reemployment. This would, of course, effectively set to naught the first preference in reemployment expressly granted employees who are discharged on account of work injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The protections outlined in HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) were enacted originally as part of the Hawaii Workers\u2019 Compensation Law when a general revision of the law was approved in 1963.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But in 1970 a legislative perception that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division was \u201cneither concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>with [investigation] nor staffed to carry on an enforcement program\u201d resulted in a repeal of the provisions, then codified in HRS \u00a7 386-141, and the reenactment of \u201csimilar provisions into Part III of Chapter 378, which governs employment practices.\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 253-70, in 1970 House Journal, at 859.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The underlying purpose of the repeal and reenactment was to place \u201cresponsibility where it properly belong[ed].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860. Inasmuch as the department was authorized under part III of HRS chapter 378 to \u201corder the reinstatement of [an] employee with or without back pay[,]\u201d HRS \u00a7 378-35 (1968),7 an intended conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>quence of the transfer of responsibility was that the injured employee \u201cgain[ed], under Part III, the remedy of reinstatement in employment [in addition to that] of preference for reemployment[.]\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 253-70, <em>supra, </em>at 860. The reenacted language thus \u201cprovide[d] penalties against offending employers, re-employment preferences for aggrieved employees, [reinstatement in employment,] and for collective bargaining agreements which prevent continued employment and re-employment of injured employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 859; <em>see supra </em>note 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The director, however, would have us rule HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) cannot be enforced against United because the collective bargaining agreement covering employees in its flight kitchen prevented Mrs. Flores\u2019 continued employment. He maintains this ungenerous application of the statute is justified because \u201c[t]here need not be a provision in the agreement preventing both the continued employment and reemployment of the injured employee.\u201d If we elected to approach the problem at hand in similar fashion, we could still reject the director\u2019s niggardly application of HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) because the foregoing committee report speaks of \u201ccollective bargaining agreements which prevent continued employment <em>and </em>reemployment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">But we do not find it necessary to rely on a word buried in a committee report to ascertain the intention of the legislature. We agree with Mrs. Flores that the plain language of HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) grants one whose employment has been terminated because a work injury rendered her incapable of performing work, first preference to reemployment by the employer if she regains some capacity for work and there is a job she can perform. And the preference is voided only by a provision preventing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>reemployment in an applicable collective bargaining agreement or when the discharged employee secures employment with another employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Even if it could be said that this is not clear on the face of the statute, we would still reach the same conclusion. For HRS \u00a7 378-32(2) is a remedial statute in more than one sense,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and therefore, \u201cis to be construed liberally in order to accomplish the purpose for which it was enacted.\" <em>Roe v. </em>Doe, 59 Haw. 259, 265, 581 P.2d 310, 315 (1978) (citation omitted). Or as aptly stated by the editor of a highly regarded treatise on statutes and statutory construction, \u201c[Remedial statutes are liberally construed to suppress the [perceived] evil and advance the [enacted] remedy.\u201d N. Singer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 60.01 (footnote omitted). The director\u2019s narrow reading would impede rather than advance the remedies of preference and reinstatement in employment written by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Since our perusal of the collective bargaining agreement between United and the International Association of Machinists has uncovered nothing preventing the reemployment of Mrs. Flores if she is capable of performing any job available in United\u2019s vast organization in Hawaii, we conclude the circuit court and the director erred in ruling the department had no jurisdiction over her complaint. Thus, we vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case for entry of a judgment vacating the director\u2019s decision and order and remanding the case to the Enforcement Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations for a new hearing in accord with procedures not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ak\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>Douglas S.

Thus, the director was properly a party to the appeal. The definition serves a salutary purpose in cases where the agency\u2019s position would not be adequately defended by the successful party in the agency proceeding. For example, an unemployed worker who has been awarded several hundred dollars in unemployment compensation benefits would be most unlikely to have the means or the interest to defend the director\u2019s ruling in the circuit court and in an appellate court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\"> Act 116, Session Laws 1963, added anew section to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">No employer shall discharge or dismiss any employee or deny such employee the right to return to his employment solely because he suffers any work injury which is compensable under this chapter and which arises out of and in the course of employment with such employer unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the director that the employee will no longer be capable of performing his work as a result of the work injury and that the employer has no other available work which the employee is capable of performing.

The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division is neither concerned with nor staffed to carry on an enforcement program, while the Labor Law Enforcement Division is structured so as to implement the policy and purpose of the law, and to prefer sanctioning for violations thereof in the event of unlawful suspension or discharge, which is the subject matter of Part HI of Chapter 378.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Stand.
