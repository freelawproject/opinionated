But Austin, who was not carrying drugs when arrested, had not been caught up in Operation Rabbit. Austin contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the prejudicial, irrelevant evidence of his other crimes and of Operation Rabbit. We agree that the many references to Operation Rabbit constituted reversible error, therefore vacate the judgment of conviction, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The initial facts are not disputed. On April 1, 1987 at the Kailua-Kona airport after returning from San Francisco, Thomas Guzzetta (Guzzetta) was arrested, and the police discovered cocaine in a duffel bag. Guzzetta, though, asserted that Austin had obtained the cocaine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>California for distribution, so the police subsequently arrested Austin upon Austin\u2019s return to Hawaii on April 4, 1987. Austin, who was not transporting any cocaine, denied involvement in any illegal scheme but acknowledged traveling with friend Guzzetta in California. On April 10, 1987, Austin was charged with aiding or attempting to help Guzzetta distribute the dangerous drug cocaine on March 29, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On September 14,1987, the defense moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of Austin\u2019s other crimes and his associates\u2019 drug dealings on the grounds that such evidence would 1) create undue prejudice, confuse the issues, mislead the jury, or waste time; and 2) influence the jury into convicting him based on uncharged offenses plus his associates\u2019 bad acts. State replied that the relevant evidence would prove Austin\u2019s 1) involvement in and familiarity with drug trafficking as part of his continuing scheme to import cocaine for sale in Hawaii; and 2) guilt although no cocaine was found when he was arrested. The parties repeated their arguments at the pretrial hearing on the motion, and the trial court took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">At the jury trial, the deputy prosecutor gave her opening statement which asserted in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">When Steven Austin stepped off the plane in Kona, he was immediately arrested by police officers of the Hawaii County Police Department and charged as an accomplice in a plan to distribute cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">Now, the question here is why? What had gone so wrong for Steven Austin? What had gone so wrong with the plan? What had gone wrong begins with the arrival of Thomas Guzzetta two days before. The police were waiting and perhaps the defendant expected this. <em>Operation Rabbit was drawing to a close and drug distributors all over the county were getting arrested. </em>How do we know that the defendant expected this? We know because he instructed Thomas Guzzetta to return with the cocaine first and then if everything was all right, to give him a call and then arrange for his passage home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\"><em>Then probably what the defendant least expected of all, we\u2019ll hear the testimony of Stephen Wasik, caught in Operation Rabbit for hashish. </em>Stephen Wasik [met] and was befriended by Steve Austin while they were jailed together at the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Hawaii Community Correctional Center in Hilo. Not knowing that Wasik had come to hate the drug lifestyle that had ruined his [Wasik\u2019s] own life, Steve Austin, in the pursuit of this new found friendship bragged about his cocaine operation \u2014 about his part in picking out the cocaine and giving it to Tom Guzzetta \u2014about how he, Steve Austin, was arrested with nothing and so the State has no case. So arrogant and so confident is this defendant that as he sits in the jail awaiting trial, he\u2019s making\u2014 he\u2019s planning to continue his operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">And how do we know that Steve Wasik is telling the truth? It\u2019s not only because he testifies at great risk to himself but because what he has to say could only have come from Steve Austin\u2019s mouth. Those little details that only the defendant would have known and only the defendant could have said is what we\u2019re going to hear from Steve Wasik.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Transcript of October\u00f3, 1987 and October 7,1987at23,25-26(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Later, Guzzetta plus Hermione Kalikolani Wingate (a mutual acquaintance of Guzzetta and Austin) testified about Austin\u2019s many drug sales (cocaine as well as marijuana) in Hawaii in recent years. Guzzetta also described the trip to California to obtain cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Subsequently over the defense objections, Hawaii County Police Sergeant Lionel Lincoln detailed Operation Rabbit, said that certain prosecution witnesses acquainted with Austin had been arrested for drug trafficking, but noted that Austin had neither been implicated nor caught in the police sting. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">MR. GIANOTTI: Yes, Your Honor, at this time, we would move to strike the testimony of Sergeant Lincoln pertaining to Operation Rabbit, [prosecution witnesses] Tony Cerrone and Mr. Center on the grounds that <em>the testimony is totally irrelevant and has absolutely nothing to do with the case of which Mr. Austin is charged with. </em>And in addition, Your Honor, \u2014 well, we\u2019U submit it on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">THE COURT: Okay, thank you. Counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">MS. ROSS: Yes, Your Honor, I think that the evidence clearly shows that there is relevance to this evidence. Mr. Guzzetta testified that his instructions from the Defendant was to deliver part of the cocaine to Mr. Tony Cerrone; that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>statements made by this Defendant while he was incarcerated regarding Tony Cerrone and regarding Bill Center. That was testified to by Mr. Wasik.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">Mr. Wasik himself is a Defendant from Operation Rabbit and I believe that in order for the jury to make a fair determination of this case, they needed to hear what Operation Rabbit was about, so that they don\u2019t have any misperceptions based on anything that they might have heard through the media on what exactly this operation was about. And I think that the evidence clearly shows that this Defendant was not caught \u2014 and that in Operation Rabbit \u2014 and that Sergeant Lincoln testified to that fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">MR. GIANOTTI: I mean Judge, I think <em>it\u2019s guilt by asso</em>ciation, your bringing up the subjects which is totally void of this situation here. And the jury is hearing about a drug operation which my client has absolutely nothing to do with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">THE COURT: And I don\u2019t see any prejudice to your client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">MR. GIANOTTI: Well, if that jury hears about Operation Rabbit, as I previously informed the Court, it is a well known operation, there\u2019s been a number of people who pleaded guilty \u2014the public and I\u2019m sure everyone on that jury knows they associate my client with Operation Rabbit, it\u2019s going to give some prejudice in their mind, by gosh, <em>if he had any association with Operation Rabbit, he\u2019s guilty of this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">THE COURT: But there isn\u2019t a shred of evidence that he was, so therefore, I can\u2019t see how this could be prejudicial to your client at ail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">MR. GIANOTTI: Well, without being argumentative, if there is no shred of evidence, then it\u2019s totally irrelevant to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">THE COURT: There are shreds of evidence connecting it to people in this case but certainly not your client, therefore under [Hawaii Rules of Evidence] Rule 403, balancing the prejudice against the relevance, I\u2019m going to deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">Transcript of October 14, 1987 at 124-26 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The defense thereafter sought to strike all the testimony about drugs other than the cocaine for which Austin had been arrested because of the prejudice and the confusion generated by the irrelevant evidence. State repeated its earlier position. Denying the motion to strike, the trial court held that \u201cthe evidence has disclosed that [Austin] was engaged in .. . distributing drugs and that he and Mr. Guzzetta were conspiring to achieve the criminal objective... the relevance [of the other illegal acts] outweighs any probable prejudice____\u201d Transcript of July 21,1987, October 13,1987, and October 15,1987 at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The jury afterwards found Austin guilty on October 16,1987. After the entry of the judgment, Austin appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">We will answer the issues posed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">I. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the evidence about Austin\u2019s other drug dealings? NO.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">II. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the statements about Operation Rabbit? YES.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">AUSTIN\u2019S PRIOR DRUG DEALINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">Austin maintains that the testimony concerning his other bad acts amounted to prejudicial, irrelevant, and inadmissible character evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>State counters that the probative evidence of Austin\u2019s prior drug trafficking with Guzzetta demonstrated Austin\u2019s ongoing cocaine distribution plan and complicity with Guzzetta.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Although the trial court generally has the wide discretion to admit evidence, Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules 403 plus 404 specifically prohibit the introduction of prejudicial character evidence unless 1) an exception applies; and 2) there exists no other way to prove the accused\u2019s guilt <em>See State v. Castro, </em>69 Haw. _, 756 P.2d 1033 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Here, the identity of Guzzetta\u2019s drug supplier was in dispute, and Austin had denied any involvement in the cocaine trafficking at issue. Austin\u2019s past pattern of drug dealing with Guzzetta plus earlier trips to California to obtain cocaine is therefore probative of whether he hadacted in complicity with Guzzetta in the instant action. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>67 Haw. 231, 683 P.2d 1217 (1984). In short, State\u2019s evidence rebuts Austin\u2019s defense that he had not planned the crime where he had no cocaine when arrested. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>66 Haw. 613, 670 P.2d 1282 (1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Admittedly, the offenses in question might be improperly used to infer Austin\u2019s propensity to sell drugs. <em>See State v. Chong, </em>3 Haw. App. 246, 648 P.2d 1112 (1982). But despite the potential prejudicial effect, the extreme similarity between Austin\u2019s pattern of earlier drug dealing, plus importation from California and the current crime is extremely relevant to prove a common scheme. <em>See </em>HRE Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">The State has just offered evidence that the defendant at another time engaged in other crimes, wrongs or acts. That evidence was not admitted to prove the character of the defendant in order to show he acted in conformity therewith. The only purpose of admitting that evidence was to show proof of motive, opportunity, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake [or] accident. <em>You may not use that evidence for any other purpose. </em>The defendant is not being tried for that other crime, wrong or act. <em>He may not be convicted for any other offense than that charged in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Transcript of October 16,1987 at 25-26 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>A jury is presumed to follow a trial court\u2019s directive, so any prejudice was eliminated. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Blanding, </em>69 Haw. _, 752 P.2d 99 (1988). Accordingly, there was no reversible error. <em>See State v. Iaukea, </em>56 Haw. 343, 537 P.2d 724 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">OPERATION RABBIT EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Austin next advances that the information about Operation Rabbit, in which he was never caught or implicated, only served to prejudicially paint him as an associate of notorious drug dealers. State responds that the explanation about Operation Rabbit 1) was not detrimental to Austin since the pertinent testimony explicitly described his noninvolvement there; but 2) was necessary to connect some important prosecution witnesses with the drug dealing community and their knowledge about Austin\u2019s illegal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Once more, this court must determine if the trial court abused its discretion in balancing the relevance of the controverted evidence against the adverse effect to Austin pursuant to HRE Rule 403. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morishige, </em>65 Haw. 354, 652 P.2d 1119 (1982). HRE Rule 404 is not directly implicated, but Austin complains that the hinting at his involvement in Operation Rabbit through his associates (conceded drug dealers) unfairly indicates he is a drug dealer, too. <em>See State v. </em>Medeiros, 1 Haw. App. 536, 621 P.2d 986 (1981) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The testimony regarding Operation Rabbit was somewhat relevant to outline how the police received information about the incriminating statements of Austin. <em>See </em>HRE Rules 401 and 402.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But repeatedly em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>phasizing the Operation Rabbit link to the many important prosecution witnesses who knew Austin was far too extreme. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>68 Haw. 659, 728 P.2d 1301 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Certainly, this evidence did not go towards proving Austin\u2019s identity as the drug supplier of Guzzetta. <em>See State v. Murphy, </em>59 Haw. 1, 575 P.2d 448 (1978). For example, Austin\u2019s motive, opportunity, modus operandi, or state of mind are not shown (unlike the evidence of his prior bad acts). <em>See State v. Apao, </em>59 Haw. 625, 586 P.2d 250 (1978), <em>subsequent resolution, </em>66 Haw. 682, 693 P.2d 405 (1983) (per curiam). Furthermore, no jury instruction covered this specific problem. <em>Cf. </em>note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We cannot condone the unnecessary overkill on this point Obviously, the guilt by association implication was too strong: since Austin was acquainted with so many disreputable characters, hemustlikewise be a bad person who was somehow connected with the illicit conduct of Operation Rabbit <em>See State </em>v. <em>Estrada, </em>69 Haw. _, 738 P.2d 812 (1987). The jury could thus have easily been prejudiced by the continuous references to the police undercover activity. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Huihui, </em>62 Haw. 142, 612 P.2d 115 (1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The prejudice generated by the frequent descriptions of Operation Rabbit more than substantially outweighed any relevance under HRE Rule 403. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Burkhart, </em>5 Haw. App. 26, 675 P.2d 811 (1984). Hence, the inadmissible evidence violated Austin\u2019s fair trial rights. <em>See State v. Fox, </em>70 Haw. _, 760 P.2d 670 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">We therefore vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial because the error concerning Operation Rabbit was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt <em>State v. Wideman, </em>69 Haw. _, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>739 P.2d 931 (1987); <em>State v.

In short, State\u2019s evidence rebuts Austin\u2019s defense that he had not planned the crime where he had no cocaine when arrested. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>66 Haw. 613, 670 P.2d 1282 (1983) (per curiam).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">As the opinion states, the testimony undoubtedly tended to establish the identity of the defendant as the supplier of the seized drug as well as the scheme of the defendant and Guzzetta to promote its sale. Thus, the testimony was admissible under Haw. R. Evid 404(b) as evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts \u201cprobative of. . . plan, knowledge, [and] identity,\u201d not as an exception to the general rule of inadmissibility of character evidence under Haw. R. Evid. 404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">In discussing the law, however, the court appears to ascribe the admissibility of Guzzetta\u2019s testimony to Haw. R. Evid. 404(a) by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM_\">Although the trial court generally has the wide discretion to admit evidence, Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rules 403 plus 404 specifically prohibit the introduction of prejudicial character evidence unless 1) an exception applies; and 2) there exists no other way to prove the accused\u2019s guilt. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Castro, 69 </em>Haw. _, 756 P.2d 1033 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">(Footnote omitted). It also appears to lay down a hard and fast rule of admissibility premised on the absence of other evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt I do not believe this aspect of the opinion accurately reflects the rule governing the admissibility of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, and acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">\u201cHaw. R. Evid. 404(b)... reiterates the common law rule \u2018that the prosecution may not introduce evidence of other criminal acts of the accused unless the evidence is introduced for some purpose other than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>suggest that because the defendant is a person of criminal character, it is more probable that he committed the crime for which he is on trial.\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>69 Haw. at _, 756 P.2d at 1041 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">But even when such evidence tends to establish a fact of consequence to the determination of the case, the trial court cannot admit the evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Haw. R. Evid. 403. In other words, the admissibility of the evidence even after a demonstration of relevance is a matter of discretion. And,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">[i]n deciding whether the danger of unfair prejudice and the like substantially outweighs the incremental probative value, a variety of matters must be considered, including the strength of the evidence as to the commission of the other crime, the similarities between the crimes, the interval of time that has elapsed between the crimes, the need for the evidence, the efficacy of alternative proof, and the degree to which the evidence probably will rouse the jury to overmastering hostility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">E.W. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 190, at 565 (3d ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). The \u201cneed for the evidence\u201d is but one of the factors a trial court must consider in weighing probative value against unfair prejudice pursuant to Haw. R. Evid. 403. The rule calling for a weighing of factors furnishes no basis for fashioning a subsidiary rule of admissibility based solely on the \u201cneed for the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">In discussing the repeated references to \u201cOperation Rabbit,\u201d the opinion states \u201cthis court must determine if the trial court abused its discretion in balancing the relevance of the controverted evidence against the adverse effect to [the defendant] pursuant to HRE Rule 403.\u201d It goes on to say \u201c[t]he testimony regarding Operation Rabbit was somewhat relevant to outline how the police received information about the incriminating statements of [the defendant].\u201d The record, however, does not bear this out; it confirms instead that the proffered evidence was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">In considering the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the testimony describing the \u201csting\u201d operation, the trial court observed there wasn\u2019t a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cshred of evidence\u201d implicating the defendant therein. But the court nevertheless denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">There are shreds of evidence connecting it to people in this case but certainly not your client, therefore under [Hawaii Rules of Evidence] Rule 403, balancing the prejudice against the relevance, I\u2019m going to deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">If, as the trial judge found, there was no shred of evidence connecting the defendant and Operation Rabbit, testimony about it was irrelevant; \u201cthere [was] no room for ad hoc balancing. The evidence [was] then unequivocally inadmissible[.]\u201d E.W. Cleary, <em>supra, </em>at 565. For it had no rational \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that [was] of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would [have been] without the evidence.\u201d Haw. R.Evid.401. Of course,. it could have had an irrational and improper tendency to do so, as the opinion implies; but it is a system of rational proof we are expounding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
