Unlike other restrictions on judicial review \u2014 doctrines such as case or controversy requirements, standing, ripeness and prematurity \u2014 all of which may be cured by different factual circumstances, a holding of nonjusticiability [from an application of the political question doctrine] is absolute in its foreclosure of judicial scrutiny.\u201d Nowak, Rotunda &amp; Young, <em>Constitutional Law </em>102 (3d ed. 1986) (footnote omitted). Examining justiciability as expounded by the Supreme Court, we learned</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a lextually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\"><em>Baker v. </em>Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962). We also learned the doctrine \u201cis one of \u2018political questions,\u2019 not one of \u2018political casesl,]\u2019\u201d and \u201ccourts cannot reject as \u2018no law suit\u2019 a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated \u2018political\u2019 exceeds constitutional authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Our inquiry into the facts revealed the Trustees of OH A were asking the circuit court to rule that the defendants were \u201cmisreading and misap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>plying HRS \u00a7 10-13.5 and to order that some funds controlled by [the defendants] be turned over to OHA.\u201d <em>Trustees of OHA </em>v. <em>Yamasaki, </em>69 Haw. at _, 737 P.2d at 457. The judicial \u201ctask at first sight appealed] to be one of statutory interpretation. But a closer look at the disputes reveal[ed] they [were not] traditional fare for the judiciary; and if the circuit court ruled on them, it would [have intruded] in an area committed to the legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 737 P.2d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The task ostensibly called for an interpretation of HRS \u00a7 10-13.5, which provides that\u201c[t]wenty per cent of all funds derived from thepublic land trust described in [HRS \u00a7] 10 \u2014 3[] shall be expended by [OHA].\u201d As noted earlier, the Trustees sought twenty per cent of what the State received as damages for the illegal mining of sand from Papohaku Beach in the first case. Though the beach is part of Hawaii\u2019s public domain, \u201cnoth-. ing in HRS \u00a7 10-3 ... serve[d] as a statutory base for a ruling that such damages are funds derived from the public land trust or that a pro rata portion of the land conveyed to the State in lieu of the damages should in turn be conveyed to the Trustees of OHA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 737 P.2d at 458. \u201cEither ruling,\u201d we concluded, \u201cwould [have been] rendered possible only by an initial policy determination... of a kind normally reserved for nonjudicial discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 737 P.2d at 458. For \u201cthere were [many] uncertainties with respect to the ceded lands comprising the trust res and the funds derived therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 737 P.2d at 457. There were uncertainties about \u201cwhat and where ceded lands exist, the legal and fiscal problems which may exist or arise from their use, and the effect on all parties concerned with the use and distribution of revenues generated from ceded lands.\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 396, in 1982 House Journal, at 1061; Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 663, in 1982 House Journal, at 1200; Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 565, in 1982 Senate Journal, at 1190; Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 768, in 1982 Senate Journal, at 1279. And in the opinion of the Legislative Auditor, these uncertainties were incapable of resolution \u201cwithout further legislative action.\u201d <em>Trustees of OHA </em>v. <em>Yamasaki, </em>69 Haw. at _, 737 P.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">A ruling as prayed for in the second case, that is, OHA was entitled to a pro rata share of the revenues generated through the use or disposition of harbor and airport lands, \u201cwould [have been] at odds with legislative commitments relative to such revenues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 737 P.2d at 458. We also could find \u201cno \u2018judicially discoverable and manageable standards\u2019 that could be employed to resolve the conflict between the mandates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>HRS [\u00a7] 10-13.5 and\u201d the legislative mandates regarding income derived from the use of the foregoing lands in \u00a7 261-5. <em>Id. </em>at _, 737 P.2d at 458 (citation omitted). Thus, we agreed with the Legislative Auditor that the uncertainties surrounding the trust res and the funds derived therefrom could not be resolved without further legislative action and concluded the circuit court would have trod on legislative turf if it ruled on the questions posed in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Like the pleadings in the OHA cases, the pleadings in the case now before us describe intra-executive branch disputes. The defendants would have us rule \u201c[t]he resolution of interdepartmental problems is normally done within the executive branchQ\u201d and the Board as well as its members therefore lack standing to sue. \u201cThe mere assertion of a claim of an \u2018intra-branch dispute,\u2019 without more,\u201d however, does not render the dispute nonjusticiable. <em>United States </em>v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974); <em>see also State ex rel. Amemiya </em>v. Anderson, 56 Haw. 566, 545 P.2d 1175 (1976) (Attorney General brought declaratory action against Director of Finance). As we emphasized in the OHA cases, \u201c[t]he nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. at 210. Our rulings there were bottomed on \u201ca lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving [the issues raised therein and] the impossibility of deciding [them] without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. But we cannot say the record in the case at hand manifests a commitment to a coordinate political branch of the questions for which judicial determinations were sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Alleging the Governor and the Director had interfered with and usurped the powers vested in the Board by article X, section 3 of the State Constitution, the plaintiffs sought a declaration of \u201cthe powers of the BOARD to formulate policy and exercise control over the public school system and the internal organization and management of that system [.]\u201d Obviously a judicial declaration of the Board\u2019s powers under the constitution would have political repercussions \u2014 \u201call constitutional interpretations have political consequences.\u201d R. Jackson, <em>The Supreme Court in the American System </em>56 (1955). Still, a court \u201ccannot reject as \u2018no law suit\u2019 a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated \u2018po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>liticaT exceeds constitutional authority[,]\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. at 217, unless the matter at hand has been committed to another branch of government and a decision would compel the court \u201cto make judgments not susceptible to the usual tools of judicial methodology[.]\u201d K. Ripple, <em>Constitutional Litigation </em>96 (1984). Inasmuch as the matter at hand was textual interpretation, which undoubtedly constitutes judicial fare, the circuit court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 suit on the ground that it involved political questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Having decided that the circuit court erroneously rejected a contro-. versy subject to judicial resolution, we proceed to the question of whether the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was subject to summary disposition in favor of either the plaintiffs or the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Since the allegations of the plaintiffs, in short, were that the defendants misread and misapplied a constitutional provision and must be directed to follow it, we begin with a brief look at its provenance. The constitution drafted in 1950 and adopted by the citizens of the State of Hawaii in 1959 established a Board of Education and vested it with power \u201cto formulate policy, and to exercise control over the public school system through its executive officer, the superintendent of public instruction!.]\u201d Haw. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3. That the Board was given less than a free hand in formulating policy and exercising control over the system is evident, for these powers were to be employed \u201cin accordance with law[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The review of the State of Hawaii\u2019s fundamental document conducted in 1978 resulted in the renumbering and amendment of the provision. What was article IX, section 3 is now article X, section 3, and it reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">The board of education shall have the power, <em>as provided by law, </em>to formulate policy and to exercise control over the public school system through its executive officer, the superintendent of education, who shall be appointed by the board; <em>except </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>that the board shall havejurisdiction over the internal organization and management of the public school system, as provided by law, and shall exercise its jurisdiction in a manner consistent with general laws.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">(Emphasis supplied to indicate new language). The amendment was meant \u201cto give the [Board] jurisdiction over the internal organization and management of the public school system to the fullest extent possible.\u201d Comm. Whole Rep. No. 6, in <em>Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1978 [1978 </em>Proceedings], at 1006. But \u201cthose matters [that would] be within the jurisdiction of the board\u201d were to be defined by the legislature. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The constitutional assembly recognized too \u201cthat the department of education is an executive department subject to the governor\u2019s statewide policy-making and executive powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1006- 07. And the report issued by the delegates to the convention sitting as a committee of the whole underscored their intent to subordinate the Board\u2019s powers in budget-making to the Governor\u2019s; for the report states the amendment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aai\">would not affect the governor\u2019s authority over the board of education with respect to policy formulation affecting the public in budget preparation. In the budget-making process, the governor would continue to review the board\u2019s requests before its submission to the legislature. Nor would the budget-making powers or process of the legislature be altered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1007. Article X, section 3, therefore, can hardly be characterized as a constitutional declaration emancipating the Board of Education from all executive direction, and what has been \u201cprovided by law\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is consistent with the intention of the framers not to divest the Governor of his \u201cstatewide policy-making and executive powers\u201d or his authority over the executive budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">To begin, the structure of government ordained by the legislature makes the DOE one of the eighteen principal departments \u201c[u]nder the supervision of the governor\u201d to which the \u201cexecutive and administrative offices, departments, instrumentalities of the state government and their respective functions, powers, and duties [have been] allocatedf.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 26-4. \u201cUnder policies established by the [B]oard, the superintendent [of education] administerfs] programs of education and public instruction throughout the State[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 26- 12. These include programs \u201cat the preschool, primary and secondary school levels, adult education, school library services, health education and instruction (not including dental health treatment transferred to department of health), and such other pro-. grams as may be established by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board also establishes policies \u201cfor the administration of programs relating to public library services and transcribing services for the blind.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Board\u2019s authority to \u201cadminister programs of education and public instruction,\u201d however, does not include the actual preparation and execution of the DOE\u2019s budget; for as we noted at the outset, the Department of Budget and Finance is responsible for \u201cthe preparation and execution of the executive budget of the state government.\u201d HRS \u00a7 26-8. And since it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">the policy and intent of the legislature that the total appropriations made by it, or the total of any budget approved by it, for any department [is] the maximum amount authorized to meet the requirements of the department... for the period of the appropriation, ... the governor and the director of finance [have been] given the powers [to effect savings] by careful supervision throughout each appropriation period with due regard to changing conditions; and by promoting more economic and efficient management....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">HRS \u00a7 37-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">These powers are described in sections 37-32 to 37^42 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, which establish an allotment system whereby appropriated moneys are made available for expenditure on a quarterly basis upon prior estimates of requirements submitted by the departments to the Director of Finance.

In the memorandum supporting their motion for partial summary judgment and opposing the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint or for summary judgment, the plaintiffs acknowledged that the relief they were then seeking was not what they sought at the outset of the proceedings. The \u201cPlaintiffs,\u201d they further allowed, \u201care <em>not </em>questioning the right of the Governor to restrict amounts appropriated by the Legislature, providing such restrictions are necessary because of changes in the fiscal condition of the State; and they are <em>not </em>trying to remove the Governor\u2019s \u2018influence\u2019 with regard to departmental reorganization or the adoption of administrative rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">What the plaintiffs were seeking in Count \u201cA\u201d of their amended complaint, in the words of the memorandum, was that the Governor be ordered to \u201cinform the BOE of the amount of money available to it in both the biennial and supplemental budgets and then allow that Board to allocate such money among the various educational programs, facilities and activities.\u201d They \u201cspecifically objected] to the current practice of allowing uninformed budget analysts in the Department of Budget and Finance (\u2018B &amp; F\u2019) to make detailed decisions in the allocation of the education budget, and thus, for all practical purposes, formulate policy and exercise control over the public school system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The gravamen of this count is that the Governor and the Director of Finance unilaterally altered the Board\u2019s budgetary proposals before submitting them to the legislature as part of the executive budget and thereby infringed the Board\u2019s powers to formulate policy and determine its own program priorities. The framers of article X, section 3 of the Hawaii Constitution, however, contemplated that the provision \u201cwould not affect the governor\u2019s authority over the board of education with respect to policy formulation affecting the public in budget preparation!]\u201d and that in \u201cthe budget making process, the governor would continue to review the</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>board\u2019s requests before... submission to the legislature.\u201d <em>1978 Proceed</em>ings, at 1007. The power of review would be an empty one indeed if it did not encompass the power to alter or amend. We have no reason to believe the Governor\u2019s authority in this regard does not include discretion to restructure the Board\u2019s program priorities when the law provides that \u201c[t]he governor shall direct the preparation and administration of state programs, program and financial plans, and budgetQ\u201d with assistance from the director of finance. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 37-65 and 37-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The relief sought under Count \u201cB\u201d was an order to the effect \u201cthat if the State financial condition [compelled a reduction of expenditures], the Governor [should] place a proportionate percentage restriction on legislative appropriations, and then allow the BOE to allocate such restriction among the educational programs and activities[.]\u201d The plaintiffs \u201cspecifically objected] to the broad financial restrictions imposed without financial justification, when the Governor should use the item veto pursuant to the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In essence, the plaintiffs alleged the Governor interfered with the Board\u2019s implementation of the budget approved by the legislature when he imposed a one per cent spending restriction on the DOE. The Governor, the plaintiffs maintain, may impose such restrictions only if sufficient funds are not available. But \u201cthe policy and intent of the legislature [is] that the total appropriations made by it. .. for any department [is] the maximum amount authorized to meet the requirements of the department ... for the period of the appropriation,\u201d and \u201cthe governor and the director of finance [have been] given the powers [to effect savings] by careful supervision throughout each appropriation period[.]\u201d HRS \u00a737-31. Moreover, when advised by the director of finance \u201cthat the probable receipts from taxes or any other sources for any appropriation will be less than was anticipated, and that consequently the amount available for the remainder of the term of the appropriation or for any allotment period will be less than the amount estimated or allotted therefor,\u201d the Governor is obliged \u201cto redetermine the allotment ceiling[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 37-37(b). Since the plaintiffs did not aver that such was not the case here, we perceive no basis for declaring that the Governor\u2019s action breached any constitutional or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>statutory provision or that an exercise of the veto power was the only means by which a spending.restriction was imposable.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">With regard to Count \u201cC\u201d of the amended complaint the plaintiffs prayed \u201cthat the [DOE] be given the right to acquire budgeted goods and services necessary for the efficient operation of the education system without having to route such decisions through other departments[.]\u201d In the memorandum supporting their motion for summary judgment, however, they conceded that \u201ca substantial part of the relief requested in the original Count \u2018C\u2019 [has been granted by the legislature] and some part has been granted by order of the current administration, but the jurisdictional. boundaries should be more clearly <em>defined.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Again we perceive no basis for a judicial declaration as prayed for by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The relief sought for Count \u201cD\u201d was an order \u201cthat the constitutional grant to the BOE of \u2018. .. jurisdiction over the internal organization and management of the public school system...\u2019 (Haw. Const, art. X, \u00a7 3) be respected by the Governor and the B &amp; F[.]\u201d The objection here was \u201cto the detailed and trivial interference with departmental reorganization exercised by the B &amp; F which causes delay and serves no valid purpose.\u201d But the plaintiffs acknowledge \u201c[t]he reorganization plan was finally approved by the Governor and the Director of Budget and Finance on July 18,1985.\u201d Thus, the dispute was no longer viable when the circuit court heard the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for Count \u201cE\u201d was that \u201cthe Governor [be ordered], pursuant to... 1965 Hawaii Sess. Laws 97, [to] consolidate various functions such as repair and maintenance of school buildings, student transportation, and teacher housing in the DOE, instead of putting \u2018policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>making\u2019 in one department and funding and personnel in another.\u201d The claim regarding school repair and maintenance was that \u201cthe effective operation of that service require[d the] management of the service on Oahu be lodged with the DOE [rather than the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS)], and decentralized to the district and school level.\u201d With regard to student transportation, the plaintiffs objected to the fact that \u201c[w]hile policies and procedures, including fares to be paid, are set by the BOE, the funds for such transportation are appropriated to DAGS and all bus contracts are arranged by that department.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVX\"><em>Thomas P. Gill (Vernon Yu </em>with him on the briefs; Gill, Park, Park &amp; Kim, of counsel) for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aya\"><em>Charleen M. Aina (Diane Erickson </em>with her on the brief), Deputy Attorneys General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In effect, the plaintiffs sought a judicial declaration that the DOE should be allowed to expend funds appropriated for the foregoing purposes. But this would be at odds with the designation of DAGS as the expending agency for the appropriated funds in Session Laws of Hawaii (Haw. Sess. Laws) 1987, ch. 216, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Finally, the plaintiffs sought an order \u201cthat the BOE\u2019s rule making power, under Chapter 91, HAWAII REV. STAT., not be restricted or improperly interfered with by the Governor or other officials, through the requirement that \u2018preliminary\u2019 approval be had before a public hearing is noticed and held.\u201d Section 91-3(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, however, provides that \u201c [t]hc adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule by any state agency shall be subject to the approval of the governor.\u201d Thus, there is no basis for a court to rule he exceeded his powers in adopting a preliminary approval procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all counts. The circuit court\u2019s order of dismissal is vacated, and the case is remanded for entry of an appropriate judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> The defendants challenge HSTA\u2019s standing to sue.
