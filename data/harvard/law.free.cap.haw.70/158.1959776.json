He moved to suppress as evidence the results of the breath test administered shortly after his arrest on January 14,1987 to determine the concentration of alcohol in his blood. Concluding that the accuracy of the testing instrument used on the occasion was not verified in strict compliance with applicable provisions of chapter 111 of title 11 of the State\u2019s Administrative Rules, the District Court of the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Circuit granted the motion. The district court reasoned that section 11-111-2. l(i) of the foregoing rules compelled the performance of an accuracy verification test \u201cduring the actual breath test sequence of a subject,\u201d the test \u201cmust be the analysis of a suitable reference sample of known alcohol concentration,\u201d \u201cthe quartz crystal beam attenuator [used to verify accuracy in this instance] contained] no alcohol,\u201d so \u201c[i]n the instant case no accuracy verification test using a reference sample of known alcohol concentration was performed during the actual breath test sequence of the defendant\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The State of Hawaii appealed, and the case was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals. The ICA found \u201cthe district court focused narrowly\u201d on section 11-111-2.1(l) in deciding the employment of a beam attenuator to verify the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer 4011 AS was not authorized under the relevant administrative rules. Invoking basic principles of statutory construction that \u201ceach part or section of a statute should be construed in connection with every other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole[,]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>63 Haw. 191, 196, 624 P.2d 376, 380 (1981), and \u201cif rational and practicable, [a court should] give effect to all parts of a statute[,]\u201d <em>Camara v.

The ICA further noted subsection 2.1(j)(3) authorized the use of \u201c[mjethods recommended by the manufacturer [of the testing instrument] or approved by the department for the testing for accuracy or calibration [.]\u2019\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>7 Haw. App. _, _, 764 P.2d 1245, 1248 (1988). It rejected the defendant\u2019s thesis that subsection 2.1(j)(3) \u2018\u201cmust be read to limit approval of such methods exclusively to [those approved by] the Department[] \u2019 \u201d to avoid (1) a nullification of section 2.10, (2) \u201c\u2018an impermissible abdication of the State\u2019s role in assuring that the <em>Rules </em>are given effect[,]\u2019\u201d and (3) an \u201c\u2018absurd result[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">There was evidence in the record, the ICA said, \u201cthat the beam attenuator is a reliable means of testing the Intoxilyzer for accuracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 764 P.2d at 1249. And since \u201cthe performance of an accuracy verification test with a beam attenuator is a method recommended by [its] manufacturer[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>(footnote omitted), the court ruled \u201cthere was strict compliance with the [department\u2019s] [r]ules____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 764 P.2d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The defendant then submitted his application for a writ of certiorari, arguing that section 11-111-2.1 (l) of the Department of Health\u2019s Rules for the Testing of Blood, Breath and Other Bodily Substances for Alcohol Concentration required no construction because it \u201cis clear on its face\u201d and the department\u2019s \u201cincorporation of the manufacturer\u2019s [recommended] method [for verification of accuracy] in \u00a7 2.1 (j)(3)\u201d was an invalid subdelegation of its rule-making power. He argued too that the department breached the provisions of HRS \u00a7 91-3 in authorizing a use of methods recommended by the manufacturer for the verification of accuracy or calibration of testing instruments. Finding the questions posed in the defendant\u2019s petition worthy of further discussion, we granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The defendant, we noted at the outset, was charged with Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor, an offense which may be established by a showing that aperson \u201coperatc[d.| orassume[d] actual physical control of the operation of [a motor] vehicle [either] while under the influence of intoxicating liquor[J\u201d or \u201cwith 0.10 per cent or more, by weight of alcohol in [his] blood.\u201d HRS \u00a7 <em>291-4. </em>And by virtue of HRS \u00a7 291-5 \u201cthe amount of alcohol found in the defendant\u2019s blood within three hours after the lime of the alleged [offense] as shown by chemical analysis or other approved analytical techniques of the defendant\u2019s blood or breath [is] competent evidence [to establish] that [he] was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the alleged [offense].\u201d The analytical technique we arc concerned with here is infrared absorption spect rometry, and the testing instrument in question is the Intoxilyzcr 4011 AS.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u201cWith the advent of advanced infrared (IR) breath alcohol analyzer and microprocessor technology, IR spectrometry has become a major technique in the quantitative analysis of breath for alcohol content.\u201d Goldberger &amp; <em>Caplan, Infrared Quantitative Evidential Breath-Alcohol Analysis: In Vitro Accuracy and Precision Studies, </em>31J. Forensic Sci. 16 (1986). The technique is founded on knowledge that \u201c|w]hen organic compounds such as ethanol, acetone, benzene, and many others, are exposed to infrared radiation, they absorb the radiation of certain frequen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>cies and not others.\u201d Fitzgerald &amp; Hume, <em>Intoxication Test Evidence: Criminal and Civil </em>140 (1987). When the Intoxilyzer was originally developed, \u201c[t]he infrared wavelength used by the [instrument] coincided] with a major absorption band of ethyl alcohol, 3.39 microns, representative of C[arbon]-H[ydrogen] stretching, molecular bond vibrations.\u201d Harte, <em>An Instrument for the Determination of Ethanol in Breath in Law Enforcement, </em>16 J. Forensic Sci. 493 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Though this absorption band is sensitive to alcohol it is sensitive also to other organic substances that have carbon and hydrogen molecular bonds. Brent &amp; Stiller, <em>Handling Drunk Driving Cases </em>166(1985). \u201cIn particular, the [original] instrument was unable to distinguish alcohol from acetone, a fault for which it was often criticized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The manufacturer met the problem when it introduced the Intoxilyzer 4011 AS \u201cwhich measured absorption of two wavelengths, 3.39 and 3.48 microns, a combination designed to detect the presence of acetone in the breath.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This model was the one approved for use by the county police departments on December 16, 1980. <em>See State v. Tengan, </em>67 Haw. 451, 461, 691 P.2d 365, 372 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cThe basic physical characteristics of the Intoxilyzcr[, however,] are similar in all 4011 models.\u201d Brent &amp; Stiller, supra, at 167. \u201cIn all, operation is far easier than with the wet chemical breath testing devices. No chemicals are needed for the test[, and the] test sequence is several times faster than [that in] the wet chemical breath testing device\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166. \u201cCalibration [of an Intoxilyzer] is done [by the manufacturer] at the factory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">For jurisdictions like Hawaii where the accuracy of the testing instrument must be verified in each test sequence, the manufacturer recommends that a two-phase verification system be followed. It recommends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the use of a wet bath simulator as a standard for calibration verification at scheduled intervals. And for accuracy verification during each test sequence, it recommends the use of an accessory developed to quickly perform the required task as a secondary standard. The accessory, denominated a Beam Attenuator by the manufacturer, is a circular piece of quartz encased in a rectangular metal holder; the quartz absorbs a known quantity of the infrared radiation emitted by the Intoxilyzer\u2019s light source when the accessory is placed in the instrument. Each Beam Attenuator is matched to a particular Intoxilyzer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the \u201cCertificate of Calibration Verification\u201d supplied by the manufacturer advises the user of the reading that is displayed digitally to verify accuracy when the Beam Attenuator is employed as the testing standard. The certificate for the Intoxilyzer used to measure blood alcohol concentration (B.A.C.) in this instance reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">This is to certify that the calibration of INTOXILYZER serial number 27-102370, manufactured by CMI INC. a subsidiary of Federal Signal Corporation of Park Forest South, Illinois, is verified when used with Beam Attenuator Accessory serial number Q-102370, to exhibit a reading of .292 \u00b1 .01 % B. A.C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Since \u201c[t]he responsibility of maintaining \u2018scientific and technical control of chemical testing for blood alcohol\u2019... is that of the Department of Health[,]\u201d <em>State </em>v. Tengan, 67 Haw. at 457, 691 P.2d at 369, the use of an Intoxilyzer to measure blood alcohol is controlled by the department. HRS \u00a7 321-161 directs the department to establish <em>inter alia </em>appropriate procedures for \u201cspecimen selection, collection, handling and analysis\u201d and vests it with authority to adopt the necessary rules and regulations. What was adopted pursuant to this authority is now codified in chapter 111 of title 11 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">As the ICA noted, the general requirements relating to \u201c\u2018 [t]esting for accuracy or calibration of all breath testing instruments[,]\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Christie, </em>7 Haw. App. at _, 764 P.2d at 1248, are set forth in section 11-111-2.1 (j) of the department\u2019s Rules for the Testing of Blood, Breath and Other Bodily Substances for Alcohol Concentration (the Rules), the department\u2019s recommended calibration testing method is described in section 11-111-2. l(k). and the accuracy verification test to be performed during an actual breath test is described in section 11-111-2.l(i). <em>See supra </em>note 1. Calibration testing is required \u201cnot less frequently than every thirty days,\u201d and the department\u2019s recommended testing method calls for the use of at least \u201ctwo reference samples of known alcohol concentration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For accuracy verification during each test sequence, the Rules call for the use of \u201ca suitable reference sample of known alcohol concentration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cReference sample\u201d is defined in section 11-111-1 of the Rules to mean \u201ca solution, ampoule, lens, or air sample that registers on an appropriate instrument, a known concentration of ethyl alcohol.\u201d And section 11-111-2.1 (j)(3) provides that \u201c[m]ethods recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>mended by the manufacturer or approved by the department for the testing for accuracy or calibration shall be employed[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendant urges that the Rules clearly called for the use of a wet bath simulator in verifying the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer during the breath test administered to him by the Honolulu Police Department and that the use of a Beam Attenuator as a standard for accuracy pursuant to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation rendered the results of the test inadmissible as evidence. Though the Rules provide that methods recommended by the manufacturer may be employed to verify accuracy, he argues the rule-making power of the Department of Health cannot be delegated to the manufacturer. But we conclude the Rules allow the use of a Beam Attenuator in verifying accuracy and no invalid delegation of rule-making authority occurred. And like the ICA we reach these conclusions after reading each applicable part of the Rules \u201cin connection with every other [applicable] part\u201d and giving \u201ca sensible... effecllo each.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>63 Haw. at 196, 624 P.2d at 380 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">We begin our analysis by examining a relevant part of the administrative regulations that dealt with \u201cBreath Testing Instruments\u201d at the time the Intoxilyzer was placed on the approved list of instruments employable in evidential breath testing. The relevant regulation, section 2A of chapter 47 of the Public Health Regulations, staled that \u201c[o]nly instruments and their related accessories approved by the Department [of Health] shall be employed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The regulation compelled \u201cthe manufacturer or the agency requesting [such] approval to provide the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>with the instrument and related accessories; chemical reagents; detailed set of instructions pertaining to the operation, calibration, and mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>nance; interpretation of results; and any other material needed for the evaluation^]\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 5. And it was the department\u2019s responsibility to evaluate what was submitted and decide whether the instrument and related accessories met the stringent performance standards prescribed in \u201cSection 2-A, 3,4, and 5.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The department found the Intoxilyzer and its related accessories met the prescribed standards in December of 1980, and the instrument and the accessories have since been used by the county police departments to measure blood alcohol concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The defendant\u2019s primary thesis, however, is not that the accessory in question provides an erratic or imprecise reference sample for verifying the accuracy of an Intoxilyzer; it is that the Department of Health \u201cdid not intend [to authorize the use of a Beam Attenuator] as an alternative method for an accessory verification test\u201d \u201cHad it so intended,\u201d he argues, \u201c[the method] would have been included in [section 11-111 \u2014 2.1(0 of the Rules] because that rule is quite detailed and explicit in the procedure to be followed.\u201d If \u201cits use were even contemplated,\u201d he maintains, \u201cthe Department certainly would have reference to it and described its method of use somewhere in Title 11 [of the Hawaii Administrative Rules].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">True, \u201cBeam Attenuator\u201d is not to be found in section 11 -111 -2.1 (0; the rule in relevant part provides that \u201c[t]he accuracy verification test [to be performed during the actual breath test sequence] shall be the analysis of a suitable reference sample of known alcohol concentration.\u201d Without more, the use of an accessory containing no alcohol as a reference sample for verifying the accuracy of the testing instrument would appear to be precluded. For purposes related to chapter 111, however, \u2018\u201cReference sample\u2019 means a solution, ampoule, lens, or air sample that registers on an appropriate instrument, a known concentration of ethyl alcohol.\u201d Hawaii Administrative Rules \u00a7 11-111-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">That \u201csolution\u201d would cover a wet bath simulator of known alcohol concentration, of course, is beyond cavil; that an \u201campoule\u201d could hold a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>solution with a known quantity of alcohol is not to be doubted; and that an \u201cair sample\u201d with a known quantity of alcohol dispersed therein could be prepared is not to be doubted too. But as the district court observed, a \u201clens\u201d contains no alcohol. Still, the framers of the definition designated a \u201clens\u201d as a possible reference sample. Were we to follow the district court\u2019s reasoning and hold a \u201clens\u201d is not a suitable reference sample because it contains no alcohol, we would be rendering superfluous a portion of the Department of Health\u2019s definition of \u201creference sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">An agency\u2019s policy declaration ought not be cast aside lightly. \u201c[E]ach part [of a rule like] each part... of a statute should be construed in connection with every other part... so as to produce a harmonious whole.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>63 Haw. at 196, 624 P.2d at 380 (citation omitted). \u201cDE]very part... must be viewed in connection with the whole so as to make all parts harmonize, if practicable,\u201d and sensible effect must be given to each. <em>Id. </em>Viewing the definition of \u201creference sample\u201d in section 11-111-1 in connection with section 11 \u2014 111\u20142.1 (j), (k), (l) and giving sensible effect to the definition, we conclude a Beam Attenuator matched to a particular Intoxilyzer is a suitable reference sample for verifying its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Among the definitions of \u201clens\u201d given by a recently published dictionary arc the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">1. a piece of transparent substance, usually glass, having two opposite surfaces either both curved or one curved and one plane, used in an optical device in changing the convergence of light rays, as for magnification, or in correcting defects of vision. 2. a combination of such pieces. 3. some analogous device, as for affecting sound waves, electromagnetic radiation, or streams of electrons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\"><em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1101 (unabr. rev. ed. 1987). The term in our opinion is broad enough to accommodate a circular piece of quartz that absorbs a known quantity of infraredradiation emitted by a particular source. A Beam Attenuator absorbs infrared radiation, so it is a device that affects electromagnetic radiation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>provides a precise and constant standard for verifying the accuracy of an Intoxilyzer. For when placed in the path of a properly functioning Intoxilyz,er\u2019s beam, the accessory causes the instrument to exhibit a predetermined reading \u201c\u00b1 .01% B.A.C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The defendant, however, argues the Department of Health would have mentioned Beam Attenuator and described its use if such use were intended. The district court apparently found his thesis convincing, citing the department\u2019s subsequent rejection of a suggestion advanced by the office of the public prosecutor to amend the definition of \u201creference sample\u201d to include \u201cbeam attenuator\u201d as evidence that all reference samples \u201cwhen tested on the breath testing instrument, would display values of actual alcohol and not values which merely simulated alcohol concentration.\u201d But the record reveals the department had a reason for rejecting the suggestion for change \u2014 as it said, this would have \u201cdilulc[dj the definition and the purpose of the definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Beam Attenuator, as we observed earlier, is not a generic term. It is a trade name bestowed on a particular accessory by the manufacturer of a breath testing instrument \u201cutilizing well accepted technologies based on sound physical principles.\u201d The Intoxilyzer is but one of several infrared absorption instruments developed to employ these technologies in breath testing; the Breathalyzer 2000 and the BAC Verifier are others now in use. <em>See </em>Fitzgerald &amp; Hume, <em>supra, </em>at 142-46. Since approval by the department of other infrared absorption devices and their accessories may be sought hereafter, we would have to agree that the specific inclusion of a \u201cBeam Attenuator\u201d as a suitable reference sample mightnot have served a salutary purpose. If other manufacturers chose to develop accessories that absorb infrared radiation in known quantities to be used as reference samples for accuracy verification, they would hardly be likely to apply that term to their radiation absorbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Having decided that the Rules for the Testing of Blood, Breath and Other Bodily Substances for Alcohol Concentration permit a reliance on a Beam Attenuator in verifying the accuracy of an Intoxilyzer, we turn to the defendant\u2019s contention that the incorporation of a manufacturer\u2019s recommended method for verification of accuracy in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>11-111-2.1 (j)(3) of the Rules constituted an impermissible subdelegation of rule-making authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We recognize that legislation empowering \u201cprivate persons to decide what the law shall be\u201d may be invalid. 1 Singer, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 4.11 (Sutherland 4th ed. 1985). \u201cWe are mindful too,\u201d we said in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tengan, </em>\u201cthat \u2018state legislation which adopts by reference <em>future </em>legislation, rules, or regulations, or amendments thereof, which are enacted, adopted, or promulgated by another sovereign entity [would constitute] an unlawful delegation of legislalive power.\u2019 <em>People </em>v. <em>Urban, </em>45 Mich. App. 255, 262, 206 N.W.2d 511, 516 (1973) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).\u201d 67 Haw. at 463, 691 P.2d at 373. But we are not confronted with a situation in which private persons or other sovereign entities have been authorized to decide what the Hawaii Rules controlling the use of breath testing instruments shall be \u2014 the Rules have been adopted by the Department of Health pursuant to a grant of authority in HRS \u00a7321-161.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Rules codified in title 11, chapter 111 of the Hawaii Administrative Rules comprise a comprehensive scheme covering all aspects of blood and breath testing for evidential purposes. The specific Rules governing the use of breath testing instruments, we noted, begin with a mandate that \u201c[a]ll devices used to determine equivalent blood alcohol content from breath samples shall be approved by the director.\u201d Hawaii Administrative Rules \u00a7 11-111-2.1 (a). The Rules go on to make approval contingent upon the instrument\u2019s capacity to meet performance standards prescribed by the department. <em>Id. </em>And they describe the methods to be followed in calibration and accuracy testing. <em>See supra </em>note 1. The vice of this aspect of the Rules, the defendant urges, is that it allows testing to be carried out in accord with methods recommended by the instrument\u2019s manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We would be concerned if the Rules did not call for a thorough evaluation of an instrument\u2019s capacity to accurately measure blood alcohol concentration before approval. But section 11-111-2.1 in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">(c) The manufacturer or the agency requesting evaluation of a breath testing instrument for the purpose of approval shall provide the department with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">(1) Instrument;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">(2) Related accessories;</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AWu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Paul J.

Technical consultation, as necessary, shall also be provided to the department during the evaluation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">That the instrument and related accessories have been found accurate when used as intended by their designer and manufacturer is thus implicit in the department\u2019s approval. For section 11 \u2014 111\u20142.1(d) provides \u201c[t]he department shall evaluate the instrument for compliance with subsection (a)[J\u201d which describes the stringent performance standards the instrument must meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Under these circumstances, we could not say the incorporation of the manufacturer\u2019s recommended method for testing accuracy in section 11-11 l-2.1(j)(3) of the Rules constitutes an impermissible subdelegation of rule-making authority. The section does not empower \u201cprivate persons to decide what the law shall be,\u201d 1 Singer, supra; it merely allows accuracy testing to be conducted in accord with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions which were submitted for examination and approval along with the instrument and accessories. Like the ICA, we find it logical to follow what the manufacturer has recommended in testing the accuracy of an Intoxilyzer. In our view it would be foolhardy not to follow the \u201cinstructions pertaining to the operation, calibration, and maintenance of the instrument\u201d issued by the manufacturer of a sensitive device designed to measure blood alcohol concentration, especially after the responsible agency has evaluated the instrument and found it is capable of meeting the performance standards set for such instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">A review of the record, the relevant statutes, and the relevant rules revealing no error, the decision of the Intermediate Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\"> Section 11-111 \u2014 2.1 (j), 11 \u2014 111\u20142.1(k), and 11-111-2.1(l) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">(j) Testing for accuracy or calibration of all breath testing instruments and related accessories employed pursuant to this chapter shall comply with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">(1) The supervisor shall assure that testing for accuracy or calibration is done;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">(2) Calibration testing shall be done not less frequently than every thirty days and after every instance of maintenance or repair;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">(3) Methods recommended by the manufacturer or approved by the department for the testing for accuracy or calibration shall be employed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>(4) Results of tests for accuracy or calibration shall be noted in a permanent record, as required by Section 11 \u2014 111\u20146(a)(2);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">(k) The recommended calibration testing method shall use a minimum of two reference samples of known alcohol concentration at a known temperature within the range of one hundredths to thirty hundredths per cent weight per volume or higher known alcohol concentrations that are recommended by the breath testing instrument\u2019s manufacturer.

This test shall be followed by a blanking procedure to insure that no residual sample remains in the instrument.

Selected narrow band infrared energy is passed through a sample chamber alternately filled with ambient air and breath from the subject under test. The infrared energy is absorbed in proportion to the alcohol concentration present in accordance with well established physics. The calculated concentration is then displayed digitally and if the test has been conducted properly, printed on a multicopy print-out for a permanent record.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\"> The following findings entered by the district court aptly describe how the accessory functions and how it is matched to an Intoxilyzer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">35. When a beam attenuator is inserted into the Intoxilyzer in to the path of an infrared beam energy source, the [quartz] causes a known decrease in the energy or infrared beam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">36. The decrease in energy after passage through the beam attenuator is then read by the Intoxilyzer machine and that amount, or v alue is [digitally] displayed on the Intoxilyzer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">37. After the manufacturer of the Intoxilyzer calibrates the Intoxilyzer machine at the factory, using primary standards (solutions which contain known concentrations of ethyl alcohol) and seals the critical components of the instrument with a special glue, the manufacturer then takes a quartz crystal (which the manufacturer calls a beam attenuator), inserts it into the Intoxilyzer and assigns that quartz crystal the value which is displayed on the Intoxilyzer screen.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\"> The Hawaii Administrative Rules are codified in a format that \u201cbrings all agency rules adopted pursuant to the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act (chapter 91, HRS) into a single numbering system [consisting] of a series of titles, with each title divided into chapters, and each chapter divided into sections.\u201d Hawaii Administrative Rules Directory 1.
