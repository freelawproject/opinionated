NO. 86-0047)</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b447-8\">MAY 2, 1989</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b447-9\">LUM, C.J., NAKAMURA, PADGETT, HAYASHI, AND WAKATSUKI, JJ.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b447-15\">OPINION OF THE COURT BY</p>\n<author id=\"AjS8\">PADGETT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of the defendant/possessor of land pursuant to a jury verdict, in a slip-and-fall case.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">Appellant Margaret Corbett allegedly injured herself when she stepped off of a paved sidewalk on appellee\u2019s premises and fell. She claims that the cause of her fall was the four- or five-inch difference in height between the paved sidewalk and the adjoining lawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The appeal is based upon claimed error in the giving of defendant\u2019s proposed jury instructions 38,40 and 41 over her objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Those three instructions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">DEFENDANT\u2019S PROPOSED INSTRUCTION NO. 38</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3H\">People can hurt themselves on almost any condition of the premises. But it takes more than this to make a condition unreasonably dangerous. If people who are likely to encounter a condition may be expected to take perfectly good care of themselves without further precautions, then the condition is not unreasonably dangerous because the likelihood of harm is slight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4U\">DEFENDANT\u2019S PROPOSED INSTRUCTION NO. 40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZX\">\u201cActual notice\u201d means that the defendant actually knew the condition was unreasonably dangerous. \u201cConstructive notice\u201d of an unreasonably dangerous condition arises by operation of law and may be inferred if the facts indicate a reasonably prudent person would have discovered the dangerous condition in time to remedy it or give warning before the injury occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxP-\">DEFENDANT\u2019S PROPOSED INSTRUCTION NO. 41</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmV\">In determining whether the condition was unreasonably dangerous and whether the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the condition, you may consider evidence of the absence of prior accidents or occurrences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The phrase \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d is used five times in these three instructions. Appellant contends, and we agree, that for the purposes of jury instructions, that term is misleading, and should not have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The legal question, of the scope of the duty of a possessor of the land, toward those who come onto the land, with respect to conditions on the land, is a matter with which the courts have had great difficulty in dealing, and which has resulted in many jurisdictions in very complex rules based on the particular status of the person coming on the land. See, for example, 2 <em>Restatement of Torts (Second) </em>\u00a7\u00a7 328E through 350, at 170-233 (1965). Some years ago, this court broke with the common-law tradition of classifying the scope of the possessor\u2019s duty by the status of the persons injured as invitees, licensees, etc. <em>Pickard v. City &amp; </em>County, 51 Haw. 134, 452 P.2d 445 (1969); <em>Gibo </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>51 Haw. 299, 459 P.2d 198 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>However, in discussing the land possessor\u2019s negligence in other cases we have, in various contexts, used the term \u201ccondition unreasonably dangerous\u201d <em>(Friedrich v. Department of Transp., </em>60 Haw. 32, 36 n.1, 586 P.2d 1037, 1040 n.1 (1978)); \u201cdangerous conditions\u201d <em>(Littleton </em>v. <em>State, </em>66 Haw. 55, 69, 656 P.2d 1336, 1345 (1982)); and \u201cextremely dangerous conditions\u201d <em>(Kaczmarczyk </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>65 Haw. 612, 615, 656 P.2d 89, 92 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Likewise, the Intermediate Court of Appeals of the State of Hawaii has used \u201cunreasonably dangerous condition\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Haw. App. 554, 558, 623 P.2d 446, 449 (1981)) and \u201cdangerous condition\u201d <em>(Hascup v. City </em>&amp; <em>County, </em>2 Haw. App. 639, 642, 638 P.2d 870, 873 (1982)). Textual writers also have used the term \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d (2 Harper &amp; James, <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 27.13 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In our view, the substance of our many cases, dealing with possessors of land, and their duly toward persons using the land, is that, if a condition exists upon the land which poses an unreasonable risk of harm to persons using the land, then the possessor of the land, if the possessor knows, or should have known of the unreasonable risk, owes a duly to the persons using the land to take reasonable steps to eliminate the unreasonable risk, or adequately to warn the users against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Our past discussions of this matter, and the terms used therein, were made in the context of the facts in those cases, but were not discussions of the proper wording of jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">As we have pointed out in earlier decisions, a direct quotation of language from an opinion is not always a good basis for a jury instruction. The question here is whether the use, five times, of the term \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d applied to the condition of the land, in the three instructions quoted, is the equivalent of the proper test for negligence of the possessor which we have stated above. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The focus of the test for negligence should be, and, in the case of jury instructions, must be, on the unreasonableness of the risk of harm, not on the degree of dangerousness of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">A jury might, and probably would, regard the four- to five-inch difference in height between the sidewalk and the adjoining lawn as not \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d but it might find that, in the circumstances of the case, it posed an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Att\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>Douglas R. Spencer (Teresa S. Tico </em>on the opening brief) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AGx\"><em>Jeffrey S. Portnoy (Peter W. Olson </em>with him on the brief; Cades Schutte Fleming &amp; Wright, of counsel) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In our view, the instructions, as worded, required the jury to find that the condition was \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d before it considered the unreasonableness of the risk of harm, and were thus misleading. Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
