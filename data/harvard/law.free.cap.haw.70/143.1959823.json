Mrs. Myers appealed, averring the family court \u201cerred in its distribution of the property of the parties[.]\u201d The Intermediate Court of Appeals agreed that the family court abused its discretion in determining the value of her husband\u2019s pension plan but affirmed the property division in all other respects. We granted her application for certiorari because other aspects of the family court\u2019s final division and distribution of the estate of the parties did not appear to be just and equitable, as mandated by HRS \u00a7 580-47. A review of the record confirms that the family court\u2019s treatment of the post-separation appreciation of property acquired with marital assets but held in the husband\u2019s name, following a rule enunciated by the Intermediate Court of Appeals in <em>Woodworth </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>7 Haw. App. _, 740 P.2d 36 (1987), is inconsistent with HRS \u00a7 580-47. We therefore overrule <em>Woodworth v. Woodworth </em>as precedent to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion, vacate the portions of the decree covering the Kaiser Option and the Revere Copper investment, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The parties were married on December 12, 1969, physically separated on June 19,1984, and divorced on May 8,1987. No children were bom of the marriage. The record on appeal indicates the parties discussed divorce and its legal consequences on numerous occasions prior to their separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">In December of 1982, they reached an agreement whereby Mrs. Myers was to receive one-third of the marital assets and Mr. Myers was to receive the remaining two-thirds and be responsible for liabilities other than the first mortgage on the marital residence, which Mrs. Myers was to receive. The oral agreement was refined and reduced to writing thereafter by the lawyers retained by the parties, and the Agreement in Contempla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tion of Divorce was executed on October 11,1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In accord with its terms, Mr. Myers then conveyed his interest in the marital residence to Mrs. Myers and removed the encumbrance of the second mortgage on the property; he also made a lump sum payment of $1,008,222.00 to Mrs. Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Mrs. Myers filed her complaint for divorce on July 24, 1984. Though the parties initially contemplated that there would be no contest of the action, Mr. Myers filed his Cross-Complaint for Divorce on March 7,1985. And when the case was finally heard in October of 1986, a primary dispute to be resolved by the family court was the validity and effect of the Agreement in Contemplation of Divorce. The court concluded the agreement was valid; it nevertheless \u201crefuse[d] to allow the Agreement to control the division and distribution of the parties\u2019 assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">For purposes of valuing the assets subject to division, \u201cin view of the fact that almost all of the financial documents that were offered into evidence [were dated] June 30, 1984 ..., the [c]ourt [concluded] it [was] reasonable [to] use [that date rather than the date of separation, June 19, 1984].\u201d Among the assets valued and divided by the family court were the husband\u2019s interest in an Option Agreement and Right of First Refusal for the purchase of the real property on which the Kaiser Hospital formerly stood (the Kaiser Option) and his interest in a limited partnership holding Revere Copper stock (the Revere Copper investment).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Mr. Myers acquired a 50% interest in the Kaiser Option from Bruce Stark on September 2,1982 and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 50% interest from Stark on January 19,1984. Mr. Myers found it necessary thereafter to file suit against Kaiser Hospital to enforce the option to buy its property. The suit was settled on May 4,1984, and the validity of the option, as well as the price of the real property, was established. He commenced his efforts to obtain the necessary governmental approvals and permits to develop the property in October of 1984 and succeeded more than a year later in December of 1985. He sold the Kaiser Option for approximately $12,000,000.00 in April of 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The interest in the Revere Copper investment was acquired by Mr. Myers in 1983, and the transaction involved an outlay of $725,000.00 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>his part. He \u201chad no intention of sharing any portion of this investment with [Mrs. Myers since the acquisition followed the execution of the Agreement in Contemplation of Divorce and] he believed the funds used to purchase the investment were his own separate funds.\u201d The family court found the investment was worth $1,380,410.00 as of June 30,1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The court ruled Mrs. Myers was \u201centitled to one-half (1/2) the value of the [Kaiser] Option as of June 30,1984[,]\u201d and \u201cone-half (1/2)... of the value of the [Revere] stock[]\u201d as of that date. She appealed from \u201cthe part of the May 8,1987 Divorce Decree relating to the division and distribution of property and debts.\u201d The appeal was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Mrs. Myers sought to overturn the property division on grounds that the family court \u201cimproperly valued and apportioned the Kaiser Option and Revere Copper Investment[]\u201d and \u201cerred as a matter of law by concluding that Husband\u2019s pension is subject to deferred taxes.\u201d The Intermediate Court agreed \u201cthat the family court abused its discretion when it reduced the value of Husband\u2019s $946,000 pension plan account by $560,000 on account of the taxes that Husband would have been obligated to pay if he had withdrawn the funds in his pension plan account on June 30,1984.\u201d The appellate court, however, found no reason to disturb the valuation and apportionment of the Kaiser Option and the Revere Copper investment, deeming these actions consistent with its decision in <em>Woodworth v. Woodworth, </em>7 Haw. App. _, 740 P.2d 36 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Mrs. Myers now urges us to review and modify the part of the intermediate court\u2019s decision in <em>Woodworth </em>v. Woodworth, <em>supra, </em>\u201cestablishing legal ownership as the uniform starting point for the distribution of post-separation appreciation of assets acquired during marriage by and from the investment of marital assets, labor and capital of the spouses.\u201d We begin our review of the case by examining the statute governing the division and distribution of the estate of the parties in a divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The statute in question, HRS \u00a7 580-47(a), empowers the family court, \u201c[u]pon granting a divorce,... [to] make such further orders as shall appear just and equitable... finally dividing and distributing the estate of the parties, real, personal, or mixed, whether community, joint, or separate[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThere is,\u201d we have said in applying the statute, \u201cno fixed rule for determining the amount of property to be awarded each spouse in a divorce action other than as set forth in HRS \u00a7 580-47.\u201d <em>Au Hoy v. Au Hoy, </em>60 Haw. 354, 357, 590 P.2d 80, 82 (1979). Section 580-47 \u201cgives to the family court the discretion to divide marital property according to what is just and equitable[,]\u201d <em>Cassiday </em>v. <em>Cassiday, </em>68 Haw. 383, 388, 716 P.2d 1133, 1137 (1986) (citation omitted), and this authority \u201cincludes the discretion to award separate property to the non-owning spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 716 P.2d at 1136 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">When the directive to the court is to do what is just and equitable in the circumstances, \u201c[o]f course, each case must be decided upon its own facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Carson v. Carson, </em>50 Haw. 182, 183, 436 P.2d 7, 9 (1967). This \u201cdo[es] not mean that the ... court may do whatever pleases it. [A grant of discretion] means instead that the court has a range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Kern </em>v. <em>TXO Prod. Corp., </em>738 F.2d 968, 970 (8th Cir. 1984). Thus, we have avoided, where possible, the adoption of general rules governing the division of marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In <em>Cassiday </em>v. <em>Cassiday, </em>6 Haw. App. 207, 716 P.2d 1145 (1985), the Intermediate Court of Appeals established a general rule \u201cthat it is equitable to award each party half of the during-marriage real appreciation of property separately owned at the time of the marriage or subsequently received through gifts or inheritance and still separately owned at divorce[.]\u201d <em>Cassiday v. Cassiday, </em>68 Haw. at 384, 716 P.2d at 1134. \u201cThe effect of such a rule,\u201d we said, was \u201cto create a rebuttable presumption that [any appreciation in] separate property should be evenly divided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 716 P.2d at 1137. We therefore rejected the Intermediate Court\u2019s general rule and held \u201cinstead that the trial court may award up to half of [the during-marriage] appreciation [of separately owned property] to the non-owning spouse if, under the totality of the circumstances, it is just and equitable to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 716 P.2d at 1138. \u2018The trial court,\u201d we added, \u201calso may determine that a lesser award, or no award, is in order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The dispute at bar involves an appreciation in the value of separately owned marital property during the lengthy period between the separation of the parties and their divorce, and our concern again is with the establishment by the Intermediate Court of Appeals of rules governing thedivision of such property.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Inasmuch as HRS \u00a7 580-47(a) empowers the family court to make a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d division and distribution of \u201cthe estate of the parties, real, personal, or mixed, whether community, joint, or separate[,]\u201d the task of sorting, valuing, and dividing assets indeed may be formidable. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Hashimoto </em>v. <em>Hashimoto, </em>6 Haw. App. 424, 725 P.2d 520 (1986), the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) classified marital assets subject to division; the classification scheme underscored the complexity of the task. The ICA\u2019s five-category classification of property and \u201cproperty net market values\u201d took the ownership, the time of acquisition, the manner of acquisition, and the during-marriage increase in the value of marital assets into account<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and designated \u201cuniform starting points\u201d (USP) from which the family court\u2019s \u201cequitable distribution analysis and application of statutory and case law mandates!]\u201d should begin. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 725 P.2d at 522.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cUniform starting points\u201d were first enunciated by the ICA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>in <em>Miura </em>v. <em>Miura, </em>No. 10651 (Haw. App. July 30,1986) (mem.), but we ordered the depublication of the full opinion and set it to naught as precedent on August 22, 1986.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Hashimoto, </em>however, was not reviewed by this court because no application for further review of the case was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Subsequently, the appellate court observed in <em>Woodworth </em>v. <em>Woodworth </em>that a division of the estate of the parties necessitated the determination of ownership and value of property held by either or both spouses on the date of marriage, during marriage, and/or at the time of divorce. 7 Haw. App. at _, 740 P.2d at 39. It said that for purposes of dividing property owned by either or both spouses at the time of divorce, what is relevantis the \u201c\u2018date of final separation in contemplation of divorce.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 740 P.2d at 39. This date, the court ruled, is the date when the trial is completed or \u201cwhen one spouse clearly and unconditionally communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>cates to the other... that the marriage has in fact ended and that he or she wants a divorce and does not thereafter... communicate a different message to the other[, ]\u201d whichever occurs earlier. <em>Id. </em>at _, 740 P.2d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The court\u2019s establishment of the \u201cdate of final separation in contemplation of divorce\u201d (DOFSICOD) as the relevant date for determining the value of marital assets at the time of divorce resulted in a reexamination of its prior classification of \u201cproperty net market values\u201d subject to division and the addition of yet another category of \u201cnet market value\u201d (NMV), Category 6, covering \u201c[t]he difference between the NMVs, plus or minus, of all property owned by one or both of the spouses at the conclusion of the evidentiary part of the trial and the total of the NMVs, plus or minus, includable in categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 740 P.2d at 40.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then held \u201c[t]he USP for dividing the NMVs under category 6 is to award them to their legal owner spouses in proportion to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>legal ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 740 P.2d at 41. In effect, it established a presumption that a legal-owner spouse is entitled to the appreciation in marital assets between the DOFSICOD and the conclusion of the evidentiary part of the trial, a period that could extend, as it did here, for several years. This, in our view, cannot be squared with the mandate of HRS \u00a7 580-47 \u201cto look beyond the mere form of title\u201d in dividing the estate of the parties. Kastely, <em>An Essay in Family Law: Property Division, Alimony, Child Support, and Child Custody, </em>6 U. Haw. L. Rev. 381, 393 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The family court \u201cfound\u201d Mr. Myers was \u201cproperly entitled to the. appreciation in value of the Kaiser Option after the date of separation\u201d because the project was a \u201chighly speculative venture,\u201d it \u201cwas largely undeveloped prior to the date of separation,\u201d it \u201cdid not actually reach fruition until 1986,\u201d and his \u201cskill and effort resulted in the development of the Kaiser Option without [the] assistance\u201d of Mrs. Myers. The court\u2019s conclusion with respect to the Revere Copper investment was that \u201cthe parties [were] entitled to one-half (1/2) each of the value of the stock[]\u201d as of June 30,1984. Deeming the \u201cdifference in the value of the Kaiser Option onJune 19,1984 and on January 27,1987.. .a category 6 value,\u201d the IC A said \u201cthe family court did not abuse its discretion when it decided not to vary its award of this ... value from the applicable uniform starting point.\u201d The ICA further concluded Mrs. Myers \u201cfailed to prove\u201d any category 6 increase attributable to the Revere Copper stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Granted, \u201cthe skill and effort\u201d of Mr. Myers enhanced the marketability of the Kaiser Option after the DOFSICOD. But even he was not so bold as to claim other forces were not responsible too for its eventual sale at a handsome profit; he acknowledged rapid changes in the yen-dollar exchange rate were what finally made the sale possible. As he put it, \u201c[a]nd all of a sudden what didn\u2019t make sense for [the Japanese buyers] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>now [made] sense because they had the project at a fraction of what [it was] going to cost anybody else.\u201d We would then have to conclude the family court erred in not taking all the circumstances into consideration in deciding Mr. Myers was entitled to \u201cthe appreciation in value of the Kaiser Option after the date of separation,\u201d inasmuch as a portion thereof can only be characterized as passive appreciation unrelated to his activities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor do we agree with the IC A that family court judges \u201cshould be bound by [a] rule that automatically presumes\u201d a legal owner spouse is entitled to the appreciation in marital assets between the date of final separation in contemplation of divorce and the conclusion of the evidentiary part of a divorce trial. <em>Cassiday v. Cassiday, </em>68 Haw. at 388, 716 P.2d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Our divorce and separation laws do \u201cnot contemplate any [final] division of property other than where the person is divorced <em>a vinculo [matrimonii] r Clifford v.

This is consistent with the notion that \u201cmarriage is a partnership to which both [parties] bring their financial resources as well as their individual energies and efforts. That one partner brings to the marriage substantially greater [resources] than the other does not make this any less the case.\u201d <em>Cassiday </em>v. <em>Cassiday, </em>68 Haw. at 387, 716 P.2d at 1136 (footnote omitted). A presumption that the non-owning spouse is not entitled to any part of the appreciation in property legally owned by the other after a declaration by either that the marriage has ended is inconsistent with the partnership model of marriage we have accepted and the rule that a final division of marital property can be decreed only when the partnership is dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The portions of the decree of divorce relating to the Kaiser Option and the Revere Copper investment are vacated,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Woodworth </em>v. <em>Wood</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>worth, </em>7 Haw.

The ICA affirmed the award, finding \u201cno evidence in the record of the value of Husband\u2019s Revere Copper investment\u201d at the time of trial. The family court, however, found the investment was worth $1,430,820.00 on December 31, 1984.
