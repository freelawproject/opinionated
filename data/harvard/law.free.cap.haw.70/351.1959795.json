After using a polygraph examination to verify rape charges filed by Roman, the investigating police officers had suspected that she was lying, questioned her about the accusations without first giving <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966) warnings <em>(Miranda </em>warnings), and then obtained oral plus written confessions admitting to fabricating the allegations. The trial court had ruled that the police had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>improperly interviewed Roman after the polygraph session by failing to issue the required <em>Miranda </em>warnings. State contends that the trial court erred because 1) there was no custodial interrogation necessitating <em>Miranda </em>warnings; and 2) Roman had received adequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to the polygraph testing. We disagree, instead affirm the suppression order, and therefore remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The facts are not disputed. On January 5,1987, Roman, an inmate serving weekends at the Women\u2019s Correctional Facility reported having been repeatedly raped by two male Adult Corrections Officers on November 7,1986, December 9,1986, December 26,1986, December 27,1986, and January 2,1987. But the investigating Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Detective Leighton Fujinaka (Det. Fujinaka) suspected Roman was lying (based on the inconsistencies in her story plus the lack of corroborating physical evidence) and arranged a polygraph examination to confirm her charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">On January 15,1987 at the Beretania Street police station, qualified examiner HPD Detective John Paekukui (Det. Paekukui) went over two standard police forms apprising Roman of her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, seeking consent to the polygraph testing, plus telling that the test results would be discussed afterwards. Roman signed the forms. After the questioning had ended, Det. Paekukui reviewed the readings for a few minutes, determined that Roman had not been truthful describing the purported rapes, and confronted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">As Det. Paekukui later testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">Q. When you informed Ms. Roman that you concluded that she was not being entirely truthful with you, what response did she give, if any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">A. At first, she said that she was telling the whole truth and at that point, she wouldn\u2019t make any other statements that she was just telling the truth about what had happened, continued to talk to her about this result of the test, and when I told her that <em>it appeared that she was carrying a heavy burden because </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>of this test, and that if she would tell the truth, it would probably make herfeel better </em>instead of feeling this burden. That\u2019s when she asked me to sit down because she wanted to tell me something. This is when she told me that she lied in the test and nothing happened and she made everything up [to allay her husband\u2019s suspicions about unexplained bruises received while at the prison].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Transcript of July 10,1987 1 at 18 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Det. Paekukui next brought Det. Fujinaka into the examination room where Roman repeated her confession. Det. Fujinaka thereafter took Roman to another room to have her write down her statement and informed his superior officer HPD Lieutenant James Neely (Lt. Neely). Lt. Neely then instructed Det. Fujinaka to arrest Roman for making false accusations plus tape record her confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">On February 19, 1987, Roman was charged with violating Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 710-1015 (1985) by filing a false crime report.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 15,1987, the defense moved to suppress all of Roman\u2019s confessions arguing that 1) she had been improperly pressured into talking; 2) no <em>Miranda </em>warnings had issued after the questioning, based on the polygraph examination results, had commenced; and 3) the warnings on the two standard police forms had failed to alert Roman about any post-testing interrogation. State answered that 1) Roman was not under custodial interrogation but had voluntarily confessed; 2) the two police forms had adequately explained her <em>Miranda </em>rights; plus 3) no unlawful coercion had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Det. Fujinaka subsequently testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">Q During the time Ms. Roman was <em>in your custody, </em>Detective, did you ever inform her of her constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">A No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">Q Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">A After she had made a spontaneous utterance to me and the polygraph in the presence of Detective Paekukui and myself and after getting her permission to write out her statement on the statement form, my intention was just to close the case for insufficient evidence, because of the deception that was discovered. However, I did inform her in the polygraph room, if I recall correctly, that she may be arrested for making a false report. At that point <em>I had no indication or intention of placing her under arrest. </em>Basically, mainly to close the report, while she was writing out her statement form in the interview room I went to look for my lieutenant [Ll Neely]. I left her alone to inform him of the progress of this particular case. I was unable to locate him at that time. I then returned back to the room. She had just about finished the statement form. I left her again. I found the lieutenant. I informed the lieutenant what had happened. And it was at that point the lieutenant instructed me to place her under arrest for making a false report and also to tape record her written statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">Q What about when Detective Neely told you to arrest her? At that point you intended to arrest her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">A Well, when Lieutenant Neely informed me to arrest her, <em>at that point </em>/ <em>should have warned her of her constitutional rights. But I did not.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Transcript of July 10,1987 2 at 8-9,16 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">On April 19,1988, the trial court rendered its written decision suppressing Roman\u2019s statements by concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">1. As a matter of law, the \u201cWARNING PERSONS TAKING A POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\u201d given to the Defendant before the polygraph examination was insufficient to enable her to knowingly and intelligently waive her rights with regard to the post-test interrogation by Detective Paekukui. <em>Nothing in the language </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>of the written warning of rights form given to the Defendant explicitly related to interrogation after the polygraph examination. </em>Furthermore, while the form indicated that the Defendant\u2019s words might be used in court, <em>the form did not indicate that those words might be used against her. </em>In addition, while the form indicated that the Defendant would be informed of the results of the polygraph test, <em>it said nothing about any interrogation of the Defendant about those results. </em>Consequently, the Defendant could not have knowingly and intelligently waived her rights with regard to the post-polygraph interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Record at 87-88 (emphasis added). The trial court therefore held that a custodial interrogation had begun when Roman became the focus of a false charges investigation, the police detectives had improperly failed to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings after the polygraph examination, and the official misconduct had tainted all the statements which had to be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"AnO\">State then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">We will answer the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">1. Whether the trial court erred by ruling that a custodial interrogation requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings had taken place? NO.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">2. Whether the trial court erred by holding that Roman had not been adequately apprised of her constitutional rights by the two standard police forms? NO.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">State maintains that Roman did not undergo any custodial interrogation since the questioning concerned her rape accusations and not her involvement in any other crime, she was free to leave after receiving the polygraph examination results, plus the police detectives did not attempt to incriminate her. Roman counters that the inherently coercive, intimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>dating situation forced her to admit to the fabrication and amounted to custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings must precede any police questioning which subjugates an individual to the will of the examiner and thereby undermines the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>67 Haw. 126, 681 P.2d 553 (1984), <em>appeal after remand, </em>69 Haw. _, 734 P.2d 156 (1987). The test to determine if a custodial interrogation had taken place is whether the investigating officer should have known that his or her words or conduct were reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ikaika, </em>67 Haw. 563, 698 P.2d 281 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Here, Roman voluntarily underwent the polygraph testing, was not at first a suspect, so was not initially in custody. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sugimoto, </em>62 Haw. 259, 614 P.2d 386 (1980); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>67 Haw. 293, 687 P.2d 544 (1984). Yet, Det. Paekukui knew about Det. Fujinaka\u2019s suspicions, confirmed that Roman had probably lied about the rape incidents, and then encouraged her to tell the truth (i.e. confess to concocting a false story). State does not challenge the trial court\u2019s crucial finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">12. When Det. Paekukui informed the Defendant of his conclusion, the Defendant initially insisted that she had told the truth about the sexual assaults. Det. Paekukui then questioned the Defendant about the discrepancies between the polygraph test and her statements for about five minutes. At one point Det. Paekukui observed that the Defendant appeared to be carrying a \u201cheavy burden\u201d; <em>he urged her to unburden herself to him. </em>The Defendant then said, \u201cSit down, there\u2019s something I want to tell you.\u201d The Defendant then made a statement to Det. Paekukui that she had earlier fabricated her reports of being sexually assaulted while a prisoner at the Womens Facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Record at 85-86 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The criminal investigation had now focussed on Roman, and the questioning by Det. Paekukui (and later Det. Fujinaka) became specific as to her misconduct. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Blanding, </em>69 Haw. _, 752 P.2d 99 (1988). What had originally been a relatively innocuous interview had turned into a custodial interrogation requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Amorin, </em>61 Haw. 356, 604 P.2d 45 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">State, however, declares that 1) neither Det. Paekukui nor Det. Fujinaka had sought to institute any charges based on Roman\u2019s admissions (until Lt. Neely\u2019s later intervention); 2) the questioning was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>designed to elicit any incriminating evidence; so 3) <em>Miranda </em>warnings were unnecessary. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Paahana, </em>66 Haw. 499, 666 P.2d 592 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">But regardless of their initial, actual, subjective intent, the police detectives should have realized that they were essentially asking Roman to confess to the false reporting offense. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Melemai, </em>64 Haw. 479, 643 P.2d 541 (1982). That a subsequent decision by Lt. Neely changed the situation should not excuse the police detectives\u2019 initial failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We do not condone any police ignorance about the law and the consequences of a custodial interrogation. <em>See, e.g., State </em>v. <em>Uganiza, </em>68 Haw. 28, 702 P.2d 1352 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">THE POLICE FORMS\u2019 MIRANDA WARNINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">State next advances that 1) the two standard police forms which Roman had signed before submitting to the polygraph test provided sufficient <em>Miranda </em>warnings; so 2) she had willingly waived her constitutional rights by confessing. Roman replies that 1) the police forms were inadequate; and 2) there was no knowing, intelligent relinquishment of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings must clearly convey to the accused a full understanding of the applicable constitutional protections: the right to remain silent, that anything said can and will be used against the accused, the right to an attorney present during the questioning, plus an appointed counsel will be offered if needed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hong, </em>62 Haw. 83, 611 P.2d 595 (1980) (per curiam); <em>State v. Kalai, </em>56 Haw. 366, 537 P.2d 8 (1975). That the defendant read and signed police forms providing <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to confessing may be sufficient to indicate a valid waiver of one\u2019s constitutional rights, but the defendant\u2019s age, background, intelligence, and situation should be considered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kreps, 4 </em>Haw. App. 72, 661 P.2d 711 (1983); <em>see State v. Maluia, </em>56 Haw. 428, 539 P.2d 1200 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">As the trial court accurately discerned, the forms revealed nothing about a post-testing interrogation leading to a criminal prosecution aris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ing out of an offense other than the alleged rapes. <em>Cf. Wyrick v. Fields, </em>459 U.S. 42 (1982) (per curiam). This is not an instance where the person under the police questioning was a suspect knowing about being the focus of an investigation and the chance of criminal liability. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Ramones, </em>69 Haw. _, 744 P.2d 514 (1987); <em>cf. Colorado </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564 (1987). Because Roman was not informed about the totally separate false charges problem (although arising out of the inquiry into her rape complaint), the earlier <em>Miranda </em>warnings (relating solely to the polygraph examination) were inadequate, so rewarnings specifically pertaining to the subsequent interrogation were mandated. <em>See State v. Nelson, </em>69 Haw. _, 748 P.2d 365 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Where the prosecution has not proven that the accused was properly admonished about her constitutional rights, there could be no valid waiver. <em>See State v. Kaahanui, </em>69 Haw. _, 747 P.2d 1276 (1987). The first improper questioning by Det. Paekukui therefore tainted all of Roman\u2019s subsequent confessions, rendering them inadmissible. <em>See State v. Kim, </em>68 Haw. 286, 711 P.2d 1291 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">2. Although the Defendant came to the police station voluntarily in order to submit to the polygraph examination, when Detective Paekukui began questioning the Defendant after the polygraph examination ended, the Defendant became the subject of a custodial interrogation since at that point she became the central focus of a separate criminal investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">3. <em>Because the Defendant was not re-informed of her Constitutional rights prior to the post-polygraph custodial interrogation, and because the earlier warning and waiver of rights were insufficient with regard to the post-polygraph interrogation, </em>the State of Hawaii could not demonstrate that it had exercised adequate procedural safeguards to secure the Defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. Consequently, the Defendant\u2019s oral statements to Detectives Paekukui and Fujinaka must be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">4. The Defendant\u2019s subsequent written statement must also be suppressed under the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d doctrine articulated in <em>United States v. Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 540-541 [, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>332 U.S. 785] (1947), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>4 Haw. App. 248[, 665 P.2d 181] (1983) since the Defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>not re-informed of her Constitutional rights against self-incrimination prior to making the written statement.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A51\"><em>Wallace W.
