The trial judge construed HRS \u00a7 286-156 as forbidding a waiver of the 20-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">While we have held that, absent waiver, the 20-day statutory requirement must be strictly complied with, we think it clear that the defendant can waive that requirement Here, the record indicates that the appellee requested a continuance in order to complete discovery and that the court below granted that continuance. We hold that a defendant, charged with failure to submit to testing, can waive the 20-day period. Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AfO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Arthur E.
