Appellant contends that the trial court erred in giving the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">The term \u201cextreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d as used in the Manslaughter defense denotes the emotional state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>an individual who 1) is exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress, and 2) has an extreme emotional reaction to it, as a result of which there is a loss of self-control and reason is overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or other similar emotions.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"Af4\"><em>Chester M. Kanai </em>on the brief for appellant</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AIx\"><em>Jeffrey M. Albert, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">This was so-called State\u2019s supplemental instruction no. 3. It is drawn from a passage in <em>People </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>88 Misc.2d 136, 149, 385 N.Y.S.2d 708, 717 (1976), quoted by the Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawaii (ICA) in <em>State v. Dumlao, </em>6 Haw. App. 173, 181-82, 715 P.2d 822, 829 (1986). In <em>Dumlao, </em>the ICA reversed a murder conviction for failure to give an instruction in accordance with HRS \u00a7 707-702(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">HRS \u00a7 707-702(2), which the instruction is attempting to explain, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">In a prosecution for murder in the first and second degrees it is a defense, which reduces the offense to manslaughter, that the defendant was, at the time he caused the death of the other person, under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation. The reasonableness of the explanation shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as he believed them to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The problem we have with the instruction, as given, is with subsection (1), which by the use of the word \u201cextremely\u201d focuses the effect of the statute on the quality of the stress. In order to have the benefit of the statute, under the instruction given, the person invoking it must show he or she has been exposed to \u201can extremely unusual and overwhelming stress.\u201d No such provision appears in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">On the contrary, the statute focuses, as the ICA opinion in <em>Dumlao </em>demonstrates, on the defendant\u2019s reaction to the stress, and requires only that the defendant be under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is \u201ca reasonable explanation.\u201d The instruction given was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
