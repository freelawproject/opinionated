Reviewing the record and the relevant statutory provisions, we conclude the circuit court was correct in ruling HIGA had no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The claim in question was submitted by Jesse and Cynthia Villagonza to HIGA for payment; it arose out of a construction accident that occurred on February 24, 1985, in which Jesse Villagonza was injured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The Villagonzas sued Brundage Concrete Pumping, Inc. for damages thereafter, and agreed to settle their claim in October of 1986. The settlement called for the payment to them of $625,000, $300,000 by the defendant\u2019s primary insurer, Argonaut Insurance Company, and $325,000 by the defendant\u2019s surplus line insurer, Holland-America Insurance Company. But by November of 1986 Holland-America, a California insurer, was insolvent, had been placed in conservatorship, and could not pay its share of the agreed sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The plaintiffs thus looked to HIGA for the payment of $300,000, the monetary limit on claims the association is allowed to pay. HIGA, however, refused to honor the Villagonzas\u2019 claim; in its opinion, the relevant provisions of HRS chapter 43 ID (1985) only provided for the payment of a claim against an \u201cauthorized insurer\u201d and Holland-America was not one. The plaintiffs then sued HIGA, asserting Holland-America was an \u201cauthorized insurer\u201d in this instance because the policy insuring Brundage Concrete Pumping, Inc. had been procured through a licensed surplus line broker in accord with the provisions of HRS \u00a7 431-330 (1985). Summary judgment was sought by the defendant as well as the plaintiffs, and the circuit court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. The plaintiffs perfected a timely appeal to this court</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The issue on appeal being one of statutory interpretation, we begin the task of ascertaining and giving effect to the intention of the legislature by examining the Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association Act, HRS chapter 43 ID (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The legislature created the Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association \u201cto provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment and to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer ... and to provide an association to assess the cost of such protection among insurers.\u201d HRS \u00a7 43 ID-2 (1985). All insurers licensed to transact insurance in Hawaii and writing all kinds of direct insurance, other than life, title, surety, disability, credit, mortgage guaranty, and ocean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>marine insurance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are compelled to \u201cbe and remain members of the association as a condition of their authority to transact insurance ...HRS \u00a7 431D-6 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The association is obligated to cover unpaid claims<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in excess of $ 100 but less than $300,000 which arise out of and are within the coverage of an insurance policy issued by an insurer who was authorized to transact insurance in Hawaii when the policy was issued or when the insured event occurred and is later declared insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It defrays these obligations through assessments levied on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>members. HRS \u00a7 431D-8(a)(3) (1985). Each \u201cmember insurer\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is assessed \u201cin the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the rates and premiums paid by their insured perforce reflect the assessments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association Act, however, does not speak of \u201csurplus line insurance.\u201d The term, as we noted at the outset, is defined in HRS \u00a7 431-329 (1985), which was part of the repealed Hawaii Insurance Law, as \u201cinsurance procured from an unauthorized insurer in accordance with the provisions of [HRS \u00a7 431-330 (1985)].\u201d Thereunder, \u201c[a] general agent is permitted to procure [such] insurance only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmN\">(1) After diligent search the general agent determines in good faith that any portion or the full amount of insurance required to protect the interest of the insured, or insurance affording substantially the same protection, cannot be procured from a substantial number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the insurers authorized to transact that kind of insurance in this State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">(2) The surplus line insurance procured is in addition to or in excess of the amount and coverage which can be procured from such substantial number of authorized insurers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">(3) The insurance is procured through a licensed surplus line broker; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">(4) The insurance is not procured at a rate lower than the lowest rate at which a substantial number of the insurers authorized to transact that kind of insurance in this State will provide insurance affording substantially the same protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">In short, surplus line insurance is meant to cover risks that authorized insurers have refused to cover; it is insurance that is \u201cexported\u201d and placed with unauthorized insurers by a licensed surplus line broker. <em>See Railroad Roofing &amp; Bldg. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Financial Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>85 N.J. 384, 389, 427 A.2d 66, 68 (1981). By virtue of HRS \u00a7 431-332 (1985), \u201c[i]nsurance contracts procured as surplus line coverage from unauthorized insurers in accordance with [applicable provisions of the Hawaii Insurance Law are] fully valid and enforceable as to all parties, and [are] given recognition in all matters and respects to the same effect as like contracts issued by authorized insurers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">The Villagonzas concede Holland-America has never been licensed to transact insurance in Hawaii. But they maintain the transaction that provided Brundage Concrete Pumping, Inc. with insurance coverage in excess of the amount provided by Argonaut Insurance Company was authorized.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus in their view Holland-America was an authorized in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>surer for purposes related to the Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association Act</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">True, transactions whereby licensed surplus line brokers procure insurance from unlicensed insurers to cover risks authorized insurers are unwilling to insure are expressly provided for in HRS chapter 431 (1985). And a policy procured in accord with HRS \u00a7 431-330 (1985) is \u201cfully valid\u201d and recognized \u201cto the same effect as like contracts issued by authorized insurers.\u201d HRS \u00a7431-332(1985). Still, it does not necessarily follow that HIGA is obliged to honor claims against an insolvent surplus line insurer. For when we read HRS chapter 43ID throughout, we discern no legislative intention to have HIGA do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The legislative scheme, as we said earlier, \u201cprovide[s] a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment and to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 431D-2 (1985). HIGA is the cogwheel of this mechanism; and pursuant to HRS \u00a7 431D-8(a)(l) (1985), it is obliged to pay certain claims against insurers who become insolvent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is \u201cdeemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.\u201d HRS \u00a7431D-8(a)(2) (1985). What HIGA is duty bound to assume, therefore, are the obligations of an \u201cinsolvent insurer,\u201d which for purposes of the Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association Act \u201cmeans (A) an insurer authorized to transact insurance in this State either at the time the policy was issued or when the insured event occurred and (B) determined to be insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d HRS \u00a7431D-5(4) (1985). Holland-America, though insolvent, was never authorized to transact insurance in Hawaii; it was at all relevant times an unauthorized insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The statutory scheme is designed also \u201cto assist in the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and to provide a [means] to assess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>cost of [the] protection [afforded under the scheme] among insurers.\u201d HRS \u00a7 431D-2 (1985). The measures contemplated to accomplish these purposes, of course, can only be effective among insurers who must \u201cbe and remain members of the [Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association] as a condition of their authority to transact insurance in this State.\u201d HRS \u00a7 431D-6 (1985).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A14\"><em>Paul E. DiBianco (Adelina A. Simpliciano </em>with him on the briefs; Wagner, Watson &amp; DiBianco, of counsel) for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In order to fulfill its duties, the association is empowered to \u201c[a]ssess insurers amounts necessary to pay [the covered claims against insolvent insurers], the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, ... the cost of examinations under section 431D-13 [(1985)],<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and other expenses authorized by [chapter 431D (1985)].\u201d HRS \u00a7 431D-8(a)(3) (1985). The assessments are levied against each member insurer \u201cin the proportion that [his] net direct written premiums... for the preceding calendar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Holland-America, of course, has never been a member of the association; it has never been assessed its share of the cost of the protection afforded claimants and policyholders under HRS chapter 431D (1985). As an unauthorized insurer, Holland-America has not been subjected to regulation by the insurance commissioner; nor has it been subjected to an examination of its financial condition. <em>See supra </em>note 11. Under the circumstances, we cannot believe the legislature intended that the association would assume the liability occasioned by Holland-America\u2019s insolvency, particularly when the cost must ultimately be borne by the policyholders of authorized insurers. <em>See supra </em>note 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AA5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Kevin P.H.
