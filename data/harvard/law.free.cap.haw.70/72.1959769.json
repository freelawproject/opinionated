(Taxpayer) seeks reimbursement of accumulated unemployment insurance payments made to the state\u2019s unemployment compensation fund during January 1,1971 through December 31,1982. Taxpayer appeals the First Circuit Court\u2019s November 19,1987 Decision and Order Affirming Referee\u2019s Decision entered in favor of Appellees Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Unemployment Insurance Division (UID), Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Employment Security Appeal Referee\u2019s Office, and the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations (collectively DLIR). The circuit court affirmed the administrative referee\u2019s decision denying Taxpayer\u2019s two applications seeking self-financing status under the Hawaii Employment Security Law, HRS ch. 383. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We begin with an overview of the pertinent federal and Hawaii statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311 (I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311), imposes a federal unemployment tax on employers. At the same time, FUTA allows states to provide and administer federally approved unemployment compensation funds for the same purpose under state law. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, FUTA permits tax credits of up to ninety percent of the federal tax for contributions made by employers to the state fund. I.R.C. \u00a7 3302.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Non-profit organizations, subject to limited exceptions, are exempt from federal unemployment taxation. I.R.C. \u00a7501. In 1970, FUTA was amended (effective date January 1,1972) to require states to include nonprofit organizations in their unemployment compensation systems. This amendment allowed states to provide \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations the option of participating in an experience-rated fund or to elect reimbursement financing (self-financing) in lieu of contributions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I.R.C. \u00a7 3303(e) and (f). Simply put, rather than paying unemployment insurance based upon past experience, \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations could now elect to reimburse the unemployment insurance fund the exact amount withdrawn and paid to the organization\u2019s employees as unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">In response to the 1970 federal amendment, the Hawaii state legislature, in 1971, enacted a \u201ctransition statute,\u201d HRS \u00a7 383-62(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Act 187, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u00a7 7,1971 Haw. Sess. Laws 394, 407, to facilitate the orderly transition to the self-financing alternative system. Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 383-62(f), \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations that elected self-financing were also permitted to use their positive reserve balance<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the payment of future unemployment benefit claims. Only when the reserve balance is depleted would the organization then be required to make payments under the self-financing method.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In 1977, HRS \u00a7 383-62(f) was repealed. Act 148, \u00a7 6,1977 Haw. Sess. Laws 284, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Finally, HRS \u00a7 383-62(d)(l)(D) and (E) (1985) provide (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">(d) Benefits paid to employees of nonprofit organizations shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For the purpose of this subsection, a nonprofit organization is an organization (or groups of organizations) described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>in section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of such code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">(1) Liability for contributions and election of reimbursement. Any nonprofit organization which is, or becomes, subject to this chapter on or after January 1, 1972, shall pay contributions under the provisions of this part (with the exception of the provisions in subsection (b) of this section) applicable to other employers unless it elects, in accordance with this paragraph, to pay to the director of labor and industrial relations for the fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and of one-half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of unemployment which begin during the effective period of such election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">(D) Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this chapter for a period subsequent to January 1,1972, may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the department not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of any calendar year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next calendar year. (E) The department <em>may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, </em>or a notice of termination, <em>must be filed </em>and <em>may permit an election to be retroactive </em>but not any earlier than with respect to benefits paid after December 31,1971.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On March 11,1955, Taxpayer was incorporated as a non-profit organization. Taxpayer subsequently applied for non-profit tax status pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 501 but did not specify whether it sought status under I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4). In 1963, the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) granted Taxpayer \u00a7 501(c)(4) status retroactive to its incorporation in 1955.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Taxpayer did not challenge its \u00a7 501 (c)(4) designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In 1971, the Hawaii state legislature enacted the transition statute. In 1971, after the transition statute was enacted, Taxpayer\u2019s provider entity, Kaiser Foundation Hospital (Hospital), applied for and was granted self-financing status. Taxpayer was aware of the transition statute in 1971.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">In 1976, another health maintenance organization (individually HMO, collectively HMOs), the Georgetown Health Plan (Georgetown), unsuccessfully applied for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status. Georgetown then reapplied for \u00a7 501(c)(4) status, which the IRS granted. Soon thereafter, Georgetown reapplied for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status but that application was not acted upon by the IRS.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">In 1977, the transition statute was repealed by Act 148, Session Laws of Hawaii, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">In 1981, Taxpayer merged with Georgetown. In August 1981, Taxpayer heard rumors that the IRS would begin to rule favorably upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00a7 501(c)(3) applications from similar HMOs. Later during the same month, Taxpayer learned that the IRS had officially taken action to exempt another HMO as a \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization and had also begun to act favorably on the backlog of \u00a7 501 (c)(3) applications on file. Taxpayer then proceeded to compile the necessary documents and on September 15, 1981, filed an application for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status with the IRS.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">An IRS letter dated December 10,1981, was received by Taxpayer on December 21, 1981. The letter stated that Taxpayer was granted \u00a7 501(c)(3) status. Because no effective date was contained in the IRS letter, by letter dated December 29,1981, Taxpayer requested clarification on whether its \u00a7 501(c)(3) status was retroactive to its date of incorporation. An IRS response letter dated January 26,1982, and received by Taxpayer on February 1, 1982, stated that the IRS deemed Taxpayer\u2019s \u00a7 501(c)(3) status to be retroactive to March 11,1955, the date of its incorporation. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">With this newly recognized \u00a7 501(c)(3) status, Taxpayer was now able to elect reimbursement financing (self-financing) in lieu of contributions pursuant to HRS \u00a7 383-62(d)(l)(D). The deadline for electing self-financing rather than contributions for the calendar year 1982 was December 1,1981.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">On July 12,1982, Taxpayer submitted two applications forselffinancing status to the UID, one application with the proposed effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>date of January 1,1972,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the other application with the proposed effective date of January 1,1982. By letter dated August 10,1982, the UID denied both applications on the grounds that Taxpayer failed to timely file a written notice of election as to becoming a self-financing employer (citing HRS \u00a7 383-62(d)(l)(D)). On August 24, 1982, Taxpayer submitted to the UID a timely notice of appeal and a request for hearing on the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On January 6,1983 and on March 8,1983, hearings were held before the administrative referee (Referee Robert S. Page).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On December 12,1986, the referee issued a Decision affirming the UID\u2019s denial of Taxpayer\u2019s two applications for self-financing. <em>In re Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., </em>Referee\u2019s Decision No. 1079-82A (December 12,1986).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">On January 9,1987, Kaiser filed a timely notice of appeal to the circuit court. On September 14,1987, ahearing on Taxpayer\u2019s appeal before the circuit court was held. On November 19,1987, the circuit court entered a Decision and Order Affirming [the] Referee\u2019s Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Following a statement of the facts,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the circuit court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">1. Taxpayer cannot avail itself of former \u00a7 383-62(f) since the statute was repealed prior to [Taxpayer\u2019s] 501(c)(3) status. Thus, [Taxpayer\u2019s] July 1982 election may not be retroactive to 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">2. Taxpayer did not show \u201cgood cause\u201d to extend the notice of election period back to January 1, 1982 when it took [T]axpayer from February 1,1982 to July 12,1982 to make the election that was due no later than early December 1981. The only cause shown for the delay is the late determination by IRS of [T]axpayer\u2019s change in status, yet IRS made its position known in December 1981. Taxpayer could have filed it [sic] selection and/or asked for an extension long before July 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">3. The referee\u2019s rejection in toto of [T]axpayer\u2019s position appears to be based on the foregoing conclusions 1 and 2 and his decision is not clearly erroneous or otherwise defective under \u00a7 91-14(g), H.R.S.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Record at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Upon the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of Taxpayer\u2019s appeal, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Our starting point is the standard of review applicable to this administrative appeal. On secondary judicial review of an administrative decision, Hawaii appellate courts apply the same standard of review as that applied upon primary review by the circuit court. <em>IBEW, Local 1357 </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Tel. Co., </em>68 Haw. 316, 713 P.2d 943 (1986); <em>Kilauea Neighborhood Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Land Use Comm\u2019n, 1 </em>Haw. App. _, 751 P.2d 1031 (1988). The applicable standards of review are provided in HRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00a7 91 \u2014 14(g) (1985). Under HRS \u00a7 91-14(g)(5), an administrative agency\u2019s factual findings are presumptively correct, and cannot be set aside on appeal unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. <em>Dedman v. Board of Land &amp; Natural Resources, </em>69 Haw. _, 740 P.2d 28 (1987), <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 108 S. Ct. 1573, 99 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1988); <em>Agsalud v. Lee, </em>66 Haw. 425, 664 P.2d 734 (1983) (per curiam). However, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review is only applicable to an agency\u2019s factual findings and is not applicable to conclusions of law. <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Agsalud, </em>67 Haw. 212, 685 P.2d 794 (1984). In contrast, an agency\u2019s legal conclusions are freely reviewable upon judicial review. <em>IBEW, Local 1357 </em>v. <em>Hawaiian Tel. Co., </em>68 Haw. 316, 713 P.2d 943 (1986); <em>see also </em>HRS \u00a7 91-14(g)(4) (1985). And discretionary determinations are reviewable for abuse. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 91-14(g)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Taxpayer seeks to recoup its excess reserve balance of unemployment taxes assessed against Taxpayer from January 1,1971 through January 31,1982. Taxpayer asserts three supporting theories. These theories, in turn, involve the application of several provisions of the Hawaii Employment Security Law (HESL), HRS ch. 383: HRS \u00a7 383-62(d)(l)(D) and (E), \u00a7 383 \u2014 62(f) (repealed in 1977) and \u00a7 383-76. We now examine Taxpayer\u2019s theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">JULY 1982 APPLICATION FOR SELF-FINANCING WITH THE PROPOSED EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 1982</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">On July 12, 1982, Taxpayer submitted two applications for self-financing to the UID, one application with the proposed effective date of January 1, 1982. By letter dated August 10,1982, the UID denied both applications based on Taxpayer\u2019s failure to timely file a written notice of election pursuant to HRS \u00a7 383-62(d)(l)(D). On December 12,1986, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>administrative referee affirmed the UID\u2019s denial of Taxpayer\u2019s two applications for self-financing, citing HRS \u00a7 383-62(d)(l)(D) and (E). On judicial review, the circuit court affirmed the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The \u201cgood cause\u201d language in HRS \u00a7 383 \u2014 62(d)(1)(E) is preceded by the terms \u201c[t]he <em>department </em>may____\u201d Clearly, the determination of good cause is within the DLIR\u2019s discretion. Upon judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision before this court, the agency\u2019s discretionary determination will not be reversed in the absence of abuse. See HRS \u00a7 91 \u2014 14(g)(6). We apply this standard to the referee\u2019s decision that in the absence of good cause, Taxpayer\u2019s application for self-financing with the proposed effective date of January 1, 1982 was not timely submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Taxpayer maintains that good cause existed to extend the period upon which Taxpayer\u2019s notice of election for self-financing, effective January 1,1982, could be filed. But for the unusual treatment by the IRS, namely the timing of the IRS\u2019 initial notification (received by Taxpayer on December21,1981) that Taxpayer\u2019s request for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status was approved, Taxpayer asserts that its lack of \u00a7 501(c)(3) status to apply for self-financing until receipt of the IRS\u2019 confirmation of retroactive \u00a7 501(c)(3) status on February 1,1982 constituted good cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"A9g\">The fundamental starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>69 Haw. _, 742 P.2d 373 (1987). Where the statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, the court\u2019s only duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. <em>Hubbell v. Iseke, </em>6 Haw. App. 485, 727 P.2d 1131 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">The deadline for filing the self-financing application commencing with the calendar year 1982 was December 1,1981. While Taxpayer was not formally notified of its \u00a7 501(c)(3) status by the IRS until December 21,1981, the Taxpayer has failed to explain why it then waited until July 12,1982 to file its self-financing application. No good cause having been shown for the delay, there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the UID in concluding that the application was not timely submitted. The UID\u2019s determination was therefore validly upheld by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">We hold that Taxpayer\u2019s delay in filing its self-financing application (effective January 1,1982) from December21,1981 to July 12,1982 did not constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">JULY 1982 APPLICATION FOR SELF-FINANCING WITH THE PROPOSED EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 1972</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Taxpayer\u2019s second theory is based on its second application for self-financing submitted to the UID, with the effective date of January 1,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Taxpayer\u2019s theory is as follows. By virtue of its retroactive \u00a7 501(c)(3) status back to the date of Taxpayer\u2019s incorporation, March 11, 1955, Taxpayer seeks approval of its self-financing application (effective January 1, 1972) under good cause. Once approved, Taxpayer\u2019s self-financing status would be retroactive to January 1,1972, thereby \u201ctriggering\u201d application of the transition statute. The transition statute, in turn, would enable Taxpayer to use its existing positive reserve balance as of January 1, 1972 for the payment of any future unemployment claims. Moving forward in time, only when the entire reserve balance is depleted would Taxpayer then be required to make any reimbursable payments to the unemployment tax fund in lieu of contributions, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 383-62(d). We reject Taxpayer\u2019s \u201cchain\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\"><em>Thefoundation </em>of Taxpayer\u2019s theory that it is entitled to go back in time to recoup excess contributions payed to the unemployment insurance fund is the <em>transition statute. </em>However, the transition statute was repealed in 1977. Taxpayer did not file its second application for self-financing (effective January 1, 1972) until July 12, 1982. At that point, the transition statute pursuant to which Taxpayer sought recoupment was no longer in existence. Taxpayer, therefore, cannot avail itself of former HRS \u00a7 383-62(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Taxpayer contends that Act 148, Session Laws of Hawaii, 1977, merely \u201cdeleted\u201d the transition statute for housekeeping purposes. We disagree. In the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary, repeal means the statute or statutory provision no longer exists. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 1-7 (1985), HRS \u00a7 1-9 (1985); <em>see also Hamano </em>v. <em>Miyake, </em>24 Haw. 12 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Additionally, we note that during the period the transition statute was in existence, Taxpayer never applied for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status with the IRS even though it was aware of HRS \u00a7 383-62(f)in 1971. Instead, Tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>payer never formally applied for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status until September 15, 1981. By this time, the transition statute was repealed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Au1\"><em>Roland Q. F. Thom (Dean Y. Sugano </em>with him on the briefs; Char, Hamilton, Campbell &amp; Thom, of counsel) for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AcN\"><em>Wilfredo Tungol (Wayne A. Matsuura </em>with him on the brief), Deputy Attorneys General, for Appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Finally, \u201cgood cause\u201d was also not shown for Taxpayer\u2019s five month delay from February 1,1982, the date Taxpayer formally received confirmation of its retroactive \u00a7 501(c)(3) status, to July 12,1982, the date Taxpayer submitted its second application for self-financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We hold that Taxpayer\u2019s retroactive \u00a7 501(c)(3) status does not permit Taxpayer to avail itself of former HRS \u00a7 383-62(f).

While the IRS granted \u00a7 501(c)(4) status in these cases, the IRS did not rule on the \u00a7 501 (c)(3) status.
