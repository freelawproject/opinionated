Concluding from a review of the record that the court erred in allowing the alleged victim\u2019s teacher to relate what the child told her and to give her opinion on the veracity of the child\u2019s statements, we set aside the decree and remand the case for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The petition filed in the family court by a police officer alleged that the juvenile-appellant committed Sexual Abuse in the First Degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>between August 1 and August 4,1986 by intentionally having sexual contact with a four-year-old female child while a weekend guest of her stepbrother in her parents\u2019 home. When the petition was heard, the child could not be qualified as a witness despite the prosecuting attorney\u2019s strenuous efforts to establish competency. Thus, he relied on the testimony of the child\u2019s mother and preschool teacher to sustain the allegations of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The mother of the child testified that on Monday morning, August 4, 1985, the child asked her \u201cwhy [the juvenile-appellant was] doing exercises on me[?],\u201d indicating through her motions that what the juvenile-appellant had done were \u201cpush-ups.\u201d The mother understandably was alarmed, but felt it would be best not to have the child think \u201csomething horrible had happencd[.]\u201d She therefore asked no pointed questions about what happened. She then took the child to a pediatrician, who examined her but found no physical signs of trauma. After the examination, the mother took the child to her regular preschool class. Sticking to the child\u2019s normal routine, the mother felt, was the best course under the circumstances. She advised the preschool principal that the child might have been abused sexually during the weekend. The principal in turn apprised the child\u2019s teacher of the mother\u2019s fears and concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The child had been in the teacher\u2019s class for approximately three months so she knew the child quite well. The teacher, who had been teaching for about six years, had majored in early education and had taken a course on child abuse in college. Her testimony at the hearing included an account of what the child had related in response to a general query directed to a group of eight preschoolers about what they had done over the weekend. The teacher was allowed, over the objections of juvenile-appellant\u2019s counsel, to repeat the purported responses on the ground that they constituted spontaneous statements falling within \u201cthe \u2018excited utterance\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule[.]\u201d Among these statements was one that the juvenile-appellant had asked the child to tickle his penis. The teacher was also asked, again over counsel\u2019s objections, for \u201can opinion as to the truthfulness of what this child had told you[.]\u201d In her opinion, the child \u201cwasn\u2019t lyingf]\u201d because \u201c[i]t\u2019s not normal for a child to speak that way or to make up or imagine ... a situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The juvenile-appellant, however, denied even being in the child\u2019s room. He claimed that he had to use the bathroom adjoining her room on Saturday night, had accidentally opened the door to her room, and could have startled the child in doing so. Though he admitted playing with her and doing exercises in her presence, he denied asking the child to tickle his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">After reviewing the conflicting evidence, the family court entered a decree finding the juvenile-appellant was a law violator, placed him on probation, and ordered that he be evaluated psychologically, that he cooperate and participate in any psychiatric program or therapy arranged for him, and that he be detained for two days at the detention home on hard labor. The juvenile-appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration or in the Alternative for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The court denied reconsideration, filing its findings and conclusions instead. A timely appeal from the adjudication of delinquency was perfected thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The juvenile-appellant avers on appeal that the family court abused its discretion in admitting hearsay testimony, the admission of such testimony breached his right to confront and cross-examine his accuser, and the family court abused its discretion too in permitting the preschool teacher to give her opinion on the truthfulness of the child\u2019s out-of-court statements. We begin our analysis of these points of alleged error by reviewing the relevant teachings of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The Court has said a hearing to determine delinquency need not \u2018\u201cconform with all of the requirements of a criminal trial[;]\u2019\u201d but it has held the procedures employed \u201c\u2018must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u2019\u201d <em>In re </em>Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 30 (1967) (quoting <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 562 (1966)) (footnote omitted). For one thing, \u201cabsent a valid confession, a determination of delinquency and an order of commitment to a state institution cannot be sustained in the absence of sworn testimony subjected to the opportunity for cross-examination in accordance with our law and constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>If one were to apply <em>Gault </em>literally, it would require, on objection, the exclusion of all hearsay from a delinquency hearing. \u201cIn the hearsay situation, two \u2018witnesses\u2019 are involved. The first complies with all three of the ideal conditions for the giving of testimony[.]\u201d E.W. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 245 (3d ed. 1984). He is present at trial, under oath, and subject to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>His testimony, however, \u201cconsists of reporting what the second \u2018witness\u2019 said. The second \u2018witness\u2019 is the out-of-court declarant; his statement was not given in compliance with the ideal conditions[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though the statement \u201ccontains... information that is of concern in the case[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>its evidentiary value rests \u201cupon the credibility of the declarant without the assurances of oath, presence, or cross-examinalion[.]\u201d E.W. Cleary, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">But neither the rule against hearsay, \u201cthat most characteristic rule of ' the Anglo-American Law of Evidence[,]\u201d 5 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1364 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1974), nor \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403-405 (1965); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315 (1974),\u201d operates to bar all hearsay from trial. <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 62 (1980). \u201cThe basic rule against hearsay, of course, is riddled with exceptions developed over three centuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and footnote omitted). And the Court \u201chas recognized that competing interests, if \u2018closely examined,\u2019 <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. [284,] 295 [(1973)], may warrant dispensing with confrontation at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The relevant opinions of the Supreme Court emphasize that the clause \u201creflects a preference for face-to-face confrontation... and... \u2018a primary interest secured [thereby to the defendant] is the right of cross-examination.\u2019 <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418 (1965).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63 (footnotes omitted). At the same time, the Court acknowledges that \u201cevery jurisdiction has a strong interest in effective law enforcement, and in the development and precise formulation of the rules of evidence applicable in criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64 (citations omitted). The Court\u2019s approach to the problem of accommodating the competing interests \u201creflects the truism that \u2018hearsay rules and the... Clause are generally designed to protect similar values,\u2019 <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. [149,] 155, and \u2018stem from the same roots,\u2019 <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 86 (1970). It also responds to the need for certainty in the workaday world of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ducting criminal trials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. The circumstances, which in the Court\u2019s view, warrant dispensing with confrontation at trial are outlined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">In sum, when a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause normally requires a showing that he is unavailable. Even then, his statement is admissible only if it bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). In other words, \u201cthe Clause countenances only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that \u2018there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule.\u2019 <em>Snyder </em>v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. [97,] 107 [(1934)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The hearsay testimony in question was admitted because the family court found it fell within \u201cthe \u2018excited utterance\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule[.]\u201d Our law of evidence defines an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d as \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition!]\u201d and renders the utterance admissible at trial though it may be hearsay. Haw. R. Evid. 803(b)(2). The pertinent rule codifies \u201can exception to the hearsay rule... [that] is universally recognized.\u201d E.W. Cleary, supra, \u00a7 297. The evidence of the alleged sexual abuse furnished by the teacher, then, was admissible under the Hawaii Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause would have countenanced its admission if the out-of-court declarant\u2019s statement constituted an \u201cexcited <em>utterance.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But we do not believe it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">\u201cThe crucial element that buttresses the reliability of such [out-of-court] declarations is their spontaneity!.]\u201d <em>State v. Messamore, 2 </em>Haw. App. 643, 649, 639 P.2d 413, 418 (1982). \u2018\u201c[T]o be admitted [they] must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>be reasonably contemporaneous with the event to which they relate, i.e., they must be such as to have been proximately caused by the exciting influence of the event without opportunity for deliberation or [other] influence.\u2019\u201d <em>Shea </em>v. <em>City &amp; County, </em>67 Haw. 499, 506, 692 P.2d 1158, 1164 (1985) (quoting <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>39 Haw. 635, 640 (1953)) (citations omitted). Essentially, the time span between the event and the declaration must be short. <em>State v. Messamore, </em>2 Haw. App. at 649, 639 P.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Here, the teacher was allowed to relate what the child said about the event three hours after she first told her mother about it. By the time the teacher asked the child what she did over the weekend, it would have been nearly half a day after the event at the least. We would be hard put to say the child\u2019s statement was reasonably contemporaneous with the event even if we assumed the event occurred shortly before she spoke to her mother. Hence, we conclude the admission of the child\u2019s account of the alleged sexual abuse, as related by the teacher, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The admissibility of opinion evidence on the veracity of a witness\u2019 statement once again is brought into focus by the juvenile-appellant\u2019s remaining point of alleged error, that \u201c[t]he trial court abused its discretion in admitting [the teacher\u2019s] opinion as to the truthfulness of [the child\u2019s] statements[.]\u201d The juvenile-appellant argues the teacher\u2019s opinion was \u201cnot lay opinion permissible under [Haw R. Evid.] 701..., was not proper expert opinion under [Haw. R. Evid.] 702 and 703 ... and the standards set forth in <em>State v. Kim . </em>. ., and [constituted] improper bolstering of credibility without impeachment in violation of [Haw. R. Evid.] 608(a)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of <em>State v. Kim, </em>64 Haw. 598, 645 P.2d 1330 (1982), where the defendant was accused of having sexual intercourse with his thirteen-year-old stepdaughter. As in the case at bar, the putative victim was the sole witness to the alleged offense. When the case was tried, defense counsel succeeded in casting some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>doubt on her credibility through cross-examination. The Slate then offered the testimony of the psychiatrist who examined her shortly after the offense was reported to support her account of the event. The defendant\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s offer of proof was overruled on the ground that the cross-examination had put the witness\u2019 credibility sufficiently in question to render the proffered evidence admissible. The psychiatrist was qualified as an expert, and he gave testimony which culminated in a statement that he found the witness\u2019 account of the sexual encounter with her stepfather \u201cbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">When the case reached us on the defendant\u2019s appeal, we were, of course, troubled by the admission of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony. Yet we were \u201creluctant to categorically preclude all such testimony! because] we [felt]... that under certain circumstances expert psychiatric testimony may reveal... characteristics or conditions of the witness which may assist the [trier of fact in] assessing]... credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 645 P.2d at 1334 (citations omitted). But as we said recently in <em>State v. </em>Castro, 69 Haw. _, 756 P.2d 1033 (1988), \u201c[i]f <em>[State </em>v. <em>Kim] </em>is perceived as precedent for the allowance generally of expert testimony on credibility, the perception is erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 756 P.2d at 1044 (footnote omitted). And obviously, <em>Kim </em>does not stand for the proposition that lay testimony on credibility is generally allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Uniike the situations in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kim </em>and <em>State v. Castro, </em>the opinion evidence in this case was not adduced after the witness\u2019 credibility was attacked on cross-examination. The testimony that the child \u201cwasn\u2019t lying!]\u201d was elicited during the direct examination of a witness for the prosecution who earl ier had reported what the out-of-court declarant purportedly said; it was an attempt to bolster hearsay with lay opinion on its veracity. The prosecution has not directed us to case law supporting the admission of such evidence, and our research has uncovered no case where its introduction was approved. We conclude the family court erred when it admitted the sustaining evidence in the form of lay opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">To begin with, \u201c[o]ne general principle, operative under both case law and the Federal Rules of Evidence, [from which the Hawaii Rules of Evidence are derived,] is that in the absence of an attack upon credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>no ... evidence [supporting the witness\u2019 credibility] is allowed.\u201d E.W. Cleary, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 49 (footnote omitted). The opinions of this court and our rules of evidence reflect this general principle. <em>See Brown v. Walker, </em>24 Haw. 285, 291-92 (1918); Haw. R. Evid. 608(a). Here, there was no prior attack upon credibility \u2014 we could hardly deem an objection to the out-of-court declarant\u2019s statements as inadmissible hearsay an attack upon her credibility.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ago\"><em>SusanBarr (William C. Bagasol </em>with her on the opening brief), Deputy Public Defenders, for juvenile-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A_0\"><em>LilaB. LeDuc, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Furthermore, the prosecution does not even attempt to justify the admission of the opinion testimony as permissible under the rules of evidence. The teacher\u2019s \u201crepeated recitation in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, that she believed the child,\u201d it argues in its answering brief, \u201cwas an already determined proposition which could hardly serve to bolster the credibility of any of the witnesses.\u201d But we cannot so lightly write off the family court\u2019s error. For the procedures followed in the adjudication of a minor as a law violator \u201c\u2018must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. at 30 (quoting <em>Kent v. United States, </em>383 U.S. at 562).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The decree of the family court is vacated, and the case is remanded for a new hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> HRS \u00a7 571-11(1) (1985) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">(1) Concerning any person who is alleged to have committed an act prior to achieving eighteen years of age which would constitute a violation or attempted violation of any federal, slate, or local law or municipal ordinance.
