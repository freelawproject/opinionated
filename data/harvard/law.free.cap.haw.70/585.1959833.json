(Robert\u2019s), a motor carrier onl,y authorized to render transportation service over \u201cirregular routes\u201d between points on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, and Molokai, was conducting a \u201cregular route operation\u201d between certain points on Maui, the Public Utilities Commission (the PUC or the Commission) issued a \u201ccease and desist\u201d order against the carrier. The carrier\u2019s appeal from the decision and order was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (the ICA) for hearing and disposition. Concluding \u201cthe Decision [wasj a rule of general application which should have been but was not promulgated in accordance with the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act, HRS chapter 91 (1985)[,]\u201d the ICA set aside the decision and order. ShorclineTransportation, Inc. (Shoreline), who instigated the PUC action by filing a complaint against Robert\u2019s, applied for a writ of certiorari. We granted the writ in order to examine the often vexing question of whether an administrative agency must follow rulemaking or adjudicatory procedures in the circumstances. A review of the record and the applicable law confirming that the PUC properly engaged in adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>tion in the situation at hand and committed no error in issuing its decision and order, we reverse the ICA.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Shoreline is the holder of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN or certificate) issued by the PUC; it is authorized thereby to transport passengers by motor vehicle \u201cOver Regular Routes On a Scheduled Basis Between Kapalua and Wailca and Intermediate Points On the Island of Maui.\u201d Robert\u2019s is also certified by the PUC to transport passengers by motor vehicle; its certificate authorizes the transportation of passengers \u201cOver Irregular Routes Between Points on the Islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, and Molokai.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Shoreline filed a complaint with the Commission on March 18, 1986, alleging \u201cRobert\u2019s has been and is transporting public passengers in an illegal regular route scheduled bus service between various points in the West Maui area (and also between points in the West Maui area and the Maalaea to Kihci to Wailea area) without proper authorization from [the] Commission.\u201d Attached to the complaint were \u201ccopies of Robert\u2019s published schedule of its scheduled regular route bus operations which were posted in public places in West Maui.\u201d Shoreline prayed that Robert\u2019s \u201cbe immediately ordered to cease and desist all scheduled regular route or \u2018shuttle\u2019 services ... in the West Maui area[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Following its Rules of Practice and Procedure, the Commission issued an \u201cOrder [directing Robert\u2019s] to Satisfy or Answer Complaint\u201d within ten days. Robert\u2019s responded by denying the material allegations of the complaint. It then moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that Shoreline \u201cerroneously allcge[d]... Robert\u2019s [did] not possess authority to run a regularly scheduled bus service in the Kihei and West Maui areas\u201d and \u201cRobert\u2019s shuttle service started on December 16,1984.\u201d Attached to the pleading were copies of six documents purportedly demonstrating that Robert\u2019s had been operating a regularly scheduled \u201cshuttle\u201d service between points on Maui.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">What was attached to the pleading were copies of documents submitted to the Commission by the Western Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc., a rate-making organization to which Shoreline and Robert\u2019s belonged, as proposed revisions of the bureau\u2019s published \u201cLocal and Proportional Passenger and Tour Tariff 8-B.\u201d All were entitled \u201cScheduled and Regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Route Daily Bus Service on the Island of Maui.\u201d Four were further designated as \u201cOnly for the account of Shoreline Transportation, Inc. (Except as shown),\u201d and two were designated as \u201cOnly for the account of Robert\u2019s Tours and Transportation, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Robert\u2019s claim that its \u201cshuttle service started on December 16, 1984\u201d was premised on the tariff revision submitted on November 14, 1984 and effective from December 16, 1984 \u201c[o]nly for the account of Shoreline... (Except as shown).\u201d The document indicated that Shoreline provided a daily bus service between Kapalua, Wailea, and intermediate points, with fixed departure times. There was a notation thereon slating a portion of Shoreline\u2019s schedule \u201c[a]lso applie[d] as a shuttle via Robert\u2019s Tours and Transportation, Inc.\u201d There were similar notations on the other schedules submitted \u201cfor the account of Shoreline.\u201d The tariff revision. submitted on March 7,1986 \u201cOnly for the account of Robert\u2019s Tours and Transportation, Inc.\u201d showed a daily schedule of departures from fixed points and applicable fares. That submitted on Robert\u2019s behalf on March 19,1986 showed routings from fixed points and fares, but the departure times were deleted. \u201cTime schedules,\u201d the document stated, were \u201cavailable at [the] carrier\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Shoreline responded with a memorandum in opposition and a motion of its own to dismiss Robert\u2019s motion. Observing no dispute on the material facts, the commission treated the motions as pleas for summary judgment. After hearing argument, the commission \u201cconcluded\u201d that \u201cRobert\u2019s published tariffs... and its daily fixed time schedule... demonstrate that Robert\u2019s is conducting an operation from Kapalua to Maui Plantation as a regular route operation because it is daily, systematic, scheduled, premeditated, service.\u201d Robert\u2019s, the commission further found, had \u201cflagged in\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Shoreline\u2019s routes and time schedules \u201cwithout coming before the commission.\u201d And it concluded \u201cthat since Robert\u2019s [had] not applied for nor received any authorization... to operate <em>on a regular route basis </em>to those points stated in 2nd Revised Page 93-A [of\u2018Localand Proportional PassengerandTourTariff8-B\u2019] and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Waikapu, Wailuku and Kahalui, [Robert\u2019s was] operating beyond the scope of the operating authority granted by the Commission.\u201d The commission ordered Robert\u2019s to \u201ccease and desist. . . from conducting any regular route operation\u201d and ordered the Western Motor Tariff Bureau to \u201cfile an appropriate tariff cancelling\u201d those parts of revised Tariff 8-B referring to Robert\u2019s regular route operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Robert\u2019s moved for reconsideration of the decision and order, maintaining it was entitled to present evidence of \u201cwhat it believes constitutes an irregular route operation as opposed to a regular route operation.\u201d The commission stayed enforcement of the order, and after hearing argument, granted the request for an evidentiary hearing. The day before the scheduled hearing date, however, Robert\u2019s moved to continue the hearing \u201cuntil the Commission has determined the scope of an \u2018irregular route\u2019 CPCN during a rule making proceeding in which all carriers who hold such CPCNs have had notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d The motion was denied, and the hearing was conducted as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The hearing yielded nothing in the way of evidence controverting the complaint that Robert\u2019s was operating a \u201cregular route scheduled bus service between various points in the West Maui area.\u201d If anything, it served to confirm Shoreline\u2019s claim regarding Robert\u2019s operations. For example, Robert\u2019s counsel questioned the carrier\u2019s executive vice-president about his understanding of the operating authority granted by the commission. The relevant colloquy reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">Q According to what Robert\u2019s practice has been, under this irregular route authority are you authorized to perform a shuttle service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">Q What is your understanding or the definition, your definition of a shuttle service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">A Transporting people from Point A to Point B on a regular basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">Q And when you say on a regular basis, would dial be on a scheduled basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">A Thai\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">Q Under your understanding of irregular route authority, is Robert\u2019s allowed to on a scheduled basis between more than 2 or 3 points?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>A Well, my understanding as far as the difference between regular and irregular has been that the irregular-, the irregular certificate holders were unrestricted and the regular routes were restricted as to ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">He went on to describe Robert\u2019s scheduled service between Lahaina, Kaanapali, and Maui Plantation; the description is recorded in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Q Let\u2019s turn now to the Kaanapali shuttle and to Exhibit 201. 201 is toward the very end of the packet. Mr. Iwamolo, could you tell the Commission what Exhibit 201 is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">A It\u2019s a copy of our schedule that the shuttle operates between Lahaina and Kaanapali and Maui Plantation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">Q Now would you describe for the Commission how that shuttle operates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">A Well, if you look towards the bottom part, where it says Lahaina wharf to Kaanapali, we pick up at 8:10 in the morning at the wharf in Lahaina, taking people out to Kaanapali; and then if you notice at 8:25 from the Royal Lahaina to Lahaina Town, we start at the Royal Lahaina at 8:25 and if you look beneath there under the Kaanapali stops, it says, depending on what hotel you\u2019re at or what property you\u2019re at, how many minutes to add to the listed lime and that\u2019s approximately what time we\u2019re at these pickup[s]; and then from Kaanapali, we get into Lahaina Town.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The commission found \u201cno facts, reasons, or authorities presented by Robert\u2019s\u201d to cause an amendment of the previous decision and order. It concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">that Robert\u2019s shuttle operation as shown in its Tariff 8-B, 1st Revised Page 93-A is a regular route operation and Robert\u2019s does not possess a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the service being provided. To operate as an irregular route operator in a given territorial area, Robert\u2019s must be bound to an operation that is indiscriminate, coincidental, nonscheduled, and unperiodical service. On the other hand, Shoreline has to run over its routes and maintain its schedule even if there are no passengers on the run because it requested such a-service \u2014 clearly Robert\u2019s has not requested such an operation nor has it been given the authority to provide such a service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The Commission, therefore, lifted the stay of enforcement and ordered Robert\u2019s and the Western Motor Tariff Bureau to comply with its dec ision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Robert\u2019s appealed, and the appeal was heard by the ICA. The appellate court issued a memorandum opinion invalidating the PUC\u2019s decision and order. The decision, the court said, was a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 91-1(4), and the PUC should have followed the rulemaking rather than the adjudicatory procedures outlined in the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act in deciding the controversy between Shoreline and Robert\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We begin our review of the ICA\u2019s ruling with a brief look at the difference between the rulemaking and adjudicatory functions of administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\u201cRulemaking is the process by which an agency lays down new prescriptions to govern the future conduct of those subject to its authority; adjudication is the process by which the agency applies either law or policy, or both, to the facts of a particular case.\u201d B. Schwartz, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 4.15, at 190 (2d ed. 1984). Rulemaking \u201cis essentially legislative in nature, not only because it operates in the future, but also because it is concerned largely with considerations of policy.\u201d Ginnanc, <em>\u201cRule Making\u201d \u201cAdjudication </em>\u201d <em>and Exemptions Under the Administrative Procedure Act, </em>95 U. Pa. L. Rev. 621, 630 (1947). \u201cAdjudication, conversely, is concerned with the determination of past and present rights and liabilities. Typically, there is involved a determination as to whether past conduct was unlawful, so that the proceeding is characterized by an accusatory flavor and may result in disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">But \u201c[t]he line between these two functions is not always a clear one and in fact the two functions merge at many points.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 770 (1969) (Black, J., concurring).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">For example, in exercising its quasi-judicial function an agency must frequently decide controversies on the basis of new doctrines, not theretofore applied to a specific problem, though drawn to be sure from broader principles reflecting the purposes of the statutes involved and from the rules invoked in dealing with related problems. If the agency decision reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>under the adjudicatory power becomes a precedent, it guides future conduct in much the same way as though it were a new rule promulgated under the rule-making power, and both an adjudicatory order and a formal \u201crule\u201d are alike subject to judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 770-71. Mr. Justice Black characterized these powers as \u201cseparate but almost inseparably related powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The PUC exercises such powers by virtue of HRS \u00a7 271-9; it is empowered thereby \u201c[t]o administer, execute, and enforce [the Hawaii Motor Carrier Law], to make all necessary orders in connection therewith, and to prescribe rules, regulations, and procedures for the administration.\u201d HRS \u00a7 271 \u2014 9(a)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether it engages in rulemaking or adjudication, it must do so, of course, in accord with pertinent provisions of. the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA), HRS chapter 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">HRS \u00a7 91-1(4) defines a \u201crule\u201d as \u201ceach agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes the organization, proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>dure, or practice requirements of any agency.\u201d The definition follows closely the meaning given the term by the federal Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIf the words \u2018or particular\u2019 [therein] are literally applied, almost every [administrative] process . . . becomes rulemaking.\u201d 2 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 7:3, at 10 (2d ed. 1979). For example, \u201can order of [a regulatory agency] requiring a [regulated ] company to cease and desist from a practice... fits perfectly the... definition of \u2018rule.\u2019 Yet [the] order is still regarded as an \u2018order.\u2019 And the... proceeding leading to it is regarded as an adjudication.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">When we had occasion earlier to consider the meaning of \u201crule\u201d as defined by HRS \u00a7 91-1(4), we voiced agreement with Professor Davis that a literal application of the words \u201cor particular\u201d therein \u201cwould rob provisions of (HAPA) relating to \u2018adjudication\u2019 of virtually all meaning.\u201d <em>Aguiar </em>v. <em>Hawaii Hous. Auth., </em>55 Haw. 478, 485-86 n.13, 522 P.2d 1255, 1261 n.13 (1974) (quoting 1 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 5.02, at 295 (1958)). \u201cFor this reason,\u201d we said, \u201cthe use of the words \u2018or particular\u2019 in [HRS \u00a7 91-1(4)] probably does not significantly change the basic understanding of the distinction between rulemaking and adjudication held prior to the adoption of the [Administrative Procedure] Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486 n.13, 522 P.2d at 1261 n.13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We are convinced from a review of the record that the PUC was correct in following adjudicatory procedures here, though its decision and order also could be characterized as an \u201cagency statement of general or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>particular applicability and future effect that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy.\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-1(4). For our \u201cbasic understanding of the distinction between rulemaking and adjudication\u201d tells us the resolution of the controversy between Shoreline and Robert\u2019s called for the employment of quasi-judicial rather than quasi-legislative procedures. <em>Aguiar v. Hawaii Hous. Auth., </em>55 Haw. at 486 n.13, 572 P.2d at 1261 n.13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">To begin, Shoreline and Robert\u2019s are common carriers by motor vehicle. A \u201ccommon carrier by motor vehicle [cannot] engage in operations. on any public highway in this State, unless there is in force with respect to such carrier a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the public utilities commission authorizing such operations.\u201d HRS \u00a7 271-12(a). \u201cAny certificate covering the transportation of passengers [specifies] the service to be rendered and the routes over which, the fixed termini, if any, between which, and the intermediate and off-route points, if any, at which the motor carrier is authorized to opcrate[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 271-12(d). The exercise of the privileges granted by a certificate is also subject to \u201csuch reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations as the public convenience and necessity may from time to time require].]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Shoreline is the only carrier authorized to transport passengers \u201cOver Regular Routes On a Scheduled Basis Between Kapalua and Wailea and Intermediate Points On the Island of Maui.\u201d As we noted, Robert\u2019s is only authorized to transport passengers \u201cOver Irregular Routes Between Points on the Islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, and Molokai.\u201d In the complaint lodged with the commission Shoreline charged Robert\u2019s was operating a \u201cregular route scheduled bus service... without proper authorization,\u201d thereby causing substantial financial harm to the authorized regular route carrier. The disposition of the complaint thus entailed a \u201cdetermination of past and present rights and liabilities\u201d of the two carriers; it \u201cinvolved a determination as to whether [Robert\u2019s] past conduct was unlawful, so that the proceeding [was] characterized by an accusatory flavor [and] resulted] in disciplinary action.\u201d Ginnane, <em>supra, </em>at 630-31. The proceeding, therefore, was one \u201cin which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties [were] required by law to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>determined after an opportunity for agency hearingl,]\u201d in other words, a \u201c[cjontested case\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 91-1(5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Robert\u2019s, however, urges the decision and order in question is nonetheless a \u201crule\u201d because it applies generally to \u201cthe entire class of irregular route carriers,\u201d has \u201cfuture effect,\u201d and \u201cnecessarily \u2018implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy,\u2019 in that it goes beyond what is contained in \u00a7 271-12(d) H.R.S. by creating classifications of passenger carriers.\u201d We do not agree; for the accusatory proceeding called for a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing, and it involved a determination on whether or not Robert\u2019s had been operating in a manner only Shoreline had been authorized to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Shoreline\u2019s authority was spelled out in its certificate to cover the transportation of passengers by motor vehicle \u201cOn Regular Routes On a Scheduled Basis Between Kapalua and Wailea and Intermediate Points on the Island of Maui.\u201d We fail to see why an adjudication of its rights thereunder could not proceed without rulemaking. And the PUC\u2019s decision \u201cthat Robert\u2019s shuttle operation as shown in its Tariff 8-B, 1st Revised Page 93-A is a regular route operation\u201d cannot be faulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The memorandum opinion of the Intermediate Court of Appeals is vacated, and the decision and order of the Public Utilities Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Wilbur K.
