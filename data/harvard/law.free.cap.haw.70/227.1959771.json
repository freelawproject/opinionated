Theexamining physicians had all testified that the Victim had died of deliberately inflicted abdominal injuries plus had exhibited symptoms of repeated child abuse. Greyson raises as prejudicial, reversible errors Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Emlyn Higa\u2019s (Higa) improper 1) opening statement references to alleged past instances of child abuse (suffocating the Victim) without a good faith belief that such evidence would be adduced at trial; and 2) use of a confidential 1984 presentence report for impeachment. We agree that the latter point constituted reversible error, vacate the judgment of conviction, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The preliminary facts are not controverted. On February 16,1983 at about 4:00 p.m., Greyson and his wife Maria Greyson (Maria) sought medical care for the seven month-old Victim. The examining physicians discovered the Victim had a swollen abdomen, bruises all over his body, scars, a bruised and lacerated scalp with a bizarre haircut, ruptured intestines, plus a fractured pancreas. Although emergency surgery was performed, the Victim died of his internal injuries on February 17,1983. A subsequent autopsy indicated that death was caused by blunt abdominal trauma, multiple abdominal trauma, and chronic child abuse. Despite that the suspicious injuries had happened while the Victim was inGreyson\u2019s care, Greyson insisted that the Victim had been hurt after falling onto a Rubik\u2019s Cube toy. Significantly, though, Maria had serious psychological problems, could not remember important events, and sometimes displayed unusual behavior (she gave the Victim the strange haircut).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">On November 23, 1983, Greyson was indicted for murder. A conviction later resulted on November 16, 1984, and he appealed. We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>versed and remanded the case, however, because the trial court had incorrectly prevented the defense from cross-examining Maria about potentially incriminating admissions made to her psychologist. <em>State v. </em>Greyson, No. 10367 (Haw. Oct. 1, 1986) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Maria, who had returned to her native Bolivia, did not testify at the retrial. By this time, moreover, Greyson had changed his story about the Victim\u2019s injuries and instead claimed to have accidentally stepped on the infant who had been placed on the floor to sleep. The trial court later declared a mistrial on May 5,1987 after the jury could not reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Just prior to the beginning of the third trial on October 26,1987, a dispute arose 1) whether Maria would return to Hawaii to testify; and 2) whether the prosecution could refer to her earlier statements describing Greyson\u2019s abusive behavior if she was unavailable. Although defense, counsel Jonathan Ezer (Ezer) on October 27,1987 reported that Maria\u2019s family would not allow her to travel, Higa said that State would bring her from Bolivia. Yet on the morning of October 29,1987, Ezer 1) asserted that Maria had told him on October 27, 1987 she would not be coming; and 2) requested that Higa\u2019s opening statement refrain from referring to Maria\u2019s prior claims that Greyson had sometimes quieted the Victim by suffocating the crying child. Higa assured that only the funding for Maria\u2019s trip had to be finalized, but later that day discovered that Maria would not appear, and obtained a trial recess to determine if Greyson had influenced her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">On November 3, 1987, Higa stated that 1) Greyson had not pressured Maria; 2) Maria\u2019s Bolivia lawyer, who had planned to accompany her to Hawaii, had a scheduling conflict; but 3) travel arrangements would be made as soon as the problem was resolved. Maria, though, never arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">During opening statements, Higa said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">While Maria was in the Day Hospital, Eric was alone with the defendant in their apartment, and while she was in Day Hospital, Eric suffered a variety of injuries. These included bruises, a cut lip, a large first and second degree burn, a circular burn on Eric\u2019s belly, and a skull fracture at the back of Eric\u2019s head. The defendant also apparently had a practice at times of suffocating Eric to stop him from crying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">Sometimes when Eric cried and could not be quieted in the usual manner \u2014 checking the diapers or feeding him or walking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>him around \u2014 defendant took him into the bathroom and closed the door. And he would remain in there perhaps for about five minutes, and when he came out, Eric wouldn\u2019t be crying any more. He would look dazed, but he would be very quiet and very still, and there would be red marks on his cheeks and chin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">What the defendant was doing, of course, was putting his hands over the nose and mouth of Eric while they were in the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Transcript of November 3,1987 at 17-18. Overruling Ezer\u2019s objections, the trial court nevertheless instructed Higa to 1) stop being conclusory; and 2) instead tell the jury that evidence or testimony would be presented about the child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">During the later questioning of former medical examiner Dr. Charles Odom (who had performed the autopsy on the Victim), Higa attempted to elicit an expert opinion about the supposed suffocation, but the dial court ruled that the reliance on Maria\u2019s account was improper under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 703.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">At the close of prosecution\u2019s case on November 9, 1987, Ezer sought a mistrial because of the prejudicial references to Greyson\u2019s acts of suffocation since Maria had not testified about her statements. The trial court denied the request noting that Ezer had made no timely demand for a mistrial or a curative jury instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">After Greyson had taken the stand, Ezer protested Higa\u2019s efforts to bring up the suffocation incidents by the prejudicial use of Greyson\u2019scon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>fidential presentence report. The trial court, however, allowed Higa to proceed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">Q (By Mr. Higa) Mr. Greyson, I\u2019m handing you a document [the presentence report] and if you read the area that I have indicated to yourself and let me know when you\u2019re done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">A Yes, I remember writing this about four years ago now. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">Q On October 10,1984, you had written that you would bring Eric into the bathroom to quiet him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">A Yes, I would walk around the apartment and as I \u2014 as I recollect now, I would walk into the bathroom area and since there was no light \u2014 windows in that area of the apartment, he would calm down quicker in the subdued \u2014 subdued at \u2014 lighting of the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">Q Excuse me, to quiet Eric, to pacify him when he\u2019s crying and in a cranky mood. In order to pacify him in that short period of time, just a few minutes, are you saying that all you did was rock him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">A Yes, rock him gently and pat him on the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">Q (By Mr. Higa) Mr. Greyson, wasn\u2019t it the case that in order to get Eric quiet when he was in that condition and in such a brief period of time and in the bathroom, that <em>the method that you used </em>tras <em>putting your hands over his mouth and nose suffocating him until he was unconscious or semi-conscious </em>and that that\u2019s why there were red marks on his cheek and chin, when he came out of the bathroom, after one of these sessions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Transcript of November 9,1987, November 10,1987, and November 12, 1987, vol. II at 268-69,272 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">On November 17,1987, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The conviction was entered, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">But later at the hearing on the motion for release on bail pending appeal, Higa revealed that State could not transport Maria to Hawaii because her attorney had refused to accompany her unless a $10,000 fee was paid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Ezer argued that this surprise disclosure demonstrated State never had a good faith belief about producing Maria for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">QUESTION PRESENTED<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The following issue is dispositive of this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Whether the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the use of the presentence report? YES.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">We thus decline to address the other issues posed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">USE OF THE 1984 PRESENTENCE REPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Greyson advances that the use of his 1984 presentence report 1) improperly impeached his credibility; and 2) violated HRS \u00a7 806-73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> State responds that Higa 1) correctly utilized the report only to refresh Greyson\u2019s recollection; and 2) neither the nature of the document nor any private information was divulged to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Although the trial court normally possesses the wide discretion to admit evidence and to allow questioning, <em>State </em>v. Estrada, 69 Haw. _, 738 P.2d 812 (1987), the trial court cannot disregard a statutory prohibition against the use of certain information. <em>State </em>v. <em>Domingo, </em>69 Haw. _, 733 P.2d 690 (1987); <em>see State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>69 Haw. _, 756 P.2d 1033 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">HRS \u00a7 806-73 reads in relevant part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">Duties and powers of probation officers; adult probation records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\"><em>All records of the State of Hawaii adult probation divisions are confidential and are not public records, including but not limited to, all records made by any adult probation officer in the course of performing official duties', </em>provided that such records, or the content of such records, shall be divulged only as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">(1) A copy of any adult probation division case record or of a portion of it, or the case record itself, shall upon request be provided to an adult probation officer of the State of Hawaii adult probation division which originated the record; provided that a written summary of the record may be provided upon request to an adult probation officer of another State of Hawaii adult probation division or to an adult probation officer of a probation department of another state which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>is providing supervision of a probationer convicted and sentenced by the courts of Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">(2) A copy of a presentence report shall be provided to the persons or entities named in section 706-604; to the Hawaii paroling authority; to any psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health practitioner who is treating the defendant pursuant to a court order for mental health care; in accordance with applicable law, to persons or entities doing research; to any adult probation officer providing supervision of an offender in Hawaii; or to any adult probation officer providing supervision of an offender in another state if the offender was convicted and sentenced in the courts of Hawaii. <em>Any persons or entities not entitled pursuant to this section or pursuant to section 706-604 to receive a copy of a presentence report are not entitled to receive a summary of a report and are not entitled to view a report.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">HRS \u00a7 706-604 (1985 and Supp. 1987) thus permits only the above-mentioned parties as well as the courts, the defendant, the defense counsel, and the custodial institution (the Department of Social Services and Housing, the Department of Corrections, or the confining private facility) use of the confidential presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Clearly, Higa should not have employed the report for purposes not contemplated by HRS \u00a7 806-73. <em>See, e.g., State v. Fields, </em>67 Haw. 268, 686 P.2d 1379 (1984). Greyson\u2019s credibility was adversely affected when he was shown to have either forgotten taking the Victim into the bathroom or to have been deceitfully concealing the facts concerning the heinous acts of child abuse. <em>See, e.g., In re John Doe, </em>70 Haw. _, 761 P.2d 299 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The unlawful use of the presentence report seriously undermined Greyson\u2019s entire defense. Given the conflicting versions of the Victim\u2019s death, that Greyson was the only eyewitness, the inflammatory charges, and that the case was close (as evidenced by the previous hung jury in the second trial), we cannot say that the violation of HRS \u00a7 806-73 was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Wideman, </em>69 Haw. _, 739 P.2d 931 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>We acknowledge that certain evidentiary rules allow the limited use of an accused\u2019s prior statements in particular situations. <em>See </em>HRE Rules 612 and 613.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 806-73, though, is the more narrow authority. Where a plainly irreconcilable conflict exists between a law of general application and law of specific application concerning the same subject matter, the specific authority will be favored. <em>State v. Spencer, </em>68 Haw. 622, 725 P.2d 799 (1986).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AG9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>Jonathan Ezer (Alvin T.

Politano, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for PlaintiffAppellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>70 Haw. ___, 760 P.2d 670 (1988).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> This statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">Murder. (1) Except as provided in section 707-702, a person commits the offense of murder if he intentionally or knowingly causes the death of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\">(2) Murder is a class A felony for which the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment as provided in section 706-606.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\">This rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">Bases of opinion testimony by experts.

The court may, however, disallow testimony in the form of an opinion or inference if the underlying facts or data indicate lack of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-13\"> We admonish all counsel to promptly assert motions for a mistrial or for curative jury instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Senteno, </em>69 Haw. _, 742 P.2d 369 (1987). We strongly disapprove of gambling on the outcome of the trial or on further developments in the case before complaining about the allegedly prejudicial errors. <em>State </em>v. <em>LaRue, </em>68 Haw. 575, 722 P.2d 1039 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-13\">The opening statement merely provides the opportunity to advise and outline for the jury the facts and questions to be posed during the trial but is not evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>64 Haw. 363, 641 P.2d 320 (1982). Yet, aprosecutor is obliged not to advance arguments designed to prejudice the accused. <em>See State v. Marsh, </em>68 Haw. 659, 728 P.2d 1301 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">Here, the circumstances surrounding Maria\u2019s availability to testify are suspicious. Trial had begun, and Higa was still unable to obtain her presence because of her family\u2019s opposition, her own reluctance to travel, plus the difficulties with her Bolivia attorney. Higa\u2019s late explanation about the $10,000 demanded fee, moreover, raises the strong inference that State lacked a genuine good-faith belief that Maria would take the stand. <em>See State v. White, </em>65 Haw. 286, 651 P.2d 470 (1982) (per curiam). Higa\u2019s overzealousness to convict Greyson by the questionable use of the suffocation incidents, although Maria was likely not going to testify, was not <em>de minimis. See State v. Johnson, </em>3 Haw. App. 472, 653 P.2d 428 (1982). We condemn such overreaching but do not determine if this conduct amounted to reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b264-15\">The defense\u2019s statement of the case section violates Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(3) by not fully reciting the incriminating ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>pert medical testimony by the examining physicians. <em>See </em>Opening Brief at 9-13. There is no excuse for these omissions. <em>See State v. Hanawahine, </em>69 Haw. _, 755 P.2d 466 (1988).
