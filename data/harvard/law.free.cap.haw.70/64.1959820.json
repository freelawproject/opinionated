Concluding that residential lots leased for terms of less than twenty years should be excluded in determining whether or not a \u201cdevelopment tract\u201d is subject to condemnation under the Land Reform Act and that the Kualoa Beach Lots therefore did not constitute a condemnable tract of land, the circuit court granted Kualoa Ranch\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Sugais, the only plaintiffs remaining as appellants, aver the court \u201cerred in concluding that as a matter of law, the Kualoa Beach Lots do not constitute a \u2018development tract\u2019 within the meaning of Section 516-1(2) H.R.S.\u201d Finding no error, we affirm the order granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The Kualoa Beach Lots are thirty-three lots strung out along the ocean side of Kamehameha Highway in Kualoa, Oahu; they are owned in fee by Kualoa Ranch, and twenty-seven of the lots are leased to others for residential purposes. Mr. and Mrs. Sugai and the eight other persons who brought the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief are the lessees of six of the residential lots. The controversy at bar began with their applications to the Hawaii Housing Authority (HHA) seeking an acquisition by the agency of the leased fee interests in the residential lots through the exercise of the power of eminent domain for eventual purchase by the lessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>From the outset, HHA doubted that it could designate all or a portion of the Kualoa Beach Lots for acquisition as requested. The doubt centered on the size of the \u201cdevelopment tract\u201d in which the fee interests could be designated for acquisition pursuant to HRS \u00a7 516-22. It arose because HRS \u00a7 516-1(2) (Supp. 1987) defines \u201cdevelopment tract\u201d as \u201ca single contiguous area of real property not less than five acres in size which has been developed and subdivided into residential lot[s] ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the leased residential lots were aggregated for the purpose of determining whether the tract met this criterion or not, the land therein, as indicated by the descriptions in recorded documents, added up to only 4.713 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">This setback, however, did not cause the lessees to abandon their efforts to become the owners in fee of the residential lots they leased. Aware that the shoreline boundaries of the lots were shifting boundaries affected by tides and other natural forces, they employed a surveyor to determine just where the lines were at the moment. His \u201csurvey of the shoreline affecting the leased Kualoa Beach Lots\u201d resulted in a calculation that there were 5.002 acres in the tract that the lessees proposed be condemned by HHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The new information and supporting survey data were submitted to HHA, but the agency still was not convinced that the Kualoa Beach Lots were suitable for acquisition. It concluded \u201cthere are several leased lots in the ... [subdivision which do not meet the criteria for conversion under the provisions of [cjhapter 516...\u201d because they \u201care under 19-1/2 year leases... and therefore, cannot be considered in determining the minimum acreage requirements for designation of a development tract for conversion....\u201d The agency advised the lessees\u2019 attorney that it would \u201cnot pursue the proposed designation of Kualoa Beach Lots as a development tract for condemnation purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The Sugais and eight other lessees filed their complaint against HHA and Kualoa Ranch in the circuit court shortly thereafter. But even before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>HHA filed its responsive pleading, three of the plaintiffs were dismissed by stipulation from the suit. After HHA\u2019s answer was filed, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment and Kualoa Ranch countered with its motion seeking dismissal of the action or a summary judgment. HFDC, which by then had been substituted in place of HHA as a defendant, joined in Kualoa Ranch\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The agency, in its memorandum in opposition to the Sugais\u2019 motion for summary judgment, reiterated what the lessees were told earlier. But its stance now was also that six of the thirty-three Kualoa Beach Lots were \u201cbeach access lots that have always been owned in fee simple by Kualoa Ranch ... and thus cannot be included in the calculation of the five acre requirement [for convertibility of a tract from leasehold to fee ownership under the Land Reform Act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The circuit court heard argument, considered the memoranda and other documents submitted by the parties, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(1) the term \u201cresidential lots\u201d as used in section 516-1(2), Hawaii Revised Statutes, as amended, is given the meaning which the Attorney General has determined in the Opinion of the Attorney General No. 85-16 (Aug. 9, 1985) and, accordingly, lots subject to leases with terms less than twenty (20) years are excludable in determining the scope of a development tract; and (2) as a matter of law, the Kualoa Beach Lots do not constitute a \u201cdevelopment tract\u201d since the Kualoa Beach Lots are not five (5) acres of properly developed and subdivided into residential lots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">It therefore granted \u201cKualoa Ranch, Inc.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, as joined in by Housing Finance and Development Corporation[.]\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Sugai and two other plaintiffs appealed from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">The Sugais, the only appellants still pursuing the appeal from the circuit court, argue \u201c[l]he Circuit Court\u2019s construction of the term \u2018residential lots\u2019 contradicts the plain meaning of the definition for the term found in \u00a7 516-1(11) H.R.S. and [lacks] support in the statutory schcmc[,]\u201d its \u201cconclusion that lots with a lease term shorter than twenty years must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>excluded [in] calculating the area of a \u2018development tract\u2019 is contradicted by the language of the statute,\u201d and these readings are inconsistent with the legislative purpose for the enactment of the Land Reform Act and unjust But we conclude the circuit court\u2019s interpretation and application of the relevant provisions are consistent with the statutory scheme and its objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The Hawaii Land Reform Act represents an ambitious legislative effort to remedy the problems stemming from the \u201cdisproportional concentration of land ownership\u201d in Hawaii. <em>Hawaii Hous. Auth. v. Lyman, </em>68 Haw. 55, 63, 704 P.2d 888, 893 (1985). Its stated purposes are \u201cto increase the availability, alienability and turnover of single family residential lots, spread ownership of fees simple, disperse the oligopolistic market power of the large landowners, and stabilize land prices, inflation, and the state\u2019s economy by containing the cost of living and the cost of public assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 704 P.2d at 893 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">To achieve these ends, the legislature \u201ccreated a mechanism for condemning residential tracts and for transferring ownership of the condemned fees simple to existing lessees.\u201d <em>Hawaii Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Midkiff, </em>467 U.S. 229, 233 (1984). Yet it is axiomatic that \u201cone person\u2019s property may not be taken for the benefit of another private person without a justifying public purpose,\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Consolidated Gas Corp., </em>300 U.S. 55, 80 (1937), and the exercise of the eminent domain power established by the Act, of course, must be fully consistent with its public purposes. <em>Hawaii Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Midkiff, </em>467 U.S. at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u201cUnder the Act\u2019s condemnation scheme, any [eligible tenant]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of a single family houselot of no more than two acres within a development tract of at least five acres [is entitled to request a condemnation of] the underlying fee interest\u201d <em>Hawaii Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>68 Haw. at 64, 704 P.2d at 893. \u201cWhen twenty-five eligible tenants or lessees of half of the lots in the tract file appropriate applications, the [HFDC], after public notice and hearing, may designate some or all of the lots in the tract for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>acquisition by eminent domain... if it finds that the acquisition will effectuate the public purposes of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 704 P.2d at 894 (citation omitted). The Sugais and the other lessees of the beach lots at Kualoa, however, could not convince HFDC\u2019s predecessor that their applications were appropriate for agency action. And for good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Legislation establishing the condemnation scheme was prompted in part by a finding that there was \u201ca concentration of land ownership in the State in the hands of a few landowners who have refused to sell the fee simple titles to their lands and who have instead engaged in the practice of leasing their lands under long-term leases[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 516-83(a)(l) (1985). The eminent domain power granted the agency by HRS \u00a7516-22 (1985), therefore, is tailored to be used where long-term leases have been imposed upon leaseholders in a sizable development tract</p>\n<p id=\"A4rU\">As we noted earlier, HFDC</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">may designate all or a portion of a development tract for acquisition and acquire leased fee interests in residential houselots in such development tract, through the exercise of the power of eminent domain or by purchase under the threat of eminent domain after twenty-five or more lessees or the lessees of more than fifty per cent of the residential lease lots within the development tract, whichever number is the lesser, have applied to the authority to purchase the leased fee interest in their residential leasehold lots....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">HRS \u00a7 516-22. Where the legislature has drawn the line separating condemnable from non-condemnable leased fee interests in residential houselots is clear when the relevant statutory provisions are read conjunctively, rather than in isolation as the appellants have, with the objects of the Act in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">To begin, HRS chapter 516 \u201capplies to all lands leased as residential lots,\u201d save Hawaiian Home and federal lands, in Hawaii. HRS \u00a7 516-2 (1985). The seemingly broad coverage of the chapter, however, is circumscribed by its definition of \u201clease.\u201d As used in the chapter, \u201clease\u201d does not mean any lease; it only means one with \u201ca term, measured from the initial date of the conveyance, twenty years or more (including any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>periods for which the lease may be extended or renewed at the option of the lessee).\u201d HRS \u00a7 516-1(5) (1985). Thus when the term \u201clessee\u201d is used in the chapter, it \u201cmeans any person to whom land is leased [for twenty years or more], and the lessee\u2019s heirs, successors, legal representatives, and assigns.\u201d HRS \u00a7 516-1(8) (1985). And a \u201clot,\u201d \u201chouselot,\u201d \u201cresidential lot,\u201d and \u201cresidential houselot\u201d all \u201cmean a parcel of land, two acres or less in size, which is used or occupied or is developed, devoted, intended, or permitted to be used or occupied as a principal place of residence for one or two families.\u201d HRS \u00a7 516-1(11) (1985).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AC\"><em>Thomas T. Watts </em>(Kemper &amp; Watts, of counsel) for Appellants Sugai.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">HRS \u00a7 516-22 entitles one who has leased a houselot two acres or less in size for a term of twenty years or more to apply to purchase the fee interest therein if the houselot is part of a development tract \u201cnot less than five acres in size.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But as the circuit court concluded, the houselot leased by the Sugais was not part of a development tract large enough to enable HHA to act on their application. The conclusion, in our opinion, is consistent with the statutory scheme and its justifying public purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The Land Reform Act was passed to alleviate the undesirable economic and social consequences of \u201ca concentration of land ownership... in the hands of a few landowners who have... engaged in the practice of leasing their lands under long-term leases[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 516 \u2014 83(a)(1). We do not see that an acquisition of the leased fee interests in a tract consisting of less than five acres of condemnable land would be consistent with the Act and its purposes. A development tract of sufficient size to warrant a taking must consist of at least five acres of land under lease for twenty years or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The order of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Au6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Rene E.
