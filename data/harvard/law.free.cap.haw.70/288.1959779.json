The proceeding must be brought and prosecuted by the person entitled to possession \u201cin the district court of the circuit wherein the lands and premises in question are situated.\u201d HRS \u00a7 666-6. And any action prosecuted in a district court must be tried and determined \u201cwithout a jury[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 604-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The question in this appeal is whether the District Court of the First Circuit lacked jurisdiction to try and determine the summary possession action brought by Joseph T. Lum against Gary Dwight Henig and Christianna Wai Ha Sun after Ms. Sun filed a multi-count counterclaim and demanded a trial by jury. We conclude as the district court did that the counterclaimant was entitled to a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on her claims, but the jury demand did not divest the district court of power to decide whether or not Joseph Lum should be restored to possession of the premises in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Lum leased a single-family dwelling, which he and his wife owned, to Henig and Sun for a term of six years beginning on October 3, 1983. The \u201cRental Agreement\u201d called for the payment of rent at the rate of S900 a month; it further provided that the lessees would not sublet the premises or make alterations to the property without the lessor\u2019s prior written consent. During their tenancy, however, the lessees enclosed the carport attached to the dwelling and covered with concrete a substantial portion of the yard without obtaining permission to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Henig and Sun vacated the premises in or about March of 1986 without notice to Lum. They then sublet the property without permission and received monthly rent payments of $1,400. When the subtenant vacated the premises in or about July of 1987, they rented the dwelling to another, again without the lessor\u2019s permission. Lum brought his first summary possession action in the district court a month later. But by then Sun had filed a chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Lum thus sought to be relieved of the automatic stay imposed on his action by the provisions of section 362 of title 11 of the United States Code. The stay was lifted by the bankruptcy court on September 29,1987, and Lum brought another action seeking to recover possession of the premises and other relief<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the District Court of the First Circuit on October 30, 1987. Henig, however, was not personally served with the complaint since his whereabouts are unknown. Lum and Sun subsequently stipulated and agreed that the first action would be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On November 9,1987 the district court, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 521-78 and at Lum\u2019s request, ordered Sun to deposit the rent received from her subtenant in a court-administered trust fund pending the resolution of the dispute. On the same day, Sun filed a demand for a jury trial on \u201call issues [presented by Lum\u2019s complaint that were] so triable.\u201d She further purported to reserve the right to file an answer and counterclaim after the anticipated transfer of the case to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Lum countered with a motion to deny Sun a jury trial or, alternatively, to sever the issues raised by his claim of entitlement to possession of the premises from those posed by his claim for other relief. When the hearing on the competing requests to have the case transferred to the circuit court or kept in the district court was conducted, Sun maintained a severance of issues was out of order because she had acquired an option to purchase the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court did not rule on the requests, but gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Sun additional time to file a responsive pleading. Sun then withdrew her demand for a jury trial without prejudice, and Lum withdrew his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Sun filed her answer and counterclaim on November 24, 1987; she again demanded a trial by jury, and Lum again moved for an order denying Sun\u2019s request for jury trial. But this time the alternative relief he sought was an order severing Sun\u2019s claims as well as his claims in assumpsit from that seeking possession of the premises. The district court granted the alternative relief; the summary possession proceeding itself was kept in the district court, but the other issues raised by the pleadings of the parties were severed and transferred to the circuit court for trial by jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The summary possession proceeding was tried by the district court shortly thereafter. The court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Sun and Henig, without seeking Lum\u2019s consent, made material alterations to his property and sublet it to two subtenants. The court also found that Lum had not given Sun or Henig an option to purchase the property. Thus it concluded Sun and Henig had breached their lease and entered a judgment giving Lum possession of the premises; it subsequently ordered the release to Lum of the rent being held in trust. Sun appealed, and she now avers the judgment must be vacated since her demand for a jury trial and the fact that \u201ctitle was in issue\u201d rendered the exercise of jurisdiction by the district court invalid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">We begin our consideration of the appeal with the postulate that the \u201cdispossessory proceeding [provided under HRS chapter 666] is not for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the trial of title to land, but its [primary] purpose is the determination of the right to possession between the person claiming to be the landlord and one claiming to be his tenant.\u201d 3A G. Thompson, <em>Commentaries on The Modern Law of Real Property </em>\u00a7 1370, at 722 (J. Grimes Repl. 1981) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For \u201cthe person entitled to the possession of the premises [must] bring and prosecute the person\u2019s action in the district court of the circuit wherein the lands and premises in question are situated[,]\u201d HRS \u00a7 666-6; and \u201c[t]he district courts [cannot take] cognizance of real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate comes in question[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 604-5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">It is evident too that the statutory proceeding described in HRS chapter 666 is meant to provide \u201ca remedy to enable the landlord to obtain possession of leased premises without suffering the delay, loss and expense to which... he might be subjected [if he could only rely on the common law to remove a tenant who is] wrongfully holding over his term.\u201d 3A G. Thompson, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For the legislature has characterized the proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>as a \u201csummary\u201d action to be brought in the district court where all actions are tried and determined \u201cwithout a jury.\u201d <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7\u00a7 666-1, 666-6, 666-7, 604 \u2014 5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">But the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \u201c[i]n [sjuits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law[,J\u201d and article I, section 13 of the Hawaii Constitution secures to litigants the right to a jury trial \u201c[i]n suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed five thousand dollars[.]\u201d \u201c[Tjhe Seventh Amendment[, however,] applies only to proceedings in courts of the United Stales and does not in any manner whatever govern or regulate trials by jury in state courts....\u201d <em>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R.R. </em>v. <em>Bombolis, </em>241 U.S. 211, 217 (1916) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">We then must turn to the state constitutional provision and the statutes and rules implementing it to see if anything there might have prevented the district court from entertaining Lum\u2019s summary possession suit after Sun filed her counterclaim and demanded a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The relevant portion of our statutes governing trials, which arc compiled in HRS chapter 635, reiterates the constitutional guarantee; it mandates that \u201c[w]hen the right of trial by jury is given by the Constitution or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>statute of the United States or this State and the right has not been waived, the case shall be tried with a jury.\u201d HRS \u00a7 635-13.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district courts, as we noted at the outset, must \u201ctry and determine all actions without a jury[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 604-5(b). The statute defining the civil jurisdiction of the district courts, therefore, further provides that \u201c[w]henever a civil matter is triable of right by a jury and trial by jury is demanded..., the case shall be transferred to the circuit court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The procedural rules governing trials in the district court reinforce the constitutional provision in similar fashion; DCRCP Rule 38(a) states; \u201cThe right of trial by jury as declared by the Constitution of the State of Hawaii or as provided by a statute shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.\u201d Thus, a party to an action brought in the district court \u201cmay demand a trial by a jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the case is at issue.\u201d DCRCP 38(b). He may \u201cspecify the issues which he wishes tried by jury; otherwise he shall be deemed to have demanded trial by jury for all issues so triable.\u201d DCRCP 38(c). And upon the payment of \u201csuch costs for jury trial as are payable in the circuit court,... the case shall be transferred to the circuit court.\u201d DCRCP 38(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We have not ruled on how the constitutional provision, as implemented by statute and rule, should be applied in the setting at hand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sun would have us rule that \u201cwhenever a demand for trial by jury is properly made as to a \u2018matter\u2019 (in the words of the statute) or \u2018any issue\u2019 (in the words of the rule) which is triable of right by a jury, \u2018the case,\u2019 not just the matter or issue, <em>shall </em>be transferred [to the circuit court].\u201d (Emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>appellant\u2019s brief). But we conclude the district court did not err in deciding not to transfer the summary possession action.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As we observed, the State Constitution preserves the right to jury trials in \u201csuits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed five thousand dollars[.]\u201d Haw. Const, art. I, \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lum, of course, did not sue at common law to regain possession of his property; he invoked the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under a statute reflecting a legislative decision that the \u201cunique factual and legal characteristics of the landlord-tenant relationship [justified] special statutory treatment inapplicable to other litigants.\u201d <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 72 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Originally, what one entitled to the premises could seek under the special statutory provisions enacted as part of the Civil Code in 1859 was a writ of possession.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But\u201c[i]n any action for summary possession begun under [HRS chapter 666], the plaintiff may [now] join claims for rent, lodging, board, profits, damages, and waste, where these arose out of and refer to the land or premises, irrespective of the amount claimed.\u201d HRS \u00a7 666-7. The defendant may now also have any counterclaim \u201caris[ing] out of and referring] to the land or premises, the possession of which is being sought,\u201d other than a real action or one in which the title to real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>estate comes in question, heard in the district court along with the summary possession action even though the value of the counterclaim may exceed the monetary limit for actions ordinarily triable there. HRS \u00a7 604-5(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">But it does not follow that the action for summary possession may not be separated thereafter from the other claims asserted by the plaintiff or the counterclaims asserted by the defendant. By virtue of DCRCP 38(b) a party \u201cmay demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury ....\u201d He may also \u201cspecify the issues which he wishes tried by jury[.]\u201d DCRCP 38(c). There is, of course, no constitutional barrier to the trial in different courts of separate issues arising from the same factual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u201cThe [Supreme] Court [on several occasions] has held that it is permissible to segregate an action for possession of property from other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>actions arising out of the same factual situation that may assert valid legal or equitable defenses or counterclaims.\u201d <em>Lindsey v. Normet, </em>405 U.S. at 67. \u201cIn <em>Grant Timber </em>&amp; <em>Mfg. Co. v. Gray, </em>236 U.S. 133 (1915) (Holmes, J.), the Court upheld against due process attack a Louisiana procedure [providing] that a defendant sued in a possessory action for real property could not bring an action to establish title or present equitable claims until after the possessory suit was brought to a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lindsey v. Normet, </em>405 U.S. at 67-68 (footnote omitted). And in <em>Bianchi v. Morales, </em>262 U.S. 170 (1923), the Court upheld Puerto Rico\u2019s mortgage law which provided for summary foreclosure without allowing any defense other than payment, concluding that \u201c[t]he United States, the States, and equally Porto Rico, may exclude all claims of ultimate right from possessory actions, consistently with due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 (citing <em>Grant Timber &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Gray, supra, and Central Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Garvan, </em>254 U.S. 554 (1921)).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Sun, however, argues a segregation of Lum\u2019s claim to possession of the premises from his other claims and her counterclaims was precluded because HRS \u00a7 604-5 and DCRCP 38(b) mandate a transfer of \u201cthe case\u201d from the district to the circuit court whenever a trial by jury has been demanded on any matter or issue so triable. In her view, \u201cthe case\u201d refers to the aggregate of claims asserted by the parties to a lawsuit. Thus, she would have us rule her demand for a jury trial deprived the district court of power to act on any claim rooted in the lease of the premises owned by Lum.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u201cIn a legal sense, \u2018case\u2019 is generally understood as meaning a judicial proceeding for the determination of a controversy between parties where rights are enforced or wrongs are prevented or redressed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Montevallo Coal Mining Co., </em>29 Ala. App. 318, 197 So. 82, <em>85[, cert. denied, </em>240 Ala. 73, 197 So. 87 (1940)]; <em>Ex Parte Chesser, </em>93 Fla. 590, 112 So. 87, 90 [(1927)].\u201d <em>Opinion of the Clerk, </em>345 So. 2d 1329, 1330 (Ala. 1977). Read narrowly, it is \u201ca question contested before a court of justice.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>195 (5th ed. 1979). It may also be \u201cthe lawsuit, the cause of action, or the matter as a whole.\u201d <em>Wetmore v. Wrynn, </em>32 Conn. Supp. 249, 254, 349 A.2d 857, 860 (1974). Read in the context of the relevant rule, \u201cthe case\u201d could hardly be \u201cthe matter as a whole,\u201d as Sun contends, for the litigant is allowed thereunder to \u201cspecify the issues which he wishes tried by jury[,] otherwise he shall be deemed to have demanded trial by jury for all issues so triable.\u201d DCRCP 38(c). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>rule thus contemplates that the questions raised by the aggregate of facts furnishing occasion for the exercise of judicial authority are subject to segregation for bench or jury trial.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1e\"><em>Frederick </em>W. <em>Rohlfing, HI {James M.

Goble </em>with him on the brief) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The district court, therefore, did not err by retaining jurisdiction over the summary possession action despite Sun\u2019s demand for a trial by jury and by issuing a writ of possession in favor of Lum. Nor did it err in releasing the money in the trust fund consisting of rent received subsequent to the lessees\u2019 breach of the \u201cRental Agreement.\u201d The district court, however, should not have ruled on whether or not Lum gave Henig and Sun an option to purchase the property, and its finding thereon is stricken.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> \u201cIn any action for summary possession begun under [chapter 666], the plaintiff may join claims for rent, lodging, board, profits, damages, and waste, where these arise out of and refer to the land or premises, irrespective of the amount claimed.\u201d HRS \u00a7 666-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> By virtue of HRS \u00a7 604-5(d), \u201c[t]he district courts [cannot take] cognizance of real actions, nor actions in which the title to real estate comes in question . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\"> The appellant also argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">The District Court had no jurisdiction or legal authority to order that the amounts deposited by Sun in the District Court under H.R.S. \u00a7521-78 to be [sic] released to Lum where the District Court had no jurisdiction or legal authority to order such a release of rent trust fund amounts! ;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">The District Court lacks jurisdiction over the entire case because there is an automatic stay in effect in <em>In re Wai Ha Sun, </em>Bankruptcy No. 84-00586 in theBankruptcy Court [of] the United States DistrictCourt for the District of Hawaii[.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> HRS \u00a7 666-1 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">Summary possession on termination or forfeiture of lease.
