State contends that 1) Paaluhi was a multiple offender; so 2) the trial court erred by not imposing the more severe, mandatory multiple offender penalties. We agree, therefore vacate the sentence, and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">No facts are disputed. On February 11,1988 pursuant to plea bargaining, Paaluhi pled guilty to six counts of driving without a license (HRS \u00a7 286-102), two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol (HRS \u00a7 29 l-4(a)), one count of contempt of court (HRS \u00a7 710-1077), and the three no-fault insurance violation counts. Paaluhi perpetrated the last three offenses on September 28,1982, October 26, 1985, and December 12,1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>After the trial court had accepted Paaluhi\u2019s guilty pleas, the following exchange occurred during the sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">[THE COURT:] For no-fault insurance, Case Number 48, 57 and 58, Court at this time will impose <em>a fine of $100 each, consecutive.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">MR. LINSTROM: Your Honor, at this time, the State would object to that sentence. It would inquire of the Court if the Court is ruling that <em>Ahakuelo [State </em>v. <em>Ahakuelo, </em>5 Haw. App. 205, 683 P.2d 400 (1984)] applies to the no-fault cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">THE COURT: I also will indicate <em>that Ahakuelo </em>does apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">MR. LINSTROM: At this time, Your Honor, State would indicate that Section 294-39 reads that each additional offense shall be charged at the rate of \u2014 at the enhanced sentencing rate; and I would further indicate to you that <em>Ahakuelo </em>does not apply <em>becaust Ahakuelo </em>by its term applies to DUI [driving under the influence] and perhaps to serious or criminal offenses. And that in this case, there is no benefit of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">So the internal rationale of <em>Ahakuelo </em>that somehow the alcohol rehabilitation and training would have prevented a second offense does not apply to no-fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-12\">So if the State\u2019s objection may be noted and at this time\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">THE COURT: Your objection is noted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Transcript of February 11,1988 at 12-13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">The judgment was entered, and State subsequently appealed pursuant to HRS \u00a7 641-13(6) (Supp. 1988). Paaluhi has not cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b271-18\">The sole issue on appeal is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-19\">Whether the trial court erred by not imposing the multiple offender penalties on Paaluhi? YES.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">We thus need not address the other contentions raised by Paaluhi.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">ENHANCED SENTENCING UNDER HRS \u00a7 294-39</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">State maintains that, under HRS \u00a7 294-39, Paaluhi was a multiple offender who had to be subjected to the enhanced sentencing penalties. Paaluhi counters that 1) the trial court imposed a legal sentence; so 2) State has no basis to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Although this court has rejected an approach to statutory construction which is limited to the words of the statute, it is still fundamental that the statutory language is the starting point for any interpretation which 1) must be consistent with the legislative purpose; and 2) cannot contradict the plain and obvious meaning of the law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oshiro, </em>69 Haw. _, 746 P.2d 568 (1987); <em>see State </em>v. <em>Avilla, </em>69 Haw. _, 750 P.2d 78 (1988) (per curiam).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">HRS \u00a7 294-39 (1975) reads in relevant part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">(a) Any person subject to the provisions of this chapter in the capacity of the operator, owner or registrant of a motor vehicle in this State, or registered in this State, who violates any applicable provision of this chapter, shall be subject to citation for such violation by any county police department in a form and manner approved by the violations bureau of the district court of the first circuit. <em>Each violation shall be deemed a separate offense </em>and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 or thirty days imprisonment, or suspension of motor vehicle driver\u2019s license, or forfeiture of motor vehicle certificate of registration, or any combination of such penalties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">By contrast, HRS \u00a7 294-39 (1985) provides in pertinent part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">(a) Any person subject to this chapter in the capaci ty of the operator, owner, or registrant of a motor vehicle in this State, or registered in this State, who violates any applicable provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of this chapter, shall be subject to citation for the violation by any county police department in a form and manner approved by the violations bureau of the district court of the first circuit. Notwithstanding any provision of the Hawaii Penal Code, <em>each violation shall be deemed a separate offense and shall be subject to a fine not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 </em>and the fine shall not be suspended; <em>provided if the person is convicted of not having had a no-fault policy in effect at the time the citation was issued, the fine for the first offense shall be $100, with a minimum of $400for each additional offense. </em>Any operator of a motor vehicle owned by another person shall not be considered in violation of this section if the operator\u2019s own insurance covers such driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>In the case of multiple violations the court shall in addition to any other penalty, impose the following penalties:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">(1) Imprisonment of not more than thirty days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">(2) Suspension or revocation of driver\u2019s license of the driver and of the registered owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">(3) Suspension or revocation of the motor vehicle registration plates of the vehicle involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">(4) Impoundment, or impoundment and sale, of the motor vehicle for the costs of storage and other charges incident to seizure of the vehicle; or any other cost involved pursuant to section 294-10; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">(5) Any combination of such penalties!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">Finally, HRS \u00a7 294-39 (1987) states in important part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-13\">(a) Any person subject to this chapter in the capacity of the operator, owner, or registrant of a motor vehicle in this State, or registered in this State, who violates any applicable provision of this chapter, shall be subject to citation for the violation by any county police department in a form and manner approved by the violations bureau of the district court of the first circuit. Notwithstanding any provision of the Hawaii Penal Code, <em>each violation shall be deemed a separate offense and shall be subject to afine not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 </em>and the, fine shall not be suspended; <em>provided if the person is convicted of not having had a no-fault policy in effect at the time the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>citation was issued, the fine for the first offense shall be $100, with a minimum of $400for each additional offense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>In the case of multiple violations the court shall, in addition to any other penalty, impose the following penalties:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">(1) Imprisonment of not more than thirty days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">(2) Suspension or revocation of driver\u2019s license of the driver and of the registered owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">(3) Suspension or revocation of the motor vehicle registration plates of the vehicle involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">(4) Impoundment, or impoundment and sale, of the motor vehicle for the costs of storage and other charges incident to seizure of the vehicle; or any other cost involved pursuant to section 294-10; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">(5) Any combination of such penalties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Here, Paaluhi pled guilty, was convicted, and was sentenced on the same day for three different offenses which had occurred at three separate times. Furthermore, there exists no dispute that he had committed these violations. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Apuna, </em>3 Haw. App. 673, 657 P.2d 1062 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The trial court, however, relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Ahakuelo, </em>5 Haw. App. 205, 683 P.2d 400 (1984), where the defendant had been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on February 15,1983 plus February 16,1983, was convicted on both counts in the same proceeding, was sentenced as a first offender for the February 15,1983 charge, but was subjected to the enhanced sentencing provisions for the February 16, 1983 charge. The Intermediate Court of Appeals vacated the enhanced sentencing and remanded the case for resentencing by opining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">Construing HRS \u00a7 291-4(a)(l) and (2) together and giving a sensible and intelligent effect to each, it is clear that the legislature intended that the increased penalties of \u00a7 291-4(a)(2) are applicable only where sentence is being imposed for a DUI offense which occurred after a prior DUI conviction. Any interpretation contrary to this would not give effect to the triggering provisions of \u00a7 291^(a)(2) and would not produce a harmonious result with the entire statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">The intention of the legislature in promulgating \u00a7 291-4(a)(2) is clear. It was to impose the mandatory sentencing provisions thereof on persons convicted of a DUI \u201coffense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>which occurs within four years of a prior <em>conviction </em>under this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The focus of the section is upon the commission of a subsequent DUI offense by a person who has already had a drunk driving conviction. The event which triggers the mandatory sentence is the prior conviction followed by the subsequent offense. In the instant case, <em>the second DUI offense was committed before Defendant was convicted of his DUI offense and therefore the mandatory sentence provision of \u00a7 29I-4(a)(2) was not applicable in sentencing Defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 683 P.2d at 403 (emphasis added and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The different language in HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291-4 and 294-39, however, makes the <em>Ahakuelo </em>rationale inapplicable to the instant action. HRS. \u00a7 294-39 clearly recites that the <em>commission </em>of more than one offense necessitates the multiple offender penalties. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Akana, </em>68 Haw. 164, 706 P.2d 1300 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">By comparison, for purposes of the repeat offender sentencing statutes defining \u201cconviction\u201d (HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-606.5(1) plus 706-666(1)), a defendant who committed different crimes a month apart, was charged in separate indictments, was found guilty in separate trials on each offense, but was sentenced for both crimes on the same day, had two convictions, so was a repeat offender. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodrigues, </em>68 Haw. 124, 706 P.2d 1293 (1985). But, convictions on both counts of one indictment are considered a single conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>63 Haw. 509, 630 P.2d 633 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The situation in the present case initially appears more similar to <em>Tavares, </em>but the only reason why all the various offenses were heard together by the trial court is because Paaluhi had previously refused to show up for trial when required. As State accurately complains, adopting Paaluhi\u2019s position \u201cwould reward [him] for failing to report to court on the first citation, and treat him as a first offender when he finally appears in court on three successive multiple violations.\u201d Opening Brief at 10. This is not what the legislature had intended. <em>See State v. Himuro, </em>70 Haw. _, 761 P.2d 1148 (1988). <em>Rodrigues, </em>by contrast, is the more appropriate precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Paaluhi was convicted for three separate violations occurring in different years. Accordingly, the trial court should have given the mandatory, enhanced sentencing penalties established by the legislature. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>68 Haw. 292, 711 P.2d 1295 (1985). Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>Ahakuelo </em>logic seems appealing, the trial court was required to sentence Paaluhi as a multiple offender (discretion, however, still existed on what combination of punishments might be imposed). <em>See State v. </em>Scott, 69 Haw. _, 746 P.2d 976 (1987).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6Q\"><em>Vickie L. Silberstein, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for Plaintiff-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ARk\"><em>Mary Helen Wong (Daniel Pagliarini </em>and <em>Linda C. Ramirez </em>on the brief), Deputy Public Defenders, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Based on the above reasoning, the language of HRS \u00a7 294-39, plus the specific facts of this controversy, <em>see State </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>69 Haw. _, 742 P.2d 373 (1987), the sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Baroza, </em>68 Haw. 169, 706 P.2d 1304 (1985).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-17\"> HRS \u00a7 294-8 (1985) reads (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-18\">Conditions of operation and registration, (a)(1) No person shall operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public street, road, or highway of this State at any time unless such motor vehicle is insured at all times under a no-fault policy.
