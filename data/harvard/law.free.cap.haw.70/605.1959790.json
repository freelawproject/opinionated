Magoon, II, the Personal Representative of George A. Magoon, deceased, appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, [and] Order Dividing Property and the Order Denying Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Relief entered by the Family Court of the Third Circuit in the divorce action brought by George A. Magoon against Velma Lee Magoon. The issues we are asked to resolve are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">1. Where the divorce decree reserves the matter of the final division of the parties\u2019 property for further hearing and decision and a party dies before the hearing, should the division be effected in accord with the divorce statute or in accord with the Probate Code and the dower statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">2. Where the final division of the property is effected before the lapse of a year following entry of a divorce decree reserving the final division of property, do the provisions of HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) as interpreted by this court in <em>Boulton v. Boulton, </em>69 Haw. 1, 730 P.2d 338 (1986), divest the family court of power to grant a party relief from the order dividing the property for fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of the adverse party after the elapse of the foregoing one-year period?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">We conclude the divorce statute governs the final division of the parties\u2019 property in the situation above and HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) does not divest the family court of jurisdiction to grant a party relief from the order effecting the division despite the elapse of a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">George A. Magoon and Velma Lee Magoon were first married on March 13,1977 in Hot Springs, Arkansas. But Mr. Magoon\u2019s previous marriage was not finally dissolved until May 27, 1977, and the parties were married again on April 8,1980 in Kona, Hawaii. The parties executed an antenuptial agreement on March 11,1977, whereby each party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>waived any and all rights or interests in and to the property owned or thereafter acquired by the other and any and all claims that could otherwise be made against the estate of the other, whether by way of dower, curtesy, or inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Mr. Magoon filed a complaint for divorce in the family court on August 12,1986, and a decree of divorce was entered on March 4,1987. The court, however, reserved issues related to spousal support, attorney\u2019s fees, and property division for further hearing and decision as authorized by HRS \u00a7\u00a7 580-47 and -56. But Mr. Magoon died before the court was able to conduct a further hearing and determine the reserved issues, his death occurring on June 6,1987. The fam ily court then vacated the decree of divorce and dismissed the case on January 29,1988 on the ground that his death abated the divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Mr. Magoon\u2019s Personal Representative, who had been substituted as the plaintiff in the action, immediately petitioned this court for a Writ of Mandamus directing the family court to reinstate the decree and proceed with the hearing to determine the property division issue. Finding the situation was one calling for intervention on our part, we issued an order directing the family court to rescind the dismissal of the case, reinstate the decree of divorce, conduct a hearing, and resolve the properly division issue before the elapse of the one-year period following its reservation. The family court conducted a hearing, and on March 3,1988 it ruled that Mrs. Magoon should be awarded a third of Mr. Magoon\u2019s real property and a third of his net estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The court entered its written Findings of Facts, Conclusions of La w, [and] Order Dividing Property, <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, on April 15,1988. It found \u201cDefendant did not abandon Plaintiff so as to defeat her claim to dower rights[,]\u201d she \u201cmade a timely election of Elective Share and Dower Rights under the relevant provisions of the Hawaii Revised Slalulesl,]\u201d and \u201c[t]here [was] insufficient evidence [to] prove Plaintiff\u2019s claim of the existence of an antinuptial [sic] agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant.\u201d Concluding \u201cthe rights of the parlies [were] controlled by Chapter 560 and Chapter 533 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes!,]\u201d the court awarded Mrs. Magoon \u201cone-third of the Mahaiula land which was solely owned by [Mr. Magoon] on May 27,1977[]\u201d and \u201cone-third of [his] net estate].]\u201d The finding that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence [of] the existence of an anlinuptial [sic] agreement\u201d was predicated upon the production by the substituted plaintiff of only an unsigned copy and the defendant\u2019s refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>to acknowledge that the parties had executed an agreement, despite the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in the divorce hearing that they had.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">After the substituted plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the order entered on April 15,1988, he discovered a photocopy of an executed and notarized agreement among the decedent\u2019s papers. The document was appended to an affidavit submitted by Mr. Magoon in support of a motion filed on Mrs. Magoon\u2019s behalf in a federal criminal case in which she was a defendant. Asserting the late discovery of the evidence and the commission of fraud by Mrs. Magoon furnished grounds for relief under Rule 60(b) of the Hawaii Family Court Rules (HFCR), the substituted plaintiff filed a motion in the family court to vacate the order awarding Mrs. Magoon \u201cone-third of the Mahaiula land which was solely owned by [Mr. Magoon] on May 27,1977[]\u201d and \u201cone-third of [his] net estate[.]\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The family court voiced an opinion.that \u201cthere [were] sufficient questions raised by the discovery of this document to have required or conducted a further fact finding hearing to determine the validity of the document.\u201d But it nevertheless concluded it had \u201clost jurisdiction and could not amend the division of property in any event.\u201d In its view, HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) and our ruling in <em>Boulton v. Boulton</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>served to divest it of power to act on the matter because more than a year had elapsed since the decree of divorce was entered. The family court, however, intimated a ruling on the jurisdictional question should be secured from this court. A motion for remand was filed, but we chose not to decide the issue then in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>summary fashion. The family court, in the meantime, had issued a written order denying the Rule 60(b) motion, and we decided the issue should be given plenary consideration along with any other issue properly raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We begin our review of proceedings in the family court with a brief survey of the statutes implicated in its rulings and our decisions expounding said statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">\u201cEvery decree of divorce which does not specifically recite that the final division of the property of the parties is reserved for further hearing, decision, and orders shall finally divide the property of the parties to such action.\u201d HRS \u00a7 580-56(a). In effecting a division of the properly the family court is governed by HRS \u00a7 580-47. Subsection (a) thereof empowers the court, \u201c[u]pon granting a divorce, or thereafter if... jurisdiction of such matters is reserved under the decree..., [to] make such further orders as shall appear just and equitable... finally dividing and distributing the estate of the parties, real, personal, or mixed, whether community, joint, or separate!.]\u201d Since the directive is to make such orders as shall appear just and equitable \u201ceach case must be decided upon its own facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Carson v.

Whether the agreement was unconscionable or not is \u201cdecided by the court as a matter of law.\u201d HRS \u00a7 572D-6(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">By virtue of HRS \u00a7 533-1, \u201c[e]very woman shall be endowed of one-third part of all the lands which are not included in the net estate of her husband which is subject to her elective share and which were owned by her husband in fee simple, in freehold, or in leasehold at any time during marriage, and prior to July 1, 1977, unless she is lawfully barred thereof.\u201d Divorce, however, cuts off this right of a woman to claim on the death of her husband a one-third part of the lands that were owned by him during marriage. For \u201cfi]n case of divorce dissolving the marriage, contract, the wife shall not be endowed.\u201d HRS \u00a7 533-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cIf a married person domiciled in this Slate dies, the surviving spouse has a right of election to take an elective share of one-third of the net estate under the limitations and conditions ... stated fin the Probate Code].\u201d HRS \u00a7 560:2-201.

Pul simply, this subsection \u201creserves to a former spouse the rights to dower and curtesy [and to an elective share of the decedent\u2019s net estate] until the entry of a Decree which finally divides the property of the parties.\u201d House Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 618, in 1973 House Journal, at 1045. And the following subsection, HRS \u00a7 580-56(c), serves to prevent the attachment of intervening dower or curtesy rights in the event a party remarries before the properly division is effected; it bars the right of dower or curtesy \u201cto a subsequently acquired spouse until the property of the parties [to the pending action] has been finally dividcd[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">HRS \u00a7 580-56(d), however, mandates that the division be accomplished within a year following the dissolution of marriage; the subsection reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">Following the entry of a decree of divorce, or the entry of a decree or order finally dividing the property of the parlies to a matrimonial action if the same is reserved in the decree of divorce, or the elapse of one year after entry of a decree or order reserving the final division of property of the party, a divorced spouse shall not be entitled to dower or curtesy in the former spouse\u2019s real estate, or any part thereof, nor to any share of the former spouse\u2019s personal estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">In <em>Boulton </em>v. Boulton, we interpreted the foregoing \u201cone-ycar limitation [as applying] to all entitlements to the former spouse\u2019s personal estate,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>69 Haw. at _, 730 P.2d at 340, and we concluded the passage of a year following the entry of a decree or order reserving the final division of property \u201cdivested the family court of jurisdiction\u201d to divide the property of the parties. 69 Haw. at _, 730 P.2d at 340; <em>see also supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In the case at bar, the family court conducted a hearing pursuant to our direction within the one-year period following the dissolution of the marriage of George A. Magoon and Velma Lee Magoon and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">1. The plain language and legislative history of Section 580-56(b) clearly show that in a situation such as this one where a decree of divorce is entered reserving the issue of property division and where one party dies before the trial on the division of property, that the rights of the parties are controlled by Chapter 560 and Chapter 533 of the Hawaii Revised Statues [sic] and not by Section 580-47 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes[;] and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">2. Defendant presented timely notice of her decision to take her dower rights and her elective share rights and is thereby entitled to one third of all land owned by Plaintiff at the date of marriage prior to July 1,1977 that is not in the net estate of the Plaintiff under Chapter 533 of the Hawaii Reivscd [sic] Statutes and to one third of the net estate of Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The principal vice of this ruling lies in the court\u2019s failure to recognize that the section of the divorce statute empowering it to finally divide and distribute \u201cthe estate of the parties, real, personal, or mixed, whether community, joint, or separate!,]\u201d is section 580-47(a), and not section 580-56(b). \u2018\u201cThere is,\u2019 we have said in applying the [divorce] statute, \u2018no fixed rule for determining the amount of property to be awarded each spouse in a divorce action other than as set forth in HRS \u00a7 58CM7.\u2019 <em>Au-Hoy v. Au-Hoy, </em>60 Haw. 354, 357, 590 P.2d 80, 82 (1979).\u201d <em>Myers v. Myers, </em>70 Haw. 143, 148, 764 P.2d 1237, 1241 (1988). And what is set forth there is discretion to do what is \u201cjust and equitable\u201d in the circumstances. <em>Cassiday </em>v. <em>Cassiday, </em>68 Haw. 383, 388, 716 P.2d 1133, 1137 (1986) (citing <em>Au-Hoy </em>v. <em>Au-Hoy, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The plain language and legislative history of HRS \u00a7 580-56(b), contrary to the family court\u2019s conclusion, indicate it was enacted primarily to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>prevent the attachment of \u201cintervening rights of a new spouse\u201d to the property of divorced persons in the hiatus between the dissolution of their marriage and the final division of their property. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 618, <em>supra, </em>at 1045. As we noted, HRS \u00a7 580-56(b) \u201creserves to a former spouse the rights to dower and curtesy presently granted by Hawaii Revised Statutes until the entry of a Decree which finally divides the property of the parties to the former marriagc[,]\u201d HRS \u00a7 580-56(c) \u201cbars the rights of dower and curtesy to a subsequently acquired spouse until the property of the parlies of [the] prior marriage has been finally divided,\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. <em>618, supra, </em>at 1045, and HRS \u00a7 580 \u2014 56(d) compels an expeditious determination of issues related to the division of property when the divorce decree reserves that matter for further hearing and decision. HRS \u00a7 580-56(b), (c), and (d); <em>Boulton </em>v. <em>Boulton, </em>69 Haw. at _, 730 P.2d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The language of HRS \u00a7 580-56(b) docs not even intimate HRS chapters 560 and 533, rather than HRS \u00a7 580^47, control the division of the property of divorced parties in the event one dies in the interim between their divorce and the division of their property. Nor is there a suggestion in the Probate Code or the dower and curtesy statute that either is controlling in the foregoing situation. For a person \u201cwho is divorced from the decedent... is not [his] surviving spouse[,]\u201d HRS \u00a7 560:2-802, and \u201c[i]n case of divorce dissolving the marriage contract, the wife shall not be endowed.\u201d HRS \u00a7 533-9. Thus, the family court erred in concluding the division of property in the case at bar is \u201ccontrolled by Chapter 560 and Chapter 533 of the Hawaii Revised Statues [sic] and not by Section 580-47.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">When the substituted plaintiff sought relief from the erroneous ruling under HFCR 60(b), the family court denied his motion because it \u201ccould not amend the division of properly in any event.\u201d The court rested the decision not to act on our holding in <em>Boulton </em>v. <em>Boulton </em>that by reason of HRS \u00a7 580-56(d) the elapse of a year following the entry of a decree or order reserving the final division of property \u201cdivested the family court of jurisdiction.\u201d 69 Haw. at _, 730 P.2d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">True, the division of property following a divorce must be accomplished in a year, and the substituted plaintiff was attempting to invoke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>family court\u2019s authority to engage in property division after the elapse of a year. Were we to apply <em>Boulton v. Boulton </em>literally, we would have to affirm the family court. But we would then be ignoring the fact that the property division was accomplished within a year, albeit erroneously, and agreeing that the court was powerless to reconsider its decision in the face of allegations in the substituted plaintiff\u2019s motion of fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of the defendant because a year had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Our concern that a judgment or final order should reflect the true merits of the case, which is expressed in HFCR 60(a) and (b), militates against a literal application of the one-year limitation here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> So does the principle that a court has \u201cinherent power ... to investigate whether a judgment was obtained by fraud[.]\u201d <em>Universal Oil Prods. Co. v. Root Refining Co., </em>328 U.S. 575, 580 (1946) <em>(citing Hazel-Atlas Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford-Empire Co., </em>322 U.S. 238 (1944)). The court\u2019s power in this regard is inherent because it \u201cis necessarily implicit in the proper and orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>56 Haw. 292, 294, 535 P.2d 127, 128 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">We cannot conclude the legislature intended to divest our courts of power to do what the proper and orderly administration of justice demands by adopting the one-year limitation period in the absence of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>express declaration to that effect. <em>Cf. State </em>v. Brown, 1 Haw. App. 602, 602, 623 P.2d 892, 892 (1981) (\u201cThe legislature, in the enactment of a statute, will not be presumed to intend to overturn [a court\u2019s] inherent powers, unless such intention is made clearly to appear by express declarations or by necessary implication.\u201d). The respect due one branch of government from a coordinate branch militates against such a conclusion. Thus, we conclude the family court retained jurisdiction to entertain a Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the order dividing the properly despite the elapse of a year.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGF\"><em>Thomas L.
