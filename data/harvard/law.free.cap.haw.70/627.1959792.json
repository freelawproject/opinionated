The convictions, he urges on appeal, must be vacated because the trial court erred when it: (1) did not excuse jurors he purportedly challenged for cause, (2) denied his motion to continue the trial, (3) denied his motion to exclude as evidence recordings of his conversations with an undercover agent of the police, (4) denied his motion to exclude evidence seized under a defective warrant, (5) permitted the jury to hear testimony that the undercover agent responsible for his apprehension had been involved in other drug transactions as an agent of the police, and (6) denied his motion for mistrial predicated on the deliberate injec-. tion of prejudicial evidence by a witness. Concluding from a review of the record that no reversible error was committed, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The State Department of Human Services, the agency responsible for the administration of the Child Protective Act, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 587, received a report on March 3,1987 that the defendant\u2019s eight-year-old daughter was threatened by imminent harm because of his involvement in drug trafficking. A social worker assigned to the department\u2019s child protective services section began an investigation of the situation by going to the school where the child was enrolled as a pupil to interview her. The social worker neither sought the defendant\u2019s permission to speak with his daughter nor informed him of the report of his criminal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">In the course of the interview the child recounted some of the activities she observed in the apartment where she lived with her father. These activities included the weighing of cocaine and the exchange of cocaine for money by the defendant. The child said her father\u2019s girlfriend smoked cocaine in her presence, using a glass pipe, alcohol, cotton balls, and a lighter in the process. She also told the social worker about the large amounts of currency kept in the apartment. Believing she would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>harmed by the criminal activities of her father if she remained in the apartment, the agency assumed protective custody of the child on March 5, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The social worker passed on what she had learned to Detective Helepololei of the Honolulu Police Department The detective then interviewed the child, who reiterated what was said earlier to the social worker. Helepololei conferred with Detective Godsey thereafter and asked him to secure a warrant authorizing a search of the apartment. Godsey prepared an affidavit setting forth the information given by the child to the other detective. But Godsey\u2019s affidavit contained a piece of erroneous information \u2014 it stated the child saw both her father and his girlfriend use cocaine. A warrant was issued on the strength of Godsey\u2019s affidavit, and the apartment was searched on March 6,1987. The search yielded a triple-beam scale, the defendant\u2019s address book, a telephone bill with his name on it, and some small plastic bags. No cocaine was found in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The Prosecuting Attorney filed a four-count criminal complaint against the defendant on May 12, 1987. Counts I, II, and IV thereof charged him with Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree and Count III charged him with Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the First Degree. The defendant was arrested thereafter, and the arrest was the subject of extensive media coverage. A few days later there was a murder, which the defendant witnessed, outside his apartment. The media accounts of the murder named him as the same person whose daughter was in protective custody because of his involvement in the promotion of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The defendant\u2019s trial on the four charges of Promoting Dangerous Drugs commenced on October 6,1987. The voir dire examination of prospective jurors revealed a number of them remembered the media accounts of the defendant\u2019s earlier tribulations. Twenty-four of the forty-one prospective jurors acknowledged they had been exposed to pretrial publicity adverse to the defendant. Of the twelve who were first seated in the jury box, six remembered media accounts of the defendant\u2019s arrest and the assumption of protective custody of his daughter by the State. One of the six said she could not be fair to the defendant, and she was excused and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>replaced by another person who had some knowledge of the case. Several others were also excused when they said they could not be fair to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The defendant exercised all of his allotted peremptory challenges to excuse prospective jurors who remembered the earlier media accounts of the defendant\u2019s troubles. Two of the three peremptory challenges, however, were exercised without prior challenges for cause. The jury that heard the State\u2019s case against the defendant included six of the twenty-four prospective jurors who indicated they had viewed or read accounts in the print or electronic media of the defendant\u2019s arrest and the State\u2019s assumption of protective custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Before evidence was adduced, however, the defendant unsuccessfully sought \u201ca postponement of the trial to a later date so that a new jury. could be picked with more lime standing between the trial and the pretrial publicity.\u201d He then moved to suppress as evidence tape recordings of telephone conversations between himself and an undercover police agent. The trial court heard the motion over the State\u2019s objection that it was untimely and denied it. The defendant also moved unsuccessfully to suppress as evidence items seized in the search conducted of the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The State called as witnesses its undercover agent, the police officer who \u201csupervised\u201d the agent, the officers who conducted the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment, and a police criminalist who identified the substance the agent received from the defendant as cocaine. The defendant did not testify at trial; nor did he call any witnesses to rebut the evidence adduced by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">At the close of evidence the defendant moved for and was granted a judgmentof acquittal on the charge of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the First Degree. The remaining charges were submitted to the jury for decision, and it returned guilty verdicts on all three counts of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree. The trial court\u2019s judgment of convictions was entered thereafter, and the defendant perfected a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Our scrutiny of the six points of alleged error begins with the claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to excuse three jurors who \u201csimply could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>make up their minds if they could be fair or not\u201d caused the defendant \u201cto waste all three of his peremptory challenges\u201d and \u201cseverely affected\u201d his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u201c[T]he_right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial... jurors.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722 (1961). And \u201c[t]he theory of the law is that a juror who has formed an opinion cannot be impartial.\u201d <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 155 (1878). The law, however, does notrequire a juror to \u201cbe totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved\u201d when he is sworn. <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\"><em>A </em>criminal case of this nature undoubtedly will command media attention and \u201carouse the interest of the public in the vicinity [.]\u201d 366 U.S. at 722. \u201c[Sjcarcely any of those... qualified to serve as jurors [would] not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>ruling \u201cthat the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality would ... establish an impossible standard.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. at 723. The prevailing rule thus allows a person with preconceived notions about a case to serve as a juror if he \u201ccan lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court. <em>Spies </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>123 U.S. 131 [(1887)]; <em>Holt v. United States, </em>218 U.S. 245 [(1910)]; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, supra.\u201d </em>366 U.S. at 723.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">When a juror is challenged on grounds that he has formed an opinion and cannot be impartial, the test is \u201cwhether the nature and strength of the opinion ... are such as in law necessarily ... raise the presumption of partiality.\u201d <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U.S. at 156. The question \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>one of mixed law and fact,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201c[t]he affirmative of the issue is upon the challenger.\u201d 98 U.S. at 157. Furthermore, the reviewing court is bound by \u201cthe proposition that findings of impartiality should be set aside only where prejudice is \u2018manifest.\u2019 <em>Holt </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Spies v. Illinois, supra; Hopt v. Utah, </em>120 U.S. 430 [(1897)].\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. at 724; <em>cf. Territory </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>16 Haw. 743, 754 (1905) (In determining whether a juror can be fair, \u201cmuch must be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The State maintains and the record confirms the defendant challenged the impartiality of only one of the three prospective jurors on whom he claims peremptory challenges were wasted. \u201cA defendant in a. criminal case cannot sit in silence and accept a juror as unprejudiced and fair and then subsequently allege error in the retention of the same juror.\u201d <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Fukunaga, </em>30 Haw. 697, 704, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>33 F.2d 396 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 U.S. 593 (1929); <em>see also McKeague v. Talbert, </em>3 Haw. App. 646, 655, 658 P.2d 898, 906 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The result can be no different where a member of the jury panel is not challenged for cause and is later excused on a peremptory challenge. No error can be predicated on the trial court\u2019s failure to excuse the proposed juror for cause since \u201cthe court was not asked to rule on the matter and did not rule.\u201d <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Fukunaga, </em>30 Haw. at 704. Our discussion here is thus confined to the prospective juror whose impartiality was challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">As the defendant avers, the record reflects the ambiguous and at times contradictory responses of the challenged juror to queries regarding her willingness to lay aside impressions or opinions formed from earlier media accounts. Still, \u201c[t]his is not unusual on <em>voir dire </em>examination, particularly in a highly publicized criminal case.\u201d <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1039 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Her opinions could hardly be characterized as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u201cstrong and deep impressions which close the mind against the testimony that may be offered in opposition to them.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 1. The following colloquy between the court and the prospective juror dispels the suggestion that she could not render a verdict based on the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">THE COURT: Have you formed some kind of an opinion as to what type of a person perhaps Mr. Graham might be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: No, not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">THE COURT: Are you willing to pul aside whatever you do know and be guided by what is offered in evidence at this trial in order to pass judgment upon Mr. Graham?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would try. I really don\u2019t know if I can positively say yeah, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">THE COURT: All right. Do you have some serious doubts about whether you will be able to be fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I really don\u2019t know. I really \u2014it\u2019s hard for me to say yes to that. I have serious doubts. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">THE COURT: Okay. Would you be able to follow the Court\u2019s instructions at the end of the trial? Are you pretty good about following instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">THE COURT: Now, whatever your opinions of the law may be, in the end I will be prescribing what law you arc to apply. And do you think you\u2019d be able to follow the instructions as I give them to you on what the law is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes, I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-15\">THE COURT: Basically, do you think that you can be fair to Mr. Graham?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-16\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I would try. I think I could try.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>We would have to say the defendant failed to meet his affirmative burden of raising a presumption of partiality. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Having found no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to excuse the challenged juror for cause, we proceed to the related claim of error in the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for continuance of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Ordinarily, \u201c[t]he granting of a continuance is within the discretion of the trial judge and is not reviewable except for abuse of that discretion. <em>The Queen v. Ah Kiao, </em>8 Haw. 466; <em>Territory v. Van Dalden, </em>33 Haw. 113; <em>see also </em>Annotation, 39 A.L.R.2d 1321-1324.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Gager, 45 Haw. 478, 488, 370 P.2d 739, 745 (1962). But we are not dealing with a garden-variety motion for continuance of trial; for what was sought of the trial court was a postponement necessitated by \u201cthe strong possibility that the jury would be prejudiced by pretrial publicity.\u201d In other words, the defendant asserted his right to a fair trial was imperiled by adverse publicity and the trial should be put off until the passage of time dissipated the high potential for prejudice. As we observed earlier, \u201c[t]he constitutional standard of fairness [applicable'to a jury trial] requires that a defendant have \u2018a panel of impartial... jurors.\u2019 <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S., at 722.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799 (1975). If pretrial publicity rendered the impanelment of such persons unlikely, a continuance was hardly a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Yet, \u201cextensive knowledge in the community of either the crimes or the putative criminal is not sufficient by itself to render a trial constitutionally unfair.\u201d <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 303 (1977). Nor docs \u201cjuror exposure to information about a ... defendant\u2019s prior convictions or to news accounts of the crime with which he is charged alone presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tively deprive[] the defendant of due process.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. at 799. \u201cIn those cases [where] the influence of the news media, either in the community at large or in the courtroom itself, pervaded the proceedings[,]\u201d however, unfairness can be presumed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The Supreme Court thus presumed \u201cthe circumstances under which the trials in <em>Rideau </em>[v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723 (1963)], Estes [v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532 (1965)], and <em>Sheppard </em>[v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333 (1966)], were held[]\u201d rendered the proceedings unfair. <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. at 798-99. \u201cIn each of these cases, [the] Court overturned a state-court conviction obtained in a trial atmosphere that had been utterly corrupted by press coverage.\u201d Id. at 798.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where media influence is not so pervasive as to render a trial presumptively unfair, however, \u201cthe burden of showing essential unfairness [must] be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside, and ... it [must] be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.\u201d <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 281 (1942); <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>369 U.S. 541, 558 (1962); <em>Darcy v. Handy, </em>351 U.S. 454, 462 (1956). For \u201c[i]f the mere opportunity for prejudice or corruption is to raise a presumption that they exist, it will be hard to maintain [a] jury trial under the conditions of the present day.\u201d <em>Holt v. United States, </em>218 U.S. at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The convictions here, of course, were not \u201cobtained in a trial atmosphere that had been... corrupted by press coverage.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. at 798. The record reflects the trial was not \u201clacking in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>solemnity and sobriety to which a defendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of fairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799. And juror exposure to the purportedly prejudicial media accounts of what happened to the defendant and his daughter occurred six months before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The record further indicates the trial judge personally examined those prospective jurors who had been exposed to the media coverage. He apparently was satisfied from their responses that a jury of impartial persons could be impaneled, and we cannot say his assessment was manifestly wrong. We would have to say the defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Proceeding from the foregoing unproved assertion of unfairness to the defendant\u2019s claim of error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress the recordings of his telephone conversations with a police agent, we begin our analysis by reviewing our rulings in <em>State v. Lester, </em>64 Haw. 659, 649 P.2d 346 (1982), and <em>State v. Okubo, </em>67 Haw. 197, 682 P.2d 79 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">What the defendant would have us condemn was described as \u201cconsensual eavesdropping\u201d or \u201cparticipant monitoring\u201d in <em>State v. Lester, </em>64 Haw. at 663, 649 P.2d at 350. The incriminating statements the defendant sought to suppress there were made in the course of a conversation he had in a public park with a co-defendant, who unbeknownst to him was a government agent. The conversation was recorded by an electronic recording device concealed on the co-defendant\u2019s person. <em>Id. </em>The defendant sought to exclude the recorded conversation on grounds that the warrant-less taping breached the Fourth Amendment, \u201carticle I, sections 6 and 7 of the Hawaii State Constitution],] and [Hawaii Revised Statutes] chapter 803, part IV (Supp. 1981) (\u2019\u2019Electronic Eavesdropping\u201d)].]\u201d 64 Haw. at 662, 649 P.2d at 350 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">A plurality of this court concluded no constitutional or statutory violation occurred because \u201cone of the parties was a willing participant [who] consented to the eavesdrop]]\u201d and the \u201coverwhelming weight of authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>[has] upheld these warrantless consensual or participant eavesdrops.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 649 P.2d at 350. Relying on <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 427 (1963), <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. 745 (1971), and <em>United States v. Caceres, </em>440 U.S. 741 (1979), the plurality reasoned no Fourth Amendment violation was involved because \u201cthe government agent [was] free to testify to what was heard and the tape merely preserve[d] his credibility[.]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lester, </em>64 Haw. at 664, 649 P.2d at 351. It also saw \u201cno compelling reason to afford greater minimum protection\u201d under the State Constitution in the situation at hand. <em>Id. </em>at 665, 649 P.2d at 352. Nor did it \u201cfind merit [in the defendant\u2019s] argument that the use of the recording device by the government constituted \u2018bugging,\u2019 in violation of [the provisions of] Hawaii\u2019s Wiretap Law [which were then in effect].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 649 P.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Two years later, warrantless \u201cconsensual eavesdropping\u201d was reviewed by this court \u201c[b]ecause of the change in the composition of [the] court,\u201d and the reasoning of the plurality in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lester </em>was adopted by the majority in <em>State </em>v. <em>Okubo. </em>67 Haw. at 200, 682 P.2d at 81. Thus, the recording of a private conversation with the consent or cooperation of a participant is not subject to constitutional regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The defendant, however, avers a reconsideration of this court\u2019s position is \u201cespecially appropriate in light of the facts in this case which show that the monitoring was not a simple matter of attaching a listening device directly to the phone of the cooperating individual, but a much more complicated procedure involving a three-way conference monitoring by [a detective] from the police department.\u201d He argues \u201cthe complicated conference call monitoring used... in this case was not specifically approved in <em>Okubo </em>and should not be tolerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\"><em>Okubo, </em>however, represents an acceptance and affirmation of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Lopez, White, </em>and <em>Caceres, </em>the essence of which is captured in the following passage from <em>White:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">If the conduct and revelations of an agent operating without electronic equipment do not invade the defendant\u2019s constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, neither does a simultaneous recording of the same conversations made by the agent or by others from transmissions received from the agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to whom the defendant is talking and whose trustworthiness the defendant necessarily risks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">401 U.S. at 751. Whether monitoring is subject to constitutional regulation or not, therefore, does not turn on the complexity of the procedure employed, and we find no compelling reason to review this court\u2019s position on \u201cconsensual eavesdropping\u201d or \u201cparticipant monitoring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The defendant\u2019s succeeding point of error covers the denial of his other motion to suppress evidence, one which sought the suppression of evidence seized from his apartment on the ground that.the warrant for the search was defective. The warrant, he claims, was defective because \u201cthe State authorities had no valid basis for questioning [his] child and . . . whatever information [they obtained] should not have been released to [the] police for criminal investigative purposes without a court order[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">We begin our discussion of this claim of error with a look at the statute empowering the Department of Human Services (DHS) to investigate reports of harm, imminent harm, and threatened harm to a child, HRS \u00a7 587-21(a). On March 3,1987, when the department received a report concerning the defendant and his daughter, the subsection in relevant part read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">Upon receiving a report that a child has been harmed, is subject to imminent harm, or is threatened harm, the department shall cause such investigation to be made in accordance with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>chapter as it deems to be appropriate. In conducting the investigation the department may enlist the cooperation of police officers for phases of the investigation for which they arc better equipped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">HRS \u00a7 587-21(a) (1985). The subsection now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">Upon receiving a report that a child is subject to imminent harm, has been harmed or is subject to threatened harm, the department shall cause such investigation to be made in accordance with this chapter as it deems to be appropriate. In conducting the investigation the department may enlist the cooperation of police officers or other appropriate law enforcement authorities for phases of the investigation for which they are better equipped and the department may conduct a criminal history record check concerning an alleged perpetrator of imminent harm, harm, or threatened harm to a child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">HRS \u00a7 587-21 (a). The department, therefore, is obliged to investigate any report of harm or threatened harm to a child. If the situation involves criminal activity the department is authorized to enlist the collaboration of the police, who obviously are better equipped to investigate reports of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The defendant does not question the department\u2019s authority to investigate reports of harm befalling children. But he maintains \u201cthere was \u2018no reasonable cause\u2019 to believe that [his] child was in dangcr[]\u201d and this court \u201cshould not permit evidence obtained [in the investigation] to be released without court order.\u201d Absent family court approval for the release of the information, he avers, \u201cthe information [the department] obtained from [his] daughter and passed on to [the police] was in effect the fruit of a poisonous tree and should not have been permitted to be used to provide the basis for a search warrant affidavit.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Samuel P.

But the defendant has not demonstrated in a convincing manner that the right of privacy guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions includes the right of a parent to be free of searches based on information supplied by his child. <em>See State v. Mueller, </em>66 Haw. 616, 630, 671 P.2d 1351, 1360 (1983) (A freedom protected under the constitution must \u201cbe one \u2018ranked as fundamental\u2019 in the concept of liberty that underlies our society.\u201d). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the State authorities had reason to question the child and to seek further evidence of his involvement in crime on the basis of what they learned from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Finding no merit also in the remaining points of error raised by the defendant, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\"> This was written into our law as early as 1807 when \u201cMr. Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>Burr\u2019s Trial </em>(1 Burr\u2019s Trial, 416), state[d] the rule [was] that \u2018light impressions, which may fairly be presumed to yield to the testimony that may be offered, which may leave the mind open to a fair consideration of the testimony, constitute no sufficient objection to a juror; but that those strong and deep impressions which close the mind against the testimony that may be offered in opposition to them, which will combat that testimony and resist its force, do constitute a sufficient objection to him.\u2019\u201d <em>Reynolds v.

Prospective jurors represent a cross section of the community, and their education and experience vary widely. Also, unlike witnesses, prospective jurors have had no briefing by lawyers prior to taking the stand. Jurors thus cannot be expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>invariably to express themselves carefully or even consistently. Every trial judge understands this, and under our system it is that judge who is best situated to determine competency to serve impartially. The trial judge properly may choose to believe those statements that were the most fully articulated or that appeared to have been least influenced by leading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-18\"><em>Patton </em>v.

But we conclude the term \u201cnarcotics paraphernalia commonly associated with the use and storage of controlled substances\u201d was not so imprecise as to vitiate the warrant and the inclusion of erroneous information about the use of cocaine by the defendant in the supporting affidavit did not invalidate the warrant \u2014 the rest of the information in the affidavit was more than sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\"> The novelty of the issue and the paucity of authority supporting the defendant\u2019s argument on this point led us to order the submission of supplemental briefs discussing the issue.
