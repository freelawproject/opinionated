Finding substantial evidence to support the conviction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">During an undercover police stakeout fronting the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki, Officer Angut observed Defendant approach and solicit passers by. He saw Defendant approach, speak to, and accompany a man into a nearby parking lot. At the jury waived trial, Officer Angut testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">[A]t this time I observed \u2014 after having a conversation with the Caucasian male, I observed Halmos retrieve from his waistband area a clear, plastic bag containing greenish, brown, vegetable-like matter resembling marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Officer Angut then observed the man place the plastic bag into his pants pocket and give Defendant money which Defendant put into his pocket. Officer Angut arrested Defendant and retrieved $35.00 from his pocket.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officer Angut then observed a fellow officer retrieve the cleat plastic bag from the man\u2019s pocket. The State introduced the money inte evidence but without explanation failed to introduce the bag containing the imitation controlled substance. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case. Defendant moved for Judgment of Acquittal on the ground of insufficieni evidence. The motion was denied. The defense chose to rest without introducing any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that his conviction was not based upon substantial evidence because the Slate failed to produce the clear plastic bag containing the imitation controlled substance and failed to introduce testimony by the person who conducted the Duquenois test.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In a bench trial, a lower court\u2019s determination will be affirmed if \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the S tatc, there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>60 Haw. 540, 542, 592 P.2d 810, 811 (1979) (citations omitted); <em>State v. Sujohn, </em>5 Haw. App. 459, 461, 697 P.2d 1143, 1145 (1985). Even if it could be said that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as there is substantial evidence tending to support the requisite findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tamura, </em>63 Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">As trier of fact, the judge is free to make all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence, <em>see State v.

The State produced Officer Angut\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that he believed the substance in the plastic bag was marijuana and that Duquenois lest results on the substance were negative. Although the State\u2019s case would have been stronger with the presentation of the plastic bag and its contents as well as testimony by the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>administering the Duquenois test, despite the lack of this presentation, we cannot say that the trial judge did not have substantial evidence to convict Defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AW\"><em>Susan Barr, </em>Deputy Public Defender, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A4\"><em>Peter Van Name Esser (Vickie L.
