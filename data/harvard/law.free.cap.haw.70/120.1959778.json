We granted certiorari to review the Intermediate Court of Appeals\u2019 decision affirming the lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Respondent Insurance Company of North America (INA) on the issue of stacking. We affirm the intermediate court\u2019s conclusion that stacking should be denied under these facts, however, we disagree with the intermediate court\u2019s reasoning in applying the principle of \u201creasonable expectations\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Petitioner, a police officer employed by the City and County of Honolulu, was struck and injured by an uninsured motorist while occupying his privately owned, but City subsidized automobile. The vehicle was insured under a single \u201cBusiness Auto Policy\u201d providing uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $25,000 per vehicle for 1,106 vehicles. The premium in the amount of $3.00 per vehicle was paid by the City. The intermediate court characterized the policy as a commercial fleet policy, however, the \u201cBusiness Auto Policy\u201d in the instant case does not meet the intermediate court\u2019s definition of a \u201cfleet\u201d policy. The intermediate court defined a fleet policy as one \u201ccovering a number of vehicles owned by a business or government entity.\u201d Here, the vehicles are owned by individual police officers, not by the City. Also, unlike the typical fleet policy in which the employer is the named insured, here, the City employees are also named insureds due to the unique practice in this state for motor patrolmen to use their own automobiles in performance of their official duties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Respondent INA paid Petitioner the $25,000 policy limit on the uninsured motorist coverage, but refused any further recovery based on stacking. The trial court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of stacking and granted Respondent\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">On appeal the intermediate court affirmed the trial court, holding that stacking was not permitted under these circumstances. The intermediate court reached that result by applying the principle of \u201creasonable expectation,\u201d concluding that it was unreasonable for either the City or Petitioner to expect that the $3.00 charge for uninsured motorist coverage for each vehicle would afford Petitioner coverage for all of the vehicles included in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Alp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Petitioner contends that the intermediate court\u2019s decision is inconsistent with this court\u2019s prior rulings allowing the stacking of uninsured motorist benefits under a single policy covering more than one automobile. He claims that the \u201cBusiness Auto Policy\u201d in this case covering 1,106 vehicles is no different from the personal automobile policies involved in previous stacking cases. We disagree since we find that fundamental differences exist between the circumstances of this case and those of our prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">This court has, on several occasions, considered the \u201cstacking\u201d of uninsured motorist insurance coverage under a single multi-vehicle policy. <em>In Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. Morgan, 59 Haw. 44, 575 P.2d 477 (1978), the claimant was permitted to stack three separate coverages under her father\u2019s policy even though she was injured in a fourth independently owned automobile. Similarly, in <em>American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Takahashi, </em>59 Haw. 59, 575 P.2d 881 (1978), the claimants (husband, wife and daughter) were injured while occupying the daughter\u2019s car. All three were allowed to recover aggregated benefits under a policy owned by the father covering two vehicles not involved in the accident. And in <em>Estate of Calibuso </em>v. <em>Pacific Ins. Co., </em>62 Haw. 424, 616 P.2d 1357 (1980), three passengers were permitted to recover against aggregated benefits under their host\u2019s policy covering three automobiles. <em>Calibuso </em>declined to distinguish between \u201cclasses\u201d of insureds to favor the named insured and relatives of the same household over persons occupying the automobile. The guiding principle underlying all of these decisions was to effectuate the legislative intent of the uninsured motorist statute HRS \u00a7 431-448 \u201cto protect innocent victims of financially irresponsible drivers.\u201d 62 Haw. at 430, 616 P.2d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Petitioner argues that the issue in this case was settled by <em>Morgan, Takahashi, </em>and <em>Calibuso </em>which permitted named insureds and passengers to stack coverages under personal automobile insurance policies. He also claims that to deny stacking in this case would be inconsistent with the legislative intent of HRS \u00a7 431-448 as we have construed it. We disagree. When a court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle. Where the facts are essentially different, however, <em>stare decisis </em>does not apply, for a perfectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>sound principle as applied to one set of facts might be entirely inappropriate when a factual variance is introduced. 20 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Courts </em>\u00a7 191 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The facts in <em>Morgan, Takahashi, </em>and <em>Calibuso </em>are fundamentally different from the situation we must now consider in this case. None of these decisions addressed the issue of stacking uninsured motorist coverages provided to a large group of unrelated insureds by a common employer. The INA policy in the instant case is not a personal automobile insurance policy covering a number of vehicles owned by an individual. Rather, it is a group policy insuring over one thousand vehicles which are connected only by the common fact of ownership by City employees. Given these fundamental factual differences, we do not find our prior decisions to be controlling here. Any assumption that these decisions stand for the broad contention that uninsured motorist coverages must be allowed to be stacked in <em>all </em>cases, is unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The public policy considerations underlying our prior decisions do not warrant extending the stacking principle to the group policy in this case. In <em>Palisbo v. Hawaiian Ins. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>57 Haw. 10, 15, 547 P.2d 1350, 1354 (1976), we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">We recognized that \u201c[t]he avowed purpose of the statute is to encourage self-protection against the financially irresponsible motorist through <em>voluntary insurance.\" Id. </em>We examined the legislative history of the uninsured motorist statute, HRS \u00a7 431-448. According to the legislature, the purpose of the law was \u201cto promote protection through voluntary insurance, for persons who are injured by uninsured motorists who cannot pay for personal injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents.\u201d Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 194, in 1965 House Journal, at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Allowing injured persons to recover by stacking benefits under a personal automobile insurance policy is consistent with the legislative purpose. We do not find, however, either by statutory provision or compelling precedent, that public policy in Hawaii requires uninsured motorist benefits to be aggregated under a group policy covering 1,106 unrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>vehicles. To allow stacking in this case fora total of S27 million dollars in uninsured motorist coverage would not serve to promote the statutory purpose and may even undermine it. Sucha dramatic increase in exposure may well lead to increased premiums causing employers such as the City and County of Honolulu to decline to purchase voluntary uninsured motorist coverage at all. While the principle of \u201cstacking\u201d was initially created by this court to serve the public interest, it need not be extended indefinitely to the point where it no longer serves that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While we are in accord with the result reached by the intermediate court that stacking should not be permitted in this case, we disagree with the intermediate court\u2019s reasoning in applying a rule of \u201creasonable expectation\u201d to stacking of uninsured motorist coverage. Contrary to the intermediate court\u2019s assertion, we did not apply the principle of \u201creasonable expectation\u201d in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>and we find it unnecessary to adopt such a rule in the present case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor do we address the question of commercial fleet policies at this time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We simply hold that the public policy considerations underlying the principle of stacking of uninsured motorist coverage do not warrant extending that principle to a \u201cBusiness Auto Policy\u201d covering 1,106 vehicles separately owned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>motor patrolmen of the Honolulu Police Department. Our holding is a narrow one applying to the unique factual pattern presented in this instant case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-_\"><em>Norman K. K.

Co., </em>67 Haw. 203, 684 P.2d 960 (1984), we were faced with a question of interpretation of the terms of an insurance contract. We said that insurance policies \u201care to be construed in accord with the reasonable expectations of a layperson.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 684 P.2d at 964. The instant case does not present such a question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We note, however, that other jurisdictions addressing the issue of stacking in the commercial fleet context have almost unanimously denied stacking. Even states which have permitted stacking of uninsured motorist coverage under an individual\u2019s personal policy have refused to extend stacking to fleet policies. <em>See, e.g., Lambert </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>331 So. 2d 260 (Ala. 1976); <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>495 So. 2d 682 (Ala. App. 1986); <em>Ohio Casualty Ins.
