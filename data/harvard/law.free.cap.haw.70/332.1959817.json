LARRY JOSEPH WACKER, Defendant-Appellee</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b364-5\">NO. 13257</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b364-7\">(CR.NO. 87-1193)</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b364-8\">MARCH 15, 1989</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b364-9\">LUM, C J., NAKAMURA, PADGETT, HAYASHI, AND WAKATSUKI, JJ.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b364-13\">OPINION OF THE COURT BY</p>\n<author id=\"AxP\">PADGETT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">This is an appeal by the State from an order dismissing a charge for driving under the influence, under HRS \u00a7 291^1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">In this case, appellee was charged under both HRS \u00a7 291-4(a)(l) and 291-4(a)(2). The two charges were tried together as required under HRS \u00a7 701-109(2). At the trial, appellee was acquitted of the offense under subsection (a)(1), but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge under subsection (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">The court below believed that, under HRS \u00a7 701-111(1), it was required to dismiss the charge under HRS \u00a7 291-^t(a)(2), rather than conduct a retrial. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">HRS \u00a7 701-109(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-18\">Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode, if such offenses are known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction of a single court.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"ALT\"><em>Lila B. LeDuc, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVF\"><em>R. Steven Geshell, </em>on the brief for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">But for the section just quoted, appellee could have been tried separately on the offenses under HRS \u00a7 291-4(a)(l) and -4(a)(2). In that event a mistrial, resulting from the lack of agreement by the jury in either trial, would have resulted in a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The construction placed by the court below, on HRS \u00a7 701-111(1), leads to an untenable result, which frustrates the purpose of HRS \u00a7 701-109(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">HRS \u00a7 701-111 obviously was intended to deal with a new prosecution, commenced after a termination of a prior prosecution, and termi-. nated as defined in that section. It was not intended to deal with a situation where there were multiple counts, under different statutes, in an original prosecution, which were tried together as required by statute, resulting in an acquittal on some of the counts, and a mistrial on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Appellee also raises a constitutional contention of double jeopardy. However, we follow <em>State </em>v. Arakaki, 7 Haw. App. _, 744 P.2d 783 (1987), and find no double jeopardy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"ABv\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
