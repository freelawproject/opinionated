In denying the Prosecutor\u2019s Motion to Compel Production of Documents, the lower court ruled that the subpoena powers granted to the Prosecutor by sections 8-104 and 13-114 of the <em>Revised Charter of the City and County of Honolulu </em>(1984) (Honolulu Charter) impermissibly conflicted with section 28-2.5 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) (Supp. 1987) as it gave the Prosecutor \u201cgreater investigative and broader, unlimited subpoena powers than the Attorney General from whom the Prosecuting Attorney derives his authority.\u201d We agree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">On July 6, 1987, Petitioner-Appellant Charles F. Marsland, the Prosecuting Attorney for the City and County of Honolulu (Prosecutor), signed and issued an administrative subpoena duces tecum to Respondent-Appellee First Hawaiian Bank (FHB) seeking bank records relating to two persons under criminal investigation for embezzlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>and theft of a trust account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, neither of the suspects had been indicted. FHB refused to honor the subpoena duces tecum on the basis that it was signed by the Prosecutor and not the clerk of the court. Consequently, on July 13,1987, the Prosecutor filed a Motion to Compel Production of Documents pursuant to Honolulu Charter \u00a7\u00a7 8-104 and 13-114.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 6,1987, the court denied the Motion to Compel from which the Prosecutor brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AHt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Prosecutor argues that HRS \u00a7 28-2.5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not limit its subpoena powers authorized by Honolulu Charter \u00a7 13-114 because (1) the Prosecutor does not derive his prosecutorial power from the Attorney General and therefore HRS \u00a7 28-2.5 does not apply to the Prosecutor; and (2) the Prosecutor\u2019s subpoena power relates to the \u201cadministrative structure and organization\u201d of the City and County of Honolulu and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>fore is superior to HRS \u00a7 28-2.5 under the \u201chome rule\u201d provision of the Hawaii State Constitution, article VIII, section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The Attorney General is the chief legal officer for the State of Hawaii and has the ultimate responsibility for enforcing penal laws of statewide application. <em>Amemiya </em>v. <em>Sapienza, </em>63 Haw. 424, 427, 629 P.2d 1126, 1129 (1981); HRS \u00a7\u00a7 28-1 and -2. The Attorney General, however, has delegated to the county prosecutors the primary authority and responsibility for initiating and conducting criminal prosecutions within their respective county jurisdictions. <em>Amemiya, </em>63 Haw. at 427, 629 P.2d at 1129. Honolulu Charter \u00a7 8-104(b); HRS \u00a7 62-71(1) (1985). Thus, the Prosecutor\u2019s authority to investigate, initiate and conduct criminal prosecutions within the City and County of Honolulu is derived directly from the authority of the Attorney General.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The authority of the Attorney General includes the power to investigate violations of slate penal laws by issuanceof investigating subpoenas. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 28-2.5(1). The Attorney General\u2019s authority to subpoena, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>however, is not unlimited. The legislature provided for two procedural safeguards in the issuance of subpoenas to assure fairness to persons under investigation and to opposing parties. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 44-86, in 1986 House Journal, at 932. HRS \u00a7 28-2.5(l)(B) requires that when the Attorney General serves a subpoena pursuant to a general investigation, \u201cit shall attach to the subpoena a short and plain statement of the recipient\u2019s rights and procedures for enforcing and contesting the subpoena.\u201d And \u00a7 28-2.5(2)(A) provides that \u201cwhen the matter under investigation is the subject of a civil or criminal adjudication, or when the attorney general or a designated subordinate, determines that an adjudication is more probable than not, the office of the attorney general shall be subject to the relevant rules of court and shall exercise subpoena powers no different than those available to the probable opposing party.\u201d These two provisions, enacted by the legislature in 1986, are expressly designed to prevent the inappropriate use of investigating subpoenas by government officials charged with the responsibility of investigating violations of state law. <em>See </em>Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 44-86, in 1986 House Journal, at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In contrast, the Honolulu City Charter provision authorizing the Prosecutor to issue investigating subpoenas has no similar procedural safeguards. Instead, Honolulu Charter \u00a7 13-114 broadly authorizes the Prosecutor \u201cto issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents,\u201d and to apply to the court to \u201ccompel obedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ence\u201d to the subpoena. The provision also empowers the court to punish, \u201cas a contempt of the court, any refusal to comply therewith without good cause shown therefor.\u201d Honolulu Charter \u00a7 13-114 therefore grants the Prosecutor greater subpoena powers than those granted to the Attorney General by HRS \u00a7 28-2.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The question thus presented is whether the Prosecutor, having derived its authority from the Attorney General, possesses greater investigating subpoena powers than those granted to the Attorney General. Logic requires we answer in the negative. As previously stated, the Prosecutor\u2019s power to investigate state penal law violations is derived solely from the authority of the Attorney General. Consequently, the limitations imposed on the Attorney General\u2019s investigating subpoena powers by HRS \u00a7 28-2.5 apply to and define the outer limits of the Prosecutor\u2019s subpoena powers. We therefore hold that to the extent Honolulu Charter \u00a7 13-114 authorizes subpoena powers broader than or inconsistent with the subpoena powers authorized in HRS \u00a7 28-2.5, Honolulu Charter \u00a7 13-114 is invalid. HRS \u00a7 70-105 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We hold that pursuant to HRS \u00a7 28-2.5(2)(A), the Prosecutor could not execute an investigating subpoena without being subject to the relevant rules of court. Consequently, the Prosecutor\u2019s subpoena was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The Prosecutor contends that Honolulu Charter \u00a7 13-114 is entitled to constitutional protection under the \u201chome rule\u201d provision of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii, article VIII, section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Article VIII of the Hawaii State Constitution defines the relationship between the state and county governments. Article VIII, section 1, authorized the state legislature to create the counties and grant the counties such powers as they deem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Article VIII, section 2, however, authorized the counties to exercise \u201chome rule\u201d by providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">Each political subdivision shall have the power to frame and adopt a charter for its own self-government within such limits and under such procedures as may be provided by general law. Such procedures, however, shall not require the approval of a charter by a legislative body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Charter provisions with respect to a political subdivision\u2019s. executive, legislative and administrative structure and organization shall be superior to statutory provisions, subject to the authority of the legislature to enact general laws allocating and reallocating powers and functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">A law may qualify as a general law even though it is inapplicable to one or more counties by reason of the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Under this provision, the framers granted to the counties the power to enact ordinances concerning the \u201cstructure and organization\u201d of county government. <em>City &amp; County v. Ariyoshi, </em>67 Haw. 412, 415, 689 P.2d 757, 761 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">However, as we stated in <em>HGEA </em>v. <em>County of Maui, </em>59 Haw. 65, 85, 576 P.2d 1029, 1041 (1978), \u201cthe constitutional protection afforded county governments, against legislative intrusion is far from total.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Article VIII, section 6, of the Hawaii Constitution provides: \u201cThis article shall not limit the power of the legislature to enact laws of <em>statewide concern.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In <em>Ariyoshi, </em>we stated that \u201cin order to give effect to section 6, the power of the legislature to enact laws of statewide concern regarding local self-government cannot be diminished.\u201d 67 Haw. at 416, 689 P.2d at 761. Therefore, although article VIII, section 2, created \u201chome rule,\u201d it did not repeal section 6 which reserves matters of statewide concern to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Consistent with article VIII, section 6, the state legislature in HRS \u00a7 50-15 (1985) expressly retained the \u201cpower to enact all laws of general application throughout the State on matters of concern and interest.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2x\">The Hawaii Penal Code, being of general application throughout the state, is a law of statewide concern within the meaning of article VIII, section 6, of the Hawaii State Constitution. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 701-106 (1985). When the Prosecutor conducts prosecutions for offenses against the laws of the state pursuant to Honolulu Charter \u00a7 8-104(a), it does so on behalf of all the people of the State of Hawaii. <em>See Territory of Hawaii </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>19 Haw. 162 (1908). Accordingly, how violations of state penal laws are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>vestigated by authorized state and county officials is inherently also a matter of statewide concern constitutionally reserved for the legislature.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AcL\"><em>Peter Van Name Esser, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for MovantAppellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ASf\"><em>William C. McCorriston (Scott G. Leong, </em>with him on the brief) for Party-In-Interest-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The subpoena duces tecum is an important investigatory tool of the government. <em>See </em>81 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Witnesses </em>\u00a7 14 (1976). The availability of that tool to government officials investigating violations of the Hawaii Penal Code is defined by the legislature in HRS \u00a7 28-2.5 (1985). That law grants the government broad subpoena powers in conducting general investigations. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 28-2.5(l)(A). But as noted above, the law also extends important procedural protections to the target of the investigating subpoena. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 28-2.5(l)(B) and (2)(A); and Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 44-86, in 1986 House Journal, at 932. The legislature intended \u00a7 28-2.5 to apply statewide to ensure that investigating subpoenas used in enforcing state penal laws are applied uniformly throughout the state, regardless of which county a criminal investigation is conducted in. We therefore hold that \u00a7 28-2.5 is a law of statewide concern within the meaning of article VIII, section 6, of the Hawaii State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The subpoena duces tecum commanded FHB to provide to the Prosecutor the following materials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">[A]ny and all signature cards, all account statements; current addresses and phone numbers of all account holders for account #79-020958 in the name of MAR-GO HAW AD TAX SERVICE, MAR-GO HAWAII TRAVEL; RICHARD B[.] GOEAS AND MARGUERITE G.
