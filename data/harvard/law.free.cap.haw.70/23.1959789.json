Having reviewed the record of proceedings in the circuit court, we conclude the jury should have been instructed as requested by the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">The indictment brought by the Grand Jury of the First Circuit charged Manuel Lira with two counts of Rape in the First Degree and one count of Kidnapping.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence adduced by the prosecution to support the charges indicated that shortly after noon on October 8, 1985, Camille Springer and Victor Malgarejo went to Queen\u2019s Beach at Wai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>kiki, intending to spend the afternoon swimming and sunbathing. Miss Springer saw the defendant, whom she had known for several months, upon arriving at the beach. When her companion left at about 2:00 p.m., the defendant and his friend, Ed Calderon, joined her. And the three of them whiled away several hours drinking tequila and orange juice.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">At about 6:00 p.m., Miss Springer remembered she had to call a prospective employer, and the three left the beach and walked toward Kapiolani Park in search of a telephone. After she completed the call, they sat in the park and drank some wine. Miss Springer then decided to look for Victor Malgarejo. The two males said they would accompany her, and the defendant suggested a \u201cback route\u201d out of the park, leading the group toward the North end of the park. When they reached a secluded area near the Honolulu Zoo, the defendant urged Miss Springer to take a path he said was a \u201cshort cut\u201d to Kalakaua Avenue. She did as he directed, but Calderon apparently did not. When she reached the end of the pathway, the defendant was waiting for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Miss Springer told the jury the defendant then \u201cgrabbed [her] by [the] shoulders and threw [her] to the ground.\u201d She said she wanted to scream but the defendant prevented her from doing so by putting his hand in her mouth, pushing her face to the ground, and threatening her with harm if she did. And she said the defendant then pulled off the towel she had around her waist and tore away the bottom of her two-piece bathing suit The complaining witness testified the defendant subsequently \u201cinserted his finger inside [her] vagina[] [a]nd then he inserted his penis inside [her].\u201d She managed to free herself thereafter and sought help.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Miss Springer\u2019s account of what happened on October 8,1985 differed in significant respects from what was recounted for the jury by the defendant and Calderon. In the defendant\u2019s account, the crucial encounter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>took place at the North end of Kapiolani Park, where he, Calderon, and Miss Springer had gone to finish the wine; it occurred after Calderon left them to go to a restroom. The complaining witness, the defendant said, \u201cput her hand on [him] and [they] started making out[.]\u201d She then suggested they \u201cget down.\u201d This invitation to engage in intercourse, he claimed, was rejected because the pain he was experiencing from a broken jaw sustained the night before rendered it impossible for him to have an erection. She nevertheless persisted in her efforts to arouse him but failed. When he suggested that she might turn to Calderon, she reacted by calling him vile names. Lira admitted slapping Miss Springer when this occurred, but he denied inserting his penis in her vagina at any time and said he did not believe he put a finger in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Calderon\u2019s testimony generally supported Lira\u2019s; he said he \u201csnuck up\u201d on Miss Springer and Lira upon returning from the restroom, hid behind a bush, and listened to their conversation. He too said Miss Springer was enraged by the defendant\u2019s suggestion that she might do better with someone else. And Calderon testified that he emerged from his hiding place in time to see Miss Springer move hostilely toward Lira and Lira grab and push her.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">At the close of evidence, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts. The circuit court acquitted him of Kidnapping but submitted the offenses of Rape in the First Degree to the jury for determination. The jury instructions sought by the defendant included two dealing with \u201cconsent,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but neither was given. The jury found the defendant guilty of the two offenses, and he perfected a timely appeal to this court from the judgment of conviction entered by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Where, as in this appeal, the defendant in a criminal case avers an instruction covering a defense he raised at trial was refused in error, the claim must be considered in the light of a rule that he \u201cis entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory of defense having <em>any </em>support in the evidence, provided such evidence would support the consideration of that issue by the jury, no matter how weak, inconclusive or unsatisfactory the evidence may be.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Daniel, </em>62 Haw. 518, 527-28, 616 P.2d 1383, 1390 (1980) (citations omitted) (original emphasis). And the initial inquiry is whether the defense purportedly supported by the evidence is recognized as a defense under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The appellant urges the evidence presented to the jury entitled him to an instruction on consent \u201cGenerally, it may be said that consent by the victim is not a defense in a criminal prosecution.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 57, at 408 (1972). The Penal Code, however, provides that \u201c[i]n any prosecution, the victim\u2019s consent to the conduct alleged, or to the result thereof, is a defense if the consent negatives an element of the offense or precludes the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.\u201d HRS \u00a7 702-233 (1985). Thus, we turn to the offense and unlawful conduct alleged in the indictment to see if consent might have negatived an element of Rape in the First Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Rape at common law was \u201cthe act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of ten years by force without the consent and against the will of the victim.\u201d <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464, 468-69, 157 A.2d 922, 924 (1960) (citation omitted); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Cutrer, </em>140 La. 34, 35, 72 So. 800, 800 (1916) (quoting 33 Cyc. pp. 1415, 1416). Prior to the adoption of the Penal Code, the crime was defined in the Hawaii Revised Statutes as encompassing \u201ccarnal intercourse with any female, by force and against her will[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 768-61 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When Manuel Lira allegedly raped Camille Springer theapplicable code provision, HRS \u00a7 707-730(l)(a)(i), described the offense as the intentional engagement \u201cin sexual intercourse, by forcible compulsion, with another person[.]\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Yet it cannot be inferred from the substitution of \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d for \u201cwithout the consent and against the will of the victim\u201d that consent was no longer considered a defense to the crime. For a provision of the Penal Code reiterates \u201cthe general view that the victim\u2019s consent to the defendant\u2019s conduct... is a defense if it negatives an element of the offense (e.g., consent to sexual intercourse on charge of rape)[.]\u201d HRS \u00a7 702-233 (1985), Commentary. We agree with the framers of the code that testimony of the victim\u2019s consensual attitude, if worthy of belief, could only have a tendency to refute evidence that she was forcibly compelled to engage in sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The State, however, would have us rule the defendant was not entitled to an instruction on consent since he did not admit having intercourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>with the complaining witness and denied \u201cany penetration whatsoever,\u201d \u201cthe testimony of numerous impartial witnesses[]\u201d disproved consent, \u201cthe victim\u2019s recitation of the events was consistent\u201d with the injuries she sustained, and \u201cthe evidence of sperm in the victim supported her testimony that\u201d there was penetration. It maintains \u201cthe instructions given to the jury were adequate and based upon the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d We cannot say the State\u2019s theses are utterly devoid of merit. We are convinced, nevertheless, that an instruction covering consent was in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The State implies the trial court\u2019s decision not to instruct the jury on consent was correct because the defendant ought not be allowed both to deny there was intercourse or penetration and to rely on consent as a defense. Still, as we observed, the defendant in a criminal case tried beforea jury \u201cis entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory of defense having <em>any </em>support in the evidence,... no matter how weak, inconclusive or unsatisfactory the evidence may be.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Daniel, </em>62 Haw. at 527-28, 616 P.2d at 1390 (citations omitted) (original emphasis). But, of course, \u201cwhere evidentiary support for the asserted defense, or for any of its essential components, is clearly lacking, it would not be error for the trial court either to refuse to charge on the issue or to instruct the jury not to consider it. <em>See United States v. Gosser, </em>339 F.2d 102, 109-110 (6th Cir. 1964).\u201d <em>State v. Horn, </em>58 Haw. 252, 255, 566 P.2d 1378, 1380-81 (1977). The applicable test, therefore, is one of a presence or an absence of evidentiary support for a defense, not one of a consistency of defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u201cIt is quite true that a defendant has the right to argue inconsistent defenses... <em>\u2019\u2019Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>426 F.2d 651, 656 (D.C. Cir. 1970), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>401 U.S. 846 (1971); and he would be entitled to have the jury instructed on ostensibly inconsistent theories of defense if there is evidence supporting the theories. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, _, 108 S. Ct. 883, 886 (1988) (denial of one or more elements of the offense and entrapment); <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 162 U.S. 313, 322 (1896) (manslaughter and self-defense); <em>cf. Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>(the defense in a rape case was permitted to argue that the act did not take place and that the victim consented). He would be entitled also to an instruction on a defense fairly raised by the evidence, though it may be inconsistent with the defense he advanced at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>53 Haw. 254, 271-72, 492 P.2d 657, 667-68 (1971); <em>State v. Irvin, </em>53 Haw. 119, 121, 488 P.2d 327, 328 (1971). A seeming inconsistency of defenses thus did not preclude an instruction on consent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Nor was there reason not to give an instruction because evidence of \u201csexual intercourse, by forcible compulsion\u201d was overwhelming. Though \u201c[t]he evidence might appear to the [trial] court to be simply overwhelming [on an issue], so long as there was some evidence relevant to the issue ..., the credibility and force of such evidence must be for the jury, and cannot be [a] matter of law for the decision of the court.\u201d <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 162 U.S. at 315; <em>see also State v. </em>Warner, 58 Haw. 492, 497, 573 P.2d 959, 962-63 (1977); <em>Territory </em>v. Alcantara, 24 Haw. 197, 205 (1918). And we are obliged to \u201cconstrue the evidence in the case in a light most favorable to the appellant in determining whether or not the instruction should [have been] given.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Daniel, </em>62 Haw. at 528, 616 P.2d at 1390-91 (citations omitted). Viewing the evidence in this light, we would have to say there was evidence to support the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The State\u2019s alternative position that \u201cthe instructions given ... were adequate[,]\u201d however, is not one we can lightly dismiss. That the \u201crefusal or giving of requested instructions must be interpreted, or considered, in connection with the entirety of the court\u2019s charge to the jury[]\u201d is a well-settled principle. <em>State v. Travis, </em>45 Haw. 435, 437, 368 P.2d 883, 885 (1962) (quoting <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Aquino, </em>43 Haw. 347, 380 (1959); <em>accord State v. Motta, </em>66 Haw. 254, 258, 659 P.2d 745, 749 (1983)). Where the charge given by the trial court apprised the jury of the State\u2019s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every material element of the crime charged, including that of the identity of the defendant as the person responsible for the crime, we held the omission of specific instructions on the alibi defense presented by the appellant was not error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordeira, </em>68 Haw. 207, 212, 707 P.2d 373, 377 (1985). The alibi defense, we said, \u201cwas meant to raise a doubt [about] the identity of the culprit[]\u201d and \u201cthe court\u2019s instructions dealt adequately with this aspect of the casc[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Since the defense here was meant to raise a doubt that Camille Springer was forcibly compelled to engage in intercourse and the jury was advised of the State\u2019s heavy burden with respect to forcible compulsion, the instructions in this case arguably were adequate too.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">But in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordeira, </em>we found upon a review of the record that the instructions tendered by the defendant \u201ccould have had a burden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>shifting effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 707 P.2d at 377.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Were they given, the charge to the jury would not have \u201cfairly and clearly presented the law as favorable to the defendant as he was entitled to under the testimony and evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Aquino, </em>43 Haw. at 380. Consequently, \u201c[w]e [could not] fault the trial court for rejecting [the] instructions[.]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cordeira, </em>68 Haw. at 211, 707 P.2d at 376-77. Here, Defendant\u2019s Instruction No. 5 merely reiterated HRS \u00a7 702-233; it carried no suggestion of his burden to show there was consent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3\"><em>Charles B. Fey, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ArB\">G. <em>Cher Foerster, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Viewing the testimony of the defendant and Ed Calderon in the most favorable light, as we must, we conclude there was evidentiary support for the proposition that defendant was granted consent by the complaining witness to engage in sexual intercourse prior to the acts alleged in the rape counts. Thus, he was entitled to an instruction on consent, and the trial court erred in rejecting Defendant\u2019s Instruction No. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The judgment of the circuit court is vacated, and the case is remanded for a new trial on the two counts of Rape in the First Degree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-13\"> We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim that his right to a speedy trial was violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-14\"> In 1985, when Manuel Lira allegedly raped Camille Springer, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 707-730(1)(a)(i) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-15\">Rape in the first degree.
