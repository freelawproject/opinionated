Torres appeals from his conviction for Possession of a Firearm by a Person Convicted of Certain Crimes under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 134-7(b). The issue on appeal is whether the lower court violated the Confrontation Clause by admitting into evidence the post-arrest statement of a co-defendant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>did not testify at trial. Under the circumstances, we do not find that the admission of the extrajudicial statements violated Appellant\u2019s right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 14, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii. Finding no merit to Appellant\u2019s other contention, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">On August 21,1986, Appellant and Ryanson Aki (Aki) were both indicted by the Grand Jury for Burglary in the First Degree in violation of HRS \u00a7 708 \u2014 810(l)(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was also indicted for Possession of a Firearm by a Person Convicted of Certain Crimes in violation of HRS \u00a7 134-7(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant and Aki were tried jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">At trial, Cusa Hall, a fourteen year old runaway, testified for the State that on April 17,1986, Appellant drove him and Aki to a beach-front home which he and Aki burglarized, taking a shotgun and various other items.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the burglary, Aki left to call Appellant who was at the nearby beach. Aki returned with Appellant who drove his car to where Hall was waiting. The shotgun was placed in the trunk of Appellant\u2019s car, but Hall could not recall if he saw Appellant place the weapon in the trunk. Appellant then drove to three houses where he offered to sell the stolen goods to his acquaintances. Hall testified that, at the second home visited, Appellant removed the shotgun from the trunk and offered it for sale to a man who declined to purchase the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>After his arrest, Aki confessed to his involvement in the burglary to Detective Louis Marrero. Aki, however, pled not guilty and chose not to take the stand at trial. Consequently, Aki\u2019s statement was introduced into evidence through the testimony of Detective Marrero. Aki\u2019s statement was redacted to remove references to Appellant by name. Detective Marrero testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">Q: All right. What did he [Aki] say about his involvement in that [the burglary] at the very beginning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">A: He said that he had met with Cusa Hall at Hau Bush. He informed me that they decided that they were going to burglarize the house. He said that they were driven to this location by another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">Q: Now, did he say anything about how he happened to discover this house or find out about this house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">A: He said that the <em>other </em>person, the same person that drove \u2019um there had mentioned to him that he \u2014 the <em>other person </em>knew that the house would be vacant. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACWp\">Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the testimony referring to another person, which the trial court sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Shortly thereafter, the prosecutor asked Detective Marrero what Aki said when he went to the nearby beach to get a car after the burglary. In response, Detective Marrero began to testify that Aki stated that \u201che told a person,\u201d at which point the prosecutor immediately cut off Detective Marrero\u2019s testimony by admonishing him not to \u201ctell us anything about another person, just what he [Aki] said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Detective Marrero further testified that Aki told him that after the burglary, he was driven by car to three homes where attempts were made to sell the stolen goods. And at the second home visited, the shotgun was displayed to the prospective buyer. Aki\u2019s version of the events subsequent to the burglary therefore conformed to the testimony of Cusa Hall, except that Aki\u2019s statement did not reveal who displayed the gun or offered it for sale at the second home.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Appellant was the only defense witness. On the stand, Appellant admitted taking Aki and Hall to the beach on April 17,1986; admitted assisting the pair in attempting to find potential buyers for the shotgun and a video cassette recorder by driving them to the homes of potential buyers; and admitted selling the shotgun for cash the following day. Appellant, however, denied that he knew the goods were stolen; denied that he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the shotgun was in the trunk of his car; and denied the existence of the second home where he allegedly removed and displayed the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Appellant argues that his sixth amendment right to confrontation was violated by the combined effect of the post-arrest statement by Aki that referred to \u201canother person,\u201d and Hall\u2019s testimony that Appellant displayed the shotgun to the occupant of the second home visited. Thus, although Aki\u2019s statement was redacted to avoid reference to Appellant by name, the testimony by Hall would give the jury grounds to infer that Appellant was the unnamed person in Aki\u2019s statement who displayed the gun to the potential buyer at the second home.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968), the Supreme Court held that a defendant is deprived of the sixth amendment right of confrontation when the facially incriminating confession of a non-testifying co-defendant is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider the confession only against the co-defendant. 391 U.S. at 126, 88 S. Ct. at 1622, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 479. The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\"><em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 135-136, 88 S. Ct. at 1627-28, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pastushin, </em>58 Haw. 299, 568 P.2d 504 (1977), we discussed and adopted the <em>Bruton </em>decision. In that case, we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction after finding that the co-defendant\u2019s police statement, \u201cmore than any other evidence,\u201d \u201cdirectly and pointedly\u201d implicated the defendant in the commission of the offense charged. 58 Haw. at 300, 303, 568 P.2d at 505, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Here, Aki\u2019s statement did not directly implicate Appellant. The references to \u201canother person\u201d did not mention anyone by name, and no part of the confession actually referred to Appellant by name. Aki\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ments, therefore, only became incriminating when linked with Hall\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Supreme Court has recently addressed the permissibility under <em>Bruton </em>of \u201cevidentiary linkage\u201d connecting a defendant with a co-defendant\u2019s statement, so that the co-defendant\u2019s statementindirectly implicates the defendant. <em>See Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S. Ct. 1702, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1987). In <em>Marsh, </em>the Court held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession with a proper limiting instruction when, as here, the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to her existence.\u201d 481 U.S. at 211, 107 S. Ct. at 1709, 95 L. Ed. 2d at 188. In a footnote, however, the court added that it expressed no opinion as to the admissibility of a confession \u201cin which the defendant\u2019s name, has been replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun,\u201d the situation presented in this case. <em>Id. </em>at n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Applying the principles of <em>Bruton, </em>we do not find that the admission of Aki\u2019s confession violated Appellant\u2019s right to confrontation. Aki\u2019s references to another person related only to the burglary charge, of which he was acquitted, and not to the felon in possession conviction being appealed from here. Therefore, we cannot say that Aki\u2019s confession \u201cpowerfully incriminated\u201d Appellant in the possession charge. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 135, 88 S. Ct. at 1628, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 485. Nor can we say that it was Aki\u2019s statement, \u201cmore than any other evidence,\u201d which established before the jury that Appellant illegally possessed the shotgun. <em>Pastushin, </em>58 Haw. at 303, 568 P.2d at 506. Accordingly, we hold that the admission of Aki\u2019s statement into evidence did not violate Appellant\u2019s right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 14, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Moreover, even if the admission of Aki\u2019s confession referring to \u201canother person\u201d violated <em>Bruton, </em>the admission of the statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Cruz </em>v. <em>New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 193, 107 S. Ct. 1714, 1719, 95 L. Ed. 2d 162, 172 (1987); <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 23 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1969); <em>Pastushin, </em>58 Haw. at 303, 568 P.2d at 506.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Wayne M. Rooney </em>for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AMJ\"><em>Caroline Mee (Willard J. Peterson </em>on the brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 7(b), under which Appellant was convicted, can be violated by owning, possessing, or exercising control over a firearm. Appellant\u2019s own admission at trial that he sold the gun on April 18,1986 was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he exercised \u201ccontrol\u201d over the shotgun within the meaning of \u00a7134-7(b). Thus, even if the admission of Aki\u2019s confession was constitutionally imperfect, that violation was rendered harmless by Appellant\u2019s own admission at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> Before submitting the case to the jury, the court entered a judgment of acquittal as to Appellant in the Burglary count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> HRS \u00a7 134 \u2014 7(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">(b) No person who is under indictment or who has waived indictment for, or has been convicted in this State or elsewhere of having committed a felony, or any crime of violence, or of the illegal sale of any drug, shall own or have in the person\u2019s possession or under the person\u2019s control any firearm or ammunition therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Appellant had been previously convicted of a felony, to wit, Burglary in the Second Degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\"> Hall, being a juvenile offender, was not tried with Appellant and Aki in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\">DISSENTING OPINION OF</p>\n<author id=\"AWF\">WAKATSUKI, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">I respectfully dissent</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">In <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968), the United States Supreme Court held that it was constitutionally impermissible to admit into evidence the hearsay confession of a co-defendant in a joint trial when that co-defendant does not take the stand, and when that confession powerfully incriminates the other defendants. There, the co-defendant\u2019s confession directly and facially incriminated the defendant Bruton.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">In <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S. Ct. 1702, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1987), the Supreme Court considered the constitutional infirmity of admitting into evidence a co-defendant\u2019s confession when that confession is not incriminating on its face, but becomes incriminating when linked with other evidence introduced at trial. The Court held \u201cthat the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying co-defendant\u2019s confession with a proper limiting instruction when... the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to [the defendant\u2019s] existence.\u201d 481 U.S. at 211, 107 S. Ct. at 1709, 95 L. Ed. 2d at 176. In a footnote, the Court stated, \u201cWe express no opinion on the admissibility of a confession in which the defendant\u2019s name has been replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The situation which the Supreme Court expressly declined to address in <em>Marsh </em>is presented in this case. In a joint trial of Ryanson Aki and Appellant, Aki\u2019s confession was placed before the jury through the testimony of Detective Marrero. Aki did not take the stand. Aki\u2019s confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>was redacted to remove references to Appellant by name. Instead, references were made to \u201cthe other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Redaction in this case, however, did not make Aki\u2019s confession any less \u201cpowerfully incriminating.\u201d When Aki\u2019s confession was introduced at trial, Appellant had already been identified as the \u201cother person.\u201d Saying \u201cthe other person\u201d rather than Appellant\u2019s name did nothing to protect Appellant from the kind of prejudice which concerned the Supreme Court in <em>Bruton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In reaching its decision, the majority relies on the fact that Aki\u2019s confession did not directly implicate Appellant in the firearm charge. Nonetheless, Aki\u2019s confession cannot be deemed harmless to Appellant. At trial, the State\u2019s primary witness was Cusa Hall. Appellant was the sole defense witness. Appellant\u2019s testimony contradicted Hall\u2019s in a number of cmcial areas, one of them being whether Appellant had at one point opened the car trunk and removed the gun therefrom for the purpose of showing it to a potential purchaser. The jury had to decide who was more credible, Appellant or Hall. Aki\u2019s version of events as told by Detective Marrero closely tracked Hall\u2019s version. Since Hall\u2019s version was corroborated by Aki\u2019s story, and Appellant\u2019s version was not, the jury could likely have given credence to Hall\u2019s testimony rather than Appellant\u2019s. Aki\u2019s confession boosted Hall\u2019s credibility and Hall directly implicated Appellant on the firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Appellant was unable to test Aki\u2019s credibility before the jury because Aki did not take the stand. If, however, Aki\u2019s testimony had been shown to be incredible, Hall\u2019s credibility would not have been boosted to Appellant\u2019s detriment In <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that accomplice testimony is \u201cinevitably suspect.\u201d <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 136. The inability to test the credibility of such suspect testimony is precisely the prejudice that the Confrontation Clause aims to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The majority, in citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Pastushin, </em>58 Haw. 299, 568 P.2d 504 (1977), states that Aki\u2019s confession did not, \u201cmore than any other evidence,\u201d establish Appellant\u2019s guilt But <em>Pastushin </em>did not hold that a <em>Bruton </em>violation will be found only where the co-defendant\u2019s confession \u201cmore than any other evidence\u201d establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt. We have adhered to the proposition that \u201c[w]here there exists a reasonable possibility that a constitutional error of the trial court contributed to the conviction of the defendant, the error necessitates reversal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Amorin, </em>62 Haw. 356, 363, 604 P.2d 45, 49-50 (1979). A <em>Bruton </em>violation should not be subject to a different standard. On reviewing the entire record, I cannot say that the testimony admitted in violation of <em>Bruton </em>in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">I would hold that the admission of Aki\u2019s confession through Detective Marrero violated Appellant\u2019s constitutional rights under the Confrontation Clause pursuant to <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United </em>States, and that such error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">I would reverse Appellant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
