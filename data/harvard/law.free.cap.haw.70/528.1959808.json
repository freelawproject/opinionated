Grindles appeals from his conviction of Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor (DUI) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291-4(a)(l). Appellant claims that the district court erred in \u201cbifurcating\u201d the trial into separate hearings on the two methods of committing DUI described in \u00a7 291^4(a). We agree and therefore reverse the DUI conviction and remand for a new trial. Appellant also appeals his conviction of Disregarding a Traffic Control Signal in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-32(a)(2)(A) on the grounds that (1) he was charged under a different statute; and (2) \u00a7 291 C-32(a)(2)(A) contains no prohibitions which can be violated. We find no error and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The arresting officer observed Appellant enter an intersection against a red light in the early morning hours of February 15,1987. The light had turned from yellow to red just as Appellant crossed over the stop line, before the crosswalk. When he entered the intersection, however, the light was red. The officer pulled Appellant over, administered the field sobriety test, and placed Appellant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Appellant was charged with DUI in violation of HRS \u00a7 291^4(a) and Disregarding a Traffic-Control Signal in violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-32. Trial commenced in district court on September 7, 1988 at which time Appellant waived oral reading of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">After the State\u2019s direct examination of the arresting officer, the court announced its intention to bifurcate the hearing and take all testimony based on \u00a7 291 \u2014 4(a)(1). Then, if the State made a case under \u00a7 291-4(a)(1) (\u201cdriving while under the influence\u201d), the court would not take evidence under \u00a7 29l-4(a)(2) (\u201cdriving with a blood alcohol content exceeding 0.10 \u201d). Appellant objected and cross-examination of the officer proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">After the State finished putting on its case, the trial judge asked Appellant if he had any evidence to present in his defense under \u00a7 291^4(a)(l). The judge indicated that if he determined that the Stale proved its case under the \u00a7 291~4(a)(l) standard, he would not permit the State to proceed under \u00a7 291-4(a)(2). Appellant refused to present any testimony until the State had presented its entire case against him. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>objected on the ground that bifurcation would violate his federal and state guarantees against self-incrimination. The court then pronounced Appellant guilty of violating HRS \u00a7291-4(a)(l)andHRS \u00a7291C-32(a)(2)(A). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Appellant maintains that HRS \u00a7 29 l-^4(a) creates the single offense of \u201cdriving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d which is provable in two ways, and that the trial court erred in bifurcating the two methods of proof. The State agrees that the statute describes one offense, but argues that the trial court was within the bounds of its discretion in bifurcating the trial. Because of conflicting dicta in our prior decisions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we briefly address the question of whether HRS \u00a7 291-4(a) creates separate offenses or one offense provable in two ways. We conclude that the statute sets forth one offense with alternative methods of proof, and that the trial court\u2019s action in compelling Appellant to put on his evidence prior to the conclusion of the State\u2019s evidence violated his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Although Appellant did not raise on appeal any due process claim, \u201cthe power to <em>sua sponte </em>notice \u2018plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights\u2019 clearly resides in this court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>61 Haw. 475, 482, 605 P.2d 75, 79 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">HRS \u00a7 291-4(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">\u00a7 291-4 Driving under influence of intoxicating liquor, (a) A person commits the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>(1) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of the operation of any vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">(2) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of the operation of any vehicle with 0.10 per cent or more, by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">A plain reading of the statute convinces us that the legislature sought to prohibit one offense \u2014 driving while one is influenced by alcohol. The statute provides that a person commits <em>the </em>offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor if the person\u2019s conduct falls into one of two categories; (1) driving while under the influence <em>or (2) </em>driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.10 or more. A blood alcohol content of at least .lOpercent is one method of proving the influence of alcohol. <em>See State </em>v. Brown, 109 Idaho 981, 712 P.2d 682 (Idaho Ct. App. 1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hernandez, 339 Pa. Super. 32, 488 A.2d 293 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Franco, </em>96 Wash. 2d 816, 639 P.2d 1320 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Subsections (1) and (2) were created when the legislature amended HRS \u00a7291^1(a)in 1983 to add the provision that DUI could be proven by blood alcohol content. According to the legislative history, the bill provides that \u201c[t]he defendant shall be deemed under the influence of intoxi- . eating liquor if he has ten-hundredths per cent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood.\u201d Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 591, in 1983 House Journal, at 1105. Subsection 291-4(a)(2) simply sets out an alternative method of proving the offense established by the DUI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">We conclude, therefore, based on the plain language of the statute and its legislative history, that HRS \u00a7 291-4(a) provides two alternative means of proving the single offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">We next consider Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in \u201cbifurcating\u201d the DUI trial, thus compelling him to present his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>before the conclusion of the State\u2019s evidence. We agree and conclude that the trial court\u2019s action in bifurcating the two methods of proof provided in \u00a7 291^(a) into separate trials violated Appellant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The concept of fairness is inherent in the requirement of due process of law. \u201cAs applied to a criminal trial, denial of due process is the failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.\u201d <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S. Ct. 280, 290, 86 L. Ed. 166, 180 (1941). In our legal system, the entire burden of proving criminal activity rests on the State. Due process guarantees the defendant an absolute, unqualified right to require the State to prove its case against him. \u201c[The burden of proof] is on the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial, and applies to every element necessary to constitute thecrime.\u201d State v. Cuevas, 53 Haw. 110, 113, 488 P.2d 322, 324 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">While we have recognized that the trial court has wide discretion to control the order of proof at trial, <em>State v. Alfonso, </em>65 Haw. 95, 99, 648 P.2d 696, 700 (1982), such discretion does not extend to the action taken by the trial judge in this case. The judge ordered Appellant to present his defense to the DUI charge before hearing all of the State\u2019s evidence against him. We find that such a departure from the well-established order of proof in criminal cases is fundamentally unfair and is not a matter within the discretion of the trial court. Therefore, we hold that in a trial for violation of HRS \u00a7 291-4(a), where the State intends to present proof under both subsection 291 \u2014 4(a)(1) and subsection 291-4(a)(2), the defendant has an absolute right to hear all of the State\u2019s evidence against him prior to putting on his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We further find that the trial court\u2019s actions in this case improperly burdened Appellant\u2019s right against self-incrimination in violation of the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution. In <em>Brooks v. Tennessee, </em>406 U.S. 605, 92 S. Ct. 1891, 32 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1972), the United States Supreme Court recognized a defendant\u2019s constitutional interest in controlling the timing and sequence of evidence in his defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">It must often be a very serious question with the accused and his counsel whether he shall be placed upon the stand as a witness, and subjected to the hazard of cross-examination, <em>a, question that he is not required to decide until, upon a proper survey of all the case as developed by the state, </em>and met by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>witnesses on his own behalf, he may intelligently weigh the advantages and disadvantages of his situation, and, thus advised, determine how to act. Whether he shall testify or not; if so, at what stage in the progress of his defense, are equally submitted to the free and unrestricted choice of one accused of crime, and are in the very nature of things beyond the control or direction of the presiding judge. Control as to either is coercion, and coercion is denial of freedom of action. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 608, 92 S. Ct. at 1893, 32 L. Ed. 2d at 361 (quoting <em>Bell v. State, 66 </em>Miss. 192, 5 So. 389 (1889)). The Court held that a state statute requiring a defendant who wishes to testify to be the first witness in his defense violated his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. Such a rule \u201ccasts a heavy burden on a defendant\u2019s otherwise unconditional right not to take the stand,\u201d 406 U.S. at 610-11, 92 S. Ct. at 1894, 32 L. Ed. 2d at 363, and violates the right of the accused and his counsel to decide \u201cwhether, and when in the course of presenting his defense the accused should take the stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 92 S. Ct. at 1895, 32 L. Ed. 2d at 364. Implicit in the Court\u2019s decision is that the defendant has an absolute right to hear the <em>State\u2019s </em>case against him before deciding whether or not to testify in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellant was entitled to have the State present its entire case against him under HRS \u00a7 291^4(a) before presenting any evidence in his defense or deciding whether or not he himself should take the stand. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s action in bifurcating the alternative methods of proof and requiring Appellant to defend against a portion of the State\u2019s case under \u00a7 291-4(a) was error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Finally, we address Appellant\u2019s contention that he was erroneously convicted of an offense with which he was not charged. Appellant argues that he was found guilty of violating HRS \u00a7 291C-32(a)(2)(A) (\u201cSteady Yellow Indication\u201d), but was charged with a \u201cred light violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit. The record indicates that he was charged with a violation of HRS \u00a7 291C-32. If Appellant wanted to narrow the charge, he had the option of moving for a bill of particulars under HRPP Rule 7(g). Moreover, the record shows that Appellant waived the reading of the charge when he appeared in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Nor do we find merit in Appellant\u2019s argument that HRS \u00a7 291C-32(a)(2)(A) is only a \u201cwarning\u201d and not a provision that can be violated. The statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">(a) [T]he lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">(2) Steady yellow indication:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">(A) Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when <em>vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">(3) Steady red indication:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">(A) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown, except as provided in the next succeeding paragraphs. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">Subsection (2)(A) clearly prohibits entering an intersection against a red light. Since the undisputed evidence indicates that Appellant entered the intersection when the light was red, he was properly convicted under \u00a7 29 lC-32(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Earle A.

Appellant was not subjected to double jeopardy, however, since the trial court adjudicated him guilty at the conclusion of the State\u2019s proof under \u00a7 291-4(a)(l), and did not proceed to hold a second hearing under \u00a7 291-4(a)(2). However, in the event the defendant is acquitted under \u00a7 291 \u2014 4(a)(1) and the court allows the State to proceed under \u00a7 291 \u2014 4(a)(2), the defendant will have been twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense in violation of article I, section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution and the eighth amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
