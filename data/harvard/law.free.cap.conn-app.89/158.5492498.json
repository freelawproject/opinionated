On appeal, he claims that the court (1) improperly considered the parties\u2019 finances in 1979 when fashioning its modification order and (2) impermissibly made its modification order retroactive to August 18, 1998. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The parties\u2019 marriage was dissolved on September 24, 1979. The judgment of dissolution incorporated the terms and provisions of a settlement agreement entered into by the parties. The agreement provided for unallocated alimony and child support to be paid to the plaintiff, with alimony payments to increase automatically beginning in August, 1982, by the lesser of 33.3 percent of the defendant\u2019s net income over $52,000 or 5 percent of the alimony payments to which the plaintiff was entitled for the previous calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">In 1989, the plaintiff filed a motion to modify the alimony order, which was denied. From that judgment, the plaintiff appealed and we affirmed. <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>25 Conn. App. 231, 593 A.2d 161, cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>220 Conn. 911, 597 A.2d 335 (1991). Seven years later, the plaintiff filed another motion to modify the alimony order. The motion, captioned \u201cMotion for Modification of Alimony,\u201d was left for abode service on August 18, 1998. In response, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the motion to modify on October 8,1998. On October 29, 1998, the plaintiff filed a request for leave to file an amended motion to modify. Following argument on those motions on November 2, 1998, the court granted both the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs request for leave to file an amended motion to modify. The plaintiff thereafter filed an amended motion to modify on November 13, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Almost four years later, on July 15, 2002, the plaintiff filed another motion to modify the alimony order. The matter ultimately was heard on November 25, 2002. Over the objection of the defendant, the court agreed to consider the plaintiffs November 13, 1998 motion. On February 26, 2003, the court filed a memorandum of decision in which it granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to modify the 1979 alimony order and ordered the defendant to pay weekly alimony in the amount of $1500. The court noted that it considered evidence of the change in the parties\u2019 circumstances from the 1979 dissolution and ordered the alimony modification effective retroactively from the date the original motion for modification was served, August 18, 1998. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly considered the parties\u2019 finances in 1979 when fashioning its modification order. Because the dissolution orders were self-modifying, he contends, the court \u201clooked back too far in its analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In reviewing a ruling on a motion to modify, we are mindful that \u201c[a] trial court is endowed with broad discretion in domestic relations cases. Our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>such decisions is confined to two questions: (1) whether the court correctly applied the law, and (2) whether it could reasonably have concluded as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lefebvre </em>v. Lefebvre, 75 Conn. App. 662, 664, 817 A.2d 750, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 921, 822 A.2d 243 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">As we noted in the plaintiffs previous appeal, \u201c[u]nder General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) as it existed at the time of the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, the plaintiff, to obtain a court ordered modification of alimony, must show a substantial change in circumstances that must not have been contemplated by the parties at the time the decree was entered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>supra, 25 Conn. App. 234. A dramatic increase in the income of one of the parties may constitute a substantial change in circumstances. That is precisely what the court found in the present case. As it stated: \u201cThe court concludes that the defendant\u2019s present earnings constitute a substantial change in circumstances, for the increase is dramatic, when compared to 1979, to the extent that neither party anticipated it would occur. In his testimony, the defendant admitted same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The dissolution orders entered by the court in 1979 incorporated the terms and provisions of a settlement agreement entered into by the parties. Because the agreement provided for annual adjustment to the periodic alimony beginning August 1, 1982, the defendant argues that the dissolution orders necessarily were self-modifying and self-executing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the alimony paid by the defendant has increased annually. The question is whether each such increase constitutes a modification of the dissolution orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">In <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>228 Conn. 729, 738, 638 A.2d 1060 (1994), our Supreme Court explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the power of the trial court to modify an existing order does not include the power to retry issues already decided. Thus, the court\u2019s inquiry \u201cis necessarily confined to a comparison between the current conditions and <em>the last court order.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. The court continued: \u201cApplicable to dissolution actions ... is the principle that <em>an adjudication by a court </em>having jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties is final and conclusive not only as to matters actually determined, but as to matters which the parties might have litigated as incident thereto and coming within the legitimate purview of the subject matter of the action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the self-executing alimony alterations constitute modifications of the dissolution orders is untenable. Those alterations were required not by a subsequent court order or adjudication by the court, but rather by the express terms of the settlement agreement incorporated into the 1979 dissolution orders. This court has held that \u201c[djecrees in a dissolution action cannot be modified by acts of the parties without further decree or order by the court.\u201d <em>Albrecht </em>v. <em>Albrecht, </em>19 Conn. App. 146, 151, 562 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 813, 565 A.2d 534 (1989). The record reveals no further decree or order by the court since 1979. For that reason, the court properly considered the parties\u2019 finances in 1979 when fashioning its modification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The defendant also claims that the court impermissibly made its modification order retroactive to August 18, 1998. Because the court dismissed the plaintiffs August 18,1998 motion, he argues that retroactive application to that date was improper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo order for periodic payment of permanent alimony or support may be subject to retroactive modification, except that the court may order modification with respect to any period during which there is a pending motion for modification of an alimony or support order from the date of service of notice of such pending motion upon the opposing party pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 52-50.\u201d The defendant contends that the August 18, 1998 motion was not a pending motion in light of the court\u2019s dismissal of that motion on November 2, 1998. We therefore focus our attention on the court\u2019s granting of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On October 8, 1998, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the August 18, 1998 motion to modify. In response, the plaintiff on October 29, 1998, filed a request for leave to file an amended motion to modify. On November 2,1998, after hearing argument from both parties, the court simultaneously granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and granted the plaintiff\u2019s amended motion to modify.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As in civil matters, the scope of the motion to dismiss in family matters is carefully circumscribed. It may be used to assert only \u201c(1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (3) improper venue, (4) insufficiency of process and (5) insufficiency of service of process.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 25-13. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss alleged none of those defects. Rather, it challenged the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The motion to dismiss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>therefore, was defective and should not have been granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, we note that the court dismissed the plaintiffs August 18, 1998 motion \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d while at the same time it permitted the plaintiff to file an amended motion. These actions further reinforce our conclusion that the August 18, 1998 motion remained a pending motion, as required by \u00a7 46b-86 (a). We accordingly conclude that retroactive modification was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\"> The defendant does not claim that incorporation of these terms into the dissolution orders precludes a motion to modify the alimony order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\"> The defendant also argues that the 1998 motion to modify was stale by the time it was addressed by the court. \u201c[W]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, 272 </em>Conn. 106, 153 n.19, 864 A.2d 666 (2004). Because the defendant has offered no analysis of his staleness claim, we decline to afford it review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Afo\"> The motion to dismiss alleged that (1) the motion to modify the alimony order \u201cdid not state clearly in the caption of the motion whether it is a pendente lite or a [postjudgment] motion,\u201d (2) the motion \u201cdid not state the specific factual and legal basis for the claimed modification nor did it include the outstanding orders and date thereof to which the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>modification is addressed,\u201d (3) the plaintiff \u201chad previously filed a motion to modify, which motion was heard and denied on March 20, 1990\u201d and (4) the motion \u201cfails to state a claim of an unforeseen change of circumstance not contemplated by the parties at the time of the agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-16\"> At oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff suggested that the defendant\u2019s motion was, in essence, a motion to strike. We recently held that a motion to strike is not a proper procedural vehicle to challenge the legal sufficiency of a posfjudgment motion. <em>Zirinsky </em>v. <em>Zirinsky, </em>87 <em>Conn. </em>App. 257, 268, 865 A.2d 488, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 916, 871 A.2d 372 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
