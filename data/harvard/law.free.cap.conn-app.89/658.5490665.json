Two substantially similar claims of corporate malfeasance were filed in Probate Court, one by the corporation itself and one by a shareholder purporting to act on behalf of the corporation. The shareholder appealed to the trial court from a Probate Court order denying his claim as untimely. The trial court dismissed the shareholder\u2019s appeal. The court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the shareholder had not alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate how he was aggrieved by the denial of a claim on behalf of the corporation when the corporation had itself filed such a claim. The shareholder has appealed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The plaintiff, David Doyle,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed an appeal to the trial court to challenge the decision of the Branford Probate Court denying as untimely<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his shareholder action against the estate of Thomas J. Abbenante, the deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>president of Ivy Biomedical Systems, Inc. (Ivy). On behalf of Ivy, the plaintiff alleged that the deceased had engaged in a number of acts of corporate misconduct for which his estate should be held accountable. The defendants were the three fiduciaries of his estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In response, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal. They maintained that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the plaintiff was not aggrieved by the decision of the Probate Court. Under General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a showing of aggrievement is a prerequisite to an appeal from probate. See <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>194 Conn. 635, 637, 484 A.2d 934 (1984). The existence of aggrievement depends on \u201cwhether there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest which he has in the estate has been adversely affected.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Although it found that the plaintiff had a legally protected interest in the estate,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it held that he had failed to allege in what manner the Probate Court\u2019s order had adversely impacted that interest. The claim filed by the plaintiff, derivative in nature,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was predicated on Ivy\u2019s unwillingness to pursue a probate claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>of corporate malfeasance by its deceased former president. In fact, however, the coiporation <em>did </em>file such a claim in the Probate Court. Accordingly, the court concluded that the plaintiff had not \u201csufficiently ailege[d] aggrievement within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-186 (a)----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff has raised two issues. He argues that (1) he sufficiently alleged that his interest in the estate was adversely affected by the Probate Court\u2019s denial of his claim because, in his view, Ivy had improperly settled its probate claim in a manner inconsistent with Ivy\u2019s best interests and (2) the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for reargument. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">AGGRIEVEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The plaintiffs principal contention is that, contrary to the determination of the trial court, he was aggrieved by the Probate Court\u2019s denial of the derivative claim that he had filed on behalf of Ivy in his own name and the other Ivy shareholders. Because lack of aggrievement implicates a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, it presents a question of law and our review is plenary. <em>Marchentine </em>v. <em>Brittany Farms Health Center, Inc., </em>84 Conn. App. 486, 491, 854 A.2d 40 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The trial court concluded that the plaintiff was not adversely affected by the denial of his probate claim because the allegations in his probate claim closely resembled those contained in the claim that already had been filed by Ivy. Their linguistic similarity is indeed striking.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One possible distinction is that only the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tiffs probate claim refers to an unspecified interaction between Ivy and Elliot Associates, but the plaintiff did not elaborate on the Elliot Associates claim in his appeal to the trial court or to this court. In other respects, Ivy\u2019s claim was broader than that filed by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The plaintiff maintains, however, that even if Ivy did file a proper claim, it did not pursue the claim with the required rigor. His argument centers on Ivy\u2019s disposition of litigation that Dawn Pappas, a former Ivy employee, had initiated with respect to the decedent\u2019s malfea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>sanee. In his view, it is <em>possible </em>that Ivy\u2019s management of Pappas\u2019 complaint short-changed Ivy and improperly enriched the decedent\u2019s estate. In his view, this possibility is sufficient to establish his aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The record discloses the following relevant facts. On May 6, 2002, when the Probate Court approved a final accounting filed by the defendants, the defendants did not acknowledge the claims previously filed by Ivy and by the plaintiff. Several months after the closing of the estate, Ivy filed a release relating to Pappas\u2019 claim. It also released the estate from liability for expenses arising out of Ivy\u2019s defense of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">This is <em>all </em>that we know about Ivy\u2019s alleged failure to pursue viable claims against the estate of the decedent. We know nothing about the nature or the strength of Pappas\u2019 complaint except that Pappas allegedly was employed by Ivy at a time when the decedent was Ivy\u2019s president. We do not know whether the Pappas claim related to an alleged breach of contract or a violation of her personal or work place rights, whether it was timely or whether it was substantively provable or proceduraily correct. Although the parties are not obligated to enlighten us about underlying claims that they choose not to litigate, they cannot expect us to fill in the gaps. Without some sort of a factual record, we cannot evaluate the propriety of Ivy\u2019s decision, \u201cfor \u2018good and sufficient\u2019 consideration,\u201d to release the estate from claims relating to the Pappas litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The responsibility for alleging a factual basis for aggrievement for the purpose of taking a probate appeal falls squarely on the person taking the appeal. <em>Merrimac Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>DiSesa, </em>180 Conn. 511, 516, 429 A.2d 967 (1980). In pursuit of his derivative claim,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>plaintiff was required to do more than speculate about the reason underlying Ivy\u2019s release of the estate. The right to judicial review of a probate claim because of a \u201cpossible\u201d injury to a protected interest is not a license to proceed on the basis of hypothetical occurrences for which there is no support in the allegations or record.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal from probate. The plaintiff failed to present the court with factual allegations sufficient to support his claim that Ivy was not fulfilling its corporate obligations to pursue the corporation\u2019s legitimate claims against the estate of its former president. Neither the trial court nor this court can fill this factual gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">REARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">In the plaintiffs alternate claim for reversal of the judgment of the trial court, he argues that the court abused its discretion by denying his motion for reargument. In his view, the court (1) misapplied the law of aggrievement and took too narrow a view of the facts alleged in his complaint, (2) failed to clarify the significance of the fact that the estate was closed while Ivy\u2019s claim and his own were still pending, (3) should have taken into account the discrepancy between Ivy\u2019s \u201cnarrow release of one of its claims\u201d against the estate and his own broader claims of breach of duty on the part of the decedent and (4) improperly required him to establish the probability that he would prevail as a part of demonstrating his aggrievement. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>As a general matter, in the absence of the discovery of some new facts or new legal authorities that could not have been presented earlier, the denial of a motion for reargument is not an abuse of the discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Opoku </em>v. Grant, 63 Conn. App. 686, 692-93, 778 A.2d 981 (2001). Accordingly, the plaintiffs disagreement with the court\u2019s evaluation of the factual record is not a sufficient basis for us to conclude that the court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs motion was an abuse of its discretion. The plaintiff, therefore, cannot prevail on his first three contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">At first glance, the plaintiffs fourth contention stands on a more solid footing because it raises an issue of law. It is undisputed that a showing of aggrievement does not depend on a showing of ultimate success in the underlying litigation. The proper test for dismissal of a probate appeal is whether, on examination of the pleadings, the court is persuaded that there is no <em>possibility </em>that a probate order has adversely affected a putative appellant\u2019s legally protected interest. See <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 637-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">It is, however, axiomatic that to prevail on a claim of law, an appellant must demonstrate that the trial court disregarded or misapplied the applicable principle. It is true that the court did not, in so many words, couch its dismissal of the plaintiffs appeal in terms of the possibility \u2014 or lack of possibility \u2014 that he might prevail. Nonetheless, the court properly focused its attention on the pleadings and not on their provability. Quoting <em>St. George </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>264 Conn. 538, 544-45, 825 A.2d 90 (2003), the court stated: \u201c[I]t is the burden of the party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor . . . clearly to <em>allege </em>facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) We do not presume error. A trial court\u2019s ruling is entitled to the reasonable presumption that it is cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>rect unless the party challenging the ruling has satisfied his burden of demonstrating the contrary. <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 7, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the judgment of the trial court must be upheld. We are persuaded that the court properly concluded that the plaintiff did not satisfy his burden of alleging facts sufficient to establish his aggrievement. In the absence of such allegations, the court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiffs probate appeal. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion for reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\"> We refer to Doyle as the shareholder who appealed to the trial court and as the plaintiff in this opinion, even though Dominic Caciopoli was a coplaintiff at trial. The interest of the coplaintiff is identical to Doyle\u2019s interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-360 (c), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f the fiduciary fails to reject, allow or pay the claim within ninety days from the date that it was presented to the fiduciary . . . the claimant may give notice to the fiduciary to act upon the claim . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">The Probate Court held that in the face of inaction by the fiduciary of an estate, a claimant himself must notify the fiduciary to accept or reject his claim.

Abbenante, Jr., and Patricia Abbenante, the surviving spouse and children of the decedent, whom the Probate Court had designated as fiduciaries of the estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any order, denial or decree of a court of probate in any matter, unless otherwise specially provided by law, may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> Although the trial court also considered the defendants\u2019 claim that the plaintiff and his coplaintiff at trial lacked standing to pursue a probate appeal, the trial court resolved that issue against the defendants. The defendants have not raised an issue of standing in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\"> The plaintiff characterizes his claim as individual as well as derivative, but none of the allegations contained in his appeal are individual in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\"> The plaintiffs probate claim alleged that Ivy \u201chas an unliquidated claim against the estate . . . for malfeasance and breach of fiduciary duty committed by [the decedent] while president of and director for that company. The undersigned shareholder along with other shareholders intends to commence a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit in the event that this claim is rejected by the Estate. This claim involves damages arising from the improper diversion of corporate assets to Dawn Pappas, an indemnification claim for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>liability arising out of the lawsuit brought against the Company and the Estate by Pappas, and damages arising from the self-dealing and misrepresentation engaged in by [the decedent] in entering into Ivy\u2019s transaction with Elliot Associates, and the use by [the decedent] of the proceeds of the Elliot transaction to eliminate the Company\u2019s bank line to recover his pledged collateral. . . . This claim will be prosecuted by one or more shareholders acting on behalf of the Company, because the Company\u2019s current Board of Directors is not willing to pursue this claim and further demand is futile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4E\">Ivy\u2019s probate claim alleged that \u201csubsequent to the Decedent\u2019s death, a former employee of [Ivy] . . .

This decision was part and parcel of the Probate Court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs claim was time barred.
