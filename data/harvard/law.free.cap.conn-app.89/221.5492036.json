We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On November 24,1996, the defendant participated in a gang related shooting in New Haven. The defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>a member of the Island Brothers street gang, drove behind an automobile being driven by Daniel Kelley. Either the defendant or an accomplice riding in his automobile fired on Kelley\u2019s automobile. Kelley sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder and lost control of his automobile, causing it to crash into two vehicles parked nearby. Kelley\u2019s passenger, Kendall Turner, a member of the Ghetto Boys street gang, sustained a gunshot wound to his elbow. The Island Brothers and the Ghetto Boys, both of which were involved in illegal activity, had a hostile relationship marked by gun violence between rival gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The following procedural history, evident from the record, is not in dispute. The defendant was arrested for the events underlying the conviction on December 5, 1996. The state filed a long form information on January 7, 1997, describing the date and time of the alleged crimes. On January 2,1997, the state served the defendant with a demand for notice of an alibi defense and filed the same with the court. The state therein made demand on the defendant to \u201cnotify the [s]tate, in writing, of his intention to offer a defense of alibi\u201d and, if he did intend to offer such defense, to \u201cstate, in writing, the specific place or places at which [he] claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and the names and addresses of the witnesses upon whom he intends to rely to establish such alibi.\u201d The defendant did not notify the state that he intended to rely on an alibi defense until nearly six years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The parties completed jury selection on December 5, 2002. The court informed prospective jurors at the time of voir dire that trial would commence on or about December 10, 2002, and last approximately three or four days. After trial related proceedings concluded on December 5, 2002, the defendant\u2019s attorney served via facsimile a notice of alibi to the prosecutor\u2019s office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The defendant filed the same with the court clerk on December 6, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 6, 2002, the state filed a motion to preclude the alibi testimony. The state argued that it was \u201cseverely prejudiced\u201d by the defendant\u2019s untimely disclosure of an alibi defense on the eve of trial and, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 506 A.2d 125 (1986), asked for an order precluding the alibi evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The court held a hearing on the state\u2019s motion on December 6, 2002. The defendant\u2019s attorney informed the court that he was not aware that an alibi defense existed until after court proceedings ended the day before. The defendant\u2019s attorney stated: \u201c[A]s we were leaving the courthouse yesterday, [the defendant] asked why I hadn\u2019t said anything about alibi, and I said that I don\u2019t recall ever hearing about the alibi. He assured me that in 1996, I think it was, when this case was brand new, that he had told me about an alibi. And I simply don\u2019t recall that, but I . . . can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t have an affirmative recollection that it didn\u2019t happen. I simply don\u2019t recall it at all. Obviously, based on that [conversation], I did what I was obliged to do, which was immediately prepare a notice of alibi defense, which I did fax over to [the prosecutor\u2019s] office . . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney responded to the state\u2019s motion by arguing, initially, that it was \u201cvery hard to imagine\u201d that the untimely notice could cause any prejudice to the state. The defendant\u2019s attorney stated that the alibi witness was \u201cwell known to the state to be the long-time companion of [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The prosecutor represented that the alibi witness was someone \u201cbrand new\u201d to him and that there was significant prejudice caused by the late notice. The prosecutor argued that in light of the six year span of time between the incident underlying the charges and the trial, the untimely disclosure effectively precluded the state from conducting a meaningful investigation into the alibi witness\u2019 story. The prosecutor argued: \u201c[S]ix years later, there is no possible way that [the state] could find any actual evidence to rebut the factual statements that may be made during the course of this alibi presentation.\u201d Further, the prosecutor noted that even as of December 6, 2002, the state still had not interviewed the alibi witness. He stated: \u201c[A]ll we know is that she claims to have been with him. We don\u2019t know what she claims to have done the rest of the day, what she was doing then, why they were together or any of that stuff.\u201d Further, the prosecutor argued that at such a late date, the alibi witness herself was the only source through whom the state could conduct meaningful discovery concerning the alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney responded to the prosecutor\u2019s arguments by indicating that the alibi witness likely would recall that she and the defendant were at home all day on November 24, 1996, caring for a sick infant. The defendant\u2019s attorney posited that the testimony was \u201cpretty straightforward\u201d and that it was \u201ca little hard ... to imagine that . . . the cross-examination of this witness would have been any different\u201d had the state had an earlier opportunity to investigate the alibi witness\u2019 stoiy. The defendant\u2019s attorney also argued that the state still had the opportunity to investigate the alibi witness and to take a statement from her. By means of a detailed oral decision, the court granted the state\u2019s motion, thereby precluding the defendant from calling any third party witness to support an alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The defendant claims that the court\u2019s ruling violated his right to present a defense under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right to present his own witnesses to establish a defense ... is a fundamental element of due process of law. . . . This includes the right to present alibi witnesses . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 704, 523 A.2d 451 (1987). \u201cThe sixth amendment right to compulsory process includes the right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, [and] is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerreta, </em>260 Conn. 251, 260-61, 796 A.2d 1176 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The record reflects that the defendant, while arguing against preclusion of the alibi evidence as a sanction for late disclosure under our rules of practice, did not distinctly raise a claim that such preclusion would deprive him of his constitutional right to present a defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the court did not address such a claim in its ruling. This court is not bound to consider claims that were not raised distinctly at trial unless they arose subsequent to trial or an extraordinary basis for review exists. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>60 Conn. App. 575, 578, 760 A.2d 948, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 922, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The defendant seeks review under the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>A.2d 823 (1989). We will review the claim because the record is adequate for review, and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. A court\u2019s preclusion of alibi evidence as a sanction for failure to comply with the rules of discovery does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights per se. If the court\u2019s preclusion of alibi evidence reflects a sound exercise of discretion, the defendant cannot claim that a constitutional violation exists. We will dispose of the claim under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong because the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists that clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201c[T]he right of a defendant to present a defense is subject to appropriate supervision by the trial court in accordance with established rules of procedure and evidence . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>228 Conn. 412, 426-27, 636 A.2d 821 (1994). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 209-16, our Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the trial court\u2019s authority to preclude alibi evidence as a sanction for a criminal defendant\u2019s failure to comply with our \u201cnotice of alibi\u201d discovery rules. The defendant in <em>Boucino </em>failed to comply with the notice requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 40-21 (then \u00a7 763) and untimely filed a notice of alibi. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 211. The trial court precluded the alibi evidence. Id. On appeal to our Supreme Court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the preclusion violated his sixth amendment right to present a defense. Id., 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Our Supreme Court held that in cases in which the preclusion of alibi evidence is justified under the rules of practice, the preclusion does not violate a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense. Id., 213-14. In reaching its holding, the court stated: \u201cThe sixth amendment does not confer the right to present testimony free from the legitimate demands of the adversary system. . . . The adversary system of trial is hardly an end in itself; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>it is not yet a poker game in which players enjoy an. absolute right always to conceal their cards until played. We find ample room in that system [for a notice of alibi rule] which is designed to enhance the search for truth in the criminal trial by insuring both the defendant and the State ample opportunity to investigate certain facts crucial to the determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The court then set forth considerations that the trial court must weigh when ruling on a motion to preclude alibi evidence for failure to comply with the rules of discovery concerning the alibi defense. \u201c[EJxclusion of alibi witnesses may not be justified in all cases where the defendant has failed to comply with the discovery rules. The trial court must weigh the need for exclusion against the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense. . . . The decision is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will turn on the facts of the particular case. Factors which the trial court must consider include: whether the disclosure violation was technical or substantial, the timing of the ultimate disclosure, the reason, if any, for the violation, the degree of prejudice to the parties respectively offering and opposing the evidence, whether any resulting prejudice might be cured by a postponement and, if so, the overall desirability of a continuance.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 40-21<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is not in dispute. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>properly noted that the notice of alibi was well beyond the twenty day time limit set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 40-21 in that the disclosure was nearly six years late. Practice Book \u00a7 40-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf a party fails to comply with disclosure as required under these rules, the opposing party may move the judicial authority for an appropriate order. The judicial authority hearing such a motion may enter such orders and time limitations as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation ... (4) [prohibiting the noncomplying party from introducing specified evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The court referred specifically to <em>Boucino </em>and discussed each of the factors set forth therein in granting the state\u2019s motion to preclude. First, the court found that the disclosure violation was substantial, rather than technical. In that regard, the court observed that the defendant had told the state \u201cnothing\u201d about the alibi witness until it filed its December 6, 2002 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Second, the court noted that although the relief sought by the state would cause prejudice to the defendant, the defendant\u2019s noncompliance caused a significant degree of prejudice to the state. Specifically, the court stated that efforts by the state to investigate the alibi were \u201calmost doomed to failure because of the extreme lateness of . . . the filing.\u201d In discussing the prejudice to the defendant, the court noted that its ruling did not preclude the defendant from testifying concerning the alibi, if he so decided.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Third, the court discussed whether any degree of prejudice incurred by the defendant because of its ruling might be cured by a postponement of the trial and whether a postponement was feasible. The court explained, in that regard, that it was concerned about the effect that any delay would have on the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>already had been selected for the trial, which was scheduled to begin in a matter of days. The court reminded the parties that the jury already had been selected for a \u201cspecific short period of time.\u201d At one point during argument on the state\u2019s motion, the court stated that had the notice of alibi been filed, \u201chowever belatedly, immediately prior to jury selection,\u201d it would have been more willing to explore the idea of continuing the proceedings. The court, however, stated: \u201c[Ujnder these circumstances, we\u2019ve chosen the jury. The jury has been chosen for a time certain, and we are approaching on the holiday season and any continuance, in my experience, would be catastrophic. I just don\u2019t believe that a continuance is reasonably possible in these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Fourth, the court considered the reason set forth for the timing of the disclosure. The court stated: \u201c[The] belated notice does not seem to me to have any reasonable excuse.\u201d The court also noted that the defendant had been present in the courtroom during jury selection and had heard his attorney read the list of potential witnesses to the prospective jurors, a list that did not include the name of the alibi witness. The court reasoned that the defendant reasonably could not have missed the mention of the witness\u2019 name. The court deemed the late notice to be nothing less than a \u201clast minute surprise\u201d by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The defendant first takes issue with the court\u2019s subordinate conclusion that the violation was substantial. The defendant posits that the violation was not substantial, but merely technical, because the disclosure occurred four days prior to the presentation of evidence in the trial. The defendant suggests that \u201c[t]he state had more than enough time to interview the [alibi] witness, investigate the rather simple nature of her claim, modify its opening statement if necessary and prepare for cross-examination.\u201d It is undisputed that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>did not disclose <em>any </em>information about the alibi witness until nearly six years after the state had filed its demand for alibi. We conclude that the violation clearly was substantial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>252 Conn. 714, 729, 751 A.2d 372 (2000) (holding violation to be substantial when disclosure of alibi witness occurred more than one year after state\u2019s demand for alibi); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 214 (holding violation to be \u201crather substantial\u201d when disclosure of alibi witness occurred two years after state\u2019s demand for alibi); <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>19 Conn. App. 111, 132, 562 A.2d 43 (1989) (holding violation to be substantial when disclosure of alibi witness occurred approximately three months after state\u2019s demand for alibi), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 215 Conn. 538, 577 A.2d 694 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly concluded that there was no good reason for the lateness of the disclosure. The defendant claims that \u201c[i]t is apparent from defense counsel\u2019s proffered reasons for the late disclosure that the timing of the disclosure was in no way structured to gain tactical advantage for the defense or to put the state at any disadvantage.\u201d The defendant argues that his counsel \u201csimply forgot\u201d that he had informed him of the alibi defense or \u201chad misplaced said information\u201d concerning his alibi defense. The defendant argues that the court\u2019s sanction for his counsel\u2019s \u201cinadvertent actions\u201d unjustly deprived him of his only defense and that the reason set forth for the late disclosure was \u201centirely plausible and eminently understandable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>At the hearing on the motion, the defendant\u2019s attorney represented that the defendant had told him about the alibi witness only one day earlier. He stated that he did not recall whether the defendant had told him about the witness previously and that his files did not reflect any information about the witness. The defendant\u2019s attorney related his client\u2019s belief that he had discussed the alibi witness with him at an earlier time and his own belief that his own inadvertence may have hurt his Ghent\u2019s defense. The court was not obliged to accept as true the representations of the defendant\u2019s attorney and, even if it did, it need not have concluded, as a matter of law, that the representations weighed against imposition of the sanction sought by the state. Contrary to the representations of the defendant\u2019s attorney, the court did not find that the defendant\u2019s counsel inadvertently had failed to disclose the defendant\u2019s alibi.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead, the court stated that \u201c[t]he only excuse I can think of is that [the defendant] may have just mentioned this to [his attorney], but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a reason for the excuse.\u201d The court went on to deem the failure to disclose to be a \u201clast minute surprise\u201d by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201cWhere disclosure is intentionally withheld, ordinarily there is no abuse of discretion in excluding proffered testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 215. \u201cIt is . . . reasonable to presume that there is something suspect about a defense witness who is not identified until after the 11th hour has passed.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 414, 108 S. Ct. 646, 98 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1988). If the alibi witness was, as the defendant argues, his only means of defense, it was not unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>able for the court to view with suspicion the disclosure of that evidence on the eve of trial. On the basis of the representations of the defendant\u2019s attorney as well as the court\u2019s evaluation of those representations, we are unable to disagree with the court\u2019s determination that the defendant failed to set forth a reason for the late disclosure that merited a denial of the state\u2019s motion to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The defendant also challenges the court\u2019s conclusion that the violation was prejudicial to the state. The defendant argues that disclosure occurred \u201cfour full days before the commencement of evidence\u201d and that his violation of the disclosure rules \u201cplaced [the state] in an advantageous position to attack said alibi defense.\u201d The defendant posits that had the court permitted the alibi evidence, the state would have been entitled to a juiy instruction concerning the late disclosure and would have been permitted to bring the impropriety of the late disclosure to the jury\u2019s attention. The defendant argues: \u201cThis would certainly provide a rich source for [the state\u2019s] cross-examination and a strong argument for the state to present to the jurors for their consideration. Viewed from this perspective, not only was the timing of the defense disclosure nonprejudicial to the state, it was, in fact, quite advantageous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Prejudice in this context is measured by a party\u2019s inability to investigate and to prepare for trial; it has nothing to do with a party\u2019s ability to point out to the jury its adversary\u2019s discovery violations. \u201c[T]he ends of justice will best be served by a system . . . [that] gives both parties the maximum possible amount of information with which to prepare their cases and thereby reduces the possibility of surprise at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>258 Conn. 42, 54, 779 A.2d 95 (2001). \u201cThe purpose of criminal discovery is to prevent surprise and to afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to prepare for trial.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson F., </em>77 Conn. App. 405, 419, 823 A.2d 406, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 905, 831 A.2d 254 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The court properly considered the likely detrimental effect of the late disclosure on the state\u2019s efforts to interview the alibi witness and to mount a late investigation on the eve of trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 729; <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 132. It cannot be disputed reasonably that the defendant\u2019s violation of the alibi notice rules deprived the state of a fair opportunity to investigate the alibi witness and her testimony. The admission of testimony from the alibi witness effectively would have required the state, through no fault of its own, to conduct a rushed investigation of a key witness disclosed merely days before trial. Another consequence of the lateness of the disclosure was that presentation of the testimony would have required the state to begin investigating a claim of alibi that occurred more than six years earlier. The passage of time would have negatively affected the state\u2019s ability to investigate the proffered alibi witness and her testimony. It was reasonable to conclude that the state was in a far better position to investigate the alibi evidence in January, 1997, than it was four days before trial in December, 2002. In light of the substantial nature of the violation, we do not take issue with the court\u2019s determination that presentation of the testimony significantly and unfairly would have prejudiced the state\u2019s ability to prosecute the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The defendant also claims that the degree of prejudice caused to him by the preclusion of the evidence was far greater than the degree of prejudice that the state would have suffered had the court permitted the evidence. The defendant argues that the preclusion of the evidence clearly deprived him of his right to present a defense and that the court\u2019s ruling had the effect of requiring him to take the witness stand if he wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>assert his alibi defense. The defendant argues that he had the burden of establishing an alibi defense, if he so decided, and that \u201c[wjhether the state\u2019s cross-examination [of his alibi witness] is more or less effective is immaterial compared to [his] overall right to present a defense.\u201d The defendant essentially discounts any prejudice caused to the state as well as his substantial violation of the rules of discovery. The defendant also overlooks the fact that in reaching its ruling, the court deemed his late disclosure to be anything but benign in nature. The factors that the court considered in ruling on the state\u2019s motion are not mutually exclusive. Under the defendant\u2019s rationale, a court never would be permitted to sanction a defendant by precluding an alibi witness because such preclusion implicates a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense. Our Supreme Court already has held that when the sanction is appropriate, its imposition does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Finally, the defendant claims that \u201c[t]he prejudice caused to both parties would have been eliminated had the court granted a continuance.\u201d The defendant suggests that the court failed to explore the possibility of selecting more jurors if the jurors selected could not bear a delay or, if the need arose, of \u201csimply\u201d declaring a mistrial. We agree with the court that it was unlikely that a continuance would ameliorate the prejudice caused to the state by the substantial delay in disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Nevertheless, the court noted that had the alibi evidence been brought to its attention just prior to juiy selection, it would have been more receptive to granting a continuance, if such relief was warranted. The court certainly had the option of granting a continuance, but that does not mean that granting a continuance was a desirable option. In evaluating the desirability of granting a continuance, the court properly considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>effect that a continuance would have on the jury that already had been selected. The court referred to the fact that the jury had been selected to serve for a specific short period of time and that a delay likely would have been detrimental to the jurors\u2019 ability to serve. The court was in a superior vantage point than are we to evaluate the likely effect on the jury of a delay in the proceedings, and we find no reason to disagree with the court\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The defendant suggests that additional jurors could have been chosen to replace those who could not serve due to an altered trial schedule or that the court could have declared a mistrial. A delay in proceedings would cause inconvenience to the jurors selected for trial. Additional jury selection or a mistrial would cause inconvenience to the corut and the state, and would occasion the use of additional judicial resources. The court obviously determined that this was not a case in which the adverse consequences of the defendant\u2019s noncompliance should be borne by the court system, the jury or the state. In light of the court\u2019s other determinations as well as the undisputed record, we are unable to disagree with the court\u2019s determination in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The court undertook the appropriate analysis in ruling on the state\u2019s motion to preclude the alibi testimony. It did not grant the extraordinary relief sought until it considered the unique circumstances of the late disclosure of the alibi defense. We conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s preclusion of the proffered alibi evidence reflected an abuse of discretion. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim that the adverse ruling deprived him of a right to present a defense must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\"> The state charged the defendant as either a principal or an accessory to the crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\"> The court imposed a total effective term of forty years imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-four years, to be followed by five years of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> The defendant\u2019s attorney sent the facsimile at 5:17 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> The notice stated in relevant part: \u201cThe defendant will present the testimony of Shanelle Carmichael (DOB: 9/22/76), 83 Bast Ramsdell Street, New Haven, CT, that at the time of the offenses charged, i.e., approximately 9:14 p.m. on September 24, 1996, the defendant was with her at 71 Downing Street, New Haven, CT.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney later acknowledged during argument that the date specified in the notice should have been \u201cNovember 24, 1996.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> The defendant\u2019s attorney referred to the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense during argument on the state\u2019s motion to preclude only once, in passing. The defendant\u2019s attorney stated: \u201c[T]o preclude the evidence because of my defective memory would be to deny [the defendant] a sixth amendment right and, obviously, that that would be a matter that could be addressed in a subsequent proceeding . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 40-21 provides: \u201cUpon written demand filed by the prosecuting authority stating the time, date, and place at which the alleged offense was committed, the defendant shall file within twenty days, or at such other time as the judicial authority may direct, a written notice of the defendant\u2019s intention to offer a defense of alibi. Such notice by the defendant shall state the specific place or places at which the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense and the names and addresses of the witnesses upon whom the defendant intends to rely to establish such alibi.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\"> The defendant did not testify at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\"> In his reply brief, the defendant argues that a violation cannot be deemed \u201csubstantial\u201d unless disclosure of the alibi witness occurs during the presentation of evidence. The defendant relies on the fact that in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 108 S. Ct. 646, 98 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1988), <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>200 Conn. 721, 513 A.2d 653 (1986), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 207, violations that were deemed to be substantial occurred during the presentation of evidence. We do not inteipret those cases to require that a late disclosure must occur during the evidentiary phase of the trial before it can be deemed to be a substantial violation of the rules of discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> The defendant did not request a separate hearing in which to establish the reason for the untimely disclosure, but relied on the representations of his attorney to the court. \u201cOnce the state has established that the defendant has failed to comply with the Practice Book discovery rules, it is incumbent on the defendant to make a showing of good cause ... or to request a remedy other than exclusion of the alibi testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 215.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
