We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">On October 24, 1995, the petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-54a. He thereafter was sentenced to a total effective term of forty years incarceration. On December 10, 2001, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus that alleged ineffective assistance on the part of his trial counsel. Following a one day trial at which the petitioner was the only witness, the court concluded that the petitioner had not satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>his burden of proving either deficient performance on the part of his counsel or prejudice resulting therefrom. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); <em>Johnson v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>218 Conn. 403, 424, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991). Accordingly, the court dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court subsequently denied the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">After a careful review of the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the issues raised are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that the questions raised deserve encouragement to proceed further. See <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 616, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
