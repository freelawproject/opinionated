The court found that the defendants\u2019 lease created no right of subrogation and, thus, no obligation to the landlord\u2019s insurance company for fire loss Brian Vaszil allegedly caused to the landlord\u2019s apartment building. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly rendered summary judgment because the written lease terms demonstrate the defendants\u2019 expectations that the tenant would be liable to the landlord for damage caused to the premises, thereby making subrogation appropriate. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">This issue on appeal is whether the language of the defendants\u2019 lease with the landlord was sufficient to permit the landlord\u2019s insurance company to subrogate against the defendants when the lease contained no express provision that the insurance company would have that right. We hold that subrogation exists in favor of the landlord\u2019s insurer when the lease contains specific language making the tenant liable for damage he causes to the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In 2001, Brian Vaszil was a student at the University of Connecticut. He occupied one unit of an apartment building at Hunting Heights in Storrs, pursuant to a written lease with the owner, Hunting Lodge Partners, LLC (Hunting). Robert Vaszil, Brian Vaszil\u2019s father, cosigned the lease as a guarantor. The plaintiff provided insurance for Hunting. The insurance policy specified that if Hunting had any right to recover damages from another party, those rights were deemed transferred to the plaintiff to the extent that it paid Hunting. It also required Hunting to do everything necessary to secure those rights and to do nothing after the loss to impair them. The lease between Hunting and the defendants required that the tenant not damage the apartment, repair any damage prior to leaving the building and reimburse Hunting for any amount expended to fix dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The lease did not contain the word subrogation or a specific provision stating that Hunting\u2019s insurer had a right of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On December 8, 2001, the apartment building was damaged in a fire for which the plaintiff subsequently paid Hunting in excess of $250,000. The plaintiff alleged that Brian Vaszil negligently lit and maintained a candle in his unit while he entertained a female guest. On February 15, 2002, the plaintiff brought this action in subrogation against Brian Vaszil and against Robert Vaszil as guarantor of the lease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff had no right of subrogation. On October 28, 2003, the court denied the motion. On November 14, 2003, the defendants filed a motion to reargue and, on April 21, 2004, the court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The court found that the provisions of the lease obligating the tenant to refrain from causing damage to the apartment and to repair such damage did not create an express agreement obligating the tenant to the landlord\u2019s insurer for the fire loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 744-45, 660 A.2d 810 (1995); see also Practice Book \u00a7 17-49. Thus, because the court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary judgment is a legal determination, our review on appeal is plenary. <em>Faigel v. Fairfield University, </em>75 Conn. App. 37, 40, 815 A.2d 140 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The plaintiff claims that the lease provisions were sufficient to permit subrogation, and the defendants argue that Connecticut courts require specific, express language conferring on an insurer the right of subrogation against a tenant. Insurance companies seeking subrogation proceed against the responsible party under the theory of equitable subrogation, not conventional subrogation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>269 Conn. 527, 533-34, 849 A.2d 777 (2004). \u201c[T]he right of [equitable] subrogation is not a matter of contract; it . . . takes place as a matter of equity, with or without an agreement to that effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 362, 371, 672 A.2d 939 (1996). Equitable subrogation is based on the policies of equity and fairness, and \u201cis broad enough to include every instance in which one person, not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder, pays a debt for which another is primarily liable, and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Furthermore, \u201c[s]ubrogation is a highly favored doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>. . . which courts should be inclined to extend rather than restrict.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>259 Conn. 847, 792 A.2d 819 (2002), our Supreme Court held that the insurer\u2019s right of subrogation against a tenant should be left \u201cto the specific agreement of the parties . . . .\u201d Id., 854. In its subrogation analysis, the court recognized that \u201cwhether subrogation would or would not apply ordinarily would depend ... on a case-by-case analysis of the language of the insurance policies and leases involved.\u201d Id., 853. <em>DiLullo </em>concerned a holdover tenant and, as such, there was no lease to construe, but the court recognized that if there had been a lease, it would need to be analyzed. Id. The rule of <em>DiLullo </em>that there is no right of subrogation absent an express agreement is merely a default rule. The court must determine the appropriate interpretation of the lease language.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The leading case that asserts that there is no right of subrogation absent a specific agreement is <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Jondahl, </em>532 P.2d 478, 482 (Okla. App. 1975) (precluding subrogation because law considers tenant coinsured of landlord, and because landlord and tenant have insurable interest in property). Our Supreme Court has criticized <em>Sutton, </em>concluding that \u201cunder traditional rules of insurance law, a tenant is not a coinsured on his landlord\u2019s fire insurance policy simply because he has an insurable interest in the premises and pays rent.\u201d <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 853. The court expressly agreed that subrogation generally requires a case-by-case analysis of the insurance policies and leases involved. Id. By disagreeing with the fundamental principles of the <em>Sutton </em>rule, the court preserved the right of subrogation in situations in which an analysis of relevant lease language would yield a determination that subrogation is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">In the present case, the lease provides that the tenant may not damage the apartment. If he does, he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>repair any damage by the end of the lease term. Furthermore, if he violates any of the provisions of the lease and fails to repair any damage, he will reimburse the landlord for any amount the landlord spends to make repairs. Considered together, those provisions notify the tenant that he is required to repair any damage he causes and, if he fails to do so, will be liable to the landlord. The lease clearly obligates the tenant to repair or to pay the landlord for any damage he causes. Subrogation allows a party who has paid a debt to \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of another to assume his or her legal rights against a third party to prevent unjust enrichment. R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law (1988) \u00a7 3.10 (a) (1), p. 219. Thus, when the plaintiff effectively stepped into the landlord\u2019s shoes by paying for the fire damage, it assumed the landlord\u2019s right to receive damage compensation from the defendants. In short, the plaintiff assumed the landlord\u2019s right to bring an action against the defendants for that compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The defendants argue that <em>DiLullo </em>requires language specifically indicating the right of subrogation. They cite a number of Superior Court cases to support their position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree with those cases. The right of subrogation exists when the language of the lease clearly notifies the tenant of his liability for damage he causes. \u201cThe object of [equitable] subrogation is the prevention of injustice. It is designed to promote and to accomplish justice, and is the mode which equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>adopts to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by one who, injustice, equity, and good conscience, should pay it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 371. We favor the reasoning in <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>that there is \u201cno logical reason to permit a tortfeasor to be unjustly enriched by virtue of having its debt paid by the insurance company of a party who had the foresight to obtain insurance coverage, and thus to escape all liability for its wrongdoing . . . .\u201d Id., 372-73. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s determination that the lease created no right of subrogation was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Additionally, we note that the defendants raise two policy issues in support of their argument. First, they argue that allowing the right of subrogation in this case will result in significant economic waste in the form of multiple insurance policies. Second, they argue that permitting subrogation without specific language in the lease will spring substantial liability on unsuspecting tenants. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The plaintiffs conclusion that not requiring language specifically indicating subrogation in the lease will result in multiple insurance policies on apartment buildings by landlords and tenants and, thus, cause economic waste is valid in light of DiLullo<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Connecticut\u2019s long history disfavoring such waste.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not convinced, however, that it carries more weight than the equitable nature of subrogation. Moreover, adopting a rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>requires landlords to include specific subrogation language in their leases would not alleviate the waste concern. Under such a rule, it would be permissible \u201cfor a landlord and tenant to enter into an express agreement or lease provision that would place responsibility for fire damage upon the tenant.\u201d <em>Cambridge Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Crete, </em>150 N.H. 673, 676, 846 A.2d 521 (2004). Thus, a landlord need only include subrogation language in the lease, and tenants who choose to comply will be required to procure insurance to cover the apartment, resulting in multiple policies despite the language specifically establishing the right of subrogation. Lease language alone would be insufficient to cure waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We reiterate that the goal of equitable subrogation is to avoid injustice by requiring payment from the party that occasioned the harm. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 371. In such a case, when financial injustice and some potential for economic waste collide, subrogation jurisprudence places the weight of authority on preventing injustice. Accordingly, we extend the right of subrogation when the lease language supports its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We also find unpersuasive the defendants\u2019 assertion that permitting subrogation absent an express provision in the lease will put tenants in potential financial jeopardy without clear notice. A conclusion consistent with that reasoning would assume that the average tenant expects to be exempt from liability merely because the landlord had the prudence to obtain insurance. It is sound public policy that we require people to be responsible for their negligence. Moreover, the lease in this case clearly made the tenant liable to the landlord for any damage the tenant caused, either by repairing the damage himself or by reimbursing the landlord for repairs. Thus, because the tenant was apprised that he would be required to pay for damage he caused, it was appropriate that the landlord\u2019s insurer would have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>right to receive compensation from the tenant when the insurer covered those costs. Furthermore, permitting subrogation prevents waste because it encourages tenants to exercise due care. We repeat the principle that there is \u201cno logical reason\u201d for a tortfeasor to have its debt paid by the insurance company of a party who had the foresight to obtain coverage. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 372-73. We defer to the policy of extending subrogation when the lease language makes it reasonable to do so. See id., 371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In this opinion FLYNN, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-13\">A social guest at the apartment was originally also named as a defendant in the subrogation action, but the plaintiff did not name her as a party to this appeal.

Respectfully, I dissent from the majority opinion because it is contrary to the law of equitable subrogation, as it pertains to the rights of landlords and tenants, and results in the type of economic waste that our Supreme Court held is to be avoided as a matter of public policy. See <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, 259 </em>Conn. 847, 853-54, 792 A.2d 819 (2002). In addition, the majority\u2019s decision misapplies the tenets of contract construction; see, e.g., <em>Rund </em>v. <em>Melillo, </em>63 Conn. App. 216, 220, 772 A.2d 774 (2001); and the standard applicable to motions for summary judgment. I would affirm the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants Brian Vaszil and Robert Vaszil<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the standard form lease the parties used does not contain an express agreement between the landlord, the plaintiffs insured, and the Vaszils regarding the right of subrogation of the plaintiff, the Middlesex Mutual Assurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>I agree with the majority\u2019s statement of the facts that underlie this action, including its observation that the lease does not contain the word subrogation or an express provision that the plaintiff has the right to proceed against the tenants for damage caused to the landlord\u2019s property. I would add, however, that Brian Vaszil was not the only tenant of unit 19-5 in the apartment building. See footnote 3. An important procedural fact is the trial court\u2019s reasoning in rendering summary judgment. Following reargument on the motion for summary judgment, the court concluded \u201cthat the provisions of the lease obligating the tenant not to cause damage to the apartment and to be responsible for repairing any such damages do not rise to a level of creating an <em>express agreement </em>noticing and obligating the tenant to be responsible for the fire loss in this case. The court farther finds that no other provision of the lease creates such an obligation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The majority sets forth the well-known general rule that applies to motions for summary judgment; Practice Book \u00a7 17-49; but omits the tenets that inform the standard that applies to such motions. \u201cThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, <em>under applicable principles of substantive law, </em>entitle himtoajudgmentasamatteroflaw . . . and <em>the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Altfeter </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>53 Conn. App. 791, 800, 732 A.2d 207 (1999). \u201cThe issue must be one which the party opposing the motion is entitled to litigate under [its] pleadings and the mere existence of a factual dispute apart from the pleadings is not enough to preclude summary judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Milford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Roina, </em>38 Conn.

The purpose of a complaint ... is to Emit the issues at trial, and it is calculated to prevent surprise. ... It must provide adequate notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried. ... In order to surmount a motion for summary judgment, a party must demonstrate that there exists a genuine issue of material fact. . . .

Id., 848. In affirming the trial court\u2019s granting of the tenant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court reasoned, \u201cin large part, upon the principle that subrogation, as an equitable doctrine, invokes matters of policy and fairness. . . . One such policy implicated by the issue presently before us is that disfavoring economic waste. See <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>255 Conn. 143, 154, 763 A.2d 1011 (2001) (policy against economic waste long recognized in our jurisdiction). This strong public policy convinces us that it would be inappropriate to create a default rule that allocates to the tenant the responsibility of maintaining sufficient insurance to cover a claim for subrogation by his landlord\u2019s insurer. Such a rule would create a strong incentive for <em>every </em>tenant to carry liability insurance in an amount necessary to compensate for the value, or perhaps even the replacement cost, of the entire building, irrespective of the portion of the building occupied by the tenant. This is precisely the same value or replacement cost insured by the landlord under his fire insurance policy. Thus, although the two forms of insurance would be different, the economic interest insured would be the same. This duplication of insurance would, in our view, constitute economic waste and, in a <em>multiunit building, </em>the waste would be <em>compounded by the number of tenants. </em>See <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>[428 Mass. 751, 754, 704 N.E.2d 1163 (1999)] (\u2018[i]t surely is not in the public interest to require all the tenants to insure the building which they share, thus causing the building to be fully insured by each tenancy\u2019). We think that our law would be better served by having the default rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of law embody this policy against economic waste, and by leaving it to the <em>specific agreement </em>of the parties if they wish a different rule to apply to their, or their insurers\u2019, relationship.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 853-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In its amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged the following relevant facts. The plaintiff issued an insurance policy for a <em>multiunit apartment building </em>owned by the landlord. The <em>apartment building </em>was destroyed by a fire that began in the bedroom of apartment unit 19-5 that was leased to Brian Vaszil <em>and others. </em>At the time, Brian Vaszil was a student at the University of Connecticut at Storrs and maintained a permanent residence with his parents elsewhere. The fire allegedly started as a result of his negligence when he lit a candle. As a result of his alleged negligence, the insured suffered property damage in excess of $250,000. The plaintiff has paid the loss pursuant to the terms of the policy. The landlord has subrogated and assigned all of its rights to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint also alleges that the provisions of the lease applicable to the tenants of <em>unit 19-5 </em>required the tenants to care for the <em>unit </em>and its appliances, and not destroy or damage the <em>unit. </em>The amended complaint does not allege that the lease contains an express or specific agreement regarding its right of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The construction of the effect of pleadings is a question of law over which this court exercises plenary review.

As noted in part III, to withstand a motion for summary judgment, the issue raised by the facts alleged in the complaint must be one a party may litigate under applicable principles of substantive law. <em>Altfeter </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 53 Com. App. 800; <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Roina, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 245. Although the plaintiff alleged and presented evidence of its right to subrogate under the insurance policy, it does not allege an express agreement between the landlord and the Vaszils to that effect. Under substantive law, the agreement at issue is the one between the landlord and the Vaszils, not the agreement between the plaintiff and its insured. No matter what construction is given the amended complaint, the plaintiff cannot prevail as a matter of law in the absence of an <em>express agreement </em>between the landlord and the Vaszils.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Furthermore, construing the allegations of the complaint in the plaintiffs favor, one can conclude only that they imply that <em>every </em>person who signed the landlord\u2019s lease for a unit in the apartment building would have to insure the entire building to protect himself or herself from catastrophic loss in the event of a fire, which is also the substance of the plaintiffs argument on appeal. If, as the majority has done, this implication is given effect, every tenant would be required to procure insurance to protect the entire apartment building, which is contrary to the public policy against economic waste that results when multiple parties insure the same economic interest. \u201c[I]n most instances, neither landlords nor tenants ordinarily expect that the landlord\u2019s insurer would be proceeding against the tenant, unless expert counseling to that effect had forewarned them.\u201d <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">CONTRACT CONSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Whether the trial court properly granted the Vaszils\u2019 motion for summary judgment is controlled by whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the lease contains an express or specific agreement regarding the plaintiffs right of subrogation. \u201c[I]n the absence of an express agreement between the parties covering the question, there is no right of subrogation on the part of a landlord\u2019s fire insurer against a tenant of the landlord\u2019s premises.\u201d Id., 850-51. \u201c[S]uch an agreement generally may be evidenced by the parties\u2019 lease . . . .\u201d Id., 851 n.4. The lease between the Vaszils and the landlord was before the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cA lease is a contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Central New Haven Development Corp. </em>v. <em>La Crepe, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 212, 214, 413 A.2d 840 (1979). A lease is subject to the same rules of construction as other contracts. <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Shop-Rite Supermarkets, Inc., </em>86 Conn. App. 426, 432, 863 A.2d 211 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 921, 867 A.2d 838 (2005). \u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>When only one interpretation of a contract is possible, the court need not look outside the four comers of the contract. . . . On the other hand, [w]hen an ambiguous term is at issue, the trial court can examine the extrinsic evidence to resolve the question of the parties\u2019 intent. . . . Contract language is unambiguous when it has a definite and precise meaning about which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion. ... A court will not torture words to import ambiguity when the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rund </em>v. <em>Melillo, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 220. \u201cWhen there is ambiguity, we must constme contractual terms against the drafter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>DiLullo </em>requires an <em>express agreement </em>between a landlord and tenant for the landlord\u2019s insurer to bring a successful action against a negligent tenant. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the word \u201cexpress\u201d as \u201c[c]lear; definite; explicit; plain; direct; unmistakable; not dubious or ambiguous. . . . Declared and distinctly stated. Made known distinctly and explicitly, and not left to inference. . . . Manifested by direct and appropriate language, as distinguished from that which is inferred from conduct. The word is usually contrasted with \u2018implied.\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Very simply, as the majority acknowledges, the lease does not contain the word subrogation or any express language that the plaintiff had the right to proceed against the Vaszils for damage negligently caused to the landlord\u2019s property. That acknowledgment alone is sufficient to affirm the judgment of the trial court. The majority, however, has scrutinized the contract to infer an agreement between the landlord and the Vaszils regarding subrogation. <em>DiLullo </em>does not permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>inference of such an agreement. At best, the lease is ambiguous as to a tenant\u2019s responsibility for damage negligently caused. The lease uses the words apartment, building, damage and destruction. It enumerates certain rules, including one that the tenant is not to do anything that would increase the cost of insurance. See footnote 3 (\u201c12. RULES AND REGULATIONS.\u201d). In case of a tenant\u2019s default, the landlord reserved the right to keep the security deposit to pay for rent or other money owed under the lease. See footnote 3 (\u201c16. SECURITY DEPOSIT.\u201d). One equally could infer from the provisions of the lease that a tenant\u2019s liability is limited to the amount of his or her security deposit. Such a reasonable inference is far from an express agreement between the landlord and tenant that the insurer has a right to subrogation for losses paid to its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">RULES PERTAINING TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact and does not sit as the trier of fact to decide the genuine issues of material fact. In deciding the appeal, the majority reframed one of the issues raised by the plaintiff,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thereby creating a question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>fact, i.e., \u201cwhether the language of the defendants\u2019 lease with the landlord was sufficient to permit the landlord\u2019s insurance company to subrogate against the defendants when the lease contained no express provision that the insurance company would have that right.\u201d On appeal, the plaintiff framed its first issue, concerning the construction of the contract, in the language of the trial court that ruled on the motion for summary judgment. The trial court\u2019s language is faithful to the language of the rule in <em>DiLullo, </em>i.e., \u201cexpress agreement.\u201d Furthermore, footnote 3 of the majority opinion highlights the ambiguity within the lease. The unresolved factual question noted in footnote 3 concerns the extent to which the lease permits the landlord to pursue a tenant for damage to property, that is, whether the landlord\u2019s right is limited to damage to the apartment or extends to the destruction of the building housing numerous apartments. Damage and destruction are not defined by the lease. The default provision of the lease indicates that the landlord will look to the $1500 security deposit if the tenant violates provisions of the lease. See footnote 3 (\u201c16. SECURITY DEPOSIT.\u201d). Given the question concerning the extent of a tenant\u2019s responsibility for damage or destruction, the lease not only fails to let a tenant know that the insurance carrier has the right to subrogate for any loss benefits paid, but it also does not put a tenant on notice that he or she should obtain insurance in the event of a catastrophic loss. This is particularly true where the lease implies that the landlord has protected itself by having procured its own insurance. See footnote 3 (\u201c12. RULES AND REGULATIONS.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">I recognize that if this court were to conclude that a motion for summary judgment involved a genuine issue of material fact decided by the trial court, the remedy would be to reverse the judgment and to remand the matter for further proceedings. Practically speaking, the outcome would be no different from what the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ity has ordered; but the legal effect of the majority\u2019s decision is inconsistent with <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 850, which requires an express or specific agreement between the landlord and the tenant regarding an insurer\u2019s right of equitable subrogation. Not only did the majority take onthejob of construing an ambiguous contract on a motion for summary judgment, it misapplied the substantive law of equitable subrogation regarding a tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">For the foregoing reasons, I dissent, respectfully.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\">See footnote 1 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\"> The applicable policy of insurance provides in relevant part: \u201cK.
