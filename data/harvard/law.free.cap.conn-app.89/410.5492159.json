We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On February 1, 2002, Sam Desai, the owner of the Travelers Inn in East Hartford, received a telephone call from a very scared and nervous employee, Sahid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Sheikh. Sheikh reported to Desai that the motel had just been robbed by two men, one of whom brandished a gun. Sheikh was then forced into a bathroom and ordered to remain there. Desai told Sheikh to telephone the police, but Sheikh refused. Sheikh pleaded with Desai not to telephone the police himself. Desai relented and did not report the robbery at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Also on February 1, 2002, two men entered a DB Mart in East Harford and, after requesting a pack of cigarettes and handing the clerk, Shiv Man Shrestha, some money, one of them jumped over the counter when Shrestha opened the cash register. The other man brandished a gun. The men took approximately $400 from the register before fleeing. The DB Mart was equipped with a security camera, which filmed the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">On February 6, 2002, the defendant and Keith Warren were apprehended by members of the Southington police department on unrelated charges. After being interviewed by members of the East Hartford police department, the defendant and Warren both admitted to committing robberies at the Travelers Inn and the DB Mart, and they each signed confessions. Because there had been no report of a robbery at the Travelers Inn, Officer Cheryl Proctor went to the motel to investigate. Initially, Sheikh denied that anything unusual had happened on February 1,2003,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but Proctor took a statement from Desai the next day concerning the robbeiy and Sheikh\u2019s frightened telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The defendant was charged with two counts of robbery in the first degree and two counts of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. Following a jury trial, he was convicted of both counts of robbery in the first degree and of one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. The court sentenced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>defendant to concurrent ten year terms for the conspiracy charge and for one of the robbery charges. The court sentenced the defendant to a consecutive term of ten years for the other robbery. The court, pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, also enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence for each robbery by five years, to run concurrent with each other but to run consecutive to the other sentences, giving the defendant a total effective sentence of twenty-five years incarceration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">On appeal, the defendant first claims that the court violated his right to present a defense under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution by allowing a witness, Ahmat Ojeda, to invoke his fifth amendment right not to testify through the representation of counsel without requiring Ojeda to take the stand and personally to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination at a hearing. The state argues, in part, that the defendant is not entitled to review of this claim because it is unpreserved and it is not truly of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right. In the alternative, the state argues that, even if the claim is of constitutional magnitude, a violation that would have denied the defendant a fair trial does not clearly exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The defendant contends that his claim is preserved because, although he did not specifically request that the court hold a hearing and require the witness personally to invoke his privilege, he sought to compel the witness to testify. In the alternative, the defendant requests that we review this claim pursuant to the analysis set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In order to obtain relief under <em>Golding, </em>however, the defendant\u2019s claim must be of constitutional magnitude, alleging the violation of a fundamental right, and the violation must clearly exist and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial. See id. After reviewing the record and the briefs, we agree with the state that the claim was not preserved and that a constitutional violation, which deprived the defendant of a fair trial, does not clearly exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Before and during trial, the defendant sought to challenge his written confession, which was written in English. Initially, he filed a motion to suppress any oral and written statements on the grounds that he was arrested without probable cause and that the statements were taken in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court denied that motion prior to the start of trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During trial, the defendant called witnesses who testified that he was not able to read or write English very well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant called Jessica Brunelle, his former girlfriend of seven years, to testify on his behalf. Brunelle testified that she often read letters to the defendant because \u201che didn\u2019t understand always what he was reading,\u201d and he had difficulty with the meaning of certain words. She also testified that the signature on the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form was that of the defendant, but she thought he would have had difficulty understanding the meaning of several words on the form, such as \u201cadvised,\u201d \u201cremain\u201d and \u201cdesire.\u201d After being shown the defendant\u2019s signed statement, Brunelle testified that much of the statement was \u201cpretty simple\u201d but that she thought the defendant would have had difficulty with some of the words. Brunelle also testified that the defendant \u201ccan read . . . but it doesn\u2019t make too much sense to him.\u201d Finally, Brunelle testified that the defendant had informed her that letters that he wrote to her from prison actually were written by his cell mate. The defendant also called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Warren and one of his former high school teachers to testify as to the defendant\u2019s difficulty reading and writing English.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The state offered testimony from Julie Gasiorek, a prison official, who testified that the defendant had signed the prison\u2019s telephone policies, listing the names and telephone numbers of those people with whom the defendant wanted to have contact, on the English side of the form. She also testified that prison officials had intercepted a letter written by the defendant in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The defendant then sought to call Ojeda, a former cell mate of the defendant, to the stand to testify that Ojeda had written letters in English on the defendant\u2019s behalf. More specifically, the defendant sought to have Ojeda testify that the defendant had dictated the intercepted letter to Ojeda, that Ojeda then wrote the letter in English and that the defendant merely had copied the letter into his own handwriting. Because Ojeda was awaiting trial on unrelated charges of assault and attempted murder, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance so that Ojeda\u2019s attorney could be contacted. When trial resumed a few days later, Attorney Mark Solak informed the court that Ojeda, his client, would invoke his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination as to all questions. Additionally, Solak stated that he wanted his client to invoke his right not to testify without taking the stand to claim the privilege because Ojeda was asserting a defense of diminished mental capacity as to his pending charges and that \u201cany conduct of [Ojeda] in this courtroom, would be admissible by the state of Connecticut in Mr. Ojeda\u2019s case.\u201d The defendant did not request specifically that the court hold a hearing on this matter, requiring Ojeda personally to invoke his privilege, but, instead, he moved to compel Ojeda to testify, arguing that his testimony would not be seh-incriminating. In the alternative, he urged the court to strike the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>cepted letter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court denied both motions. The defendant did not raise specifically before the court any objection to Solak\u2019s invocation of his client\u2019s privilege without requiring Ojeda personally to take the stand. Rather, he raised this issue for the first time in a postverdict motion to set aside the verdict. The issue, therefore, is unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On appeal, the defendant does not claim that the court improperly ruled that Ojeda could exercise his fifth amendment privilege. Rather, the defendant claims that the court violated his sixth amendment right to present a defense simply by failing to hold a hearing, requiring Ojeda to take the stand and personally to invoke his fifth amendment privilege. The defendant argues that this case is similar to <em>State </em>v. <em>Cecarelli, </em>32 Conn. App. 811, 631 A.2d 862 (1993), where we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>that the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense was implicated because the court did not hold a hearing, as requested by the defendant, to determine whether a witness, Anthony Gentile, would invoke his fifth amendment right not to testify as to each and every question but, instead, relied on the representation of Gentile\u2019s attorney. Id., 818-19. We conclude, however, that <em>Cecarelli </em>is distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>Cecarelli, </em>the defendant claimed entrapment as a defense, and he testified that it was Gentile who assisted with this entrapment. Id. 813. To support his entrapment defense, the defendant attempted to call Gentile as a witness. Id., 817. Gentile\u2019s attorney informed the court, however, that Gentile would exercise his fifth amendment privilege not to testify. Id. The court accepted the attorney\u2019s representation and, despite the defendant\u2019s request, declined to conduct a hearing outside of the presence of the jury at which Gentile could be questioned personally as to whether he would invoke his privilege against seh-incrimination as to each and every question. Id., 817-18. In that case, we concluded that the hearing was necessary because the defendant argued that, under the circumstances, Gentile\u2019s constitutional privilege might not pertain to all of the questions that the defendant sought to ask regarding his defense of entrapment. Id., 818-19. The defendant had claimed that he was denied the opportunity to inquire as to whether any charges were pending against Gentile at the time of the alleged entrapment, whether Gentile had been promised anything for his cooperation as an informant for two police departments, or what motivated him to approach the defendant. Id. 820. We concluded that the court\u2019s failure to hold the requested hearing implicated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In this case, however, there is no claim that Ojeda might have answered some relevant questions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>would go to the defendant\u2019s defense, and, reviewing the defendant\u2019s brief, we can observe no analysis as to how the court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing implicated the defendant\u2019s right to present his defense. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">As explained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klinger, </em>128 F.3d 705 (9th Cir. 1997), a case in which a defendant also claimed that his sixth amendment right was violated by the exclusion of a witness\u2019 testimony and the court\u2019s refusal to conduct a hearing: \u201cIn deciding whether the testimony of a particular witness should be excluded because that witness will refuse to answer \u2018noncollateral\u2019 questions, a [court] must ordinarily determine whether a witness will invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege \u2018in response to specific questions.\u2019 ... A [court] may conduct an evidentiary hearing of the proposed [witness\u2019] testimony outside the presence of the jury, but our case law does not mandate such a hearing. . . . Where the [court] finds that the witness could invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege as to all questions, it may recognize a [witness\u2019] blanket privilege against self-incrimination if \u2018the court, based on its knowledge of the case and of the testimony expected from the witness, can conclude that the witness could legitimately refuse to answer essentially all relevant questions.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 709. In holding that this evidentiary issue was properly decided, the court explained: \u201cAlthough the [court] did not hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether [the witness] would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege, the court did conduct a thorough colloquy on this issue with counsel for both sides. The [court] based its decision to exclude [the witness\u2019] testimony on the attorneys\u2019 representations about the expected content of that testimony .... [T]he [court] appropriately excluded that testimony without an evidentiary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ing.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 709-10; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Warfield, </em>97 F.3d 1014, 1019-20 (8th Cir. 1996) (court\u2019s acceptance of counsel\u2019s statement that witness would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination, without requiring witness personally to invoke privilege, not improper), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 U.S. 1110, 117 S. Ct. 1119, 137 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1997); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swanson, </em>9 F.3d 1354, 1359 (8th Cir. 1993) (court\u2019s acceptance of witness\u2019 attorney proffer that witness would invoke fifth amendment privilege not improper); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>503 F.2d 598, 600 (9th Cir. 1974) (where counsel for former codefendant advised court that client would claim fifth amendment privilege, witness need not take stand personally to assert privilege), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1113, 95 S. Ct. 791, 42 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1975); <em>People </em>v. <em>Macana, </em>84 N.Y.2d 173, 178, 615 N.Y.S.2d 656, 639 N.E.2d 13 (1994) (although witness normally should be summoned specifically to invoke fifth amendment privilege, where undisputable inference is that testimony of witness would be incriminating and that witness would refuse to testify, court needs no further verification apart from counsel\u2019s representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Here, the court conducted a thorough colloquy with the attorneys and concluded that it was not only unnecessary, but agreed with Solak that it might be harmful to his defense, for Ojeda to take the stand given his proposed defense of diminished mental capacity. The defendant provides us with insufficient analysis as to how that conclusion implicated his right to present his defense, solely because it was made by the court without mandating that Ojeda personally invoke his privilege at a hearing. We cannot conclude, on the basis of the record and the briefs in this case, that the court\u2019s failure to hold such a hearing clearly implicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to present a defense and that it clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The defendant next claims that the court violated his sixth amendment rights by enhancing his sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, without proper notice and without sending the issue to the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state argues that under the facts of this case, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">On April 28, 2003, prior to the commencement of juiy selection, the state filed with the court a notice of intent in each file to seek a sentence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who commits any class A, B or C felony and in the commission of such felony uses, or is armed with and threatens the use of, or displays, or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses any firearm . . . shall be imprisoned for a term of five years, which shall not be suspended or reduced and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for conviction of such felony.\u201d Although the state provided the written notice of its intent to seek sentence enhancement on April 28, 2003, it did not include \u00a7 53-202k on the long form informations, which listed the charges against the defendant, and the court did not instruct the jury on this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">On July 22, 2003, the day that the defendant was being sentenced, the state again notified the court that it would be seeking to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence for the robberies on the basis of \u00a7 53-202k. The defendant objected on the ground that the issue should have been presented to the jury for its consideration, and the state argued that this omission was harmless error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, concluding that the jury necessarily found that the defendant or his accomplice had used or threatened to use a firearm while committing the robberies, and it sentenced the defendant to the enhanced penalty of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>253 Conn. 210, 226, 751 A.2d 800 (2000), the defendant argues that \u201cit was never the legislature\u2019s intent with regard to \u00a7 53-202k to eliminate the jury\u2019s role as fact finder.\u201d Here, the defendant argues, the state \u201cdid just that.\u201d Recognizing that case law subsequent to <em>Velasco </em>has held this omission to be harmless error, the defendant further argues: \u201c[T]his court has continually \u2018lowered the bar\u2019 in allowing prosecutors to virtually ignore this necessary function of the jury with regard to this sentencing enhancement. In so doing, this court has \u2018institutionalized\u2019 harmless error. In this particular case, both the state and the trial court recognized what they had done constituted error yet chose to proceed anyway. This court should either remove the \u2018fig leaf and allow the state to simply ignore the jury from the outset or rein them by saying in this case they have gone too far.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In <em>Velasco, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u00a7 53-202k requires the jury, and not the trial court, to determine whether a defendant used a firearm in the commission of a class A, B or C felony for purposes of the sentence enhancement. Id., 218. We are constrained by <em>Velasco\u2019s </em>holding that the trial court\u2019s failure to allow the jury to make such factual determinations is amenable to harmless error analysis. Id., 232-33. In <em>Velasco, </em>the court held that it was not harmless error for the court to fail to submit instructions regarding the elements of sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 53-202k to the jury because, in that case, \u201ca finding of guilt on [the underly-</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ing] counts was not contingent on the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm.\u201d Id., 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Here, the charges of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-8 (a) specifically required the state to prove, and the jury to find, that the defendant, or another participant acting with the aid of the defendant, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery displayed or threatened the use of what he or the other participant represented by words or by conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm. An affirmative defense to a violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) is that \u201csuch pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The record reveals that in reporting the February 1, 2002 robbery of the Travelers Inn to Desai, Sheikh stated that one of the robbers brandished a gun. Shrestha also testified that one of the men that robbed the DB Mart had brandished a gun. The security camera at the DB Mart also filmed the robbery and showed a gun being used in the commission of that robbery; this video was shown to the jury. The defendant alludes to the fact that Warren testified that the weapon brandished during the robberies was an inoperable BB gun and thus not capable of being fired. The statutory alternative, under which the defendant was charged, however, does not require that what the defendant represents to be a firearm actually is a firearm, much less an operable one. The charging documents in this case specifically stated, in relation to the charge of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-8 (a), that \u201cin the course of committing the crime of robbery, [the defendant or another participant] displayed and threatened the use of what he or another participant <em>represented </em>by their words and conduct to be a pistol, revolver or other firearm.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>explained in <em>State v. Tinsley, </em>47 Conn. App. 716, 721-22, 706 A.2d 1008, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 915-16, 713 A.2d 833 (1998), \u201ca guilty verdict under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) does not require proof of operability [of the gun]. A conviction can result whether [or not] the defendant possessed a gun. All that is required is that the defendant [or his accomplice] displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a [gun]. ... To conclude otherwise would render this statutory provision inapplicable in situations where weapons cannot be recovered or where a defendant represents to have a gun but, in fact, does not. Certainly, the legislature did not intend to omit those frequently occurring scenarios from sentence enhancement.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Here, the jury found the defendant guilty of two counts of robbery in the first degree. Clearly then, the jury found that the defendant or Warren, with the aid of the defendant, displayed or threatened the use of a purported firearm during the course of two robberies. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4); see also General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (b) (classifying first degree robbery as class B felony). With those findings of guilt, the jury necessarily concluded that the defendant or Warren, with the aid of the defendant, committed each element of \u00a7 53-202k in that at least one of them, while committing robbery in the first degree was \u201carmed with and threatened] the use of, or display [ed], or represent[ed] by his words or conduct that he possess [ed] [a] firearm . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. Accordingly, we conclude that the jury, in finding the defendant guilty of the class B felony of robbery in the first degree, necessarily found that the defendant or his accomplice in the commission of the crimes used or threatened the use of a firearm. We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s argument that he was deprived of, what was represented as, his right to have the jury make the factual finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the predicate use of a purported firearm, necessary for sentence enhancement, had occurred in the commission of the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The defendant argues that his constitutional right to notice of the charges levied against him was violated when the state failed to include a violation of \u00a7 53-202k on the long form informations. Specifically, the defendant argues that \u201cthe court committed error when it sentenced the defendant under a statutory provision that was not contained in the information which was submitted to the jury. . . . [T]he charging document did not place the defendant on notice of this particular criminal charge.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant does not explain, except as it relates to the court\u2019s failure to submit the issue to the jury, which we discussed in part II A, how he was harmed by the state\u2019s omission of \u00a7 53-202k from the long form informations, in light of the fact that the state filed a written notice of intent on April 28, 2003. In so far as the defendant did not object on the ground of inadequate notice to the court\u2019s deciding the applicability of \u00a7 53-202k, he seeks review under the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We conclude that that the defendant was notified of the state\u2019s intention to seek sentence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k on or about April 28, 2003, and we are not persuaded that a clear constitutional violation exists which clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Boulier, </em>81 Conn. App. 824, 830-31, 841 A.2d 1217, cert. denied, 269 Conn. 909, 852 A.2d 740, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 966, 125 S. Ct. 422, 160 L. Ed. 2d 334 (2004), the defendant alleged a violation of his sixth amendment right to be informed of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>accusations against Mm because he was not informed until the first day of jury selection that the state was seekmg a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In holding that the defendant was informed adequately of the charges against him, we explained that \u201c[b]ecause the defendant was aware of the robbery charge, he was able to prepare intelligently to defend himself on each of the essential elements of both that charge and the potential sentence enhancement. As such, the defendant was not faced with any prejudicial surprise by not bemg informed of the state\u2019s intent to seek a sentence enhancement until the first day of jury selection.\u201d Id., 831-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Here, although the state did not append the alleged violation of \u00a7 53-202k to the long form informations, it filed a notice of Mtent to seek sentence enhancement with the court on April 28, 2003, with an attestation that a copy was delivered to defense counsel that same day. Counsel does not claim that a copy was not received. The defendant was aware of the charges of robbery in the first degree and, therefore, was able to prepare for trial on each of the essential elements of the robbery charges and the sentence enhancement. See id. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant had received notice that the state would be seeking a sentence enhancement. Lacking further analysis from the defendant, we cannot conclude that a clear constitutional violation exists in tMs case that deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-11\"> The jury also found the defendant not guilty of one additional count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\"> The defendant also claims that the court violated his rights under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. Because he provides no separate analysis of his state constitutional claim, we address only the federal constitutional claim. See <em>State v. Sinvil, </em>270 Conn. 516, 518 n.1, 853 A.2d 105 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-9\"> Sheikh, was unavailable at the time of trial, and his statements to Desai concerning the robbery were admitted into evidence as excited utterances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> During the suppression hearing, defense counsel conceded the issue of probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\"> The propriety of that ruling is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\"> The defendant did not testily at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\"> In a postverdict motion, the defendant raised the issue of the court\u2019s failure to require that Ojeda personally assert his privilege. He did not contest, nor does he contest on appeal, the propriety of the court\u2019s conclusion that it could be harmful to Ojeda to take the stand. If we assume, without deciding, that this conclusion was correct, Ojeda\u2019s right to invoke his fifth amendment privilege would trump the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to present a defense.

The defendant\u2019s brief provides no analysis on the effect of simply filing a notice of intent except as it relates to the issue not being submitted to the jury. We assume, without deciding, however, that the absence of a reference to \u00a7 53-202k in the information would not <em>necessarily </em>prohibit the court from submitting the issue to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
