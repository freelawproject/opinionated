The defendant claims on appeal that the court improperly concluded that the doctrine of sovereign immunity and the two year statute of limitations in General Statutes \u00a7 52-584<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> barred his counterclaim. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. On December 26, 2001, the plaintiff, Patrick Mulcahy, a Connecticut state trooper, brought an action against the defendant for personal injuries he sustained on January 17, 2000, as a result of a collision between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>state owned car he was driving and the defendant\u2019s car. On March 12, 2002, the state, Mulcahy\u2019s employer at the time of the accident, filed a motion to intervene and an intervening complaint pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking reimbursement for payments it had made or would be obligated to make under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. On March 26,2002, the defendant filed an answer and a special defense to the intervening complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On April 1, 2002, the defendant filed a counterclaim, naming both Mulcahy and the state in the caption, but containing allegations against Mulcahy only. On April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>9, 2002, the defendant filed an answer and special defense to Mulcahy\u2019s complaint. On April 22, 2002, the court granted the state\u2019s motion to intervene. On December 19, 2003, the state filed a reply to the defendant\u2019s special defense to its intervening complaint. On December 29, 2003, the defendant filed a request for leave to amend his counterclaim to bring a claim against the state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-556.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On January 9, 2004, the state filed a motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. On January 20,2004, after the parties agreed that the court would hear the state\u2019s motion to dismiss before ruling on the defendant\u2019s request to amend his counterclaim, the court heard argument on the state\u2019s motion. On January 28, 2004, the court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s counterclaim and rendered judgment in favor of the state. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">DISMISSAL OF THE DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST THE STATE</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the court improperly concluded that his counterclaim against the state was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and \u00a7 52-584. In support of his claim, the defendant argues that \u00a7 52-556, which expressly provides for a right of action in negligence when a person is injured through the negligence of any state official or employee operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state, is applicable in this case, and, therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity could not be applied to bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>his counterclaim. The defendant also argues that the state\u2019s action against him, brought pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), is controlled by \u00a7 52-584, which provides that counterclaims may be filed at any time prior to the close of pleadings in such actions, and, therefore, the court improperly dismissed his counterclaim against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The state counters that by moving to intervene as a party plaintiff under \u00a7 31-293 (a), it did not consent to a suit against it or waive sovereign immunity. The state further contends that \u00a7 52-556 does not authorize the defendant\u2019s counterclaim because (1) it was not made within two years of the date of the accident giving rise to the claim and (2) the exception clause in \u00a7 52-584 for counterclaims does not apply in this case. Finally, the state cites two alternative grounds for concluding that the court properly dismissed the defendant\u2019s counterclaim: (1) the counterclaim was premature and (2) it was not pleaded in the answer as required by Practice Book \u00a7 10-54.</p>\n<p id=\"AeS\">The standard of review concerning an appeal from the granting of a motion to dismiss is well established. \u201cIn ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Neiman </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>270 Conn. 244, 250-51, 851 A.2d 1165 (2004). Whether the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law over which we exercise a plenary standard of review. Id., 251. Because the defendant\u2019s claim involves the proper application of \u00a7\u00a7 31-293 (a), 52-556 and 52-584 to an undisputed factual scenario and because statutory construction is a question of law, our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the court\u2019s application of those statutes is plenary. <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>243 Conn. 255, 258, 701 A.2d 650 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1136, 118 S. Ct. 1838, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Waiver of Sovereign Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that the court improperly concluded that the state\u2019s intervention in this case did not operate as a waiver of sovereign immunity. The court, relying on <em>Isaacs </em>v. <em>Ottaviano, </em>65 Conn. App. 418, 783 A.2d 485 (2001), held that if it allowed \u201cthe filing of a counterclaim against the state when [the state] has intervened simply to seek reimbursement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits it has paid, that would violate the principles stated in <em>Isaacs. </em>If the provisions of ... \u00a7 52-584 are construed to extend the time in which an action can be brought against the state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-556 where the state has so intervened that would, in essence, constitute a determination that such intervention operated as a waiver of sovereign immunity because, absent such intervention, such a suit would not have been permitted. This is contrary to the explicit holding of <em>Isaacs.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In <em>Isaacs, </em>the issue before the court was whether the state waives its sovereign immunity and subjects itself to a counterclaim for indemnification and contribution when it intervenes, pursuant to \u00a7 31-293, in a personal injuiy action and seeks reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits that it paid to the plaintiff employee. Id., 419-20. <em>Isaacs </em>is distinguishable from this case in two important ways. First, <em>Isaacs </em>did not involve a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. The issue, therefore, was whether intervention pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), by itself, operated as a waiver of sovereign immunity. Second, in his counterclaim, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>in <em>Isaacs </em>sought indemnification and contribution for any damages for which he might become hable in connection with the plaintiffs action for negligence. Id., 421. Concluding that the state does not waive sovereign immunity by intervening pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), this court held that \u201cto construe the state\u2019s intervening complaint as a waiver of sovereign immunity would run contrary to one of the four overlapping principles that inform the rights established by \u00a7 31-293 (a). . . . One of those principles is that the statute protects an employer by allowing the employer to obtain reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits from a third party tortfeasor, either by becoming an intervening plaintiff in the employee\u2019s cause of action or by bringing a separate action derivative of the employee\u2019s cause of action. ... To imply a waiver of sovereign immunity by the state\u2019s intervention would expose the state to a loss of its reimbursement. If the plaintiff were to prevail against the defendant, the state\u2019s recovery from the plaintiffs judgment would be negated if the defendant were successful on the counterclaim.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We conclude that <em>Isaacs </em>is inapposite to the present case. Here, the defendant had an independent, statutory cause of action sounding in tort against the state pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. He could have brought a viable action for negligence against the state irrespective of whether the state chose to intervene under \u00a7 31-293 (a). In <em>Isaacs, </em>the defendant did not have a cause of action against the state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The concern addressed by <em>Isaacs, </em>namely, whether, in the absence of a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, intervention under \u00a7 31-293 (a) operates as a waiver of sovereign immunity, is simply not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s cause of action is subject to \u00a7 52-584, and, therefore, the counterclaim exception in that statute applies, permitting the otherwise untimely counterclaim filed by the defendant. We begin by observing that it is well established that the statute of limitations that governs the underlying action in which an employer seeks to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) also governs the intervening action. \u201cSince an intervening employer\u2019s statutory right to reimbursement depends on the liability of the third party to the employee, the statute of limitations applicable to the employer\u2019s right of action must be the same as that governing the employee\u2019s underlying action against the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Packtor </em>v. <em>Seppala &amp; AHO Construction Co., </em>33 Conn. App. 422, 431, 636 A.2d 383, appeal dismissed, 231 Conn. 367, 650 A.2d 534 (1994); see also <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lighthouse Restaurant, Inc., </em>246 Conn. 156, 170, 716 A.2d 71 (1998) (holding that when employer receives formal notice under \u00a7 31-293 [a] of employee\u2019s timely filed action against third party tortfeasor, applicable statute of limitations on underlying claim, \u00a7 52-584, is tolled if employer intervenes within thirty day period prescribed by \u00a7 31-293 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The court in this case held that \u00a7 52-584 \u201cdoes not allow for the filing of a counterclaim, beyond the time set forth in the applicable statute of limitations, against an intervening plaintiff, where the intervening complaint does not sound in negligence, but [rather] in a statutory cause of action for reimbursement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid or to be paid.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">To resolve this issue, it is necessary for us to review the relationship among \u00a7\u00a7 31-293 (a), 52-556 and 52-584. The principles of statutory construction are well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>established. \u201cWhen construing a statute, we first look to its text, as directed by [General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z], which provides: \u2018The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. \u2019 When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also seek interpretive guidance from the legislative history of the statute and the circumstances surrounding its enactment, the legislative policy it was designed to implement, the statute\u2019s relationship to existing legislation and common-law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d <em>Teresa T. </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 734, 742, 865 A.2d 428 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"ACT\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 31-293 specifically grants an employer who has paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee the right to join as a party plaintiff in the employee\u2019s action against a third party tortfeasor. ... It is an independent derivative action. ... It is a statutory and substantive right to reimbursement that is in effect one of subrogation to the right of the injured employee to recover for the tort committed against him. . . . An employer who has paid, or by award has become obligated to pay, compensation may also sue the third party in his own name directly for reimbursement. If either the employer or the employee sues the third party, the other is entitled to notice and an opportunity to join in the action. ... An employer\u2019s sole means to assert any right against the plaintiffs third party recovery [is] by way of the procedure set forth in \u00a7 31-293.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Packtor v. Seppala &amp; AHO Construction Co., </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u201cSince an intervening employer\u2019s statutory right to reimbursement depends on the liability of the third party to the employee, the statute of limitations applicable to the employer\u2019s right of action must be the same as that governing the employee\u2019s underlying action against the tortfeasor.\u201d Id., 431. In this case, there is no dispute that \u00a7 52-584 is the statute of limitations governing Mulcahy\u2019s action against the defendant and that \u00a7 52-584 governs the state\u2019s claim against the defendant. The question is whether the exception in \u00a7 52-584, allowing counterclaims at any time before the pleadings are finally closed, governs the defendant\u2019s counterclaim against the state, which rests on \u00a7 52-556.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Section 52-584, which applies to actions sounding in tort, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo action . . . shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered . . . except that a counterclaim may be interposed in any such action any time before the pleadings in such action are finally closed.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counterclaim against the state sounds in tort; it alleges that the defendant suffered personal injuries through the negligence of Mulcahy, a state employee, while operating a motor vehicle. Section 52-556 expressly waives sovereign immunity in such cases. Section 31-293 (a) establishes an employer\u2019s independent, although derivative, right of action against third party tortfeasors. An action by an employer pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) is, therefore, an action sounding in tort because it provides for an independent action by the employer against third party tortfeasors. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lighthouse Restaurant, Inc., </em>supra, 246 Conn. 164. It follows, therefore, that the state\u2019s action brought pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) is governed by \u00a7 52-584. See id., 165. As an action sounding in tort, the state\u2019s action falls squarely within actions contemplated by the exception for counterclaims pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>vided for in \u00a7 52-584. Our review of \u00a7\u00a7 31-293 (a), 52-556 and 52-584 compels us to conclude that the legislature has given no indication that the state is to be treated in a manner different from any other counterclaim defendant with respect to the exception for counterclaims in \u00a7 52-584, or that actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) should be considered something other than actions sounding in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Section 52-584 expressly provides that a counterclaim may be filed at any time prior to the close of pleadings, irrespective of whether the statute of limitations governing the counterclaim has run. The defendant in this case filed his counterclaim before the close of pleadings. The court, therefore, improperly dismissed the defendant\u2019s counterclaim against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS FOR AFFIRMANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The state raises two alternative grounds on which this court may affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. First, the state argues that the defendant filed his counterclaim before the court granted the state\u2019s motion to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), and, therefore, before the state became a party to the action. Second, the state argues that the defendant failed to file his counterclaim properly pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-54.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the state claims that the defendant failed to file his counterclaim with his answer to the state\u2019s intervening complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Lack of Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The state\u2019s first alternative ground for affirming the court\u2019s judgment essentially claims lack of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>jurisdiction because, at the time the defendant filed his counterclaim, the state was not yet a party. Under Practice Book \u00a7 10-30, a party \u201cwishing to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction . . . must do so by filing a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance.\u201d Unlike defects in subject matter jurisdiction, which may not be waived, a party waives any objection to a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction unless that party files a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance. <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 10, 32, 848 A.2d 418 (2004); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 10-30 and 10-32. In this case, the state filed an appearance on March 12, 2002, along with its motion to intervene and its intervening complaint. The court granted the state\u2019s motion to intervene on April 22, 2002. As previously noted, the defendant filed his counterclaim against the state on April 1, 2002. The state did not file its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction until January 9, 2004. The state, therefore, waived its right to object to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Defect in Pleading Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The state\u2019s second alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the court is addressed to a technical defect regarding the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, namely, it was not filed with the defendant\u2019s answer to the intervening complaint as required by Practice Book \u00a7 10-54. In support of its argument, the state cites <em>Holland </em>v. <em>East Coast Tile &amp; Marble Co., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. 282208 (June 22, 1993), for the proposition that failure by the defendant to file his counterclaim with his answer to the state\u2019s intervening complaint is, in and of itself, a suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>cient ground for dismissal. It should be noted that the court in <em>Holland </em>also held that \u201cthe counterclaim as presently constituted is inappropriate because the defendant cannot recover against [the state] in negligence based upon the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act . . . .\u201d Id. The <em>Holland </em>court concluded, therefore, that the defendant could not, as a matter of law, state a cause of action against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We begin by noting that the state\u2019s second alternative ground for affirming the court\u2019s judgment neither implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction; see <em>State </em>v. Carey, 222 Conn. 299, 307, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992) (rules of practice do not ordinarily define subject matter jurisdiction), on appeal after remand, 228 Conn. 487, 636 A.2d 840 (1994); nor the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over the state. \u201cThe motion to dismiss is governed by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 10-30 through 10-34. Properly granted on jurisdictional grounds, it essentially asserts that, as a matter of law and fact, a plaintiff cannot state a cause of action that is properly before the court. ... By contrast, the motion to strike attacks the sufficiency of the pleadings.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Egri </em>v. <em>Foisie, </em>83 Conn. App. 243, 247, 848 A.2d 1266, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004). The state\u2019s alternative argument attacking the technical propriety of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, therefore, should not have been raised by a motion to dismiss, but rather by a motion to strike. As this court observed in <em>Egri: </em>\u201cThe distinction between the motion to dismiss and the motion to strike is not merely semantic. If a motion to dismiss is granted, the case is terminated, save for an appeal from that ruling. . . . The granting of a motion to strike, however, ordinarily is not a final judgment because our rules of practice afford a party a right to amend deficient pleadings. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201cThat critical distinction implicates a fundamental policy consideration in this state. Connecticut law repeatedly has expressed a policy preference to bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his or her day in court. . . . Our practice does not favor the termination of proceedings without a determination of the merits of the controversy where that can be brought about with due regard to necessary rules of procedure.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In this case, the defendant\u2019s request for leave to amend his counterclaim is pending before the court. If that request is granted, the defendant could cure the alleged defect the state now asserts as an alternate ground for affirming the court\u2019s judgment dismissing the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.
