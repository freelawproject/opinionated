Gregg, the appellee, was indicted by the grand jury of Montgomery County for malicious destruction of property, entering premises with intent to maliciously destroy property thereon, and on two- charges of arson. There are four counts in the indictment, to the first and second of which a demurrer was interposed. On the suggestion of defendant the case was removed to Frederick County. The docket entries of that court show that- \u201ctraverser demurs to 1st and 2nd Counts of Indictment; demurrer heard before Court * * * Demurrer sustained as to 1st and 2nd counts of indictment\u201d; that the ease was then continued, and traverser released on bail; and a few days later \u201cprayer of Appeal to Court of Appeals of Maryland on demurrer, filed by State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The appeal was prematurely taken and must therefore be dismissed. There was no judgment on the demurrer. It is said in 12 <em>Standard Cyclopedia of Procedure, </em>p. 689 : \u201cThe State may appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer to an indictment on information * * * but the appeal cannot be allowed if after sustaining a demurrer to one or more counts one good count remains.\u201d And in <em>State v. Floto, </em>81 Md. 600, 602, 32 A. 315, 316: \u201cAppeals in criminal cases are upon the same footing as appeals in civil cases, and in neither case' can an appeal be taken until after final judgment.\u201d See, also, <em>Ridgely v. </em>State, 75 Md. 510, 23 A. 1099; <em>State v. Tag, </em>100 Md. 588, 60 A. 465; <em>Cochran v. State, </em>119 Md. 539, 558, 87 A. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
