On November 14, 1996, Draper took his biology class on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>field trip to the Cincinnati Zoo. After the field trip, Draper took a picture of the class. When he took the picture, he realized that one of his students, Greg Barber, had \u201cmooned\u201d him, but he was not sure by how much, nor was he sure that the camera had caught it. Draper immediately warned Barber that he would be held accountable for his conduct if the picture revealed that he had \u201cmooned\u201d the camera. Draper had the film developed over the school\u2019s winter-holiday break. It showed that Barber had, in fact, \u201cmooned\u201d the camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On January 2, 1997, Barber\u2019s guidance counselor, who was concerned with Barber\u2019s performance at school, communicated to his teachers that she would be meeting with Barber\u2019s mother. Draper gave the counselor the picture. This was the first time that Draper had taken any action regarding the \u201cmooning\u201d incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Ultimately, Barber was expelled for this and other behavior. Draper was placed on unpaid suspension for three days. According to plaintiff-appellee Princeton City School District Board of Education (\u201cthe Board\u201d), Draper was disciplined for \u201ctaking an inappropriate picture of a student and failing to report a serious student misbehavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The Association filed a grievance challenging Draper\u2019s suspension. The grievance contended that the disciplinary action was taken \u201cwithout good and just cause\u201d \u2014 a reference to the collective-bargaining agreement between the parties, which provided that teachers could be disciplined only for good and just cause. Under the collective-bargaining agreement, the grievance was submitted to arbitration. After a hearing, the arbitrator determined that the Board did not have good and just cause to discipline Draper. The arbitrator ordered the Board to expunge from Draper\u2019s personnel file any references to the discipline and to pay Draper for the three days that he was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Unhappy with the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the Board filed a motion in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas to vacate the arbitration award. The Association filed a motion to confirm the award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court vacated the award, asserting that the arbitrator had \u201cfailed to consider critical issues presented by the Board\u201d and had \u201cexceeded his authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The Association appeals the court\u2019s decision. In its sole assignment of error, it asserts that the court erred in vacating the award and in not granting the motion to confirm. The Association is correct;</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">In general, the law encourages arbitration, and courts should strive \u201cto favor the regularity and integrity of the arbitrator\u2019s acts.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judicial review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>arbitration proceedings is extremely limited, and a court may not set aside an arbitrator\u2019s award except in the very limited circumstances set forth in R.C. 2711.10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">R.C. 2711.10(D) provides that a court may vacate an award if \u201c[t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d (Neither party suggests that any other subparts of R.C. 2711.10 apply here.) To determine if an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers, the court must determine whether the award \u201cdraws its essence\u201d from the collective-bargaining agreement between the parties. This will be the case \u201cwhen there is a rational nexus between the agreement and the award, and where the award is not arbitrary, capricious or unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> So long as the award draws its essence from the collective-bargaining agreement, the court\u2019s inquiry is at an end, and it must affirm the arbitrator\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The Board made two arguments to the trial court to support its position that the arbitrator\u2019s award was not valid. First, it argued that the arbitrator erred because he did not make certain necessary determinations before making his award. Specifically, the Board claimed that the arbitrator failed to consider the issues of whether Barber\u2019s \u201cmooning\u201d of the camera was a serious offense that warranted disciplinary action and whether Draper failed in his duty to initiate discipline. But our review of the arbitrator\u2019s written opinion reveals that the arbitrator did consider all the necessary issues to reach a determination on the ultimate issue presented in the grievance: whether the Board had \u201cgood and just cause\u201d to discipline Draper.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In his opinion, the arbitrator outlined the respective positions of the parties. He specifically noted that the Board believed that Draper had failed to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>necessary disciplinary measures for what the Board considered to be a serious offense. After summarizing the facts of the dispute, he carefully discussed the basis for his award. Among other things, he concluded that Barber was merely trying to be funny when he \u201cmooned\u201d the camera and that Draper\u2019s photograph was not immoral or obscene. He also determined that Draper believed that \u201cby talking to [Barber\u2019s] mother in the setting of a counseling session, there was a reasonable chance of getting [Barber\u2019s] cooperation in the effort to use his talents to succeed in the classroom.\u201d He stated, \u201cI find that * * * Draper was not guilty of immorality, or incompetence, nor was he guilty of willful violation[s] of rules and regulations adopted by the Board. Accordingly, it is clear that there is an absence of good and just cause for the * * * suspension imposed on [Draper].\u201d Later, the arbitrator reiterated his conclusion that Draper acted reasonably:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cThe Board characterized the photograph as inappropriate, and the delay in reporting the incident as unreasonable. * * * While he has been accused of delay in reporting the matter, the fact is the delay was in [the] developing of [the] roll of film which contained the photograph. Within a reasonable time after obtaining the developed photograph, he reported to the counselor, and provided her with the photograph for use in the counseling session with the student and his mother. Considering all of the circumstances, I find that Mr. Draper acted reasonably. While I recognize that the Board contends he should have acted differently, I find that the Board\u2019s contention is based more on hindsight than insight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We conclude that the arbitrator properly considered both parties\u2019 positions and that he made a reasoned decision on the ultimate issue of whether the Board had good and just cause to discipline Draper. His opinion \u201cdrew its essence\u201d from the parties\u2019 collective-bargaining agreement and was not arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful. Thus, the trial court lacked any requisite basis under R.C. 2711.10(D) to vacate the award. Whether we, or the trial court, agree with the opinion is immaterial. The arbitration is binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The Board\u2019s second argument against the arbitrator\u2019s opinion was that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in fashioning his award. The Board referred to the following comment by the arbitrator: \u201cThe ordeal that [Draper] has been put through here in defending himself is adequate to help him understand the concerns of the Board.\u201d According to the Board, that comment was improper because, under the collective-bargaining agreement, the arbitrator did not have the authority to determine that the \u201cordeal\u201d of proceeding through the grievance process was sufficient discipline. But the Board\u2019s argument was specious. When the comment is read in its context, it is clear that the arbitrator was making it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>merely to stress that Draper had acted in good faith and that the Board did not have just cause to impose the three-day suspension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">\u201c[Draper] has what some teachers find difficult to obtain, <em>i.e., </em>the ability to maintain control of a classroom. The fact that one errant student exhibits unacceptable behavior should not be the basis for besmirching his reputation. The Board may reasonably expect its teachers to maintain order in a classroom, but it would be unreasonable to hold the teacher to the standard of an insurer. Occasionally, someone will get out of line and need to be dealt with. The Board has questioned [Draper\u2019s] manner of dealing with the student in this case, but upon a full consideration of the facts, there is adequate reason to believe that * * * Draper acted in good faith. The ordeal that he has been put through here in defending himself is adequate to help him understand the concerns of the Board. With that in mind, there is no justifiable reason to impose a three-day suspension, or to leave in his file any reference to the incident which occurred here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">After reviewing the arbitrator\u2019s opinion, we conclude that the arbitrator acted within his authority. We hold that there simply were not grounds under R.C. 2711.10(D) to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award and that the trial court erred in doing so. The Association\u2019s assignment is sustained. We reverse the trial court\u2019s order, and we reinstate and confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and final judgment entered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b367-7\">Doan, P.J., and Winkler, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\">.
