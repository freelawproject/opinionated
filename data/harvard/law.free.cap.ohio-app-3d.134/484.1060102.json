In her three assignments of error, she argues that the trial court failed to advise her of her rights pursuant to Juv.R. 29(D) before she admitted to the facts in the complaint, and that the court\u2019s award of permanent custody to the department of human services was not supported by the evidence and did not meet the statutory criteria. Although we agree with the award of permanent custody in this case based upon the record of the dispositional phase of the hearing, we must reluctantly reverse, since it is clear that the magistrate did not even minimally comply with Juv.R. 29(D).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">At the hearing on the complaint in this matter, Young was present and accompanied by both her attorney and a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>who was also an attorney. After all the parties waived opening statement, the magistrate was advised by the assistant prosecuting attorney that there was a possibility of an admission to the facts. At the apparent behest of Young (although even this is less than clear from the record), language was changed in the complaint to reflect that she had had \u201cminimal\u201d rather than \u201csporadic\u201d contact with her children. Then, after asking the parties whether such a change was acceptable, the magistrate stated, \u201cBased upon that, I\u2019m going to make an adjudication of dependency. I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s no objection to that finding?\u201d Young\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>answered, \u201cNone, your Honor.\u201d The magistrate then said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and proceeded to the dispositional phase of the hearing. At no time was any response personally elicited from Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Juv.R. 29(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">As this court has often observed, Juv.R. 29(D) imposes a positive obligation upon the trial court to make certain determinations before accepting an admission from a party. See <em>In re Lahmann </em>(Dec. 24, 1996), Hamilton App. No. C-950790, unreported, 1996 WL 733144; <em>In re Meyer </em>(Jan. 15, 1992), Hamilton App. Nos. C-910292 and C-910404, unreported, 1992 WL 5843. Indeed, Juv.R. 29 <em>prohibits </em>a court from accepting an admission from a juvenile unless it addresses the party \u201cpersonally.\u201d The purpose of the inquiry is to determine (1) that the admission is voluntary and made with an understanding of the nature of the allegations and the consequences of the admission; and (2) that the party understands that by admitting to the facts he or she is waiving the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>challenge witnesses and evidence against the party, to remain silent, and to introduce evidence at the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Similar to the analogous rule in an adult criminal proceeding, Crim.R. 11(C), Juv.R. 29(D) requires substantial, not strict, compliance. <em>Lahmann </em>and <em>Meyer, supra; </em>see <em>State v. Billups </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 31, 11 O.O.3d 150, 385 N.E.2d 1308. A trial court need not recite the provisions of the rule verbatim. <em>In re Beckert </em>(Aug. 8, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 68893, unreported, 1996 WL 447982. Nor must a court\u2019s inquiry constitute a formal colloquy. However, the record must adequately demonstrate that the party has been given sufficient information to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">While the rule is normally thought of in the context of delinquency hearings, reviewing courts have recognized that faithful adherence to Juv.R. 29(D) is of \u201cutmost importance\u201d in dependency cases that threaten the permanent loss of parental rights. <em>Elmer v. Lucas Cty. Children Serv. Bd. </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 241, 245, 523 N.E.2d 540, 545. The right of a parent to raise his or her child is considered an \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cbasic\u201d civil right. <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169, 1171, quoting <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 558-559. The Ohio Supreme Court has even characterized the loss of this right as \u201c \u2018the family law equivalent of the death penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680, 682, quoting <em>In re Smith </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16, 601 N.E.2d 45, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Juv.R. 29(D) is, therefore, no less applicable in the adjudicatory phase of a dependency proceeding than it is in a delinquency hearing. <em>In re Dukes </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 145, 150, 610 N.E.2d 513, 517. As observed by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Hayes, </em>parents in dependency proceedings \u201c \u2018must be afforded every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hayes, supra, </em>at 48, 679 N.E.2d at 682, quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 16, 601 N.E.2d at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The department of human services argues that the magistrate substantially complied with Juv.R. 29(D) by asking the parties whether the modification to the complaint was \u201cacceptable\u201d to all the parties, and by then asking whether there was any objection to her making an adjudication of dependency based upon the stipulation to the complaint as amended. We disagree. The magistrate never addressed Young personally, nor did she make any real inquiry into whether Young understood the nature of the charges in the complaint, the consequences of making an admission to the facts, or the rights she would be waiving as a consequence of the admission. Compliance with Juv.R. 29(D) was not only not substantial, it was not even minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number> The department next argues that there is \u201cno indication on the record that the admission was not voluntary, not made with the understanding of the nature of the allegations in the complaint.\u201d This argument, however, turns on its head the principle that a waiver of constitutional rights will not be presumed from a silent record. Contrary to the state\u2019s position, reviewing courts indulge every reasonable presumption <em>against </em>a waiver of fundamental constitutional rights. <em>Garfield Hts. v. Brewer </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 216, 217, 17 OBR 458, 459-460, 479 N.E.2d 309, 311, citing <em>Brewer v. Williams </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424. As we held in <em>Meyer, supra, </em>the burden on appeal is on the state to demonstrate a valid waiver when the record is silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">One issue not addressed by either party is the effect of Young\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>replying, \u201cNone, Your Honor,\u201d when the magistrate asked whether there was any objection to her making a finding of dependency based upon the complaint. The question arises whether this statement in any way lessened the magistrate\u2019s duty to comply with Juv.R. 29(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The record does not elucidate the particular reasons why the magistrate appointed Young a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>Young was over thirty years old at the time of the hearing and was therefore no longer a juvenile. In her decision, the magistrate stated that psychological testing performed in 1996 had revealed Young to be \u201cfunctioning in the borderline mentally retarded range of intelligence.\u201d We assume that this degree of incompetency was the reason for the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>under Juv.R. 4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The purpose'of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>is to secure for the juvenile or incompetent person a proper defense or an adequate protection of his or her rights. <em>In re Height </em>(1975), 47 Ohio App.2d 203, 1 O.O.3d 279, 353 N.E.2d 887. It is the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>duty to protect the best interests of the incompetent. A guardian <em>ad litem </em>is considered an officer of the court, see <em>Lovejoy v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 514, 602 N.E.2d 405, and must be distinguished from a general guardian who has the general care and control of the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">While a guardian <em>ad litem </em>has a protective role to play in any waiver of his or her ward\u2019s rights, that role does not preempt application of Juv.R. 29(D). Neither Young\u2019s attorney nor her guardian <em>ad litem </em>had the authority to make the decision for her to enter an admission. That decision belonged to Young uniquely. Particularly in light of Young\u2019s diminished mental capacity, it was incumbent upon the magistrate, notwithstanding the statement from Young\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>to comply with the mandate of Juv.R. 29(D) to personally address Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">It is noteworthy that, in an analogous situation, the Montgomery County Court of Appeals has held that the obligation of the court to personally address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>party under Juv.R. 29(D) is not eliminated even when the record affirmatively establishes that the party has given her attorney authority to speak for her. In <em>In re Richard, Laqueeda, Shennell &amp; Dominique </em>(Dec. 14, 1994), Montgomery App. Nos. 14140 and 14200, unreported, 1994 WL 702071, the mother\u2019s attorney stated to the magistrate that the mother was willing to stipulate to a finding - of dependency. The attorney then asked the mother, who was standing next to him, if that was correct, to which she replied \u201c[y]es\u201d on the record. The court of appeals rejected the argument of the children\u2019s services board that Juv.R. 29(D) had been satisfied. The court held that Juv.R. 29(D) required that the mother be personally addressed by the court, not by her attorney, and that, notwithstanding her attorney\u2019s representation that he had discussed the matter with his client, it was still incumbent upon the court to make sure that the mother fully understood her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We hold, therefore, that the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>statement did not in any way alter the magistrate\u2019s duty under Juv.R. 29(D) to personally address Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Waiver under Juv.R. 40(E)(3)(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">A more important issue not briefed by the parties is whether Young\u2019s failure to raise the issue of compliance with Juv.R. 29(D) in her objections to the decision of the magistrate precludes her from raising the issue now on appeal. Effective July 1, 1995, both Juv.R. 40(E)(3)(b) and its counterpart in the Civil Rules, Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b), were amended to provide that a party may not assign as error on appeal the trial court\u2019s \u201cadoption of any finding of fact or conclusion of law\u201d contained in the magistrate\u2019s report \u201cunless that party has objected to that finding or conclusion under this rule.\u201d While both amended Juv.R. 40(E)(4)(a) and Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(a) also provide that the trial court must undertake an independent examination of the magistrate\u2019s decision even if no objections are filed, such analysis is limited to errors of law or other defects \u201con the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The magistrate in her report stated: \u201cMother, Lisa Young, stipulated to the truth of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations, amending the word \u2018sporadic\u2019 to \u2018minimal\u2019 in paragraph 3. Upon such stipulation and the other parties\u2019 failure to appear, the children were adjudicated dependent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Although Young\u2019s attorney filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report, the objections challenged only the magistrate\u2019s decision to commit the children to the permanent custody of the department of human services. The trial court held a hearing on the objections on June 6, 1997. The record does not contain a transcript of that hearing. The trial court\u2019s entry stated simply that the decision of the magistrate was affirmed and permanent custody of the children granted to the department of human services for the purpose of adoptive placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>We are confronted, therefore, with a direct conflict between the constitutional principle that a waiver of fundamental rights cannot be presumed from a silent record, and a procedural rule that, if applied, would hold that the issue of waiver is itself waived. The waiver under Juv.R. 40(E)(3)(b) embodies the long-recognized principle that the failure to draw the trial court\u2019s attention to possible error, by objection or otherwise, when the error could have been corrected, results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal. <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 121, 679 N.E.2d 1099, 1103; see, also, <em>Gallagher v. Cleveland Browns Football Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 427, 436-437, 659 N.E.2d 1232, 1240. As noted by the court in <em>Goldfuss, </em>\u201cit is well established that failure to follow procedural rules can result in forfeiture of rights.\u201d <em>Goldfuss, supra, </em>at 122, 679 N.E.2d at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">An exception to the general rule of waiver is the plain-error doctrine. The doctrine originated in the criminal law and is embodied in Crim.R. 52(B): \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d Although its roots are in the criminal law, the Ohio Supreme Court has recognized application of the doctrine in civil cases as well. <em>Goldfuss, supra; LeFort v. Century 21-Maitland Realty Co. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 121, 124, 512 N.E.2d 640, 643; <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Astorhurst Land Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 268, 275, 18 OBR 322, 327-328, 480 N.E.2d 794, 800. Application of the plain-error doctrine to civil cases, however, is generally not favored. According to the holding of <em>Goldfuss, </em>the plain-error doctrine \u201cmay be applied only in the extremely rare [civil] case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process * * *.\u201d <em>Goldfuss </em>at. 122-123, 679 N.E.2d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Significantly, the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County has held that the plain-error doctrine may be applied as an exception to the waiver contained in Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b). <em>R.G. Real Estate Holding, Inc. v. Wagner </em>(Apr. 24, 1998), Montgomery App. No. 16737, unreported, 1998 WL 199628. We hold that the plain-error doctrine may similarly be applied to Juv.R. 40(E)(3)(b). Like <em>Wagner, </em>however, we caution that, consistent with <em>Goldfuss, </em>the doctrine should be used only sparingly and, as stated in <em>Wagner, </em>\u201cwould not be warranted in the absence of circumstances raising something more than a mere failure to object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We conclude that those circumstances exist in the present case. Although a dependency hearing is technically a civil and not a criminal proceeding, it is disingenuous to suggest that a proceeding that threatens \u201cthe family law equivalent of the death penalty\u201d should be treated like any other civil case involving a contract or tort claim. As previously observed, because parental rights are considered \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cessential,\u201d parents in a dependency proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>are to be given \u201c \u2018every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hayes, supra, </em>at 48, 679 N.E.2d at 682, quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 16, 601 N.E.2d at 54. A parent\u2019s right to the custody of his or her child is considered \u201cparamount.\u201d <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio, St.2d 89, 97, 6 O.O.3d 293, 297, 369 N.E.2d 1047, 1051-1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The magistrate\u2019s failure even to minimally comply with Juv.R. 29(D) raises the very real possibility that Young, a woman of limited mental capacity, did not fully understand her right to challenge the evidence as the state moved to terminate her parental rights. It bears emphasis that, as this court noted in <em>Meyer, supra, </em>a waiver made without an understanding of the rights being forfeited constitutes a violation of basic due process. Failure to comply with Juv.R. 29(D), therefore, requires no further showing of prejudice: <em>it is never harmless error. In re Lahmann, supra. </em>The magistrate\u2019s failure to substantially comply with Juv.R. 29(D) seriously damages the \u201cbasic fairness\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d of the underlying judicial process in this case. To apply the waiver of Juv.R. 40(E)(3)(b) would, we believe, only compound this unfairness and further impugn the integrity of the system by allowing the state to take permanent custody of a woman\u2019s children on a record demonstrating a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the magistrate failed to substantially comply with Juv.R. 29(D), and that this constituted plain error rendering inapplicable the waiver of Juv.R. 40(E)(3)(b). This holding necessitates that the case be reversed although we are admittedly reluctant to do so given the facts and circumstances placed on the record during the dispositional phase of the hearing. This court has no desire to prolong the ordeal of the children involved. However, because of the profound consequences that Young faces as a result of the department of human services\u2019 attempt to permanently terminate her parental rights, the magnitude of the magistrate\u2019s failure to substantially comply with Juv.R. 29(D) cannot be overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Young\u2019s first assignment of error concerning the trial' court\u2019s failure to comply with Juv.R. 29(D) is found to be well taken. Her second and third assignments of error challenging the trial court\u2019s award of permanent custody of her children to the department of human services are rendered moot based upon our resolution ofjhe first assignment. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, Young\u2019s admission to the facts of the complaint is vacated, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b525-9\">Sundermann, P.J., and Doan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\">.
