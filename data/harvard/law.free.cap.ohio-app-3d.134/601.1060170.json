Porter, Administrative Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">Plaintiff-appellant Mark C. Schwartz appeals from the summary judgment entered in favor of defendant-appellee Stewart Title Guaranty Company on plaintiffs claim under a title insurance policy for attorney fees resulting from his efforts to cure alleged defects in title to his condominium. Plaintiff contends that undisputed issues of material fact entitled him to coverage and indemnity under the title insurance policy as a matter of law. We find no error and affirm summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">To understand the issues on appeal, it is necessary to outline the substantial background and earlier litigation from which this case arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Schwartz purchased an unfinished condominium unit (Unit 306) in the Murray Hill Condominiums in 1989. He customized its interior. Stewart Title issued a standard form policy of title insurance to Schwartz on Unit 306, effective March 2, 1990. When the roof began to leak and the parking garage and swimming pool were not \u201crehabilitated\u201d as promised by the developers, Schwartz filed a fifteen-count complaint against various parties, including the architect and developer of the condominium (collectively referred to as the Murray Hill Company or \u201cMHC\u201d). See <em>Schwartz v. Giltz et al, </em>C.P. No. 214429, filed on July 15, 1991. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>(\u201cSchwartz I </em>\u201d). That same day, Schwartz sent a letter to Stewart Title giving notice of the suit and claiming a title defect in that, although the record owner of the Murray Hill Condominiums was the Murray Hill Company, an Ohio corporation, the declaration of the condominium listed the owner as the Murray Hill Company, an Ohio general partnership. In an August 22, 1991 follow-up letter, Schwartz also advised Stewart Title that his furnace room encroached into the common area of the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In <em>Schwartz </em>/, Schwartz sought more than two million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages for numerous alleged construction and contract deficiencies. In addition, he sought a declaratory judgment in <em>Schwartz I </em>that Unit 306 was not part of a condominium under Ohio law, due to the partnership/corporation name discrepancy, and sought to void the purchase agreement for Unit 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Stewart Title engaged coverage counsel to independently assess Schwartz\u2019s alleged claims under the title insurance policy. In a letter dated October 17, 1991, Stewart Title responded to Schwartz\u2019s claims declining coverage. The letter explained that the policy required Stewart Title to defend only third-party adverse claims against the insured, and that no third party had made an adverse claim affecting title, nor had title been rejected as unmarketable. Further, the letter explained that the indemnity provisions of the policy had not been triggered by actual damage to Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Although Stewart Title disclaimed any duty to do so, it undertook to assist MHC in its efforts to cure the partnership/corporation misnomer that Schwartz complained of. To that end, Stewart Title hired attorney Jay Rosenberg, a Cincinnati attorney and title expert, to review the document history for MHC and recommend whether and how the technical name deficiency could be cured. Rosenberg drafted and provided to MHC an affidavit pursuant to R.C. 5301.252, which was executed on November 6,1992, and filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The <em>Schwartz I </em>case was tried before a referee in common pleas court. The trial took twenty-one days, presented twenty witnesses and voluminous exhibits, and concluded in November 1993. Stewart Title was not a party. On June 16, 1994, the referee rendered a comprehensive forty-six-page report. Among the findings and conclusions rendered were the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">\u201cThat the \u2018corporation-partnership\u2019 misnomer which created the discrepancy between the Disclosure Statement and the Declaration was nothing more than a simple human error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">\u201cNeither Schwartz nor any of the other unit owners testified to any difficulties with mortgage loans or other financing arrangements arising from an alleged title defect. Title to Unit 306 has never been challenged or questioned by any one other than Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cThat efforts were undertaken to cure the \u2018corporation-partnership\u2019 misnomer by way of affidavit, which was prepared at the cost and direction of Stewart Title.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cThat by Murray Hill Partnership executing a deed to Murray Hill Corporation, it could \u2018clear any question as to title integrity.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201cThat Schwartz\u2019s theory that his unit was unmarketable due to the \u2018corporation-partnership\u2019 misnomer was untenable because the defect was curable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The referee rejected Schwartz\u2019s prayer to declare his purchase agreement for Unit 306 voidable. With respect to Schwartz\u2019s claim that Unit 306\u2019s furnace room encroached upon the condominium\u2019s common area, there could be no reimbursement to Schwartz. The referee noted that unanimous owner consent by exchange of quitclaim deeds to the encroachment could cure the problem, but if such consent were not forthcoming, he recommended that MHC redesign Unit 306 to Schwartz\u2019s satisfaction. In a journal entry dated September 22, 1995, the trial court adopted the report of the referee and entered orders accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The parties appealed the <em>Schwartz I </em>judgment. The appeal was dismissed when the parties to the MHC lawsuit entered into a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">\u201cThat MHC would pay $550,000 to Schwartz, his attorney, McFadden, and four other unit owners, and an additional $7,000 to Schwartz to be used by him to redesign his unit due to the furnace room encroachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">\u201cThat amendments would be drawn to bring all of the condominium documents in compliance with R.C. Chap. 5311 and specifically R.C. 5311.25, thereby curing alleged title defects. '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">\u201cThat a Motion to Vacate the September 22, 1995 Journal Entry would be submitted which stated that all of Schwartz\u2019s claims which were raised, or could have been raised therein, were settled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">On June 14, 1996, Schwartz sold Unit 306 to Robert and Nancy Derwae for $179,000. Chicago Title issued a standard form policy of title insurance to the Derwaes without reservations or exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">On April 4,-1996, Schwartz brought the instant case to recover attorney fees incurred in <em>Schwartz I </em>in order to quiet title resulting from the partnership/corporation name discrepancy and the furnace room encroachment. The complaint alleged counts for breach of contract, declaratory judgment, bad faith, and breach of fiduciary duty. Schwartz never clarified on the record whether the approximately $200,000 in fees he sought represented all or only a portion of the fees incurred in <em>Schwartz I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">Stewart Title claimed that there were no adverse claims against the title that it was obliged to defend under its policy and plaintiff suffered no injury or loss for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>which he was entitled to indemnity. Plaintiff claimed Stewart Title was obligated to pay the legal expense of quieting his own title because Stewart Title failed to honor its commitments under the policy. The trial court found \u201cthat no adverse claim to title was made. Therefore under the contract, Defendant did not owe an affirmative duty to the Plaintiff.\u201d Summary judgment was granted for Stewart Title and denied for plaintiff. Both parties agree that the case turns on a interpretation of the policy. Both contend that the language of the policy is clear and unambiguous and favors the application for which each contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We will address plaintiffs assignments of error in the order presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred when the trial court granted defendant-appellee title company\u2019s motion for summary judgment on plaintiff-appellant\u2019s claims one, five and six on the finding that no adverse claim to title was made and that the defendant-appellee title company did not owe an affirmative duty to the plaintiff-appellant insured to cure the plaintiff-appellant insured\u2019s unmarketable title which title the title company had insured to be marketable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Under Ohio law, the insured bears the burden of proving both the existence of a loss and coverage under an insurance policy. <em>Inland Rivers Serv. Corp. v. Hartford Fire Ins. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 32, 34, 20 O.O.3d 20, 21-22, 418 N.E.2d 1381, 1383; <em>Reverend Ferris E. Kleem v. Nationwide Ins.

The Ohio Supreme Court recently restated the appropriate test in <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201, 203-204 :</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\"> \u201cPursuant to Civ.R. 56, summary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, said party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196, paragraph three of the syllabus. The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264, 273-274.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Once the moving party satisfies its burden, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party\u2019s pleadings, but the- party\u2019s response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Civ.R. 56(E). <em>Mootispaw v.

Am. v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 302, 310, 692 N.E.2d 1028, 1033:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\u201cGenerally, insurance contracts must be construed in accordance with the same rules as other written contracts. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096, 1101-1102. Although juries are allowed to determine related factual matters, the interpretation of insurance contracts in the first instance is one of law for the trial court. <em>Leber v. Smith </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 548, 553, 639 N.E.2d 1159, 1163. Therefore, a court is precluded from rewriting a contract when the intent of the parties is evident, <em>i.e., </em>if the language of the policy\u2019s provisions is clear and unambiguous, the court may not resort to construction of the language. <em>Karabin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 163, 167, 10 OBR 497, 500, 462 N.E.2d 403, 406-407.\u201d See, also, <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684, 686 (\u201cIf a contract is clear and unambiguous, then its interpretation is a matter of law and there is no issue of fact to be determined.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Stewart Title contends that there was no adverse claim by a third party and there was no loss, and, as a matter of law, there was no coverage. Thus, Stewart Title contends that the plain meaning of the policy is that no coverage is provided for an insured\u2019s voluntary expenditures for attorney fees in prosecuting the insured\u2019s attack on his own title. Therefore, Stewart Title argues that any wounds to Schwartz in the form of attorney fees were self-inflicted, summary judgment against Schwartz was proper, and the trial court\u2019s decision should be affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Plaintiff, on his part, claims that there is no requirement in the-policy that there be an adverse claim clouding title before coverage applies. In short, plaintiff claims that the partnership/corporation name defect and the furnace room encroachment were defects that rendered the title unmarketable and that plaintiff was justified and entitled to indemnity under the policy for attorney fees required by his own action to quiet title. Both parties cite authority from other jurisdictions that supports their arguments. The issue appears to be a novel one under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Because both parties claim the policy is unambiguous in providing/not providing coverage, it behooves us to review closely the terms and conditions of the policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The insuring agreements on the face of the policy provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\u201cSUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGE, THE EXCEPTIONS FROM COVERAGE CONTAINED IN SCHEDULE B AND THE CONDITIONS AND STIPULATIONS, STEWART TITLE GUARANTY COMPANY, a Texas corporation, herein called the Company, insures, as of Date of Policy shown in Schedule A, against loss or damage, not exceeding the Amount of Insurance stated in Schedule A, sustained or incurred by the insured by reason of:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\u201c1.

Stewart Title did agree to pay \u201ccosts, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in the defense of title, as insured, but only to the extent provided in the Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d Two Conditions and Stipulations expressly address the issue of attorney fees and neither covers Schwartz\u2019s situation. Policy condition and stipulation 7 provides that \u201cthe company will pay only those costs, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in accordance with Section 4 of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d Under Section 4 of the Policy Conditions and Stipulations, only fees incurred in the defense of an adverse claim against the insured are covered. Thus, in Condition and Stipulation 4, Stewart Title agreed to defend Schwartz in \u201clitigation in which any third party asserts a claim adverse to title * * * but only as to those stated causes of action alleging a defect, lien, or encumbrance.\u201d Condition and Stipulation 4 also clearly states that Stewart Title \u201cwill not pay any fees, costs, or expenses incurred by the insured\u201d in matters not covered by the policy. In addition, Section 4 provides that Stewart Title \u201cshall not be liable for and will not pay the fees of any other counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The condominium endorsement to the policy added no coverage with respect to attorney fees, but expressly incorporated all provisions of the policy by stating it \u201cis subject to all of the Policy terms thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In sum, the policy expressly limited the insurer\u2019s attorney fee obligation to the payment of fees incurred by counsel selected by the insurer for the defense of a claim made adverse to the title or interest of the insured. The duty to pay legal fees was a product of the duty to defend. <em>Lush v. Imperial Cas. &amp; Indemn. Co. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 11, 18, 603 N.E.2d 420, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Schwartz essentially concedes that there was no adverse claim against his title.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was Schwartz\u2019s attorney who originated the litigation regarding the \u201cpartnership-corporation misnomer\u201d discrepancy and the encroachment of Schwartz\u2019s unit on condominium common areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">It is undisputed that Schwartz\u2019s fees were incurred to prosecute a case, not to defend one; Schwartz, not Stewart Title, selected the attorney who prosecuted <em>Schwartz I. </em>We find that the plain and unambiguous language of the policy herein excludes Schwartz\u2019s claims, and that the trial court did not err in granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>summary judgment for Stewart Title on Schwartz\u2019s claims. We are confirmed in this conclusion by the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In <em>Manneck v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. </em>(1994), 28 Cal.App.4th 1294, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d 771, the court found the dismissal of an insured\u2019s claim against its title insurer proper in a case similar to this one. The Mannecks discovered that the pool and fence of their home encroached on property owned by another party and demanded that their title insurer prosecute an action on their behalf and indemnify them against losses. 28 Cal.App.4th at 1298, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d at 773. When the title insurer denied coverage, plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and claimed damages for breach of contract. The court found that the trial court properly entered judgment for the title insurer on the issue of coverage because there was never any actual or even potential challenge to plaintiffs\u2019 title. The same result is warranted in this case because Schwartz\u2019s own claims of defects did not invoke coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">To avoid the policy exclusion for the attorney fees he incurred in <em>Schwartz I, </em>Schwartz argues that Stewart Title had a duty to cure the title defects that he alleged in <em>Schwartz I. </em>However, no such duty can be found in the policy. As noted above, the policy provides a duty to defend an adverse claim; it also provides a duty to indemnify against specified loss or damage in accordance with the policy terms. There is, however, no duty to cure defects, <em>per se, </em>as might be found in a title guaranty. However, the policy is one of indemnity, not guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"AkY\">Under the policy, whether to take action to cure alleged title defects is a matter committed to the sole discretion of the insurer. Condition and Stipulation 9(a), relied on by Schwartz, explains what happens if Stewart Title exercises this discretionary right, but creates no obligation. That an insurer may take certain action does not mean that it must do so. Cf. <em>Manneck, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at 1301, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d at 775. See, also, <em>Willow Ridge Ltd. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. </em>(S.D.Miss.1988), 706 F.Supp. 477, 483 (\u201c[T]he language of the policy is clear and unambiguous. While a suit to clear title was an option available to Stewart Title, it was an option and nothing more than that.\u201d); <em>Childs v. Mississippi Valley Title Ins. Co. </em>(Ala.1978), 359 So.2d 1146, 1152 (\u201cwithout owing a duty to take such affirmative action on this matter, there could be no breach\u201d). In analyzing the insurer\u2019s option to establish title under a policy, a leading authority states:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">\u201cWhen an insured title is not the subject of litigation, the insurer has the right to establish the title. The quoted provision above states just this much, but, significantly, no more. The word \u2018right\u2019 is used and might be juxtaposed against other words that the drafter of the policy might have chosen. Read in the context of the whole policy, such a provision as this usually appears in conjunction with the \u2018duty to defend\u2019 provision, so that, in the policy as a whole, this is a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>coupled with a duty.\u201d D. Burke, Law of Title Insurance (2 Ed.) Section 12.5, at 12:51.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Although Burke goes on to state that some courts have found that the duty to establish or clear title was mandatory, he notes that this is not the universal view. Given the plain language in the case herein, we find there was no duty to take affirmative action on the part of Stewart Title. To do so would impose a duty where the parties\u2019 agreement provided none.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The absence of a title insurer\u2019s duty to cure defects, whether or not they are challenged, is underscored by the policy\u2019s exclusion of coverage for \u201cdefects, liens, encumbrances, adverse claims or other matters resulting in no loss or damage to the insured.\u201d Schwartz never claimed loss or damage from the alleged title defects but rather sought to recover fees and expenses that he planned to and later did incur in a case that he initiated. Such fees are clearly not loss or damage under the policy. Under the recognized principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(mention of one implies exclusion of another), the separate treatment of \u201closs or damage\u201d and attorney fees and costs throughout the policy, \u201closs or damage\u201d as stated in the policy, does not contemplate such fees and costs. See <em>Watkins v. Brown </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 160, 166, 646 N.E.2d 485, 488-489.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The principle that title insurance is a contract of indemnity, not a guaranty of the state of title, is not only inherent in the policy here but is recognized generally by the courts in cases involving both owner\u2019s and mortgagee\u2019s title insurance. <em>E.g., Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. McDaniel </em>(Tex.1994), 875 S.W.2d 310, 311; <em>Udell v. City Title Ins. Co. </em>(1960), 208 N.Y.S.2d 504, 12 A.D.2d 78; <em>Sattler v. Philadelphia Title Ins. Co. </em>(1960), 192 Pa.Super. 337, 342, 162 A.2d 22; <em>Falmouth Natl. Bank v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.1, 1990), 920 F.2d 1058; <em>Gibraltar Sav. v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.8, 1990), 905 F.2d 1203, 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The difference between indemnity and guaranty contracts is that a contract of indemnity \u201cdoes not guarantee the state of the title, but rather agrees to indemnify the insured for any loss.\u201d <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(Aug. 25, 1998), Delaware App. No. 98CAE03018, unreported, 1998 WL 548959; Burke, <em>supra </em>(2 Ed.) Section 2.1.1, at 2:2: See, also, <em>Shafron Enterprises Defined Benefit Pension Plan v. Midland Title Security, Inc. </em>(June 25, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 60922, unreported, 1992 WL 146842 (Title guaranty guarantees good title. When defect made known, company must take steps to correct defect.). The purpose of title insurance is to safeguard the transferee of real estate from the possibility of loss through defects that may cloud title. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981), Section 5201, at 2; <em>United States v. Flint </em>(E.D.Mich.1972), 346 F.Supp. 1282, 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>To trigger the duty to indemnify, the insured must have a claim asserted against the title by a third party because an \u201cindemnity is a * * * collateral promise to make good a loss or injury suffered by a policyholder in consequence of the act of a third party.\u201d Burke, <em>supra, </em>Section 2.1.1, at 2:4-2:5. An indemnity contract requires that the insured suffer an actual loss. <em>Sattler v. Philadelphia Title Ins. Co. </em>(1960), 192 Pa.Super. 337, 342, 162 A.2d 22, 25; <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. McDaniel </em>(Tex.1994), 875 S.W.2d 310, 311; Burke, <em>supra, </em>Section 2.1.1, at 2:2-2:3, 2:6 (\u201cSuch a loss does not occur when an adverse claim, lien, or encumbrance on title is in existence but remains unasserted.\u201d). \u201cThe kind of loss contemplated by such policy is that loss or damage sustained when, \u2018because of a defect in the title, the insured was bound to pay something to make it good.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grunberger v. Iseson </em>(1980), 75 A.D.2d 329, 332, 429 N.Y.S.2d 209, 211, <em>citing Empire Dev. Co. v. Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1918) 225 N.Y. 53, 60, 121 N.E. 468, 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In the case herein, we find no loss was actually sustained by the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff argues that his title was made unmarketable because of the defect, this is not a loss suffered by the adverse action or claim asserted by a third party. Without an adverse claim contending that the title is unmarketable, the defendant has no duty to provide the plaintiffs attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\u201cThe wording is important \u2014 the policy\u2019s coverage here is not of the marketability of title, but of an <em>\u2018unmarketable </em>\u2019 one. The negative wording is consistent \u2022with the indemnity nature of the policy. To cover marketability of the title insured would be to guarantee the title; to cover its unmarketability is to provide an indemnity against- adverse claims asserted against it. A marketable title is one that a vendor, through judicial action, can compel a purchaser to take; an unmarketable title is one that a purchaser, in the course of a transaction, is justified in rejecting at the closing table. Between these two poles, it is possible to find a good title for many purposes, but unmarketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\u00ab :|: * *</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">\u201cMarketability is the grease on the wheels of real property transactions. Its function is to prevent an attorney from \u2018fly-specking\u2019 a title \u2014 looking for defects technically valid, but so trivial that they would not affect the value of the property or the acceptability of title.\u201d Burke, <em>supra, </em>Section 3.2.6, at 3:46-3:47.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">We agree with the trial court that there was no duty to defend without an adverse claim. Nor was there a duty to indemnify without actual loss. There was no duty to cure in the absence of an adverse claim as might be appropriate in a title guaranty. In light of the undisputed facts and the plain meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>policy, summary judgment was properly entered by the trial court for the title company and denied the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Plaintiffs Assignment of Error I is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred when the trial court held plaintiff-appellant\u2019s claims two, three and four are moot because there is no case in controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The trial court apparently relied on Schwartz\u2019s sale of his condominium Unit 306 as its basis for finding moot the second, third, and fourth claims for relief \u2014 the declaratory judgment counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The essential elements for declaratory relief are (1) a real controversy between the parties, (2) that is justiciable in character, and (3) speedy relief is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties. <em>Ohio Assn. of Life Underwriters, Inc. v. Duryee </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 532, 534, 642 N.E.2d 1145, 1146. See <em>Burger Brewing Co. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., Dept. of Liquor </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 93, 63 O.O.2d 149, 296 N.E.2d 261, paragraph one of syllabus; R.C. 2721.02. A declaratory judgment action should be dismissed when (1) there is no controversy or justiciable issue between the parties; or (2) a declaratory judgment will not terminate the uncertainty or the controversy. <em>Ohio Assn. of Life Underwriters, supra, </em>at 534, 642 N.E.2d at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">The trial court properly applied these criteria to Schwartz\u2019s claims for declaratory judgment against Stewart Title. The second claim for relief was also moot because Schwartz had fully tried the issues of marketability and title defect in <em>Schwartz I </em>and settled and released his claims. See <em>Turner v. Cleveland City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 99 Ohio App.3d 666, 668-669, 651 N.E.2d 511, 512; <em>Wagner v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 62 Ohio App.3d 8, 13, 574 N.E.2d 533, 537; <em>Cincinnati Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Cincinnati Dist. Council No. 51 </em>(1969), 22 Ohio App.2d 39, 42, 51 O.O.2d 45, 46-47, 257 N.E.2d 410, 413 (holding that parties must \u201cpossess a legal interest in an actual controversy\u201d or claims are moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Plaintiffs Assignment of Error II is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred when the trial court failed to grant plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on plaintiff-appellant\u2019s second claim for relief on the finding that there is no case in controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the fifth' and sixth claims for relief, which alleged bad faith on defendant\u2019s part and breach of fiduciary duty, was proper for reasons in addition to the absence of policy coverage for Schwartz\u2019s claim due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the absence of an adverse claim. In regard to the fifth claim for relief, plaintiffs claimed basis for bad faith occurred more than four years before the complaint was filed and the claim is therefore barred by the statute of limitations. See <em>Sanderson v. Ohio Edison Co., Inc. </em>(Nov. 1, 1996), Ottawa App. No. OT-96-022, unreported, 1996 WL 629478; <em>United Dept. Stores Co. No. 1 v. Continental Cas. Co. </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 72, 73, 534 N.E.2d 878, 880. Schwartz also failed to establish a genuine issue concerning whether Stewart Title\u2019s rejection of his claims lacked reasonable justification. <em>Zoppo v. Homestead Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 552, 555, 644 N.E.2d 397, 400; <em>Friendly Farms v. Reliance Ins. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 79 F.3d 541, 545-546.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Similarly, summary judgment of the sixth claim for relief was proper because Ohio law does not impose upon an insurer a fiduciary duty with respect to the analysis of claims, absent evidence that the insured placed special trust or confidence in the insured \u2014 and there was no such evidence here. See <em>Nichols v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 684, 698, 669 N.E.2d 323, 333 (no fiduciary relationship existed between title company that disbursed loan proceeds and borrower); <em>Craggett v. Adell Ins. Agency </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 443, 451, 635 N.E.2d 1326, 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Plaintiffs Assignment of Error III is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-8\">Rocco and Blackmon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-19\">.
