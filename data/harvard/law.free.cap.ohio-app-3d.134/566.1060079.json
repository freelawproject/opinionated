Combs assigns as error the denial of credit for time spent in the Pathfinder program.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">In denying credit, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">\u201cThe Court finds that the Pathfinder facility is not confinement within the terms of the Ohio Revised Code. Pathfinder Halfway House setting does not have bars and Defendants are free to come and go from the building with permission. Defendants maintain employment while they reside at the halfway house facility. Defendant\u2019s time spent in Pathfinder was not incarceration and the jail time credit determination previously made remains in effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">We have recently considered a similar situation in <em>State v. McComb </em>(June 25, 1999), Greene App. No. 99 CA 8, unreported, 1999 WL 961344. In that case, we remanded the cause to the trial court for reconsideration of whether inpatient treatment at Talbert House constituted \u201cconfinement\u201d for which McComb was entitled to credit against his prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">In <em>McComb, </em>we noted the Supreme Court\u2019s commentary in <em>State v. Nagle </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 185, 186-187, 23 OBR 348, 349, 492 N.E.2d 158, 159, on the legislative examples of \u201cconfinement\u201d in R.C. 2949.08(C):</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">\u201cIt is instructive to note that in none of these specified circumstances may the defendant leave official custody of his own volition. In contrast, the rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>facility imposed restrictions upon appellee\u2019s freedom of action to the extent communications with family or friends were restricted or monitored. Yet, appellee\u2019s freedom of movement was not so severely restrained, <em>ie., </em>he indeed did voluntarily depart the facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Because we determined that the trial court had erred in relying on R.C. 2929.01(V) in determining whether the Talbert House treatment program was confinement, we remanded for reconsideration of that question, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\u201cAccordingly, we must remand this matter to the trial court for reconsideration of McComb\u2019s motion in light of the definition of \u2018confinement\u2019 as contained in the above cited statutes [R.C. 2967.191, 2949.08(C), 2949.12] and elaborated upon in <em>Nagle. </em>On remand, the trial court should focus on whether McComb was confined while at Talbert House rather than whether Talbert House satisfied the R.C. 2929.01(V) definition of a \u2018jail\u2019 Depending on the trial court\u2019s familiarity with the Talbert House program, a hearing may or may not be required to make the determination of whether McComb was confined while undergoing treatment at Talbert House. The trial court should conduct an evidentiary hearing if its knowledge of [the] Talbert House program does not enable it to readily determine whether participation in the program does or does not constitute confinement. Regardless of whether it conducts a hearing, if the relief requested is denied, the trial court should provide an explanation of why McComb\u2019s participation in the Talbert House program was not confinement.\u201d <em>State v. McComb, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In this case, the trial court appears to have been sufficiently familiar with the Pathfinder program to explain with particularity why the program did not constitute confinement. Accordingly, remand for a hearing would serve no purpose. Furthermore, we conclude that the trial court correctly concluded that the Pathfinder program was not confinement as contemplated by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-11\">Grady, P.J., and Koehler, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b600-12\">Richard N.
