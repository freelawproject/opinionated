We find no Ohio decisions directly on point, and no reported decisions at all. Like many issues that seem to be of first impression in the appellate courts, this one may be so because no one ever thought to raise it before. And properly so, because the language is a rule of statutory construction directed to' courts, not to juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Appellee, William Dean, appealed to the court of common pleas from the administrative decision of the Industrial Commission of Ohio denying his right to workers\u2019 compensation for a claimed injury. Following a jury verdict in Dean\u2019s favor, the trial court entered judgment for Dean and against appellants, the Industrial Commission of Ohio, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and Cincinnati Drum Service, Inc., Dean\u2019s employer (collectively referred to as \u201cthe bureau\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The bureau appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment, raising two assignments of error. In its first assignment, it challenges the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that definitions were to be liberally construed. In the second assignment, the bureau contends the trial court erred by ordering reimbursement of an expert-witness fee and the copying costs of medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s use of a particular jury instruction, we \u201cmust determine whether the jury charge probably misled the jury in a matter materially affecting the complaining party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is, we must first consider whether the instruction was a misstatement of the law, and if so, whether the erroneous instruction probably misled the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, \u201c[a] court in considering the propriety of any jury instruction must always bear in mind that the purpose of the jury instruction is to clarify the issues and the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>position in the case. It must be remembered that juries are composed of ordinary men on the street, not grammarians, and that fine distinctions in the meaning of words or phrases are not ordinarily recognized by the average layman.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The bureau challenges the following instruction, to which it objected at trial: \u201cLiberal construction. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of the Ohio Revised Code shall be liberally construed in favor of employees with respect to the definitions previously given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyP\">Before giving the contested instruction, the trial court had defined \u201cburden of proof,\u201d \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d \u201cevidence,\u201d \u201cdirect evidence,\u201d \u201ccircumstantial evidence,\u201d \u201cstipulation,\u201d \u201cexpert opinion,\u201d \u201cdepositions,\u201d \u201ccorporations,\u201d \u201ccourse of employment,\u201d \u201carising out of employment,\u201d \u201cproximate injury,\u201d \u201cparticipate in workers\u2019 compensation,\u201d \u201cintoxication,\u201d and \u201cappreciable.\u201d We commend the trial judge for providing written copies of the charge to the jury. This is the far better practice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Although we can find no Ohio decisions addressing the cited language in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and no reported decisions even close to the point, three Ohio courts have been confronted with a similar ploy by criminal defendants. R.C. 2901.04(A) states, \u201cSections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d We have found three cases in which creative defense attorneys attempted to have the trial court give that language as an instruction to the jury. The appellate courts held that such an instruction should not have been given. An unreported Eighth Appellate District opinion held, \u201cIt is not the jury\u2019s job to construe criminal statutes. Construing statutes is a job for the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This court stated in a 1984 unreported opinion, \u201c[W]e find that R.C. 2901.04 is neither relevant to a jury\u2019s deliberations nor generally is it properly within the province of the jury to consider. R.C. 2901.04 concerns interpretation of the <em>law </em>\u2014a matter for the court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Fourth Appellate District, relying on the reasoning of the Eighth Appellate District and this court, has also concluded that it is improper to instruct a jury on how to construe a criminal statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Courts in other states have addressed the propriety of a jury instruction that a statute\u2019s language is to be liberally construed. An Arizona appellate court held that an instruction that the state\u2019s lien laws were to be liberally construed was erroneous, in part, because the \u201cliberally construed\u201d language was a rule of statutory construction designed to aid courts in interpreting statutes, not \u201cto guide the jury when they applied the law to the facts.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, the Supreme Court of South Dakota held that it was error for the trial court to charge the jury that provisions of the liquor laws were to be liberally construed. It explained that the challenged instruction involved \u201cinterpretation of the act and is addressed solely to the courts, and the jury has nothing to do with it.\u201d The court concluded that the giving of the instruction was prejudicial error because \u201cit must have impressed the jury that the liquor laws stand upon a higher plane than other criminal laws, and that it should be particularly astute to convict upon a charge of violating the intoxicating liquor laws as compared with the violation of other laws.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Alaska concluded that an instruction that a section of the state constitution was to be liberally construed in favor of the property owner was an improper instruction because it could induce a jury to be liberal in its damage award.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We can find no cases approving such an instruction, nor any other cases where a similar instruction was even <em>proposed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We hold that the \u201cliberally construed\u201d language of R.C. 4123.95 is directed to courts for use in interpreting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The language has no place in jury instructions. A jury\u2019s role is to make findings of fact, to weigh the credibility of witnesses, and to apply the law, as given, to the evidence admitted, not to interpret the language of statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Thus, the instruction was clearly erroneous. It was also prejudicial. The error was compounded in this case when the instruction broadly described the definitions that were to be liberally construed as those \u201cpreviously given.\u201d Previously given instructions included not only terms defined in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but also terms going to the heart of basic trial procedures essential to a fair trial, including burden of proof and preponderance of the evidence. A jury should apply those terms exactly, not \u201cliberally construe\u201d the burden of proof. We conclude that, within the context of the instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>provided, the jury instruction on liberal construction was misleading and prejudicial to the bureau. We sustain the first assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The bureau\u2019s second assignment of error involves issues that arise only when a claimant\u2019s right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund has been established.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the disposition of the first assignment extinguishes the necessary predicate for the reimbursement of expert-witness fees, because the issue may arise again on remand, judicial economy requires us to address the bureau\u2019s second assignment. We believe that the fees of an expert whose testimony is reasonably necessary to establish a claimant\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund are contemplated as reimbursable to a prevailing claimant under R.C. 4123.512(F) as part of \u201c[t]he costs of any legal proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">We recognize that there is disagreement among the appellate courts in this state,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but we believe that the \u201cshall be taxed\u201d language of R.C. 4123.512(F) requires the trial court to award costs for expert-witness fees. (The amount to be awarded and whether the testimony was reasonably necessary rests in the trial court\u2019s discretion.) Although <em>Moore v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>specifically involved costs of an expert\u2019s witness fee for preparing and giving his deposition, we believe that the rationale behind that decision is applicable to the fees for an expert testifying live at trial. This is so partly because the language of R.C. 4123.519 is to be liberally construed (by courts) in favor of employees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is just this type of legal issue that the \u201cliberally construed\u201d language is directed to. One purpose behind the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to prevent the dissipation of a claimant\u2019s recovery by \u201creasonable litigation expenses connected with the preparation and presentation of an appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.519.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the language of the statute \u201cis designed to minimize the actual expense incurred by an injured employee who establishes his or her right to participate in the fund.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In light of the intent behind R.C. 4123.512, we liberally construe R.C. 4123.512(F) to include as part of \u201cthe costs of any legal proceedings\u201d the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>an expert whose testimony is reasonably necessary to establish a prevailing claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We overrule the bureau\u2019s second assignment, but having sustained the first assignment, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with the law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b405-7\">Doan, P.J., and Gorman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\">.
