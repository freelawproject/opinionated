In essence, Farley\u2019s petition alleges that Dr. McIntosh performed a biased and incomplete court-ordered competency examination and provided the court with incomplete testimony and a incredible evaluation report. Farley then cites Ohio\u2019s public records legislation as authorizing his request for information from Dr. McIntosh.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>In response, Dr. McIntosh has filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. Dr. McIntosh contends that Farley has not met the requirements for obtaining a writ of mandamus. Having reviewed the relator\u2019s petition and Dr. McIntosh\u2019s motion, we agree that Farley has not met the requirements for a writ of mandamus. To secure a writ of mandamus, a petitioner must demonstrate a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, the respondent\u2019s clear legal duty to perform the requested act, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law. <em>State ex rel. Seikbert v. Wilkinson </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 489, 490, 633 N.E.2d 1128, 1129-1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Farley, however, has no clear legal right to the information demanded from McIntosh. Farley seeks the information under Ohio\u2019s public records act. That act, however, defines a \u201cpublic record\u201d as \u201cany record that is kept by any public office.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). Furthermore,, a \u201crecord\u201d is \u201cany document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or characteristic, created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d R.C. 149.011(G). Finally, a \u201cpublic office\u201d is \u201cany state agency, public institution, political subdivision, or any other organized body, office, agency, institution, or entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government.\u201d R.C. 149.011(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">At the outset, we note that Farley\u2019s request for Dr. McIntosh to prepare an affidavit falls outside the public records act. Farley\u2019s request does not seek an existing document, device, or item. Consequently, the information sought is not a record. Furthermore, he seeks to compel the creation of a new document. Under these circumstances, Farley has no legal right to the information requested, and Dr. McIntosh has no legal duty to perform the requested act. <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Mengel </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 455, 455-456, 584 N.E.2d 664, 665; <em>State ex rel. Kemer v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 273, 275, 695 N.E.2d 256, 258-259 (noting that the public records act does not compel the creation of a new document to satisfy a petitioner\u2019s demands).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Additionally, Farley has. cited no authority for the proposition that a court-appointed psychologist is public office. Dr. McIntosh being a private psychologist, any personal records he might possess are his private records. In reaching this conclusion, we note that the Ohio State Board of Psychology already has provided Farley with a letter containing certain public information about Dr. McIntosh, including his address, license number and date of issuance, lack of any disciplinary actions, university issuing his degree, and areas of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>We note also that Farley seeks Dr. McIntosh\u2019s \u201cfiles of his credibility as to his expertise.\u201d This vague demand does not describe with particularity the specific documents being sought. As a result, we question whether it would constitute a proper public records request, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Dr. McIntosh otherwise would have an obligation to respond. <em>State ex rel. Zauderer v. Joseph </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 752, 756, 577 N.E.2d 444, 446 (finding that a request under the public record act \u201cmust be specific and particularly describe what it is that is being sought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In short, we find that Farley lacks any legal right to the requested relief, and we find that Dr. McIntosh is under no legal duty to perform the requested acts. Farley has presented no statutory or common-law authority imposing a duty upon a court-appointed examiner to provide unspecified records and currently nonexistent testimony more than fifteen years after defense counsel stipulated to the competency examination results. Therefore, finding Farley without a legal right to the requested relief, and finding Dr. McIntosh under no legal duty to perform the requested act, we need not consider the existence of adequate remedies at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we grant Dr. McIntosh\u2019s motion to dismiss Farley\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. Farley\u2019s petition is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-8\">Frederick N.
