Lewis, M.D., Inc., and Stephen J. Lewis, M.D. (\u201cDr. Lewis\u201d), on his claim of loss of parental consortium.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At issue is whether a minor child with a derivative claim must be joined as a party to his father\u2019s medical negligence action, and what the effect is if he is not joined. Because Dr. Lewis did not contend, in the father\u2019s action, that Alex ought to have been joined as a party, he is precluded from asserting that defense in Alex\u2019s independent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">In June 1994, Wayne Hague and his second wife, Nonie Hague, filed a complaint alleging medical negligence by Dr. Lewis for failure to diagnose a spinal abscess that rendered Wayne a quadriplegic. His wife\u2019s claim was for loss of spousal consortium. Wayne was deposed by Dr. Lewis\u2019s counsel during discovery and testified that he had a minor son, Alex, from a previous marriage, who lived with his mother in Ft. Thomas, Kentucky. Seventeen months later, a jury awarded Wayne and Nonie Hague damages in excess of one million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">In January 1997, Alex brought this independent action seeking money damages against Dr. Lewis for loss of parental consortium.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Lewis moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>summary judgment, contending that the child\u2019s claim was barred for failure to join it in the prior action with his father\u2019s medical negligence claim. On May 16, 1997, the trial court, without explanation, granted Dr. Lewis\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In a single assignment of error, Alex contends that summary judgment for Dr. Lewis was improper because the doctor waived the failure-to-join defense when it was not timely asserted in the trial of the underlying medical negligence claim. The parties agree that no genuine issues of material fact remain for trial. Therefore, this court must uphold the summary judgment if \u201cthe moving party [was] entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Both parties agree that the compulsory-joinder provisions of Civ.R. 19.1 do not apply. The rule expressly provides for compulsory joinder of persons bringing derivative claims like spousal consortium or a parent\u2019s consortium claim where a minor child is injured. Civ.R. 19.1(A)(2) and (3). Logically, and in fairness, the joinder of a minor child raising a loss-of-parental-consortium claim should also be controlled by Civ.R. 19.1. In 1996, after the Supreme Court, in <em>Gallimore v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr., supra, </em>recognized the loss-of-parental-consortium claim for the first time, Civ.R. 19.1 was amended to employ the more inclusive term \u201cconsortium\u201d rather than the term \u201cservices\u201d as noted in the syllabus paragraphs of the <em>Gallimore </em>decision. But no corresponding amendment was made to require the compulsory joinder of a party bringing a loss-of-parental-consortium claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In the absence of compulsory joinder by rule or by statute, the joinder of a minor bringing a derivative claim is determined by Civ.R. 19, entitled \u201cJoinder of persons needed for just adjudication.\u201d See <em>Coleman v. Sandoz Pharm. Corp. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 492, 494, 660 N.E.2d 424, 426. A party asserting a claim for relief in the underlying suit \u201cshall state the names, if known to the pleader, of any persons\u201d who would leave another party subject to a substantial risk of multiple obligations and \u201cwho are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined.\u201d Civ.R. 19(C); see Civ.R. 19(A). If a person needed for a just adjudication has not been joined by the parties, \u201cthe court shall order that he be made a party <em>upon timely assertion of the defense of failure to join a party as provided in Rule 12(B)(7).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Civ.R. 19(A). The rule expressly provides that if the defense is not timely asserted, it is waived as provided in Civ.R. 12(G) and 12(H). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In the seventeen months after all the parties in the father\u2019s medical negligence action became aware of the minor son\u2019s existence, none of the parties apprised the trial court he was needed for just adjudication and should be joined. The Hagues did not amend their complaint to name Alex in accordance with Civ.R. 19(C). Similarly, Dr. Lewis did not plead or otherwise assert the defense of failure to join a party pursuant to Civ.R. 19(A). The assertion of a joinder defense appeared for the first time of record in Dr. Lewis\u2019s February 7, 1997, answer filed in Alex\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">While Civ.R. 19(C) contains no specific sanction, absent a showing of bad faith or deception for Wayne Hague\u2019s failure to name Alex as a party to be joined, Civ.R. 19(A) provides that the failure to join a party who should be joined is waived if not timely asserted by the means identified in Civ.R. 12(B)(7). Therefore, since Dr. Lewis did not assert the defense at a time when the trial court could have ruled on whether Alex ought to have been joined as a party in the father\u2019s action, Dr. Lewis is now precluded from asserting that defense in this case. Civ.R. 12(G) and 12(H). The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Therefore, that portion of the trial court\u2019s May 16, 1997, judgment entering summary judgment for Dr. Lewis is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in fart and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-8\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-12\">. We have <em>sua sponte </em>removed this cause from the accelerated calendar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-13\">. The Supreme Court of Ohio recognized a minor child\u2019s cause of action for loss of parental consortium against one who has negligently harmed the child\u2019s parent in <em>Gallimore v. Childrens Hosp. Med. Ctr. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 244, 617 N.E.2d 1052, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\">. In the same entry, the court granted Alex\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, as the prior verdict established that Lewis was negligent and had proximately caused Wayne Hague\u2019s injury. Neither party has assigned as error this part of the court\u2019s entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
