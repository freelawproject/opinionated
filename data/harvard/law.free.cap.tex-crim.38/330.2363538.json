Article 22, Revised Statutes,'is not divided into sections, but in subdivisions, each subdivision providing the terms for the holding of the courts in one of the particular judicial districts of the State,, and each district is set out by its number; it evidently being the legislative intention to treat the subdivisions as sections, the same being sufficiently within the meaning' of the term \u201csection\u201d as used in the constitutional provision. Moreover, it can be gathered with certainty from \u2022the title of the act in question that it was not intended to reenact the entire article 22, Revised Statutes, but only that portion of the same with reference to the twenty-third judicial district, because it singles out the particular counties named in the act which are embraced in the twenty-third judicial district alone.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Z. </em>Same\u2014Construction, of Laws.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b347-5\">The title of an act may be viewed in the light of the whole act to arrive at the legislative intention.

We have but one question presented for revision, and that is that this conviction can not be sustained, upon the ground that it was obtained at a term of court which was illegal and void. This contention of appellant is based upon the act of the Twenty-fifth Legislature (page 118) which provides for the time of holding district courts in the Twenty-third Judicial District. ' Said act makes changes in the law as to the time of holding district court in the various counties of said district. It is further contended that said act was repealed by a subsequent act of said Legislature (page 202), changing the times of holding the district court in the \u25a0Seventh Judicial District. The basis of this contention is found in sec-36 of article 3 of the Constitution of the State, which reads as follows: '\u201cNo 'law shall be revived or amended by reference to its title, but in such eases the act revived, or the section or sections amended, shall be reenacted and published at length.\u201d The two acts under discussion purport to amend article 22 of the Revised Statutes of 1895. The original article 22 fixes and designates the times of holding court in all the judicial districts in this State, beginning with the first and ending with the last numbered district. By reference to said article, it will be seen that each district is set out therein by its number. For instance, the first subdivision of said article 22 fixes the time for holding court in the various counties composing the First Judicial District; and so of the second, and on to the end of said article. The first amendment to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>article by the Twenty-fifth Legislature was with reference to the First Judicial District, which purports to amend article <em>22, </em>but fails to recite in the title that section 1 of said article was to be amended, but simply refers to article <em>22 </em>(Acts 25th Leg., p. <em>57). </em>The time of holding the-courts in the different counties of several of the districts was amended in the same manner by the same Legislature. We believe the act in question is not violative of section 36 of article 3 of the Constitution. The-title of the act is as follows: \u201cAn act to amend article <em>22, </em>title 4, of the Bevised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1895, so as to extend the terms of the District Court in Fort Bend, Wharton, Brazoria, and Waller counties.. * * *\u201d We would also state in this connection that the title of the-act to amend the First District is similar in terms to the above. We-would also observe that article <em>22, </em>being the article apportioning the judicial districts, has never been formally seetionized, though each district,, from the. first to the last, inclusive, is numbered consecutively; and no doubt it was the intention of the Legislature to treat said subdivisions-as sections; and in our opinion those numbers of the district in said article <em>22 </em>are sufficiently within the meaning of the term \u201csection or sections,\u201d mentioned in the constitutional provision. If we are correct in this statement, then it follows that if the title to the act in question had read as follows, \u201cAn act-to amend section <em>23, </em>article <em>22, </em>title 4, of the Bevised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1895, so as to extend the terms of the-District Court in Fort Bend, Wharton, Brazoria, and Waller counties,\u201d' it would have been in exact accord with the constitutional requirements. Then, the only question presented is found in the fact that said section <em>23 </em>is not specifically named as such in the title. We are of opinion that we can gather with certainty from the title to this act that it was not. the intention of the Legislature to re-enact the entire article <em>22, </em>but merely to amend that portion of it with reference to the Twenty-third Judicial District, because the language there used can have no other-reference-than to the particular district in question, for it is entitled \u201cAn act to amend article <em>22, </em>title 4, of the Bevised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1895,\u201d etc., and singles out, from all of the other districts mentioned in said article, counties in the Twenty-third Judicial District,, just as said counties are set .out in the original article <em>22 </em>as being contained in the Twenty-third Judicial District.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">It is clear that we can look to the title of this act, when viewed in the-light of the whole of article <em>22, </em>to ascertain the meaning of the Legislature, and when this has been done, the legislative mind and intent admit of no question. But, besides, if there was any difficulty in the construetion of said act, we would have recourse to contemporaneous acts of the. Legislature on the subject. A number of acts were passed at the same-session similar in terms to the one before us, and each of said acts had in view some particular designated judicial district. All these acts, taken together, are in consonance with the idea that it was merely the intention of the Legislature in each of said acts to amend that portion of the act relative to some particular district (or section of said article <em>22). </em>Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>other construction would overthrow our entire judicial system. Now, if this matter were at all doubtful, that construction would be adopted which is consistent with the Constitution, and which at the same time upholds our judicial system, rather than that which would destroy said system. The construction we have adopted will harmonize with the Constitution, and uphold our judicial system, and, moreover, harmonizes with that provision of the Constitution which requires each district judge to hold his court at least twice in each county composing his district in each year. We hold that the act in question is simply an amendment of that portion of article 22 which relates to the Twenty-third Judicial District, and which we denominate section 23 of said article 22, and that said act is not in violation of section 36 of article 3 of the Constitution.

Hill, 72 Texas, 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Huet, Presiding Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
