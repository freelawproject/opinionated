The fact that it is alleged that they had \u201cassembled for religious worship in a lawful manner\u201d does not meet the requirement of the statute that they were conducting themselves in a lawful manner after being so assembled. Everything might be true as alleged in the indictment, and yet they might not have continued in such lawful manner. In order to obtain a conviction under this statute, the proof must show that the assembled congregation were at the time of the alleged offense then conducting themselves in a lawful manner. We have held that the omission of the expression \u201cwere conducting themselves in a lawful manner\u201d in the recognizance rendered that obligation fatally defective, and the appeal in such case would be dismissed. ' See Mullinix v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 116; Morgan v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 413. If, in reciting the offense in the recognizance, the omission of this expression would constitute an insufficient recitation of the offense, much more so would the indictment or information be defective, because in such case the offense itself is charged for which the defendant must be tried; and it is necessary in this State to set out in the indictment all the essential elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The judgment is reversed, and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">\n<em>Reversed and ordered dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">Hurt, Presiding Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
