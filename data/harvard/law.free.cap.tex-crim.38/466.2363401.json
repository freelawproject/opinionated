The game was made up between four young men some time in the morning of August 10, 1897. The names of the parties were Ike Godwin (the defendant), Sam Campbell (the deceased), Ned Merchant, and Eugene- Irons1. These parties retired to a place in the woods and played a game of freeze-out poker. The defendant put up his watch as his stake, the deceased a colt, Irons a pistol, and Merchant a horse. The stake of each was valued at $5. The pistol and watch were put on the blanket which was spread down for .the game, and the horse and colt were not present. Matches were used for chips, each match being worth 50 cents. Irons was first \u201cfroze out,\u201d and then Merchant; and the gam\u00e9 continued between defendant and deceased. Deceased, in the course of the game, won nearly all of-the matches. A quarrel ensued, as one of the witnesses says, with reference to the deal. Defendant appears to have claimed the game, and grabbed up the watch, and also the pistol. On demand of the deceased he at length put down the pistol, but still held to the watch. According to the State\u2019s evidence the game then proceeded, and, after they played a while, the defendant made an effort to get the pistol again. Sam Campbell (deceased) reached for it, and got it. Defendant then said to Campbell : \u201cCome with me. I want to tell you something.\u201d They both walked out some little distance from the blanket, where they were playing, deceased carrying the pistol in his hand, and stopped facing each other. According to defendant\u2019s evidence, just before the hoiqicide Sam Campbell had most of the matches, and he claimed the watch, and told defendant to give it to him. Defendant replied, \u201cTon have got your part.\u201d Defendant then said: \u201cCome out here. I want to tell you something.\u201d Campbell said, \u201cAll right, if you will give me a show.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cAll right, I will do that.\u201d The State\u2019s witness to the homicide (Irons) said that the parties stood there, and quarreled awhile, and defendant shot deceased three times. \u201cThe pistol held by Godwin was pointed towards Campbell when fired. The first shot hit him in the breast; the second in the body, lower down; and the third in the forehead. As soon as the first shot was fired, Campbell began to fall. The' second shot was fired, and struck him about the stomach, as he was falling. He fell on his back, and after he fell defendant then walked up to his side, and pointed his pistol, and shot Campbell in the forehead. All three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>shots were fired close together. His forehead was powder-burned.\u201d This witness states that during the game Campbell sportively reached and got the pistol which had been staked on the game, and fired it at a bottle in his rear; that three shots were fired by defendant at the time of the homicide; that he (witness) then ran home, some one-fourth of a mile, and about the time he reached home he heard a fourth shot. The defendant\u2019s witness Merchant states: \u201cThat he went to where the parties were confronting each other and quarreling, and caught hold of defendant, and said, \u2018This will not do.\u2019 Defendant said, \u2018Stand back,\u2019 or he would shoot me. That he then stepped back; and Campbell at this time had his pistol cocked in his hand, near his hip. That he raised it, and pointed it towards defendant, before defendant made any demonstration to use his pistol. That Campbell raised his pistol, and pointed it at the defendant, who knocked it to one side with his right hand, and shot Campbell with his left. That when defendant knocked Campbell\u2019s pistol aside it was discharged,'and this was the first shot fired; and Godwin then fired two shots in quick succession. Campbell fell upon his hack, and after he fell Godwin took a step towards Campbell, and shot him in the forehead. This was the last shot fired, which was about a minute after the other two shots. That Campbell was dead when defendant fired the third shot into his forehead.\u201d Other testimony on the part of the State tended to show that the pistol which the deceased had was fired only once, which is accounted for by the shot at the bottle during the game of cards. The testimony also tends to show that there were four distinct shots in the body of deceased; besides those already mentioned, another being through the fleshy part of the deceased\u2019s arm, between the elbow and shoulder. After the homicide, defendant fled, and was not apprehended until some three or four weeks subsequent. These are substantially the facts attending the homicide, and have been stated in order that the \u25a0 questions of law may be properly discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">On the trial the court admitted testimony offered by the State, showing that on the day and night preceding the homicide defendant had made a number of threats of a general character; that is, not directed towards any particular person. We quote from the bill of exceptions, which was reserved to the admission of this testimony, some of said threats, in order to show their general character: \u201cHayden Williams testified that he saw defendant in the town of Baird, in Callahan County, about 11 o\u2019clock the night before the killing. That defendant was drinking, but appeared to know what he was talking about. He took me to a rock pile out in front of Maxwell\u2019s saloon, where he had his clothes hid, and took off the rocks, and uncovered his clothes, which were in a seamless sack. He got on his horse, and asked me to hand him his sack of clothes. I did so, and he tied them on behind his saddle, and I went on hack to Brown Seay\u2019s saloon with him, and we stopped in front of Seay\u2019s saloon. He said he was going to leave the country, hut was going to kill some damn son of a bitch before he left. Said he was going to kill as good a friend as he had, and go to Devil\u2019s Biver and come hack to court. He had his six-shooter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>in his hand, and struck witness on the shoulder with it, and 'remarked for me not to be afraid; that he was not going to shoot anybody right here. I told him to put up his pistol; that he might hurt somebody. He replied that he knew how to handle a gun as well as any man, and was not going to hurt anybody right here.\u201d Ida Daniels testified that she saw defendant about 11 o\u2019clock on the night before the killing, and that she heard him say he was going to kill somebody. The State also proved by witness H. P. Scruggs that he saw defendant early in the night before the killing, and he said he wanted to kill some son of a bitch; that he felt like killing somebody; and wanted to know if Scruggs ever felt that way. In none of these conversations was the name of the deceased mentioned or alluded to. The defendant reserved his bill of exceptions to all of this testimony on the ground that said threats were not pertinent or relevant; that they were not shown to have in any manner referred to deceased, and related to independent and extraneous transactions and occurrences not connected with the homicide, and not in any way pertinent to the issues in the case. It is always competent, as showing motive on the part of the defendant, to prove threats made by him against deceased; and the cases hold that, although the name of the deceased may not have been mentioned by the defendant, yet, if it can be reasonably gathered that the deceased was meant or alluded to, that threats to take his life or do him serious bodily injury are admissible. See Sparks v. Com., 89 Ky., 644, 20 S. W. Rep., 167; State v. King (Mont.), 24 Pac. Rep., 265. Some of the cases hold that general threats not directed to the deceased, made by defendant, are admissible as showing evidence of general malice and purpose to injure or kill some one. See Brooks v. Com. (Ky.), 37 S. TV. Rep., 1043. Said case cites a number of authorities bearing out this proposition, but we have not had access to all the reports. The cases of Sparks and King, supra, do not support the proposition, but it was held in each of said cases, as stated, that the testimony showed that the threats of the defendant had reference to the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Whitaker v. Commonwealth (Ky.), 17 Southwestern Reporter, 358, would seem to support the contention. The court, however, say that: \u201cIf this testimony was incompetent, j^et its admission would not authorize a reversal, because the accused, through the sympathy of the jury, was only found guilty of manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Hopkins v. Commonwealth, 50 Pennsylvania State, 9, is another case referred to. In that case it does not appear that there was any quarrel or altercation, at the time of the homicide, between the defendant and deceased. The killing appears to have occurred on shipboard, where the defendant and a number of other persons were gathered. The defendant, without any cause assigned, threw a cup of cofiee at a negro, missing him, and striking a marine. A contest then ensued between a number of parties standing on the starboard side of the vessel; and in the contest which ensued defendant stabbed one Andrew McMarity in the neck, inflicting a wound from which he died. Testimony was admitted on behalf of the State that the prisoner, some fifteen minutes before the occurrence, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>dared that he would kill -somebody before twenty-four hours. The court, upon this point, uses this language: \u201cTo get at the state of the prisoner\u2019s mind, and to show that he harbored revengeful and murderous passions, it was competent'to prove his threats at or about the time of dealing the deadly blow. It was part of the res gestae. \u2018Upon an inquiry,\u2019 says Mr. Greenleaf (volume 1, section 108), \u2018as to the state of mind, sentiments, or disposition of a person at any particular period, his declarations and conversations are admissible. They are parts of the res gestae.\u2019 A drunken brawl between marines and sailors prevailed on shipboard. The prisoner\u2019s conduct had been so violent that he had been in irons several hours the day of the killing, and when released, his turbulent and quarrelsome conduct was resumed. Less than an hour before the mortal stab was given to McMarity, the prisoner declared that he would kill somebody before twenty-four hours. \u2018He hallooed it all around the deck,\u2019 says a witness. How, it was of material consequence that the Commonwealth, who sought to convict the prisoner of murder in the first degree, should give evidence of a premeditated purpose\u2014a formed design\u2014to kill or to do some great bodily harm, for without malice prepense there could be no conviction of the higher grade of murder. Hor was it necessary that the premeditated malice should have selected its victim. If the jury believed that the prisoner had formed the deliberate design to kill somebody, and in pursuance of that purpose, within an hour after declaring it, did kill McMarity, the commonwealth had a right to insist upon his conviction of murder in the first degree, and that they might thus insist they had a right to prove his declaration an hour before the deed. Blackstone ranks \u2018antecedent menaces\u2019 and \u2018former grudges\u2019 as evidence of malice prepense; and he tells us, moreover, that malice prepense is not so properly spite or malevolence to the deceased in particular as any evil design in general, the dictate of a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart. The witness said he heard no threats against McMarity, but this made his testimony none the less admissible, for killing anybody in pursuance of the malicious purpose which the general threat evidenced was murder. We conclude, therefore, that there was no error in admitting the evidence contained in the only bill that was sealed.\u201d How it would appear from this case that the court regarded this declaration as res gestae, and so admissible; or that it was admissible as showing evidence of general malice, and, though the deceased was not singled out, he was within the scope of appellant\u2019s malice. And it is believed that all of the authorities that support the proposition that general threats (not pointing to the deceased) are admissible are cases where the threats are evidence of general malignity, and the subsequent killing was embraced within the scope of such malignity. For instance, we have no doubt that, if a person declares that he intends to go upon the street, and kill some person, and straightway goes upon the street, armed with a weapon, and slays an individual, evidence of the previous declaration made would be admissible, both as a part of the res gestae and as showing a malignant disposition towards all persons, which would embrace the person slain. We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the rule to he that evidence of general threats made by the defendant on trial for murder, when such threats are not shown to. have been directed towards the person slain, or to embrace such person, are inadmissible. In State v. Crabtree (Mo. Sup.), 20 Southwestern Reporter, 7, it was held that general threats made by the defendant on trial for murder some time before the killing were inadmissible in evidence when defendant and deceased are shown to have been on friendly terms until the day of the homicide. And see Strange v. State (decided at present term), ante, p. 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Now, in the case at bar, it can not be pretended that the threats of the defendant, made on the night before, were directed towards the deceased. The evidence does not suggest this remotely. On the day of the homicide they appear to have entered into a friendly game of cards, and a sudden altercation ensued, in which defendant slew deceased. The motive therefor was occasioned on account of a difference in regard to the game of cards. Evidently appellant became incensed at deceased because he was winner in the game. We can not say what effect this illegal testimony may have had upon the jury. Undoubtedly, it was calculated to make them believe that defendant was a dangerous and bad man. It may be that appellant deserved all the punishment he received, and even more, under the facts and circumstances of this case; but the fact that the illegal testimony was admitted, and that this may have operated to the prejudice of the defendant, requires a reversal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellant complains that the court gave a charge on provoking the difficulty. This is pointed out in the motion for a new trial. According to the testimony of hoth the State\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s witnesses, the defendant was the aggressor, and brought on the difficulty; and it is no defense to him that deceased may have engaged voluntarily with him in a rencounter in which deadly weapons were to be used. The charge of the court was rather liberal than otherwise to the defendant in this regard. But for the error of the court in admitting illegal and improper testimony of threats against defendant, the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
