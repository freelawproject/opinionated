E. Bishop, were conducting a livery business at Celeste, Texas, the point where the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas and Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railways cross. That when they went into business they bought the stable of one-England, a brother of Arthur England, who agreed not to go into business again. That soon after they had bought the business, Arthur England established a livery business at said town, and continued the same until \u00a1November, 1894, at which time he sold out to Green &amp; Thomas, a firm composed of Riley Green and Bud Thomas, and said Arthur England continued to work for them at times. That deceased, Charley Green, was a brother of the said Riley Green, and conducted a livery stable at Kingston, about three miles from Celeste, on the Missouri, Kansas <em>&amp; </em>Texas Railway. That appellant was a brother of the said Boh Mitchell, and worked for M. K. Harrell &amp; Bro., general mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>chants, at Celeste, and had been so working for a number of years. That prior to the time Green &amp; Thomas bought the England stable the Greens and Mitchells had been friendly, and had known each other for some ten or twelve years. That after the purchase of said stable by Green &amp; Thomas trouble came up between the two stables about the livery business, and especially about the transfer business from one depot to the other, and from the depots to the hotels. That John Kennedy, the first witness who testified for the State, conducted -the .Santa Fe Hotel at Celeste, and J. C. Short conducted the Lindell Hotel at the same place. That the Green &amp; Thomas stable worked in the interest of the Santa Fe Hotel, and the Santa Fe Hotel in their interest, and the Mitchell &amp; Bishop stable took their business when they could to the Lindell Hotel, and the Lindell Hotel recommended them. That for some time prior to the date at which Charley Green was shot, the hands working for the two stables had been very aggressive, and sometimes quarrelsome, over the baggage at the railway trains. That appellant had never had any connection with, and had never been present at, any of these difficulties. That on the morning of the difficulty, Riley Green telegraphed deceased to come to Celeste from Kingston, and he came on horseback, riding in a lope most of the way. That Riley Green admitted on cross-examination that he had told deceased about the trouble, and that he was going to whip Bob Mitchell, and deceased said that was what he would do, and asked Riley to let him know so that he could be there and see it. That after sending said telegram, deceased came, and when he rode into the stable, an hour after the telegram was sent, his horse was muddy, and he said, \u201cGood morning; how is tricks?\u201d From this point there is some conflict in the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">Following is the testimony for the State:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">The State proved by Riley Green that after deceased had come to his stable, Claude Yeager, who was an employe of Mitchell &amp; Bishop, came to the stable of witness and told Henley, an employe of witness, to get his friends and come up on the street, and they would fight it out. Yeager then went to Harrell\u2019s store and got defendant, and to the stable and got Bishop, and that Henley, witness, deceased, and Arthur McHatt went up to what is called Short\u2019s corner, on the main street of the town. That after they had got there, there was talk of Yeager and Henley fighting, and that appellant said to witness, \u201cI heard you wanted to whip Bob.\u201d Witness answered he did, and appellant said, \u201cBob is sick; I will take his place.\u201d Witness replied he had nothing against appellant, and appellant replied that if he, witness, was itching for a fight, he could take Bob\u2019s place. Witness retorted that he had nothing against appellant, but if it was an accommodation to him, witness would fight. That then friends stepped in and stopped them. Witness and appellant both said they had nothing against each other, and were willing to drop it, and appellant laughed and said he was not mad, and then turned away, and witness did the same. That then Bishop came up and said he had a settlement to make with witness. That he understood that witness said he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>was the man that whipped his negro. Witness denied saying it, and Bishop called Boh Kelson to prove that he said that Bishop was in the gang that whipped the negro. Witness then admitted this. Then Bishop said that any man that said he had anything to do with that was a lying son of a-; and witness said to Bishop, \u201cDon\u2019t say that; you will say too much.\u201d Then Bishop repeated that any man that said he had anything to do with it was a lying son of a bitch. Then Bud Thomas struck Bishop and knocked him to his knees. Bishop put his hand in his pocket. Thomas struck him again, and knocked him down, and witness pressed on after Bishop, and when Bishop fixed a shot, witness grabbed the pistol. That after he got the pistol, Bishop fired another shot. This witness was corroborated, as to Yeager\u2019s coming and challenging Henley to fight, by the State\u2019s witness, B. D. Cross, and as to the talk between appellant and said Biley Green, and the fight between Bishop and Thomas, and by John Kennedy, witness for the State, as to the talk between appellant and Biley Green and the fight between Bishop and Thomas; and by Walter Lewis as to the same facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-7\">The State proved by the witness, John Kennedy, that after Bishop had been knocked down by Thomas, and while Thomas and Biley Green had Bishop down on the ground, and they were on top of him, that appellant shot twice at Bud Thomas and Biley Green. That appellant at this time was about sixteen feet from deceased, and deceased was nearest to the men on the ground, and had his back towards appellant. That after appellant shot the last time in the direction of the men on the ground, that he turned his hand a little, and shot three times in the direction of deceased and witness. That witness could see the bullets hit deceased, and knock the dust out of his coat. When the first shot struck deceased, he began to turn, when appellant shot him again, and deceased ran his hand in his bosom and drew a pistol, and then appellant ran. Deceased pursued him about ten feet before he got his pistol entirely out of his scabbard. That when he got it out, he commenced shooting at defendant, and shot at him three times, and then came back to the drugstore, and sat down, and was taken in the house. This witness was corroborated as to the shooting by defendant and deceased, by the State\u2019s witness B. D. Cross, and by the witness Walter Lewis, and by the witness Andy Henderson, and by witness W. B. Schmidt. This last witness added that at the time deceased was first shot, he was standing with his arms crossed and his left hand on his mustache, looking at the men on the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">The State proved by John P. Pierce, that he was informed there was going to be a row in town. That he went to Biley Green, and told him they were about to get into a row. That he heard that he, Biley, had called Bob Mitchell certain names, and that witness would like for him to take it back, and Biley said he would, and told witness to go and tell Bob Mitchell so. He went to hunt Bob and could not find him. He found appellant and talked to him; told him what Biley Green had said. Appellant seemed to get irritated; said he did not want to get into a row ivith them at all, but if he went into it, he was going in to kill, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>before witness left he promised not to bring up any trouble. That if any trouble came up, somebody else would have to bring it up. That appellant did not know whether Green had said what was reported or not, but witness told him that he had, but had taken it back. On cross-examination this witness said that what he had heard was that Riley Green had said that Bob Mitchell was a son of a bitch, and he was going to whip him. Witness denied having told anyone that Tom Horman of Hunt County had asked him to get appellant discharged from Harrell\u2019s store after the killing, and said that it was the Tom Horman of Collin County who had told witness that, but admitted that he himself had advised Harrell &amp; Bro. that it was best for defendant to quit their employ for a while.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">The State proved by Riley Green that Arthur England got deceased\u2019s pistol immediately after deceased was taken into the drugstore, and just after the shooting, and that there were two shots left in the pistol. That it was a black-handled, blue-barreled, 38-caliber pistol, and he exhibited the pistol to the jury with two shots and three empty cartridges in it. In this he was corroborated by Arthur England.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">Following is the testimony for appellant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">Riley Green\u2019s declarations and acts previous to the difficulty: Appellant proved by Bob Helson that about a month before the difficulty Riley Green met witness and said they had been having a little fun since he had been away. That he had been gone two or three days, and they had whipped his negro, and that he could whip the sons of bitches that did it, and he believed that Bishop and Mitchell were both in it. This witness was working for Mitchell &amp; Bishop at the livery stable. The same afternoon, witness heard that Riley Green accused him of being in it, and meeting Riley, asked if he did. Riley said he did not, but what he said about Bishop and Mitchell he meant, and the quicker they knew it, the better.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\">By J. M. Pruitt: That he was constable of the precinct in which Celeste was situated. The day before the difficulty he went first to Mitchell &amp; Bishop\u2019s Stable, and saw Bob Mitchell and Mr. Bishop, and told them they ought to stop the trouble. They told witness they did \u25a0not want any trouble; that they had done everything they could to keep from having any. Then witness went to the Green <em>&amp; </em>Thomas stable, saw Riley Green, and told him the same thing. He answered: \u201cThere is no grit over there at that stable.\u201d Witness then replied, \u201cYou will be the worst fooled ever you were in the world. You will find as good grit there as is in the county.\u201d Riley replied, \u201cThat is good advice, but it will take a fight to settle it, and the sooner it comes off the better it will be.\u201d Riley Green admitted that on the morning of the difficulty, about 8 o\u2019clock, he sent a telegram to deceased to come and see him whip Bob Mitchell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>By Eli Moore: That on the morning of and prior to the difficulty, Riley told him that he and Bob Mitchell had to have a fight that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-3\">Bud Thomas\u2019s acts and declarations prior to difficulty: Appellant proved by Melvin Davis that a day or two before the difficulty Thomas told witness he was expecting trouble between the two stables, and if they had it while he was gone, he was going to make them have it over.

Witness saw appellant at the livery stable that morning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and had a conversation with him, and heard him talking to Boh, his brother, in which he said, \u201cBob, I was going to Merit to-day, to the Masonic school there, but you are so sick, I will not leave you.\u201d It was just an hour to train time.

'That his brother Bob had been complaining that morning of having -cramp colic. That he went down to the stable to see him. Dr. Harris was with him, and he had gotten a little easier when appellant got there. Appellant told him that he had intended to go to Merit that day, but as he, Bob, was sick, he would not go. Th-e doctor told appellant to get ready; that he thought Bob would be easy by train time. On the way to the store to get ready, Charley Hismith told him (appellant) about Riley Green being mad about something .with Bob, and that he was going to whip Bob when he met him. Appellant told Charley he guessed it did not amount to anything. He went to the postoffice and got his mail, went up to the store, and fixed to go to Merit. He got the money he was going to take with him, and was ready to start out, when Claude Yeager came in, seeming to be in a great hurry. Appellant called to him and asked what was the matter, and he answered something, but appellant did not understand what it was, and Yeager went out. Appellant thought perhaps his brother was worse, and followed Yeager out, and saw the crowd at the Short corner, and went up to the crowd. In fixing to go to Merit appellant had put on his pistol, because he was going from Merit to Dallas, and wanted it with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-6\">After the parties were gathered at the Short corner, the testimony offered in behalf of appellant showed that appellant came up and asked what was the mattter. Somebody replied that Yeager and Henley were .going to fight. Yeager and Henley then stepped out a little distance from the sidewalk and fronted each other, when Yeager said, \u201cYou are an awful big man for me to fight.\u201d Then appellant stepped down off the walk and went up to them and said, \u201cHenley, you are too big to fight Claude. You boys must settle this without a fight.\u201d Other parties said substantially the same thing. Then Riley Green stepped off the sidewalk and said, \u201cEb, it is not your fight, and you have nothing to do with it.\u201d (The witnesses stated this variously, some of them saying that Green said, \u201cYou have no chips in this game.\u201d) Appellant replied, \u201cI know that, but John is too big to fight Claude,\u201d to which Riley said, \u201cWhat did three of you jump on John for this morning, when he was up there by himself?\u201d Then appellant explained to Riley what had occurred that morning. Then Riley braced himself up and looked at appellant, and said \u201cbe believed a fight would help them, any way.\u201d Appellant replied,\u201d I understand you wanted to whip Bob; he is sick this morning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>but if you are bound to have a settlement, I am here in his place.\u201d Eiley said, \u201cEb, I haven\u2019t a thing in the world against you.\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t a thing in the world against you.\u201d Then Eiley said, looking at appellant, \u201cBut if you want to take Bob\u2019s place in this, you can do so.\u201d Appellant told him he had not come there for a fuss, but that he (Eiley) could jump on appellant if he wanted to. About this time deceased stepped up and said, \u201cI will fight Yeager; I am about the size for him.\u201d Appellant replied that 'he was not hunting any fight. Other parties were still interfering and saying that there ought not to be any fight. Appellant then raised his hand, and said there was nothing the matter with him; he did not want any trouble. Then the difficulty seemed to quiet down, at which time Eiley Green stepped up to Mr. Bishop and said, \u201cBoys, it looks like we could get a scrap out of this crowd. I think a fight would do us all good.\u201d Bishop replied that there had been too much said already. Eiley wanted to know what had been said. Bishop said that he understood that Eiley had said that he and Bob Mitchell were the sons of bitches that whipped his negroes. Eiley denied saydng it, and Bishop replied that it was all right if he did not say it. Then Eiley asked Bishop who told' him. Bishop replied, \u201cBob Nielson, and there he stands.\u201d Eiley called on Bob Nielson. Bob Nielson said that Eiley had said he believed Bob Mitchell and Bishop were the sons of bitches that whipped his negroes. Eiley said that he did say that. Then Bishop said, \u201cAny man that said that he whipped the negroes or had anything to do with it was a liar and a \u2014;\u201d to which Eiley Green said, \u201cLook out, old man; don\u2019t go too far; I will break your neck.\u201d Bishop repeated that whoever said it was a liar and a son of a bitch, at which time Bud Thomas struck Bishop and knocked him around, and struck him again in the hack or side of the neck and knocked him down, and he and Eiley Green both jumped on him. About the time Bishop struck the ground, his (Bishop\u2019s) pistol fired; the crowd then scattered some. Bud Thomas continued to strike and beat Bishop, and,Eiley Green had hold of Bishop\u2019s hands, and some of the witnesses said was striking him. Just as the second shot from Bishop\u2019s pistol fired, appellant testifies that he did not know who fired it, but that he caught sight of Bishop for the first time, and saw his head fall back, and his face was. all bloody, and he thought that he was shot, and he pulled his pistol and shot at Bud Thomas twice, and then paused for a moment with his pistol in the same position, and saw deceased turning on him with his pistol in his hand, and thereupon appellant directed his next shot at deceased, and as deceased got nearly around deceased fired, and about the same time appellant fired his second shot at deceased, and tried to shoot the third time, but bis pistol missed fire. Then appellant ran towards the store. Appellant\u2019s witnesses say that just before appellant shot at Bud Thomas deceased shot twice at Bishop, the balls striking the ground close to Bishop\u2019s head, Bishop being at that time on the ground with Bud Thomas and Eiley Green both on him. That immediately after deceased\u2019s second shot appellant fired two shots at Bud Thomas, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>deceased turned upon appellant, and appellant seeing him turning with his pistol in his hand, fired two shots at deceased in quick succession. That about the time of appellant\u2019s last shot deceased fired his first shot at appellant. That after appellant fired his second shot at deceased he snapped his pistol'and then ran towards the store, deceased pursuing him and shooting three shots at him as he ran along the sidewalk. Then deceased turned and sat down in a chair in front of the drugstore, from which he was removed into the drugstore. These witnesses, as usual, differ as to the position of the parties at the time of the shooting, and vary some as to whether deceased or appellant first shot at the men on the ground, but all their testimony is substantially as stated above, except some of them did not see the beginning of the difficulty, and some did not see the ending of it. Appellant also proved by the witness Bascom Bates that after deceased had fired at the men on the ground, and after defendant shot twice ait the men on the ground, that witness heard another shot a little south of deceased, which was not fired by appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">Appellant proved by M.

Pruitt what he meant by saying in his cross-examination that Bob Mitchell and J. B. Bishop had as good grit as any men in the country, because where an expression is used that is not definite in meaning, it is admissible to explain the same. Any technical term or provincialism, or local expression used by a witness, is always susceptible of explanation. The witness, on cross-examination by the State, used the expression that the parties referred to had good grit. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked on re-direct examination what he meant by that, expecting him to answer that they were not cowards, and would fight if imposed on.

Any condition or circumstance, which is capable of creating sudden passion, sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection, may constitute adequate cause so as to reduce homicide to manslaughter, and when the evidence shows a number of conditions or circumstances occurring at the time of, or incident to, the killing, tending either singly or collectively to constitute what a jury might consider adequate cause, it is the duty of the court to submit that issue, and leave the jury to .determine from all the evidence whether or not adequate cause existed.

The doctrine that one who brings on a difficulty, with intent to kill, can not avail himself of self-defense, carries with it the corrolary that if the quarrel be begun without a felonious purpose, the homicidal act will not be murder.

Where there is a difficulty in progress between a number of people, and one who is not a party thereto interferes to save the life of a friend, being moved by that object alone, he is justified in such interference. Where a difficulty is in progress between several, and an outsider interferes to save the life of a friend, and thereby is brought into a conflict with some person not then engaged in the difficulty, and slays such latter person, then it is the duty of the court to explain to the jury the law affecting defendant as to his original interference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-6\">The court erred in refusing to give the jury special charge number 2, asked by appellant, which presented the theory of killing on the appearances of danger, because the evidence raised that issue.

The condition of said garments was testified about before the jury. See Hart v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 202; Jackson v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Appellant complains that the court committed an error in permitting the witness Eiley Green to testify that Claude Yeager came down to his stable, or near his stable, the morning of the difficulty, and challenged John Henley to come up the street, and have a fight, on the ground that this was hearsay. It appears that on the morning of the difficulty, and just prior thereto, a fight was made up between the witness Yeager and Henley, Yeager representing the Mitchell faction and Henley representing the Green faction. This was the beginning of the difficulty in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>which the deceased lost his lift. It was the occasion of deceased and defendant being present at the time the homicide occurred. It was a part and parcel of the res gestae, and, in our opinion, was admissible. The cases referred to by appellant have no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The objection made by appellant to the testimony of Pruitt that he knew Bill Mitchell, a brother of defendant, and that he might have heard of said Bill Mitchell having had some trouble, was not well'taken. The answer of this witness does not show that he knew of any trouble in which Bill Mitchell, the brother of the appellant, had ever been engaged, and we fail to see how the answer given could possibly injure appellant. Hor was there any error in refusing appellant the right to prove what the witness meant by stating that the Mitchells had \u201cgood grit.\u201d We apprehend that under the circumstances in which this word was used the jury had no difficulty in understanding its meaning, to wit, as used in the dictionaries, \u201cto indicate firmness of mind, courage, spunk.\u201d See Webst. Diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The witness Lacy did not show that he was an expert in the knowledge of gunshot wounds, and there was no error in rejecting his testimony as to the appearance of the wounds on the body of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Appellant complains that after the State had proved by John Pierce that he had not talked to Tom Horman, of Hunt County, about getting the defendant discharged from the employ of Harrell &amp; Bro., the court erred in not permitting him to prove by said Horman that Pierce did talk to him on said subject. What may have occurred between the witness Pierce and Tom Horman about this matter, it occurs to us, was purely hearsay, unless it was intended to prove that deceased procured Tom Horman to endeavor to secure the removal of defendant from the employ of Harrell. This the bill does not undertake to show. It shows that the witness denied having a conversation with Tom Horman, of Hunt County, in regard to having Harrell &amp; Bro. release defendant from their employment. All that was proposed to be proved in said conversation was that the witness said to Tom Horman, of Hunt County, \u201cthat Tom Horman of Collin had asked him to get defendant discharged from the employ of Harrell &amp; Bro.\u201d It seems from the bill itself that the witness admitted that Horman of Collin County had suggested the matter to him. The only contradiction involved was whether or not the witness Pierce had ever had a conversation in regard to said matter with Tom Horman of Hunt County. It occurs to us, as presented by this bill, that the matter was hearsa3r, and was purely collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">On the trial of said case, appellant\u2019s eighth bill of exceptions shows \u201cthat he introduced H. K. Harrell as a witness, and asked him if he had ever had any talk with John Pierce in which said Pierce said anything to him about discharging defendant from the employ of H. K. Harrell &amp; Bro., and, if so, what he said, expecting the witness to answer that after Charley Green was shot, and after defendant had surrendered, and gone to work for him again, that said John Pierce came to witness, and asked him to discharge defendant from his employ, and advised him to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u25a0on the ground that it would injure the business of said Harrell if defendant continued to work for him.\u201d This was excluded, and a bill of exceptions was reserved. How, it would have been perfectly competent, in order to show that the witness John Pierce was prejudiced against appellant, that he endeavored to have his employers discharge him, but the witness Pierce should have been first asked about this matter, to afford him an opportunity of denying or explaining the same. His explanation might have been such as to have obviated the necessity of any contradictory evidence. If he had denied the same, then, as showing prejudice on his part against appellant, it would have been competent to have contradicted him upon this collateral matter. The bill fails to show that J ohn Pierce was asked any questions in regar! to this matter, or that any predicate was laid for its introduction; and it fails to show that the purpose and object of this testimony was to show prejudice on the part of .Pierce. If he had been asked as to this prejudice, he might have admitted that he entertained such prejudice, and there would have been no necessity for any further investigation. If he had denied such prejudice, and this matter had been called to his attention, he might have admitted suggesting that appellant be discharged, but on such grounds as would have entirely relieved the case of any prejudice on his part. The bill as presented does not show any error on the part of the court in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">Appellant contends that the court erred in its charge to the jury in failing to charge on the law of manslaughter, because the evidence raised that issue. \u201cHe insists that conditions and circumstances which are capable of creating sudden passion, and render the mind incapable of cool reflection, might constitute adequate cause so as to reduce homicide to manslaughter, and he urges that the circumstances existed in this case. He furthermore urges that the jury may have believed that the appellant wrongfully interfered in the fight that was going on between Bishop, Thomas, and Eiley Green, but still may have believed that Charley Green drew his pistol on appellant before appellant fired, or made any demonstration to fire at him, and that the act of Charley Green in presenting his pistol at appellant was sufficient to arouse in the mind of appellant such terror as to render his mind incapable of cool reflection, thereby producing adequate cause for appellant to shoot said Charley Green, and still they may have held in doing so he was not justified, by reason of his \u25a0wrongfully engaging in the controversy between the other parties, under which state of case the case would have been manslaughter, and not murder in the second degree.\u201d If appellant wrongfully interfered in the fight between Eiley Green and Thomas on the one side and Bishop on the other, evidently he did so as an original conspirator with Bishop, Yeager, and others on the one side against the Greens and Henley and Thomas and others, on the other side. If the jury believe that he wrongfully entered into said combination, then his offense in killing deceased could not be reduced to manslaughter. If he entered into said difficulty as one of the original conspirators, and if in the progress of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>difficulty, and while he was firing at Thomas, he saw Charley Green in the act of firing at him, and he then fired at Charley Green, and killed him, it could not be less than murder in the second degree. In the light of the circumstances presented by the evidence, whenever it is conceded that defendant wrongfully engaged in the fight going on between Biley Green and Thomas on the one side and Bishop on the other, such concession apprehends that there was an understanding beforehand-\u2014that is, before Yeager and Henley engaged in their altercation (which was the occasion of the difficulty); that appellant entered into said fight willingly, and engaged in a contest with deadly weapons, in which he or his adversary might be killed. If appellant did not engage in said fight willingly, but merely happened there, without any understanding that he was to stand by his side in any antici\u00a1Dated difficulty, and if Biley Green and Thomas jumped on Bishop, and got him down, and Bishop was in danger of his life or of serious bodily injury to his person, or it so appeared to the defendant from his standpoint, then he did not engage in said altercation wrongfully; but, if he shot at Thomas under such circumstances, he had a right to shoot at him; and, if deceased turned upon him in the attitude of firing, or, from defendant\u2019s standpoint, apparently about to fire, defendant\u2019s right to fire upon deceased would be unimpaired. Such act on his part could not possibly be manslaughter, but would be in self-defense. The charge of the court on self-defense gave defendant the absolute right of self-defense under such conditions. We can not conceive that the court would have been justified in giving a charge on manslaughter based on appellant\u2019s wrongful interference in the fight between Bishop on the one side and Thomas and Green on the other. We think such a charge would have been erroneous. Counsel, in discussing the case, admit that if this question is looked to in the light of the testimony of the defendant, there is no manslaughter in the case, but insist that we are not circumscribed by his testimony alone, but there may be other facts in the case that would require the court to give a. charge on manslaughter. There may be such cases, but in this case, however, if we look only to the testimony of the defendant, -there is nothing in it that would authorize a charge on manslaughter. Looking to his evidence, the court would not have been justified in giving manslaughter, as it only raised the issue of self-defense, and, if the court had given a charge on manslaughter, he might have had just cause of complaint, because such a charge would not have been from his standpoint. If we look beyond his testimony to that of other witnesses for the defense who testified as to the difficulty between Bishop on the one side, who was appellant\u2019s friend, and Biley Green and Thomas on the other, still we fail to see how the court was required to give a charge on manslaughter. From their testimony appellant was either justified in engaging in the difficulty, and so not wrongfully entering, into it, or was justified during the progress of the difficulty in shooting Charley Green. If he entered into said difficulty not justifiably, but wrongfully, and shot Charley Green in the progress thereof, at the least he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>guilty of murder in the second degree, and not manslaughter. There is nothing in their testimony showing conditions that would produce adequate cause to engender passion sufficient to render appellant\u2019s mind incapable of cool reflection. Their testimony fails to make any adequate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Appellant contends that the court committed an error in charging on mutual combat, insisting there is no testimony in the case raising the issue. On this subject the charge of the court was as follows: \u201cThe doctrine of self-defense, hereinbefore set out, applies to a defensive, and not an offensive, act, and is limited to necessity, or apparent necessity, and can not exceed the bounds of mere defense and prevention; and where a person voluntarily engages in a combat, knowing that it may or will probably result in death, or some serious bodily injury that might produce the death, of his adversary or himself, he can non claim to have acted in self-defense. Therefore, if you find that a controversy existed between Bob Mitchell and some of his friends on the one side, and Biley Green and some of his friends on the other side, and that the controversy was about to culminate in a difficulty, and if you further find that the defendant voluntarily made himself a party to the controversy and the difficulty that ensued, knowing that the difficulty would, or might probably, result in death or some serious bodily injury that might produce death of some one or more persons engaged in the difficulty, and if you further find that the defendant shot and killed Charley Green in the progress of the difficulty, then the doctrine of self-defense, hereinabove set out, would not apply, and he would not be justifiable, and this would be the ease, no matter to what extremity he may have been reduced in the course of the difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">We will summarize sufficient of the testimony to indicate the shape of the case which, in our opinion, authorized this charge. A feud had existed for some time in the little town of Celeste, in Hunt County, between two rival livery stables, one owned and run by J. E. Bishop and Bob Mitchell, a brother of the defendant, and the other being owned by Riley Green and Thomas. This feud involved the employes of the two livery stables and others in the town, including the defendant, E. D. Mitchell, and Charley Green (a brother of Riley Green), who lived in Kingston, some three miles distant. The record shows that this rivalry was engendered by opposition in business, and had been progressing for sometime, and reached a crisis about the time the difficulty occurred. On that morning Riley Green had telegraphed to his brother* Charley Green, at Kingston, to come over; and the evidence indicates that after he arrived at Celeste the Green people determined to bring the fight on at the depot, where the rival hacks went to meet the train, about 9 or 10 o\u2019clock. The difficulty was to be brought on by Riley Green making an assault on Bob Mitchell, but it so happened on that particular morning that Bob Mitchell was sick, and did not come to the train. The evidence indicates that the owners of the other stable, after becoming aware of what was going on, prepared for the fray. Early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that morning Bob Mitchell and Yeager attacked John Henley, an em- . ploye of the Green stable, while he was up in town. They cursed and abused him. It seems in that connection defendant appeared on the scene, and told the boys to let Henley alone; that they had cursed him enough. Subsequently Henley met Yeager, and challenged him to settle it that morning by fighting it out, and the parties agreed to meet in front of Short\u2019s corner and have a fight. Henley went to the Green stable and got his crowd; and Yeager went by the store where the defendant was, spoke with him, then went on down to the Mitchell stable, got the balance of -the boys, and both parties met at Short\u2019s corner. There Mitchell and Henley confronted each other for a short time. Some suggestion was made by some of the Mitchell party that Yeager was too small to fight Henley, and an altercation ensued between the Mitchells and their friends on the one side and the Greens on the other. Some words passed between them, in which both defendant and deceased participated. During the altercation, while Henley and Yeager were confronting each other, defendant stated to Biley Green that he had heard that he was going to whip Bob, and that he told him that Bob was sick, but he would take his place. Some of the witnesses indicate that some words passed here between defendant and deceased. The testimony shows that the parties on both sides were armed, and ready for a fight, and were willing to fight. It appears that from some cause the difficulty did not come off between Yeager and Henley, Mitchell suggesting that Yeager was not big enough to fight Henley. At this juncture Bishop stated to Biley Green that he understood that he had said that he was the son of a bitch that had whipped his negroes, and run them off from his stable while he was gone. Biley Green at first denied this, and Bishop said he could prove it by Bob Helson, one of the Mitchell party; and Helson spoke up, and said that Biley Green had told him that. Green then admitted he had said it, and Bishop told him that anybody that said he had whipped his negroes and run them off was a damn lying son of a bitch. About 'the time he made this remark, Thomas struck him, and Bishop began to draw his pistol. Thomas struck him again, and knocked him down. About this time Bishop\u2019s pistol fired, and Biley Green jumped in and engaged in the fight, either to take the pistol from Bishop or to assist Thomas. According to some of the witnesses, the defendant then drew his pistol and fired at Thomas twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\">The State\u2019s witnesses show that Charley Green was standing off to one side, about ten feet away from the parties fighting, and malting no demonstration; that after defendant had fired twice at Thomas he then raised his pistol, and fired at Charley Green, whose back or side was to him, two or three times. About this time Charley Green pulled his pistol. Defendant ran, and deceased pursued him some little distance, firing three shots at him. Defendant and some of his witnesses stated that after he had fired two or three shots at Thomas, the deceased, Charley Green, turned on the defendant with his pistol in his hand, and that defendant then shot at him, and he kept on turning and got nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>around, and he fired the second time at him; that he tried to shoot the third time, but his pistol snapped, and he then ran down the sidewalk, and the deceased fired two or three shots at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">Some of the defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that while Thomas and Riley Green had J. E. Bishop down, beating him, and his pistol was firing, that the deceased fired two shots in the crowd, evidently for the purpose of killing Bishop; and about that time turned toward the defendant with his pistol, and fired at defendant about the same time that defendant fired at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The record abundantly shows that bad blood had existed between these two factions for a considerable length of time; that the parties on that particular morning were both looking for the difficulty. The deceased and his friends expected to bring it on at the depot, and defendant\u2019s friends unquestionably made an attack on John Henley on the same morning; and subsequently the fight was made up between the factions to come off in front of Short\u2019s corner. All of the parties on both sides, except Bob Mitchell, who was sick, appear to have been on hand, and armed for the occasion. True, appellant does not say that Yeager told him what was up, but it is a little singular that Yeager happened in the store where defendant stayed, and showed himself to the defendant, just prior to his going to the stable for the other boys on his side; and when he came back with the other boys, and proceeded to Short\u2019s corner, it seems that appellant was on hand. He explains that he had his pistol because he expected to go to a place known as Merit, to a public school entertainment; but he was not then on his way to Merit, but was at the particular place, and armed with his pistol. He stated several times that he understood the parties intended to whip Bob Mitchell that morning, and that he was there to stand in Bob\u2019s shoes; that Bob was sick; and his acts and conduct all indicate that he was there ready to engage in the fight if it should come off. Hnder such a state of case, it occurs to us that the difficulty which ensued was a mutual combat, and the court properly gave a charge on that phase of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In our opinion, the law of imperfect self-defense predicated on mutual combat did not arise in this case. If appellant engaged in the combat at all, it was with felonious intent; it was with a deadly weapon, and under circumstances which indicate that persons on one or both sides in the difficulty might be killed. The court\u2019s charge on self defense was predicated solely on the idea that appellant did not go to the scene of the difficulty and was not there for the purpose of engaging in a mutual combat, and that, if there was no mutual combat in the case, and deceased fired at the defendant first, or was making some hostile demonstration indicating a purpose to kill, and defendant then fired on deceased, and killed him, that he would be perfectly justifiable in his action. This was the converse of the proposition presenting self-defense, if there was no mutual combat in the case.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b208-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>[Hote.\u2014The motion of appellant for a rehearing was overruled December <em>22, </em>1897, without a written opinion.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Hor,- in onr opinion, was there any error in the failure of the court to instruct the jury that, if deceased attempted to take the life of Bishop, defendant would have the right to slay him. True, some of the defendant\u2019s witnesses state that the deceased had fired or was in the act of firing at Bishop when defendant shot him. But, viewing the case from the defendant\u2019s standpoint, whether this, be true or false could not have affected him. He did not see this. There is no pretense from his standpoint that he fired on deceased to keep him from killing Bishop. He fired at deceased solely, according to his testimony, to prevent deceased from killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Appellant complains because the court in its charge limited his right of self-defense to an assault on him with intent to kill him, made by deceased, or to some act done by deceased, showing evidently that he intended to kill defendant. The vice suggested by this charge is that, if deceased was doing some act which indicated that his purpose was to inflict serious bodily injury on defendant, his right of self-defense against such an act would be equally perfect. If there was any testimony in the case showing that deceased, if he made an assault on the defendant, had a less purpose than an intent to take his life, the contention would have great force; but there is no such testimony in this case. If deceased was in the act of making an assault on the defendant at all, it was for the purpose of taking his life. He was then about to shoot him with a pistol, and we fail to understand how the charge in question could have injured the rights of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Appellant further complains that the court limited his right of self-defense to actual necessity. Strictly speaking, the evidence shows, if anything, an actual, and not an apparent, danger; but the court instructed the jury to regard the circumstances from the defendant\u2019s standpoint, and, furthermore, that the doctrine of self-defense is limited to necessity or apparent necessity. This, we think, was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In our opinion, there was nothing in appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Even if it be conceded that some one else fired a shot at deceased, it would not alter the result. The affidavit of newly-discovered evidence is too indefinite, and does not attempt to show who may have fired such other shot. There being no errors in the record, the judgment 'is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
