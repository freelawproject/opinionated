There is no exception to this rule except in case of an escape and the rearrest of the convict before the bond falls due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-14\">The fact that the hirer does not reside in the county of conviction does not vitiate or avoid his bond, and the judge before whom this cause was heard erred in holding that the bond in this case was void because the hirer did not reside in Lee County and for that reason refusing to discharge the applicant.

Eelator did not work for his principal, nor did the principal pay any portion of his obligation; whereupon a capias pro fine was issued, and relator placed in jail. He applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The writ was issued, the cause tried before Hon. Ed E. Sinks, District Judge, who, after hearing the case, remanded him to the custody of the officer. Eelator excepted, and prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The ruling of the court no doubt was based upon the following language, contained in article 3744, Eevised Statutes 1895: \u201cAny person who may be convicted of a misdemeanor or petty offense, and who shall be committed to jail in default of the payment of the fine and costs adjudged against him, may be worked upon the public roads or upon the county farms of the county in which such conviction is had, or be hired out to any individual, company, or corporation within the county of conviction, to remain in said county,\u201d etc. That portion of this article which forms the basis of the decision of the trial judge is found in this portion,, \u201cor be hired out to any individual, company, or corporation within the' county of conviction, to remain in said county.\u201d This seems to contemplate that the hiring out can only be done by some individual, company, or corporation within the county of conviction, and binds the convict to remain in said county. This portion of the statute formerly' read, \u201cor be hired out to any individual, company, or corporation;\u201d the words, \u201cwithin the county of conviction, to remain in said county,\u201d being added by amendment. Without going into the reasons why the Legislature made these changes in the statute, they evidently intended that the hiring should be to a resident of the county, and that under said hiring the convict must remain in the county; and we therefore believe the construction of the trial court is correct, and that the bond was invalid. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
