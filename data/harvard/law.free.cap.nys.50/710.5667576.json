Section 1384 of the consolidation act of the city of New York; Bloomer v. Merrill, 1 Daly, 485; Orvis v. Curtiss, 28 N. Y. Supp. 728. In the case last cited, which was decided by the general term of the court of common pleas, it was held that, where this omission appears upon the face of the return, the judgment should be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>versed. Such must therefore he our disposition of this appeal. The conclusion to which we have come precludes us from reviewing the judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
