That discretion is, however,, reviewable here. In this case we see no reason why the application should have been refused. It is conceded that the plaintiff has settled the case, and has given the defendant a release. Why should not the defendant be permitted to plead the release? None is suggested, save that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney has made an agreement with his client whereby he is to receive, as compensation for his services, a sum equal to 35 per cent, of the recovery. But this is no reason why, as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the release-should not be pleaded. The attorney\u2019s rights, under his agreement with his client, are not affected by the release, nor will they be prejudiced by the plea thereof. If he desires to prosecute the action in the plaintiff\u2019s name for his own benefit, he may still do so. In that case, however, he should take the risk of liability for the defendant\u2019s costs in case he fails upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-17\">There is no laches here. The delay in moving was slight, and could have prejudiced neither the plaintiff nor his attorney. Certainly, it is not shown that injustice would be wrought by allowing-the supplemental answer. The attorney can be amply protected by permitting him to continue the action, if he so elects, for the purpose of satisfying his lien, but at the same time requiring Mm to assume the payment of any judgment for costs which the defendant may recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The order appealed. from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and the disbursements of this appeal, and the motion granted, with leave, however, to the attorney to continue the action for the purpose indicated, upon his assuming the payment of any judgment for costs which may be recovered by the defendant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
