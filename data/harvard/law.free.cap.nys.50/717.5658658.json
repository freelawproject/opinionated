The actual' return of goods, and the acceptance of the same by the respondents, from time to time, tended to sustain the claim made by the appellants that there was such an agreement, and was a corroborative circumstance which the jury were entitled to take into consideration. The respondents seek to uphold the judgment on the ground that the appellants did not request to go to the jury upon any question of fact; but as the latter did not move for a dismissal of the complaint, or do any other act from which a waiver of their right to go to the jury could be implied, their exception to the direction in respondents\u2019 favor is sufficient upon this appeal to raise the point whether there were any questions of fact requiring determination by the jury. Vail v. Reynolds, 118 N. Y. 297, 301, 23 N. E. 301, and citations; As there must be a new trial, we consider it proper to say that greater care should be shown in putting in the proofs. Among other things, it is impossible to determine from the record what discounts the defendants were entitled to, and on what basis they were estimated.'</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial or- * dered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
