Upon the commission and other papers, a justice of the supreme court issued a subpoena requiring Griscom to appear and testify. Subsequently, upon the latter\u2019s motion, an order was entered vacating and setting aside the subpoena; and from the latter order an appeal was taken in the name of the German government, the Danzig see-amt, and the commissioner.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b910-9\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

There is no such party here. The German government is not a party to the proceeding,, either here or abroad. Indeed, there is no such party, in a legal sense, as the German government. That is but the popular appellation given to a defined national entity or body politic. Nor is the see-amt a party. It is the investigating body. And such a body cannot be a party before itself. If it cannot be a party before itself, it cannot well be a party here. Lastly, the commissioner is not in any sense a party. It is quite clear, therefore, that there is no party aggrieved by the order appealed from, within the meaning of the Code, and consequently the appeal must be dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
