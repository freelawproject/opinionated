The return fails to show whether the by-laws of the society were admitted in evidence, but the following appears towards the end of the stenographer\u2019s minutes: \u201cArticles 67 and 71 and arti c\u00edes 80 and 82 to be looked at.\u201d We assume from this that the said provisions were considered by both parties as having been admitted in evidence, and therefore a copy of the same should be annexed to the return, in order that we may determine whether such finding of the justice is supported by the evidence. For these reasons, a reargument must be ordered, the return to be amended meanwhile.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
