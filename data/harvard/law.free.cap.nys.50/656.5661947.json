The defendant seeks a reversal of the judgment solely upon the facts, there being no error of law charged. The main questions of fact presented for solution in the court below arose out of \u25a0two counterclaims interposed by the defendant,\u2014one for $400 damages, claimed to have been sustained in consequence of plaintiffs\u2019 .alleged failure to properly construct and adequately cover or protect the openings made by them in the course of their work, and the -other for $14.50, the alleged reasonable value of certain spruce planking and a stepladder claimed to have been borrowed and taken by the plaintiffs from the defendant for the purpose of said work, and not returned, although duly demanded. The testimony relative to these \u25a0subjects was conflicting, and a finding either way would have been warranted. The justice allowed the defendant $14.50, and gave judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the difference. He had the witnesses before him, observed their manner of testifying,- and therefore was undoubtedly better able to judge of their credibility, and of the weight to be given to their testimony, than is this appellate .court; -and hence we see no reason for disturbing his conclusion, in the absence of the elements which are .requisite to a review of the facts. Lynes v. Hickey, 4 Misc. Rep. 522, 24 N. Y. Supp. 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">There was also litigated upon the trial, but not argued upon this \u25a0appeal, the question whether the plaintiffs performed the contract within the specified time. The testimony adduced on the part of the -defendant tended to show completion subsequent thereto, while, according to that presented on behalf of the plaintiffs, the work was practically finished by the day designated. No claim, however, seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to have been made upon the trial for damages by reason of such delay, if any, in completion. Moreover, the evidence shows that the plaintiffs, with the assent of the defendant, proceeded, after the day designated, .to complete the contract; and, time not appearing to be of the essence of this contract, such claim alone, even if urged, cannot defeat a recovery of the contract price. Close v. Clark, 16 Daly, 91, 9 N. Y. Supp. .538.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">For these reasons, to my mind, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
