After a careful examination of the proofs, we are unable to find that such was the case here. The determination of the facts required the trial justice to pass upon the veracity of the witnesses. He had them before him, and observed their demeanor on the witness stand, and the manner in which they gave their testimony. These are matters which may be legitimately considered where such a question is to be determined; but, from the nature of the case, they are not susceptible. of reproduction in the minutes of the trial. The appellate court is therefore seldom in a position to satisfactorily review a decision upon the facts where the determination of the case rests upon a question of credibility. We therefore feel constrained to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
