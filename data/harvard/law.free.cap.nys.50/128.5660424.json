The plaintiffs based their right to recover upon a contract alleged to have been made by them with the defendant\u2019s testator, in and by which he promised to pay to them a commission of 1 per cent, of the purchase price for procuring a purchaser of his residence situate in the city of New York, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and services rendered by them in pursuance thereof in procuring a purchaser who was ready, able, and willing to purchase at a price which was satisfactory to the testator, and who entered into a contract with him. The answer interposed denied all the material allegations of the complaint. Upon the issue thus formed the parties, went to trial, and it there appeared that in June, 1894, Henry Knickerbacker, defendant\u2019s testator, employed these plaintiffs to negotiate a sale of certain real estate situate on Fifth avenue and Sixty-Fourth street in the city of New York, and that thereafter these plaintiffs, in pursuance of that employment, endeavored to procure a purchaser, but nothing was accomplished until the 27th of July of that year, when, as a result of negotiations had with, one John T. Martin, one of the plaintiffs (Montgomery) was authorized to make an offer for the property, as appears from the following memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201cI authorize Mr. Montgomery to offer two hundred twenty thousand ($220,000) dollars for Mr. Knickerbocker's house, Cor. 04th St. and 5th Ave. \u201cJuly 27th, 1894. John T. Martin.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The next day Montgomery communicated with defendant\u2019s testator with reference to this offer by telegraphing him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cAm authorized in writing by Mr. Martin, Sr., to offer two hundred twenty thousand dollars for house and fixtures; payment in cash, or one-year mortgage for one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) dollars, balance cash, buyer\u2019s option. Offer good only for to-day. If you want to sefi to them, advise early acceptance. It was difficult to obtain this offer because of lack of harmony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">This telegram was confirmed by a letter written on the same day by Montgomery, in which he informed defendant\u2019s testator that a contract had been prepared and taken to Martin, but that he had declined to execute the same, but that by the following Monday plaintiffs hoped \u201cwe shall be able to have the contract signed.\u201d In this respect they were disappointed, because Martin thereafter not only refused to sign a contract, but also refused to have anything further to do with the contemplated purchase. As soon as plaintiffs ascertained this, they delivered the memorandum, signed by Martin, to the defendant\u2019s testator, and requested him to pay the commissions alleged to have been earned by them in effecting a sale. Defendant\u2019s testator refused to pay, and thereupon this action was brought to compel him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The trial court, at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, dismissed the complaint, and in so doing we think no error was committed. The plaintiffs\u2019 right to commissions depended on their bringing the buyer and seller to an actual agreement,\u2014not a prospective or contemplative one. They were required to produce a purchaser who was ready and willing to enter into a contract on terms satisfactory to their employer, and until they had done that they were not entitled to commissions. Sibbald v. Iron Co., 83 N. Y. 378; Condi ct v. Cowdrey, 139 N. Y. 273, 34 N. E. 781. This they did not do. The defendant\u2019s testator wTas, so far as the evidence- discloses, willing to sell on the terms proposed, but Martin was not willing to purchase. It was not the fault of defendant\u2019s testator that the sale was not made. Indeed, it is not even suggested that any act or omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>on Ms part in any way prejudiced or affected the successful consummation of the negotiations entered into by the plaintiffs with Martin. The plaintiffs, therefore, were not entitled to commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">But it is urged by appellants\u2019 counsel that the memorandum signed by Martin was a contract which defendant could enforce. We do not think so. It was not so intended or understood by any of the parties. An action could not be successfully maintained upon it to compel Martin to purchase. .At most, it was intended as a provisional proposition, made in the course of the negotiations, and, if accepted, left open other essential details for further discussion and settlement. It is vague and uncertain in many respects. It is impossible to determine from it on what comer of the street the property is situate, or in what city or state the street is. Indeed, it is impossible to determine what part of the testator\u2019s property the authorization was intended to cover; and this is important, in view of the fact that the property he owned covered 100 feet on the avenue by 150 to 175 feet on the street, while one of the plaintiffs testified that the lot proposed to be sold was 100 feet by 30 feet. In many other respects the memorandum failed to contain provisions necessary and essential to make it a legal contract which the defendant or her testator could enforce against Martin. This the plaintiffs understood and appreciated. This is apparent from an inspection of the proposed contract which they thereafter prepared and endeavored to have Martin execute. In this proposed contract the time of payment and the character of the mortgage are not specified. Blank spaces were left for that purpose, to be filled in, presumably, when the parties had agreed upon these subjects. But, if it be conceded that the contention of appellants\u2019 counsel as to this memorandum is correct, then the plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover, because there is no proof of the acceptance of it by defendant\u2019s testator. The only proposition submitted to him, so far as appears, was the one contained in the telegram from Montgomery, above referred to, and that proposition was not the same as the one contained in the Martin memorandum. And, indeed, there is no proof that defendant\u2019s testator ever accepted the proposition contained in the telegram. The only proof offered on that subject is a letter written by Knickerbacker on the 29th of July, and it will be observed that in tMs letter he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cX will go down by early train to-morrow morning. * * * Will go direct to my office, and \u2019phone you to come there, and then we will conclude what to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">This did not constitute an acceptance of the proposition. On the contrary, it clearly and conclusively demonstrates that the proposition was not accepted, but was held open until further conference could be had. The negotiations failed, not by reason of any fault on the part of the seller, but simply because plaintiffs did not procure a buyer who was ready and willing to purchase upon the seller\u2019s terms. _</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The case was correctly disposed of by the trial court, and the exceptions should be overruled, and the motion for a new trial denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
