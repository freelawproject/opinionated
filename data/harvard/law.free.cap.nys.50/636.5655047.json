Millar v. Larmer, 85 Hun, 313, 32 N. Y. Supp. 1146. Where a decision is made under section 1022 of' the Code of Civil Procedure, an exception to the decision is necessary to present any question brought up for review. No exception having been taken to the decision, then there is nothing for the appellate court to review, and the judgment entered upon it must be affirmed.. Smith v. Moulson, 88 Hun, 147, 34 N. Y. Supp. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">It follows that the judgment must be affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
