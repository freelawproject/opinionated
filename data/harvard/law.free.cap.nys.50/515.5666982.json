Carhart, 39 Hun, 363. The right of the plaintiff to recover the amount claimed by him was conceded by the defendant. The defendant interposed a counterclaim, for which he asked an affirmative, judgment. The verdict of the jury awarded him a substantial recovery upon Ms counterclaim, the amount of which was deducted from the amount conceded to be due to the plaintiff. The only issue involved in the action being the demand of the defendant to recover upon his cause of action against the plaintiff, and he having succeeded in recovering a sum of money upon Ms counterclaim, it cannot be said that the plaintiff was the successful party. As a matter of fact, upon the only disputed question in the case the defendant succeeded, and consequently the plaintiff was not entitled to an allowance upon the balance of his conceded claim for wMeh he had judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
