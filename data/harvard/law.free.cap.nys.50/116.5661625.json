The action is brought to enforce a penalty incurred by .the defendants, as directors of a cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>poration known as the \u201cNew York Piano Case Company,\u201d by reason of the failure of the directors of the corporation to file an annual report in the year 1897. The defendants attack the complaint as being insufficient, as it is not alleged that the corporation of which the defendants are directors is a stock corporation. The statute which imposes this penalty, in force at the time this default took place, was chapter 564 of the Laws of 1890, known as the \u201cStock Corporation Law,\u201d as amended by chapter 2 of the Laws of 1892. By section 30 of that act it is provided that every stock corporation, except moneyed' and railroad corporations, shall annually, during the month of January, make a report as of the 1st day of January. By the express provisions of this statute, it is only a stock corporation that is required to make such a report, and the complaint nowhere alleged that the defendant was a stock corporation. As this is an action to recover upon a penalty, by a familiar rule the complaint must allege that the words of the statute distinctly enact that under the circumstances the penalty has been incurred. Provisions of this character must be strictly construed, and cannot be extended by implication. Van Dyck v. McQuade, 86 N. Y. 56. \u201cA party seeking to make trustees of a corporation liable under this statute, for failure to comply with it must allege and prove affirmatively every fact and circumstance upon which his right to recover depends, and nothing will be presumed in his favor.\u201d Whitney v. Cammann, 137 N. Y. 344, 33 N. E. 305. Thus, to entitle the plaintiff to recover, he was bound to allege, not only that the corporation of which the defendants were directors incorporated under the laws of this state, but must also show that it was a stock corporation; and this is not alleged in the complaint. It would seem, therefore, that upon the complaint, admitting all of the facts alleged, the plaintiff was not entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">It is not necessary for us to determine whether the answer is so clearly frivolous as to justify the court in granting an order for judgment upon the answer as frivolous. For the reasons- before stated, we do not think, upon the facts alleged in the complaint, that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The order granting the plaintiff judgment, and the judgment entered thereon, must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
