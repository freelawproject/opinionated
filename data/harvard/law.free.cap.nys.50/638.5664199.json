In the lease the clause as to the tenant\u2019s paying the water rents is stricken out. When the lease was assigned, nothing, so far as the record shows, was said as to who was to pay the water rents; and neither the assignment itself, nor the written consent of the plaintiff to such assignment of the lease, makes any reference whatever to water rents. Nothing appears in the record to show any understanding between the plaintiff and Steuernagel as to water rents, except so far as the erasure of that clause in the lease is concerned. All we have to go by is the lease, the assignment, and the agreed state of facts, above set forth; for the little testimony that was taken is practically incorporated in that statement of facts. So far as the record shows, it appears that defendant had a right to assume, when he took the assignment of the lease, that no obligation was imposed upon him to pay such rents. The law imposes the obligation to pay the tax upon the landlord, and, unless she and the tenant especially contracted that the latter should pay such tax, no obligation rested upon him to do so. See McAdam, Landl. &amp; Ten. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 89. The question suggests itself: Why did not the landlord make arrangement for the payment of the water rents at the time she consented, in writing, to the assignment, if she wished to have the tenant assume that obligation? But, as we have seen, she remained, so far as the record shows, perfectly silent upon this point, although she must have known that no obligation to pay such tax was imposed upon the tenant by the lease. As we have said, there is nothing in the record to indicate that defendant had the slightest reason to suppose, when he took the assignment, that he would be called upon to pay the water rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Having reached the conclusion that, for the reasons above stated, the judgment should be reversed, it becomes unnecessary to discuss the other points raised by the appellant upon this appeal. We may add that, while it clearly appears that the judgment appealed from has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u2022been paid in full by the defendant, we cannot recognize the application for an order for restitution, made by the counsel upon the argument, as a compliance with the provisions of section 3058 .of the Code \u25a0of Civil Procedure, and direct the return of the money paid upon the \u25a0erroneous judgment. \u201cSix days\u2019 notice of an application for an order for restitution must he given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
