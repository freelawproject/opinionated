The most casual consideration of the record before us cannot fail to convince one that the order was right, and should be affirmed. This record shows that the Gramercy Club was not organized, or the business thereafter conducted by it, in good faith, so as to bring it within the provisions of the statute relating to clubs. It was organized for the purpose of violating the law. The charter was purchased by one Edward B. Corey, and then he and two or three of his employ\u00e9s met in the barroom, and they said, \u201cWe are the Gramercy Club.\u201d This was the origin of the club, this constituted the organization, and this was the only meeting held. Thereafter Corey had some tickets prepared, which were given to the women who frequented the place,, with instructions to write in the names of such persons as they saw fit. Any person could become a member by the payment of from 10 to <em>25 </em>cents. Corey was the owner of the place. He received all the money that was taken in. He was the Gramercy Club. No by-laws were ever adopted, and no meeting was ever held after the organization. The place was frequented by a large number of women for immoral purposes, to whom liquor was served on Sundays and during prohibited hours. Its alleged members had no interest whatever in the property. They had no voice in the management of the club. Any person could obtain liquor after 1 o\u2019clock a. m. or on Sundays by joining the club, and nothing was done in the place except to drink, smoke, and solicit for prostitution. It was not a club. It was nothing more or less than a fraudulent scheme or device concocted by Corey to evade the law. Under such a state of facts, which are uncontradicted, it cannot be seriously contended that\" such a place is a club, within the intent and meaning of the statute above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The order was right, and should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
