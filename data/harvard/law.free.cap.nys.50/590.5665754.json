The contract obligated the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs, at the end of each week, the amount due for the flowers consigned by them during the week previous. The defendant did not comply with this provision in the case of any week\u2019s sal\u00e9 during the period of five weeks for which the contract was performed, but always was several days behindhand in its payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">In Wharton v. Winch, 140 N. Y. 287, 35 N. E. 589, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly true that the defendant\u2019s failure to pay the installment was such a breach of the contract as absolved the plaintiff from all obligation to further perform on his part while the default continued. Nor was he bound to grant the defendant any indulgence, and wait for any period of time in order to enable him to make good his broken promise. In that sense, punctual payment was a condition precedent. The obligation of the plaintiff to proceed under the contract depended upon it. If it was not fulfilled, one of two courses was open to the plaintiff. He might at once rescind the contract, and refuse to go on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">See, also, Moore v. Taylor, 42 Hun, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">We do not mean to say that every default or delay in payment, resulting from inadvertence, inability to make up accounts, or some cause of that character, would relieve the plaintiffs from the obligation of their contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">\u201cThe right of a party to enforce a contract will not be forfeited or lost by reason of technical, inadvertent, or unimportant omissions or defects. :s * * There must be no willful or intentional departure, and the defects of performance must not pervade the whole, or be so essential as substantially to defeat the object which the parties intended to accomplish. Whether, in any case, such defects or omissions are substantial or merely unimportant mistakes, that have been or may be corrected, is generally a question of fact.\u201d Miller v. Benjamin (N. Y. App.) 37 N. E. 631.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">On the occasion when the. plaintiffs terminated the contract, they demanded the payment then due them. This was refused. It was incumbent on the defendant to show an excuse for such refusal, and the sufficiency of the excuse was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">I am also of opinion that the evidence as to the grade and price allowed for the plaintiffs\u2019 flowers was sufficient, in the absence of explanation, to warrant the inference that the plaintiffs had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>fairly treated, or the contract carried out\u2019by the defendant. I can see that an explanation might be made by the defendant so clear as to justify the court in disposing of this issue, but, in the absence of explanation, the question was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
