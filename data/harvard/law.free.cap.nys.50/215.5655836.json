A motion for a new trial which was made upon the judge\u2019s minutes was denied, and, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the entry of judgment upon the verdict, this appeal was taken from the judgment and order denying a new trial. The plaintiff was employed in the yards of the defendant at Long Island City, and was at work under a car when an engine ran against it, and drove the car back, so that a bar which he was using was pressed down upon the rail, catching his wrist between the rail and the bar, and cutting off his hand. The car under which he was at work was on one of the repair tracks, and the plaintiff, with another man, was engaged in putting new wheels upon it. He bases his cause of action upon a claim that the defendant failed to make and enforce proper rules for his protection while so engaged\u2019. A rule had been made bv the defendant to apply to such cases; but the plaintiff insisted that the rule was not sufficient for the purpose, and- was so systematically violated by the employ\u00e9s, with the knowledge of the\u2019 defendant\u2019s officers, that it had practically been allowed to become a dead letter, and for that re\u00e1son the defendant had failed to perform its duty towards its employ\u00e9s. The defend-, ant, on the contrary, insisted that the rule was a sufficient rule; that it was generally enforced; and that the accident to the plaintiff happened solely because he and his co-employ\u00e9 at work on this particular car at this time did not see fit to obey it. The question whether, the rule was a proper one, and was properly enforced by the defendant, was submitted to the jury in a manner which was not excepted to; and we do not propose to consider the question whether or not the case was properly disposed of in that regard. The gang in which the plaintiff was at work at the time the accident occurred consisted of another man, who had been in the employ of the defendant for several years, and the plaintiff himself. The plaintiff had been thus employed only for a few days. The rule provided that a blue flag, by day, placed at the end of a car, denoted that car inspectors are at work under or about that car or train. The car or train thus protected was not to be coupled to or moved until the blue signal was removed. There were in the yard four repair tracks, one of which, upon which this car was standing, being known as the \u201cwheel spur track.\u201d It was conceded that no blue signal was put at the end of this car before the men proceeded to work upon it. There was evidence from which the jury might have found that it was the duty of Clavin, who was working with the plaintiff, to see to it that the car was properly protected by the flag, and that he was perfectly familiar with the rule, but that he did not put up the Hag because he did not think that it was necessary to do so. These facts were not conceded, but there was sufficient evidence of their existence to require that they should be submitted to the jury; and, if the jury found that they existed, it would necessarily follow that this accident was caused by the failure of Clavin to obey this rule, of the existence of which he was well aware, and the object of which he knew. His failure to obey it would clearly have been negligence, and for his negli-\u2019 gence, as that of a co-employ\u00e9, the defendant would not have been liable, and such negligence would have been a perfect defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The court, in its charge, said to the jury that if they found that the plaintiff\u2019s accident and the injury which he received were due solely and wholly through the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant, and. that the plaintiff himself was free from negligence, the plaintiff would be en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>titled to recover. To this direction the defendant took an exception. dSTo rule of law is now better settled in these cases than that, when one servant suffers injury solely through the negligence of a fellow servant, the master is not liable. Davis v. Railroad Co., 1 App. Div. 178, 37 N. Y. Supp. 157. The direction, therefore, given by the court, which was excepted to, was serious error, and the exception was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">At the close of the charge, however, the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge that, if the accident was caused in any way by the neglect of the fellow workman of the plaintiff, then the defendant cannot b\u00e9 held responsible, and the plaintiff cannot recover. The court, at first refused to make that charge, but afterwards, at the suggestion of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, said to the jury that by consent of counsel the court charged as requested; but he did not modify or change the direction given in his original charge, that if the jury found that the accident was caused wholly by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants, and the plaintiff was free from negligence, he was entitled to a verdict. As the case stood, then, when it went to the jury there were two contradictory statements of the law in this regard; the first one clearly erroneous, and the second one not stated by the court to the jury in terms, but read or stated to the court by the counsel, and only charged by way of a statement that, by consent of counsel, the court assented to what was said. The proposition was one which lay at the very foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. The first direction given to the jury with regard to it was clearly erroneous. Undoubtedly, if the answer to the request to charge to the contrary had been given by way of a statement of the law containing a retraction of the former-statement, contained in the charge, the jury would have been properly .instructed upon that subject; but, as it stood, the only instruction which they actually received in terms from the court was an erroneous one, which was seriopsly detrimental to the defendant, and at the end of the trial it is very doubtful whether the jury had any instruction upon that subject, because the court had given them directions in one way, had acceded to the request of counsel that the law was different, but had permitted both propositions to stand for the guidance of the jury. It is quite clear that, when the jury went out, they could have had no proper instruction in regard to this important element in the case, as to which the evidence in favor of the defendant was greatly preponderating; and it must be assumed that this-error was injurious to-the defendant, and for that reason a new trial must be granted, with costs to the defendant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
