In support of the claim, two promissory notes, signed by David Hall and James Hall, his brother, were put in evidence,:\u2014one dated July 1, 1873, for $300, due 6 months after its date, and the other dated October 4, 1873, for $100, due 12 months after its date. The only other evidence offered was that of the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, who testified that in 1896 she was present at a conversation between the plaintiff and the testator, in which her mother said to him: \u201cDave, how about that $400 I gave you to keep for me until I would be old?\u201d-to which the testator replied, \u201cWhat $400?\u201d She then asked, \u201cIs it possible, that yon forget about my $400 that I worked so hard for, and gave to you to keep for me?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cI remember no $400.\u201d The daughter states that her mother then left the room, went upstairs, and returned with the notes, and opened the conversation as follows: \"Now, Dave, surely you remember your own signature. Don\u2019t you remember about being so mad about my not giving you all the money when I gave your brother Jimmie $200, and how angry you were because I did not give it all to-you?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cOh, crackle, yes.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s daughter further testifies: \u201cHe took the notes, and after he got through he handed them back to my mother, and she says, \u2018Now Dave, I am glad you remember that, because I knew that money would come in useful when I was old, and I passed a remark, you were better than a bank.\u2019 \u201d At the close of the evidence, a motion was made to dismiss upon the ground that the only proof was upon two promissory notes which were barred by the statute of limitations. The referee decided that the promissory notes were intended to operate, not as evidence of a loan, hut as mere receipts for the deposit of the money. The respondent contends that the judgment should be upheld upon the ground that the evidence establishes a novation, and this is attempted to be supported upon the theory that the parties substituted some new contract for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ike old one on the notes. In this connection it is insisted that there is no evidence as to the time this transaction took place, and that it must be presumed to have been subsequent to the maiding of the notes. As we read the evidence of the daughter, however, as to what the mother said at the interview in 1896, it was a recital by the mother of what took place at the time the money was given and the notes were received. And this does not show that the money was received as a deposit, or otherwise than as indicated by the terms of the notes. The testator\u2019s statement that he remembered can only be construed, at most, into an admission that he recalled the circumstances connected with the receipt of the money and the giving of the notes, for it will be noticed that with reference to what followed, when the mother said she was glad he remembered it, because the money would come in useful when she -was old, the testator made no response. It cannot be concluded, therefore, that the testator admitted that the money represented by the notes was then held in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We have examined the other grounds upon which it is sought to sustain the judgment, and find them insufficient. Onr conclusion is that the original transaction between the parties was evidenced by the notes; that there is no sufficient evidence of a subsequent or new agreement that the money was held as a deposit; and that, as the notes were barred by the statute of limitations, and there was no evidence to take them out of the bar, the claim was not supported, and the motion to dismiss \u25a0should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The judgment accordingly should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
