On a petition to a special term of the supreme court, in which it was alleged that the county treasurer of Putnam county would pay a higher rate of interest than the Mercantile Trust Company, it was ordered that the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>company pay over the funds in parcel 70 to the treasurer of Putnam county, who was ordered to pay the interest to the petitioner, Delia Sherwood, and to distribute the fund, at her death, as directed in the original order of the court. The Mercantile' Trust Company appeals from this order, and urges that, under the provisions of section 17 of the Laws of 1883, the court has no power to direct this fund to be paid to any other than a trust company. The object of the statute was not to interfere with the general power of the court to superintend funds within its legitimate control, but to provide a place of deposit which should meet the requirements of the constitution by enabling the city to make compensation for lands taken in carrying out the objects of the law. It made it lawful for the city to pay the money into the custody of such trust companies as the court should designate; but it did not deprive the court of its right to protect such funds against an unreasonable reduction of interest, or prevent its exercising control of the money for the protection of those who are to come into possession at the close of the life estate in the property taken. The court has the right, and it is its duty, to see that the life estate of Delia Sherwood in the property taken is not made practically valueless; that the property is not taken from her without just compensation, through the operation of the trust company in lowering its rate of interest, when this can be done with safety to those who are to come into subsequent possession. Whenever it appears to the court that the fund is not realizing that rate of income which it is reasonable to expect, and when there is an opportunity to place it where it will become more productive, without infringing upon the rights of others, it is clearly within the power of the court to order the transfer of the fund. The city having paid in the money -to a trust company, designated by the court, its responsibility ends, and the fund comes under the general guardianship of the court, for the benefit of those who shall be the lawful heirs at the time of the death of Delia Sherwood, who had the life estate in the property from which this fund, known as \u201cParcel 70,\u201d was realized, the avails of which belong to her during her lifetime; and, were these the only considerations involved, w\u00e9 should affirm the order appealed from. We think, however, that, before the fund shall be reinvested under the order of the court, the persons entitled to the remainder after the termination of the life estate are entitled to notice of the application so to do; and we are of the opinion that the Mercantile Trust Company, being the present custodian of the fund, has sufficient standing in court to appear and request that this be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The order of the special term is reversed, without costs, with leave to renew the motion upon notice, as heretofore indicated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
