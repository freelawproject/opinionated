The complaint alleges that, \u201coiving to the gross carelessness and negligence of the defendant, and without any fault or negligence on the part of the said minor or this plaintiff in any wise contributing thereto,\u201d the said minor, while performing his duties as a servant of the defendant, sustained certain injuries \u201cby falling Into and through an unguarded and improperly constructed elevator shaft on the premises of the defendant.\u201d The demurrer is on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrer was sustained for the reason, stated in the opinion of the court, that \u201cthere is no allegation in the complaint that defendant knew of the defective condition of the shaft, or that the servant was</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ignorant thereof. * * * The gist of the cause of action is the negligence of the master and absence of contributory negligence on the part of the servant. The master\u2019s negligence cannot result if he was ignorant of the defects, and want of knowledge must exist on the part of the servant to hold him free from negligence contributing to his injury. Averments covering these foundations for liability must be contained in the complaint. If absent therefrom, no cause of action can be' stated.\u201d An interlocutory judgment was accordingly directed for the defendant, from which the plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b174-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

It is not alleged that the employ\u00e9 worked on the elevator shaft, or had anything to do with it; but, on the contrary, the fair inference is that he was engaged at other work in some other part of the premises, and through the negligence of the defendant, and without fault on his part, was injured. The averment that he was employed by the defendant was proper as showing that he was not a trespasser, but was rightfully on the premises. The principle of obvious risks is not, therefore, directly involved in the complaint, .though it is possible it may arise upon the trial. The confusion, therefore, between the necessary averments of a complaint and evidentiary facts led the learned judge into the error of adjudging this complaint insufficient. Where, however, a plaintiff, be he servant or third person, seeks to recover for injuries sustained,-not in connection with the machinery or appliances with which he is furnished, or in connection with the place where he is working, and where the doctrine of \"obvious risks would be applicable, his complaint is sufficient if it has the usual allegations of the defendant\u2019s negligence, and the absence of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Here, although the plaintiff counts on negligence, the defendant succeeded below in his contention that he made a mistake in so doing, and that he should have alleged facts which would have sustained an action upon the doctrine of obvious risks; and that, as upon such a theory there were absent certain nec\u00e9ssary averments, the complaint was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">It was the plaintiff\u2019s right to formulate his own theory, and the allegations in the complaint in support thereof being the usual and proper ones, and sufficient; it was error to sustain the demurrer thereto, and the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, but with leave to the defendant to withdraw demurrer and answer over on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
