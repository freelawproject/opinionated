It is averred in the complaint, and the averment is specifically admitted in the answer, that between the 15th day of November, 1895, and the 16th day of April, 1896, the plaintiff sold and delivered to White, on the faith of the guaranty, $500 worth of goods, and that this sum is due to the plaintiff by White. The defendant, after mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ing this admission, alleges that, on the 16th day of April, 1896, there was in fact due by White to the plaintiff more than the sum of $500, to wit, the sum of $886.48, on account of which latter sum White gave the plaintiff four promissorjr notes, amounting to $669.40, maturing at later dates. The defense was that the extension of time thus given to White released the defendant. The learned trial justice took this view of the case and dismissed the complaint. In thus ruling the learned trial justice overlooked the fact, which was clearly established, that the plaintiff took these notes at the urgent request of the defendant. The rule is well settled that the surety is not discharged where he consents to the extension of time given to the principal. Remsen v. Graves, 41 N. Y. 471; Morgan v. Smith, 70 N. Y. 537; Mead v. Parker, 111 Y. Y. 259, 18 N. E. 727; Powers v. Silberstein, 108 N. Y. 169,15 N. E. 185; Bank v. Bigler, 83 N. Y. 51; Smith v. Molleson, 148 N. Y. 241, 42 N. E. 669. The ruling was therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">There was an additional error, doubtless the result of oversight with regard to the balance due by White over and above the amount of these notes. The defendant in her answer concedes that, over and above all payments, there is a balance of $123.60 due by White .to the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims that the balance was larger. Whatever it was, as matter of fact, the plaintiff was entitled to it, whether the defendant consented to the acceptance of the notes or not. As was said in Lowman v. Gates, 37 N. Y. 606, \u201cthe receipt of the notes could have no greater effect than a payment of money.\u201d At most, therefore, the taking of these notes for a less amount than the sum due \u201ccould but operate as a discharge of the surety to the amount of the notes, and left her unaffected as to the remainder.\u201d The respondent does not seriously contest these positions. She asks an affirmance principally upon the ground that the plaintiff in his complaint averred that the consideration of the guaranty was that, \u201cat the request of the defendant,\u201d he would sell goods to White, and that this request was not proved. This point is frivolous. The guaranty itself imports the request. But, whether it does or not, the expression, \u201cat the request of the defendant,\u201d is surplusage. The real consideration is expressed in the \u201cpromise in writing\u201d referred to in the complaint; that is, in the instrument itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The point that the defendant did not agree to an. extension beyond the time expressed in the guaranty is equally frivolous. What she said, as testified to by Mrs. Cline, in no wise limited the extension. On the contrary, it permitted an unlimited extension. \u201cPlease do me the favor,\u201d was her language, \u201cto get him to sign notes, or anything at all, no matter what it is, so we can get money from him. You need not be at all afraid. I will pay every cent I guarantied, whether you take notes or not, and whatever you do I will pay you.\u201d Yone of the other points made by the respondent are worthy of special consideration. They are all trivial. Upon the case as it stood when the nonsuit was granted, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to a verdict for the full sum of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
