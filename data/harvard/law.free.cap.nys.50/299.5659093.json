In fact, no representations were made. The statement of things that occurred afterwards is irrelevant. The complaint does not seem to state a case of fraud at all. The statement of evidence-in it is not pleaded.\u201d There is no good ground for disturbing this-conclusion of the court. It is necessary to- bring the defendant within the provisions of section 549 \u00f3f the Code of Civil Procedure, that the facts necessary to constitute the fraud be stated. There is not a single fact stated which is calculated to support the charge of fraud' in the purchase of the goods, and the material facts in the affidavit on which the order of arrest was granted are met and overcome by the-d\u201eeclarations in the affidavit of the defendant in such a manner as to-destroy all presumption of fraud which might grow out of the recital of the plaintiff. \u201cIt is not fraudulent per se for a person in embarrassed circumstances,\u201d say the court in the case of Pinckney v. Darling, 3 App. Div. 553, 38 N. Y. Supp. 411, \u201cto buy goods-, withholding the information from the seller of the actual condition of his business affairs. It seems to be a cardinal factor in cases of this-character that there must exist an intent on the part of the purchaser-to cheat the seller; or, as said in Nichols v. Pinner, 18 N. Y. 295, there must exist, at least, an intention to do an act the necessary result of which will be to cheat and defraud another. And, as said in the case of Iron Co. v. The Hopatcong and The Musconetcong,, 127 N. Y. 206, 27 N. E. 841, the fact of insolvency and the failure of a debtor to disclose the condition of his business, unless there is an intent not to pay for what was purchased, does not constitute such fraud as would entitle a creditor to rescind a contract.\u201d See, also, Morris v. Talcott, 96 N. Y. 100; Hotchkin v. Bank, 127 N. Y. 329, 27 N. E. 1050. There is- no- evidence of intent on the part of the defendant to defraud the plaintiff of its pay. The letters submitted all show an intention to pay, and no fact is established to show that his representations as to his failure -to make such payments are not true. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ought certainly to require as good a case on the pleadings to warrant an' arrest as would be required to justify a creditor in rescinding a contract, and in this essential particular the complaint in the case now under consideration does not meet the requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The order of the special term is affirmed, with flO costs and dis&lt; bursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
