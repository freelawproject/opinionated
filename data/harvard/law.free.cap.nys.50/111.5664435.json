It was held that the agreement relating to the deposit of $4,500, to be retained as liquidated damages for a breach of the covenants of the lease, would not satisfy the obligation of these defendants to pay money due under the lease as rent of the premises. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The appeal from the order denying the motion for a new trial must be dismissed.
