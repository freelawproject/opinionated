Slane was insolvent at the time of the delivery of the deed to his wife. It is true that there is some conflict in the statements of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ants in respect to some of the details; but these cannot avail to give the plaintiffs a cause of action in the absence of affirmative evidence to show that the transfer of the property was made after the indebtedness of the defendant, and at a time when he was otherwise insolvent. The trial court, on a hearing of the evidence, decided that, \u201cat the time of the making, delivery, and recording of said deed to Cecilia I. Slane, the defendant John T. Slane was solvent and had sufficient property to meet all his obligations,\u201d and that, \u201cat the time, he was not indebted to the plaintiffs\u201d; and a careful examination of the testimony affords no good grounds for disturbing this finding of fact, or the conclusion of law based upon such finding. The plaintiffs having failed to establish a condition of facts which brings the defendants within the presumption which the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel urges,' it is unnecessary to consider the authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed, with costs to the defendants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
