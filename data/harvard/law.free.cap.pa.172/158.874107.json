McNally had notice and some of which he attended, and that subsequently the said corporation was organized under the act of the general assembly known as the corporation act of 1874 and its supplements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-24\">That James A. McNally, the above named defendant, agreed to subscribe and did subscribe for twenty shares of the capital stock of said corporation, the par value of each share being $50.00, and the amount of his subscription being the sum of $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-25\">Defendant\u2019s affidavit of defense was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-26\">It is not true that I agreed to subscribe and did subscribe for twenty (20) shares of the capital stock of the Columbus Land Company of the par value of fifty dollars ($50.00) a share. It is true that I wrote my name to the paper dated March 9, 1893, of which a copy, I believe, is annexed to the affidavit of claim, but I did not fill out any number of shares in the company which I was willing to take. I signed the paper without any examination of its contents, and with the understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that it was a paper to be used as a feeler to see how many persons were willing to go together and raise sufficient money to purchase, as I understood, a lot on Penn avenue, in the city of Pittsburg, for use as a club house for the Columbus Club. After I signed the paper it seems some person, without my knowledge or consent, has filled out the twenty (20) shares of stock for me, and subsequently, without my knowledge or consent, and some six (6) months after I had signed the paper, an application was made for a charter for a company having for its purpose the purchase and sale of real estate, and also the holding, leasing and selling of real estate. I was not consulted about the formation of the company, nor the purpose for which it was to be organized, and I gave no authority to anjr one for me to assent to the orginization of any such company with any such powers. I deny that I attended any of the meetings of the stockholders of the Columbus Land Company. As I believe, I did not receive any notices or any calls for payments to stock of the Columbus Land Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-4\">For several years prior to 1898 there had been efforts made by members of the Columbus Club in reference to the purchase of property for a club house, but as I always understood, the purchase was to be by the club itself, and was to be the property, which I thought to be peculiarly fitted for such a purpose, on Penn avenue. I never authorized the purchase of the present property on Sixth avenue, and I did not approve of the same, and I did not subscribe to any company to aid in the pur chase of such property, and, so far as I was concerned, I opposed the purchase of the Sixth avenue property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\"><em>JError assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-7\"><em>James A. </em>Pierce, <em>D.

It is not necessary that in such a paper he should meet, by an oath, every objection or argument against his case which fine critical skill may deduce. Liebersperger v.

The affidavit of defense is evidently evasive, and the court below was clearly right in treating it as insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
