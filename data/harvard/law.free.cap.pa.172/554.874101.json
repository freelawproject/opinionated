[8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s points were as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-13\">1. That under all the evidence the defendant was a trespasser on said premises. <em>Answer: </em>This point is affirmed. There are three ways by which land may become a public street or highway:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-14\">1st. By the city taking and appropriating land for use as a public street or highway in the mode provided by law for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-15\">2d. By dedication or appropriation of realty by the owner to the use of the public and the adoption thereof by the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-16\">3d. By prescription, that is a right which a possessor of land, or the public acquires by reason of his adverse possession during a period usually of twenty years, and rests upon the presumption of a grant, which by lapse of time has been lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-17\">By none of these means has the use of the land as a public highway been acquired or opened to defendant\u2019s use. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-18\">2. If entitled to recover plaintiff can recover the worth of the use of the property during the period so occupied by the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point is affirmed. Taking into consideration in ascertaining the \u201cworth of the use,\u201d that the entry or trespass complained of was on the site of a lawfully located but unopened street \u2014 the extent and character of the use made of the land \u2014 the conditions of land and its availability as a means of enjoyment or as a source of profit, and the extent of the defendant\u2019s interference therewith. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>3. That under all the evidence the defendant was a trespasser, and must pay a reasonable amount for the use of the property during the period so occupied by it, as damages, and the location of the proposed street cannot affect the amount of such damage. <em>Answer: </em>This point I decline to affirm as stated. I am willing to say that under the evidence the defendant is a trespasser, and that the plaintiff is entitled to at least nominal damages; and that he is entitled to such further damages as may be a reasonable compensation for the trespass committed in view of all the circumstances and evidence submitted for your consideration. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-3\">4. That the plaintiff is entitled to recover in addition to nominal damages whatever damages shall appear proper to the jury, from the evidence, as compensation for the unlawful use and possession of said premises by the defendant for its pipe line. <em>Answer: </em>This point is affirmed. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\">Defendant\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\">1. Under all the evidence in the case the verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">2. If the court refuses to charge, as requested in the defendant\u2019s first point, then counsel for defendant asks the court to say to the jury that if they find from the evidence that Andrew Patterson, by his deed offered in evidence, recognized Bates street as a street, and that the same, viz: the land included in the lines of Bates street, has been used by Patterson\u2019s grantees and the pnblic as a street since Patterson sold the land, as shown by his deed, then the verdict should be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point is refused. The facts set forth are to be taken into consideration in estimating damages, but I do not regard the Patterson deed as a dedication of the land for public use, nor as intended as to such of the laud within the lines of Bates street. The deed does give, I think, under the law to the grantees, the use of that portion of the land for travel and as a right of way over the same, but the defendant company does not stand in that relation to the property. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-8\">What was the use of the land in this way by the defendant, under the circumstances, reasonably and actually worth to the plaintiff by way of compensation for the wrong done ? The measure of damages is not to be estimated in my judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>upon the basis of the most advantageous terms for the trespasser; when the entry and continued use is wrongful he is not entitled to the same consideration to be accorded to one whose entry is lawful, and the use a matter of contract, expressed or implied. An implied contract is where it is not discussed, and there can be contracts of that kind. . You 'can let a man go into your house, and the implied contract is that he is to pay what it is worth; and where that is the case it is a different state of affairs than where your rights are invaded, and parties under such circumstances are not entitled to the same consideration to be accorded to those who enter of right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $100.

Phila., 162 Pa. 413, or the Brooklyn Street Case, 118 Pa. 640, and that class of cases. Those are cases where the grantor in his deed recognized the street as a boundary, but the street was .still an unopened street. In this case we have an opened street \u2014 opened and used as a street for the last ten years and upwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-9\">Again, we contend, that the conveyance of Patterson, as made, is such as to justify a purchaser in construing and believing it to convey a good title to the street referred to therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-10\">The reservation is only of so much of said property as is contained within the lines of Bates street, and contains no words of inheritance. The word property does not necessarily mean the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-11\">This is an action, quare clausum fregit, for an injury to the possession.

Phila., 162 Pa. 413; Brooklyn St. Case, 118 Pa. 640.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-6\">The defendant was a trespasser pure and simple, for there never was an ouster, and no adverse possession of the fee is maintained. In an action for mesne profits (where an owner has been disseized) the rents and profits are to be distinguished from damages suffered by way of actual injury to the premises. Such damages are recoverable in the same action: Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 905; Ward v. Warner, 8 Mich. 508; McWilliams v. Morgan, 75 Ill. 473.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Abh\">January 6, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AFJ\">Mr. Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The defendant justified its entry upon and use of the plaintiff\u2019s land for the purpose of laying gas pipes, upon the ground that the land had been dedicated for use as a public street. In 1884 the plaintiff sold a tract of unimproved land to John Reaman. On the city plan a proposed street had been located which passed over this land. No steps had then been taken, or have since been taken, by the city or any one to open the street. It was merely a plotted street. From the conveyance the plaintiff reserved the land within the lines of the street. The words of the reservation are \u201c Excepting and reserving from this conveyance all that part of the above described property lying within the lines of Bates St. as laid out upon the plan of the City of Pittsburgh.\u201d The street was not named as a boundary nor referred to in the description. Reaman, the plaintiff\u2019s grantee, divided the tract and conveyed the parts, describing them as bounded by Bates street. Some of his grantees subdivided the parts they had purchased into building lots and sold them as fronting on Bates street. The land within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the lines of the street was graded by these grantees and used as a public street. This was the condition of the property when in 1888 the gas pipes were laid, and it has remained practically the same ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The mere placing of the street upon the city plan conferred no right to the use of the land as a highway upon any one. The plaintiff made no conveyance by the implied covenants of which the land was to be left open for the use of his grantees and the public, and we find no act of his to justify the inference of dedication. He reserved from the land described a part lying within the lines of a projected street. The street was not opened. No proceedings had been instituted to open it. It had no existence except upon paper. It was not a boundary and was not named in the description of the land conveyed. Before the conveyance the plaintiff was at liberty to make such use of the land conveyed as he wished. He could have inclosed and cultivated it, or have built upon it subject to the right of the city to take it without payment for improvements made after notice of the location of the street. None of these rights was lost by his conveyance and of course they could not be affected by the subsequent conveyances of his grantee. It is not the case of the right of way over a street named in the description as a boundary, nor of a street laid out by the grantor over land which he has sold in lots, nor of the acquiescence of the owner in a use for such a length of time that public convenience or private rights would be materially affected by its interruption. There is nothing in the evidence upon which to found an implied dedication which would operate as an estoppel. \u201c A dedication to the public of the use of land must rest on the intention or clear assent of the owner; which may be manifested by writing, sealed or unsealed, or by parol, or by acts inconsistent or irreconcilable with any inference except such consent; but the dedication must be under such circumstances as to indicate an abandonment of the use to the community by the owner .... and the acts and declarations to effect a dedication should be unambiguous and unequivocal.\u201d Donaston v. Payne, 2 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The measure of damages was the injury caused the plaintiff' by the use to which his land had been subjected by the defendant. The instruction on the subject in the general charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and in the answers to the points was correct, and the amount of the verdict makes it certain that the rule was followed by the jury. The objections to the admission of testimony which appear in the seventh assignment of error might well have been sustained, as the questions asked were wanting in clearness and tended to present a wrong standard for the assessment of damages, but as it is evident that they did no harm the case should not be sent back.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
