Douty, gave Tobias Koppen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>haffer a writing in the nature of an agreement to sell, called by the parties \u201c a forfeiture receipt.\u201d A small amount of money was paid to W. H. Douty, which he subsequently returned and received back the receipt from Koppenhaffer. W. H. Douty never had any power of attorney or written authority from his father to make the sale. John B. Douty died on November 17, 1873. In 1870, Daniel Reed obtained a judgment against To-bias Koppenhaffer, and on September 3, 1872, levied upon and sold the lot in question. The sheriff executed and delivered a deed to Daniel Reed on January 16, 1873. Daniel Reed died on March 7, 1873. Plaintiffs are the heirs of Daniel Reed, deceased.

Unless he did take possession under that purchase, he took no title; and of course nothing passed by the sheriff\u2019s sale to Daniel Reed, and the plaintiffs, would have no title to the land in dispute. If he did take possession, then the judgment of Daniel Reed attached to the equitable title of Tobias Koppenhaffer, and the sale upon that judgment passed the Koppenhaffer equitable title to the purchaser at that sale, Daniel Reed, and that title is in the plaintiffs by descent from Reed.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">[Adams knew, of course, the title, and was bound to know the'title of John B. Douty. That, if I remember correctly, was upon record. Douty\u2019s deed for the land, which he had acquired sometime prior to 1870, was upon record. If Adams found the lot which he was about to purchase in 1881 of the executors of John B. Douty unoccupied, vacant, without improvements upon it, and with nothing there to indicate that any person was in possession or claiming possession of that ground, of that lot, with nothing there to show him that somebody else was claiming to hold it other than the estate of John B. Douty ; and if Adams purchased without actual knowledge of the Koppenhaffer title from Douty; and if Adams paid the purchase money or a part of it and went into possession and improved the lot of ground, then he would be an innocent purchaser for value and would be protected under the law, his title would be better than, \u2014 superior to, \u2014 the title of the Reed heirs.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">[First determine whether Koppenhaffer had any title, whether he went into possession under his agreement with Douty. If he did, then Daniel Reed by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s sale took whatever equitable interest Koppenhaffer had. If Koppen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>haffer did not go into possession, then Reed took nothing, and of course that would end the case, and you would not need to inquire any further.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">Even though you find that Koppenhaffer did go into possession and that the Reed heirs therefore took the title which he had; yet if you find that Barney E. Adams was an innocent purchaser in 1881, who paid his purchase money or a portion of it, went into possession and made improvements on that lot of gound, without actual notice of the Koppenhaffer title then in the Reeds, and without anything upon the ground at or about the time to indicate to him that the Reeds were claiming an interest in or title to this land; then Adams took a better title to this land than they, the Reed heirs, and his title is preferred to theirs. But, if you find that there was sufficient there to indicate to him that the Reeds were claiming title, then it was his duty to make inquiry, and as a man of ordinary prudence he is bound to take notice of what was being done with this lot of ground, of what was there upon the ground by way of improvement or by way of cultivation that would indicate that somebody else was there claiming an interest in or a title to the lot in dispute.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

Douty who died in November, 1873, testate. In 1881 his son, Wm. H. Douty, acting for his executors, sold the lot to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>defendant, who immediately entered into possession of it, built houses and made other valuable improvements upon it. In November, 1888, this suit was brought by the heirs of David Reed, who claimed to have an equitable title to the lot, derived from their father who acquired it in December, 1872, at a sheriff\u2019s sale upon his judgment against Tobias Koppenhaffer. In order to maintain their suit it was necessary for them to show by competent and credible evidence that Koppenhaffer had an equitable title to the lot when their father\u2019s judgment was entered, and this they undertook, but, as we think, signally failed to do. In the first place they did not show that there was a written agreement between Koppenhaffer and John B. Douty which invested the former as against the latter with such a title, or a verbal agreement of sale followed by payment of purchase money, and such possession and improvements by the vendee as would confer it. There is not more than a scintilla of evidence in the case which supports the contention that John B. Douty signed an agreement for the sale of the lot to Koppenhaffer. There is however evidence that a writing was delivered to the latter, but this was made and signed by Wm. H. Douty and described by him as a \u201c forfeiture receipt,\u201d which was subsequently surrendered by Koppenhaffer, to whom the monej' it was given for, was refunded. The evidence fails to show that Wm. H. Douty had any written authority from his father to execute any paper connected with the transaction. The most that can be inferred from the testimony favorable to the plaintiffs, is that there was a verbal agreement between John B. Douty and Koppenhaffer for the sale of the lot to the latter, and that it was abandoned by the parties within three years, and perhaps as early as 1871. Koppenhaffer\u2019s testimony on this point is not clear, nor his recollection as to the time of abandonment, certain or satisfactory. But it is clear that no such payments or improvements were made or possession taken and maintained by him in pursuance of their agreement as clothed him with a title to the lot enforceable at law or in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">If Douty had sold and conveyed the lot to another before the abandonment of the agreement, Koppenhaffer\u2019s only remedy would have been an action for the breach of it. It follows from these views that Reed acquired no title to or interest in the lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>by his sale of it on the Koppenhaffer judgment. The taxes upon the lot were not assessed to or paid by him or his estate, and neither he nor his heirs made any improvements upon it. From 1878 to 1881 Douty\u2019s estate paid the taxes and after that they were paid by the defendant. An effort was made to show that the Reeds were in possession of the lot after the sale of it on the Koppenhaffer judgment, but the evidence on this point was vague and meager. Harvey Mowrey testified that in 1873 \u201c old Mrs. Reed and Aaron Reed raised potatoes and one thing another upon\u201d it. Fridel Heitzman testified that he plowed the lot once for the Reeds, and saw \u201c Aaron and the old woman \u201d plant something there. Susan Rogers testified that she went upon the lot once with Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Reitz and saw them gather some \u201c tomatoes or radishes \u201d there. These were the only witnesses who testified in relation to the possession of the Reeds; and none of them except Mowrey could tell in what year she or he saw Mrs. Reed or Aaron upon the lot. For at least fourteen years immediately preceding the institution of this suit the plaintiffs made no claim to the lot, although during the last half of that time the defendant was in possession o\u00a3 it and made valuable improvements thereon with their knowledge and without the least intimation from them that they had or claimed to have an interest in it. The evidence is positive, clear and undisputed that the defendant never heard of their claim\u2018until this action was brought, and that there was nothing upon the lot or upon the records which suggested that any person had an interest in it which qualified his vendor\u2019s title to it. It will be seen from this reference to the testimony that the latter was insufficient to support the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, and that the learned court below would have been justified in directing the jury to find for the defendant. The plaintiffs cannot,. therefore, justly complain of the instructions under which the case was submitted. These instructions were more favorable to them than they were, upon their own showing, entitled to. Did the learned court err in its rulings upon offers of evidence ? We think not. The first and second specifications relate to the rulings upon the offers of the receipt of June 3, 1873. For the reasons stated in the objections to these offers we think the receipt was properly rejected. It was not error to allow the defendant to testify to his purchase of the lot in 1881 and tc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>his possession of, and his payments and improvements upon it. Nor do we think there was any error in the refusal of the court to strike out the testimony of Tobias Koppenhaffer in relation to his surrender of his purchase money receipt and the refunding of the money for which it was given. We think it is clear that Wm. H. Douty was a competent witness to testify to the matters to which his attention was called. He had no interest in the decision of the question involved in the case His father died testate, and he was not entitled to anything under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The specifications of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
