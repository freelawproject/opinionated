Com., Tharp v. Com., Packard\u2019s Appeal, and the general adoption act of May 4,1855. An examination of those statutes will disclose that they are all merely statutes of adoption and nothing more. They confer only the right to inherit, without saying how, or subject to what burdens. They are therefore not applicable to this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>S. R.

It is property devised or descending to children and lineal descendants that is exempt from the tax. If the heirs of devisees are so in fact they are exempt; all others are subject to the tax: Nancrede v. Com., 32 Pa. 389; Packard\u2019s App., 37 Leg. Int. 135.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">The term tax in the act is used in its ordinary acceptation, and cannot be enlarged by ingenious argument to embrace a class of cases that are not properly taxed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-6\">The right to inherit from the adopting parents is made complete, but the identity of the child is not changed : Com. v. Nancrede, 32 Pa. 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">The court below decided this case in favor of the appellees on the ground that the act of March 14, 1873, P. L. 290, was unconstitutional; that it offended against article XI. sec. 8 of the constitution of 1838 and the amendment thereto adopted in 1864, which declares, \u201cNo bill shall be passed by the legislature containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in the title, except appropriation bills.\u201d In this we submit there was no error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\">The title to an act should be so certain as not to mislead: Hatfield v. Com., 120 Pa. 395; Com. v. Frantz, 135 Pa. 389; Philadelphia v. Ridge Ave. Ry., 142 Pa. 484; Com. v. Samuels, 163 Pa. 283; Com. v. Severn, 164 Pa. 462.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1a\">Nov. 8, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Ay-\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Analysis of the act of March 14,1873, fails to show any real lack of unity in its subject-matter. The \u201c one subject \u201d which it contains relates to the status of M. H. Henderson as a son of Branton H. Henderson. \u201c The rights, powers and privilege's\u201d which the title of the act proposes, and the first section confers, are intended to be descriptive of the attributes of a son in fact\u2014 the right to inherit and the powers and privileges incidental to its enjoyment. The second section expresses what had already been implied. In our as in the Roman jurisprudence, a privilege means the exemption of a person or class of persons from the operation of any law: Cent. Dictionary. Thus it is settled that the right of a debtor or widow to exemption is a persona] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>privilege. The right of a son in fact to exemption from any species of taxation, which is equally a privilege, was implied in the title and first section and expressed in the second section of this act as being the \u201c one subject \u201d of grant. The grant of all the privileges of a son necessarily included this privilege of exemption; and its specification in the second section of the act is therefore germane to the subject; and those who read the title to the act must be presumed to have had notice of the purpose to confer it: Phila. v. Railway Co., 142 Pa. 484. The act was clearly within the amendment of 1864.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">When the act of 1878 was passed uniformity of taxation was not required by the constitution; and hence the legislature, which had the power to impose, could exempt individuals from liability for taxes on inheritance. \u201cThe right of inheritance at all is, so far as the administration of justice is concerned, purely statutory; and one of the results from the power to grant this right is that the legislature may prescribe the terms of taking:\u201d Burroughs on Taxation, sec. 81. No intent is shown in the act of 1873 to charge collateral inheritance tax on M. H. Henderson; on the contrary he was not only given \u201c all the rights, powers and privileges \u201d of a class which, at the time of grant, was exempt from its payment, but it was expressly declared that such estates as he should take by virtue of the act should be subject only to such tax as would be payable by that class. The purpose to exempt is so clearly expressed as to leave no doubt. This feature distinguishes the present from that class of cases in which there has been a grant of the right to inheritance simply. As was said by this court in Com. v. Nancrede, 32 Pa. 389, \u201c Giving an adopted son a right to inherit, does not make him a son in fact. And he is so regarded in law, only to give the right to inherit, and not to change the collateral inheritance tax law.\u201d But here there was a necessary implication of exemption, and therefore Matthias H. Henderson took the estate which he received from Branton H. Henderson exempt from the payment of collateral inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Judgment reversed and judgment is now entered for the defendant, in accordance with the terms of the case stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
