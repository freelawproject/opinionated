The lien on its face shows it was filed December 31, 1892; there is no date or item given at the time of the completion of the contract, as appears upon the face of the lien. The last credit- as given upon the face of the lien is payment of money on the 31st of July, $100. The face of the lien shows a payment in excess of the contract price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-9\">Second. On the bill of extras attached to the lien for which this lien is filed, it is for the extras alone; there is not a solitary date or time given from the beginning of the bill to the close at what time any of the work was done or any of the material furnished, in all about eighteen or twenty items of extra work, contrary to the requirements of law which require a specific statement of the dates and times when the work was done, particularly with reference to a bill of extras.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-10\">By the Court: The objections are overruled and bill sealed for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-11\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $950.

Thomas, 5 W. &amp; S. 262; Witman v. Walker, 9 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 193 ; McClintock v. Rush, 63 Pa. 203; Church v. Trout, 28 Pa. 153; Knabbs\u2019 App., 10 Pa. 186; Rush v.

Burke, 66 Pa. 336 ; Fahnestock v. Speer, 92 Pa. 148 ; Lybrandt v. Eberly, 36 Pa. 347; Howell v. Philadelphia, 38 Pa. 471.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AhDJ\">January 6, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Axp\">Mr. Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The error assigned is to the admission in evidence of the record of the mechanic\u2019s lien. The objection urged was based on the insufficiency of the lien as appearing on its face. The plea to the sci. fa. was non assumpsit, set-off, payment with leave, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In Lybrant v. Eberly, 36 Pa. 347, it was held, following Lewis v. Morgan, 11 S. &amp; R. 234, that the formal validity of a mechanic\u2019s lien is not put in issue by the plea of payment, and that no issue for the jury could be raised on the formal deficiencies of the claim, as they were questions of law and should be raised by demurrer or by motion to strike off the claim. Following this case it was decided in Howell v. City of Philadelphia, 38 Pa. 471, that pleading to the sci. fa. must be considered a waiver of defects as to dates in the lien. In Lee v. Burke, 66 Pa. 336, the plea was no lien, payment and set-off with leave, and it was said by Sharswood, J.: \u201c It was the issues of fact raised by these pleas that the jury were called and empaneled to try. No question of the sufficiency of the claim upon its face could arise at the trial. That would be an issue of law. There might arise a question of variance between the evidence as offered and the claim as filed and recited in the scire facias, but not whether that claim was regular and sufficient.\u201d And he adds that the short plea of no lien was not a demurrer general or special, and raised no question as to defects on the face of the claim filed. There is no conflict between these cases and St. Clair Coal Co. v. Martz, 75 Pa. 384, where it was held that, as the act of assembly gave the plaintiff no such lien as was filed, the fatal error in the claim was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>waived as a merely formal defect by going to trial on the issue of payment; and Fahnestock v. Speer, 92 Pa. 146, where the special plea concluded to the court, and was held to be in effect a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
