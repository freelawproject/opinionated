Before McIlvaine, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">Plaintiff averred in his statement as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsO\">Said plaintiff is the owner of a tract of surface land, containing about fifty-one acres, and overlying the coal works or mines of the defendant, in Allen township, Washington county, Pa., on which tract of land, prior to the committing of the trespasses hereinafter complained of, there were a well and three never-failing springs of water. The surface of said tract was suitable for grazing and agricultural purposes and was so used by said plaintiff. There was also on said tract a two story brick dwelling house thirty-three by eighteen feet with cellar underneath, all in good repair and the walls perfectly sound. Plaintiff further states that said defendant negligently and carelessly mined out the coal underlying said tract of land, whereby the said well and springs thereon were taken away and destroyed, the said surface cracked and damaged, and the walls of the said dwelling house also cracked and damaged. Plaintiff also states that said defendant mined out the coal underlying said surface and took away the natural support thereof and allowed the same to be and remain without support, either natural or artificial, whereby the plaintiff\u2019s said surface has been caused to settle and crack, taking away and destroying the said well and three springs and leaving the said surface destitute of the water which is necessary thereon for domestic and grazing purposes, and rendering said surface unsafe for grazing purposes ; and injuring and damaging said surface for agricultural and any other purposes for which the same is available. Plaintiff also states that by reason of the lack of support to said surface as afore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>said, the foundation and house walls of said dwelling house have been caused to crack in numerous places, whereby the said walls have been thrown out of plumb and said house rendered unsafe for use as a dwelling and otherwise damaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-4\">At the trial, evidence for the plaintiff tended to sustain the averments of the statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s point among others was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\">2. If the jury find from all the evidence that the defendant mined out the coal underneath the plaintiff\u2019s surface, and that by reason of such mining and a lack of sufficient support consequent thereon said surface was caused to settle and crack and the plaintiff thereby damaged, then their verdict must be for the plaintiff for an amount that will compensate him for the injury he has shown that he has sustained, regardless of whether the mining was carefully done according to the usual practice of mining. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\">Defendant\u2019s points among others were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">5. The averment in the plaintiff\u2019s statement being that the coal under the plaintiff\u2019s surface land had been carelessly and negligently mined out whereby the said three springs thereon were taken away and destroyed and whereby the plaintiff\u2019s said surface has been caused to settle and crack, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that the injury alleged is directly attributable to the alleged negligent and careless mining; and there being no such proof, the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-9\">6. The injuries of which plaintiff complains in this case being alleged by him to have been the result of negligent and careless mining operations of the defendant in the taking out of the coal owned by it beneath the surface of the land owned by the plaintiff, there can be no recovery of damages by the plaintiff without some evidence that the alleged negligent and careless mining was the direct and immediate cause of said injuries; and there being no such evidence, the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.

Gas Co., 131 Pa. 143; Carlin v. Chappell, 101 Pa. 348.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AIdh\">January 6, 1896:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b461-6\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The subjects of complaint in the first three specifications of error, are the affirmance of plaintiff\u2019s requests for charge recited therein respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The testimony, properly before the jury, tended to prove the facts of which these three propositions are severally predicated, and, having been submitted to them in a clear, correct and comprehensive charge, their verdict necessarily implies a finding of said facts substantially as stated. As to the law involved in these propositions, it is scarcely necessary to say that it has been well settled in a line of cases, commencing with Jones v. Wagner, 66 Pa. 429, to which it is our purpose to adhere. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>that and other cases following in its wake, it has been uniformly held, that where there has been a separation of the coal from the surface, the owner of the latter, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, has an absolute right to have his surface supported precisely as it was in its natural state. If the owner of the coal undertakes to mine and remove it, \u2014 as he has an undoubted right to do, \u2014 and damage results to the surface, either (a) from negligence in conducting his mining operations, or (5) from failure to properly and sufficiently support the surface, or <em>(c) </em>from both these causes combined, the surface owner is entitled to recover compensation for such injury as he may show he has sustained: Jones v. Wagner, supra; Horner v. Watson, 79 Pa. 242; Coleman v. Chadwick, 80 Pa. 81; Carlin v. Chappel, 101 Pa. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In stating his claim plaintiff substantially avers that the injuries of which he complains were the result of two causes, negligent mining, and defendant\u2019s failure to provide proper surface support. It was competent for him to prove on the trial that said injuries resulted from both of these causes combined, or from either of them separately. An examination of the testimony shows that it tended to prove all the material averments contained in the statement. It involved questions of fact which were for the exclusive consideration of the jury, and to them it was fairly submitted with properly guarded and adequate instructions. There was no error in refusing to affirm either of defendant\u2019s points for charge recited in the remaining specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
