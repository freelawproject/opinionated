C. 406.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">Calling the petition for a new trial a bill of review does not entitle the petitioner to the relief he would have had if he had proceeded by the bill: Riddle\u2019s Est., 19 Pa. 431; Livingston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>v.

Rep. 566.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-3\">Aside from the fact that the court had no power to grant the rehearing, the proceedings were so irregular that the petition should be dismissed: Garver v.

Reynolds, 8 Watts, 424; Lacock v. White, 19 Pa. 495; Kelber v. Plow Co., 146 Pa. 485; Jenkintown Nat.

Bank of Titusville\u2019s App., 96 Pa. 460.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-4\">The inherent power and duty of a court of record to control, revise, modify, or overturn.its judgments and final decrees, upon proper cause shown, continues until the fund has passed from its grasp or control: Johnson\u2019s App., 114 Pa. 132; Evans v. Maury, 112 Pa. 300.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVv\">November 4, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-5\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">On July 7,1894, the rule theretofore granted on the plaintiffs to show cause why the judgment, as to the defendant Rosenblum, should not be opened and he let into a defense, etc., was discharged. Nearly two months thereafter Rosenblum presented his petition praying, for reasons set forth therein, that the said decree discharging the rule to show cause be set aside, that he be permitted to take further testimony in support of the original rule, and that, upon a rehearing, the judgment be opened, etc. Thereupon, September 3, 1894, a rule on the plaintiffs was granted to show cause why the prayers of the petitioner should not be granted; and the matter was so proceeded in that on March 4, 1895, the same was made absolute, the judgment opened, as to the defendant Rosenblum, and he was let into a defense. From that decree this appeal was taken by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">A careful consideration of the assignments of error, in connection with the testimony on which the court appears to have acted, has led us to the conclusion that there was no error in making the decree complained of. On the contrary it was warranted by the evidence. There is nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires special comment. The case appears to have been one calling for equitable relief and no rule of practice stood in the way of the court below to prevent appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
