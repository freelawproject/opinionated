State of Oregon, </em>341 Or 449, 143 P3d 772 (2006). Previously, we summarily affirmed the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief in which petitioner alleged that he was denied adequate assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to adequately advise him of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to a felony. <em>Ramirez v. State of Oregon, </em>192 Or App 362, 87 P3d 708 (2004). The Supreme Court allowed review, vacated our decision, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Lyons v. Pearce, </em>298 Or 554, 694 P2d 969 (1985), and <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>340 Or 452, 134 P3d 955 (2006). On remand, we affirm the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In his petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner alleged that he was denied adequate assistance of counsel under the Oregon and United States constitutions because trial counsel failed \u201cto inform [him] fully and adequately of the immigration consequences [of] a guilty plea to a felony Assault IV[.]\u201d Specifically, the petition alleged that trial counsel was inadequate for failing to inform petitioner that, as a consequence of his guilty plea, he was virtually certain to be deported, he would be barred from becoming a United States citizen, and he would be barred from reentering the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition also alleged that the trial court erred by accepting petitioner\u2019s plea that was rendered unknowing and involuntary, because the plea petition included \u201cfalse and misleading information as [the plea petition] stated it would be merely possible that Petitioner would be deported [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The post-conviction court concluded that petitioner had been denied adequate assistance of counsel, because trial counsel failed to adequately inform him of the immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>consequences of his plea. It reasoned that, because petitioner\u2019s deportation was virtually certain, trial counsel\u2019s advice to petitioner that he \u201cmay\u201d face immigration consequences was constitutionally inadequate. However, the court denied petitioner\u2019s request for relief. The post-conviction court concluded that petitioner failed to establish prejudice as a result of the inadequate assistance; specifically, it concluded that petitioner failed to show that he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial had he received adequate advice. Moreover, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s admonition to petitioner regarding the immigration and naturalization consequences of petitioner\u2019s guilty plea * * * was sufficient under the Oregon Constitution and the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">On appeal, petitioner argued that the post-conviction court erred by concluding that petitioner failed to establish prejudice and by concluding that the trial court properly advised him prior to accepting his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The post-conviction court anticipated our decision in <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>191 Or App 587, 83 P3d 921 (2004). There, we held that trial counsel\u2019s advice that entering a guilty plea <em>may </em>impact the petitioner\u2019s immigration status was constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel, where the petitioner, after pleading guilty to an aggravated felony, would be deported unless the Attorney General or a designee chose not to pursue deportation proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 594. The Supreme Court reversed, however. It explained that the Oregon Constitution requires counsel to advise a criminal defendant of the possible maximum and possible minimum penalties that the court may impose, but counsel is not required, as a matter of constitutionally adequate assistance, to advise a defendant of the likelihood that the court will impose either the maximum or minimum penalty. <em>Gonzalez, </em>340 Or at 459. The court noted that if the constitution does not require that level of specificity for the <em>direct </em>consequences of a criminal conviction, then there is no constitutional requirement for that level of specificity for a <em>collateral </em>consequence of a criminal conviction. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed our holding that trial counsel was inadequate for failing to advise the petitioner that it was virtually certain that the petitioner would be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Here, it is undisputed that trial counsel advised petitioner that, as a result of his guilty plea, he \u201cmay\u201d be deported. Petitioner signed a plea form that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">\u201cMy lawyer has explained to me and I understand that if I am not a citizen of the United States, my conviction of this crim[e may] have the following results:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201c(1) I may be deported from the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201c(2) If I leave the United States, I may be refused readmission to this Country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201c(3) If I apply to become a naturalized citizen of the United States, I may be denied that privilege because of my conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Although counsel did not advise petitioner that his deportation and other immigration consequences were virtually certain, under <em>Gonzalez, </em>trial counsel\u2019s advice was not constitutionally inadequate. The post-conviction court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\"> Finally, the post-conviction court did not err in concluding that the trial court \u201caccurately and sufficiently advised defendant of the immigration consequences of his plea.\u201d ORS 135.385(2)(d) requires that, before a court accepts a plea, it must inform noncitizen defendants that a \u201cconviction of a crime may result, under the laws of the United States, in deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States or denial of naturalization.\u201d That statute does not require the court to \u201caddress a defendant orally about the possibility of deportation\u201d as long as the court \u201csatisfies itself that a defendant has been so informed.\u201d <em>Lyons, </em>298 Or at 561. Here, the trial court satisfied itself that petitioner was informed about the possible Immigration consequences of his plea; petitioner affirmatively acknowledged to the court that he signed the plea petition and that he understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Petitioner\u2019s post-conviction petition alleged that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate under both the state and federal constitutions. On this record, we reject petitioner\u2019s arguments under the United States Constitution without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> The petition also contained a nearly identical allegation that trial counsel provided \u201cfalse and misleading advice to Petitioner by reviewing the plea petition with him, which advised him that it was merely possible that adverse immigration consequences would directly flow from his conviction[.]\u201d Because that allegation is similar to petitioner\u2019s first, we treat them as one allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
