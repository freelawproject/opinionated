She makes six assignments of error. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error. In her fourth and fifth assignments, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to merge her criminal mistreatment convictions with each other and the felony assault convictions into one conviction. The state concedes that the trial court erred in failing to merge the convictions. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>State v. Sanders, </em>185 Or App 125, 129, 57 P3d 963 (2002), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>189 Or App 107, 74 P3d 1105 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 657 (2004). It follows that the trial court was authorized to enter only one criminal mistreatment conviction and only one felony assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Because the trial court erred in failing to merge the convictions, we are required to remand the entire case for resentencing, ORS 138.222(5), and, therefore, we need not reach defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error regarding the denial of a jury trial on the grounds for an upward departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Reversed and remanded for resentencing and for entry of judgment merging counts 1 through 4 into single conviction for fourth-degree felony assault, specifying that defendant was found guilty both on the ground that she had been previously convicted of assaulting the same victim and on the ground that assault was committed in the immediate presence of and witnessed by defendant\u2019s minor child; merging count 5 with count 6 into single conviction for first-degree criminal mistreatment; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
