ORS 426.130. The trial court found that appellant suffers from a mental disorder, is dangerous to himself, and is unable to provide for his basic personal needs. A discussion of the facts would be of no benefit to the bench and bar. The state concedes that the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that defendant\u2019s mental illness causes him to be dangerous to himself or unable to provide for his basic personal needs. We find the state\u2019s concession to be well-founded and accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
