We reject without written discussion all but two of those assignments of error and, for the reasons that follow, reject the remaining two as well. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"> Defendant first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of a 1996 incident in which defendant allegedly threatened and attempted to assault both his mother and responding police officers. Defendant contends that, under the standards prescribed in <em>State v. Johns, </em>301 Or 535, 555-56, 725 P2d 312 (1986), that evidence was not admissible under OEC 404(3). A detailed description of the proffered evidence and of the circumstances of the crimes charged here would be of no benefit to the public or to the bench and bar. It suffices to say that we agree with defendant that evidence of the 1996 incident was not relevant to his alleged intentional mental state in engaging in the charged conduct here \u2014 and, particularly, that that evidence did not satisfy Johns\u2019s third (\u201csame class of victim\u201d) and fifth (similarity of \u201cphysical elements\u201d) requisites. Nevertheless, based on our review of the totality of the record \u2014 including defendant\u2019s admissions in this case, the discrepancies between his claim of \u201cno intent\u201d and the physical circumstances of his conduct, and evidence of other incidents in which defendant had assaulted a former girlfriend and then offered <em>post hoc </em>rationalization of those assaults \u2014 we determine that there is \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the erroneously admitted evidence \u201caffected the [jury\u2019s] verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 33, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Thus, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In a supplemental brief, defendant contends that the admission of portions of police officers\u2019 testimony pertaining to defendant\u2019s assaults on his former girlfriend, in which officers recounted that victim\u2019s statements, violated defendant\u2019s constitutional confrontation rights under the principles expressed in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004), which was decided nearly two years after the trial here. That contention was unpreserved; not surprisingly, the only objection raised below was a non-constitutional objection that that testimony was inadmissible hearsay. Even assuming, without deciding, that the admission of those portions of the officers\u2019 accounts was error apparent on the face of the record, ORAP 5.45(1), we decline to exercise our discretion to review and remedy such error, <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 823 P2d 956 (1991), for the reasons stated in <em>State v. Cox, </em>337 Or 477, 500, 98 P3d 1103 (2004), <em>cert den, </em>546 US 830 (2005), and <em>State v. Poitra, </em>206 Or App 207, 212-16, 136 P3d 87, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 245 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
