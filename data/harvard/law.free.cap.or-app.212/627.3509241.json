J.</author>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Claimant, who was injured when he fell while descending from a roof in Ohio, seeks review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (the board) that upheld the denial of his claim. ORS 656.298. The board determined that, although claimant was employed by an Oregon employer at the time of his injury, he was not an Oregon \u201csubject worker,\u201d ORS 656.005(28); ORS 656.027, because he worked permanently outside of Oregon. We review for substantial evidence and errors of law, ORS 183.482(8), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The following facts, as found by the administrative law judge (ALJ) and supplemented by the board, are supported by substantial evidence. Employer is an Oregon corporation with its headquarters in Eugene. At all material times, claimant lived in Michigan. In June 2000, or perhaps earlier, claimant began \u201ccourting\u201d employer to hire him for a sales position. In September 2000, claimant was hired over the telephone without ever coming to Oregon. In December 2000, claimant faxed an executed \u201cnoncompetition and nondisclosure agreement\u201d from Michigan to employer\u2019s office in Eugene.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Claimant continued living in Michigan and worked for employer from an office in his home. Initially, in 2001 and early 2002, claimant worked as a sales manager for employer in the northeastern United States. Sometime before June 4, 2002, employer promoted claimant to national sales manager. Claimant\u2019s job duties included traveling throughout the eastern and midwestem United States to meet with customers and other sales managers. In addition, claimant occasionally attended trade shows in various locations. Neither claimant nor employer intended claimant to perform work in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Claimant was paid by direct deposit from the Eugene office, and claimant also had group health insurance funded by employer. Employer withheld federal taxes and Michigan state taxes from claimant\u2019s paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Claimant had other periodic contact with, and oversight from, employer\u2019s Eugene office. For example, claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>submitted expense reports to the Eugene office. When claimant traveled, he made hotel reservations through employer\u2019s travel agent there. When claimant attended trade shows, he was often accompanied by sales managers from Eugene. However, claimant traveled to Oregon only twice on business during the two years he worked for employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">On June 4, 2002, while working in Ohio, claimant injured his shoulder as he was descending from a roof. At the time of claimant\u2019s injury, employer did not maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance in either Michigan or Ohio. In July 2002, claimant\u2019s employment with employer ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Claimant underwent surgery on his shoulder and filed applications for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in both Michigan and Oregon. The Michigan claim was dismissed after the parties stipulated that the Michigan Workers\u2019 Compensation Board lacked jurisdiction over claimant\u2019s claim. SAIF denied the Oregon claim after concluding that claimant was not an Oregon \u201csubject worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Claimant requested a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ, applying ORS 656.126(1) and the \u201cpermanent employment relation\u201d test, concluded that claimant was an Oregon \u201csubject worker,\u201d and, thus, set aside SAIF\u2019s denial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and reinstated SAIF\u2019s denial. The board concluded that neither ORS 656.126(1) nor the \u201cpermanent employment relation\u201d test applied to claimant because claimant was \u201cpermanently\u201d employed outside Oregon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">\u201cAt first glance, it appears that Oregon case law supports a general application of the \u2018permanent employment relation test\u2019 in all cases involving a worker employed by an Oregon employer who is injured outside Oregon and is injured incidental to that employment. However, it is apparent from a close review of relevant case law that in those earlier cases, there was no dispute that the claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>had in fact worked in Oregon before leaving Oregon; instead, the question was only whether the claimants\u2019 absence from Oregon was temporary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">\u201cIn this case, claimant and the employer both intended that claimant work out of Michigan. It logically follows then that he could not temporarily leave Oregon. In other words, the question of whether claimant <em>temporarily </em>left Oregon (i.e., the \u2018permanent employment relations\u2019 test) is based on a predicate fact that is absent from this record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">\u201cThus, claimant did not \u2018temporarily\u2019 leave the state, but rather was employed by an Oregon corporation to work permanently in another state. Under such circumstances, ORS 656.126(1) does not apply. To apply the permanent employment relation test without considering the plain language of ORS 656.126(1), would lead to absurd results. For example, a person living and working in India for an Oregon-based corporation, who was hired by the corporation but never lived or worked in Oregon, would be entitled to Oregon workers\u2019 compensation benefits if injured on the job in India.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">(Citations and footnotes omitted; emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">On judicial review, the sole, and dispositive, issue is whether claimant was an Oregon \u201csubject worker\u201d within the coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act). The parties agree that claimant\u2019s work assignment was \u201cpermanently,\u201d not \u201ctemporarily,\u201d outside of Oregon. However, they take antithetical positions as to the significance of that circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">For claimant, the fact that he was injured while he was employed permanently outside of Oregon is immaterial: So long as he was injured while working for an Oregon employer, he is a \u201csubject worker\u201d within the Act\u2019s coverage. In particular, claimant reasons that (a) subject to certain specified exceptions that are inapplicable here, all workers employed by Oregon employers are \u201csubject workers\u201d for purposes of the Act, <em>see </em>ORS 656.027 (\u201cAll workers are subject to this chapter except those nonsubject workers described in the following subsections [.]\u201d); (b) claimant was employed by an Oregon employer; therefore, (c) claimant was a covered \u201csubject employee.\u201d Claimant concludes: \u201cResidence in Oregon is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>not a condition for coverage and the Act does not exclude coverage for subject workers who work outside the state.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Conversely, for employer and SAIF, the fact that claimant was employed permanently outside of Oregon when he was injured is all-important, precluding coverage under the Act. In that regard, respondents point out \u2014 as the board emphasized \u2014 that, as a matter of statutory context, although ORS 656.126(1) provides for coverage for workers \u201cemployed in this state\u201d who are injured while \u201ctemporarily\u201d out of Oregon, nothing in the Act provides coverage for workers employed by Oregon employers who are injured while permanently working outside of Oregon. Further, respondents note, no reported decision applying the permanent employment relation test has ever extended coverage to a person employed by an Oregon employer to work permanently outside of Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We conclude that claimant was not a \u201csubject worker\u201d within the coverage of the Act. Specifically, we agree with the board that, notwithstanding the ostensible unqualified breadth of ORS 656.027, the totality of the statutory scheme \u2014 and ORS 656.126(1) particularly \u2014 conclusively establishes that persons who are employed to work permanently outside of Oregon are not covered under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">ORS 656.126(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201cIf a worker employed in this state and subject to this chapter <em>temporarily leaves the state </em>incidental to that employment and receives an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment, the worker * * * is entitled to the benefits of this chapter as though the worker were injured within this state.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Here, claimant acknowledges that his circumstances do not fall within the terms of that statute; specifically, claimant concedes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">\u201c[I]t is true that claimant was not \u2018temporarily\u2019 outside the state of Oregon because he was hired without being physically present in the state and because the nature of his employment as a regional sales manager for his Oregon employer required him to work in the eastern parts of the United States [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Nevertheless, claimant insists that he is entitled to coverage because, in his view, the Act requires Oregon employers to provide coverage for all of their employees, regardless of the location of their work, and because \u201cORS 656.126 has limited, rather than unlimited, application to workers employed outside the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We disagree. ORS 656.126(1) conclusively contradicts claimant\u2019s baseline argument that the location of work is immaterial to coverage under the Act. If claimant were correct, ORS 656.126(1) would be not only superfluous or gratuitous but, even more, implicitly misleading. If the location of work were immaterial, so long as the injured worker was employed by an Oregon employer, then there would there be no need for ORS 656.126(1), much less for the further qualification regarding the employee being \u201ctemporarily\u201d outside of Oregon. Indeed, if claimant were correct, the development of the permanent employment relation test (which we discuss below) in applying ORS 656.126(1) would have been not merely academic, but \u2014 in cases in which we held that there was no coverage under ORS 656.126(1) \u2014 erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Like the board, we decline to treat ORS 656.126(1) as nugatory. Indeed, we are precluded from doing so. <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (in construing statutes, courts are obligated to \u201cif possible * * * give effect to all\u201d provisions); <em>see also State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 418, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) (explaining relationship between ORS 174.010 and contextual analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Rather, the necessary implication and effect of ORS 656.126(1) is that the location of work <em>(viz., </em>outside of Oregon) and the term/duration (\u201ctemporary\u201d versus \u201cpermanent\u201d) of such work are not only material to, but dispositive of, coverage under the Act. To wit: (1) Subject to certain exceptions, <em>e.g., </em>ORS 656.126(2), the Act requires coverage for employees who are injured while working in Oregon. (2) The Act requires coverage, under ORS 656.126(1), for workers who (a) are injured while working \u201ctemporarily\u201d outside of Oregon and (b) whose employment by an Oregon employer meets the permanent employment relation test. (3) By necessary negative implication, the Act does not provide coverage with respect to employees of Oregon employers who are injured while working <em>permanently </em>outside of Oregon. Again, if the Act covered workers in the third group, that would render the \u201ctemporarily\u2019 qualification of ORS 656.126(1) gratuitous because, under such a construction, it would be immaterial whether the injured worker was outside of Oregon \u201ctemporarily\u2019 or \u201cpermanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In sum, the Act\u2019s coverage does not extend to employees of Oregon employers who are injured while working permanently outside of Oregon. Still, claimant alternatively asserts that he is entitled to coverage under a proper application of the permanent employment relation test. In <em>Berkey v. Dept. of Ins. and Finance, </em>129 Or App 494, 498, 879 P2d 240 (1994), we summarized the factors that are material to that inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201c(1) the intent of the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">\u201c(2) the understanding of the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">\u201c(3) the location of the employer and its facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">\u201c(4) the circumstances surrounding the work assignment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u201c(5) the state laws and regulations to which the employer is subject; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201c(6) the residence of the employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We developed, and have applied, the permanent employment relation test solely in the context of disputes over coverage under ORS 656.126, beginning with <em>Kolar v. B &amp; C Contractors, </em>36 Or App 65, 583 P2d 562 (1978). <em>See, e.g., Quinton v. LT&amp;L Logging, Inc., </em>146 Or App 344, 932 P2d 105 (1997) (concluding that, under ORS 656.126(1), the employee was not a subject worker); <em>Northwest Greentree, Inc. v. Cervantes-Ochoa, </em>113 Or App 186, 830 P2d 627 (1992) (concluding that, under ORS 656.126(1), the employee was a subject worker); <em>Power Master, Inc. v. Blanchard, </em>103 Or App 467, 798 P2d 691 (1990) (same); <em>see also Phelan v. H.S.C. Logging, Inc., </em>84 Or App 632, 735 P2d 22, <em>rev den, </em>303 Or 590 (1987) (concluding that the employee was not a subject worker in the context of an ORS 656.126(2) dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Claimant\u2019s alternative argument fails for either of two reasons. <em>First, </em>the permanent employment relation test applies only to determining coverage under ORS 656.126. <em>See, e.g., Quinton, </em>146 Or App at 347 (\u201cIn determining whether claimant\u2019s work outside the state is temporary, the correct standard is the permanent employment relation test.\u201d); <em>SAIF v. Moe, </em>142 Or App 62, 67, 919 P2d 533 (1996) (\u201c[T]he key inquiry under ORS 656.126(1) is \u2018the extent to which the claimant\u2019s work outside the state is temporary.\u2019 To determine whether a worker has temporarily left Oregon incidental to Oregon employment, we apply the \u2018permanent employment relation test.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)). We have never employed that analysis more generally under the Act. Here, as noted, claimant acknowledges that ORS 656.126(1) does not apply to him because, at the time of his injury, he had not \u201ctemporarily\u201d left Oregon \u2014 instead, he was working permanently outside of Oregon. Consequently, this case does not present the necessary predicate for employing the permanent employment relation test.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\"><em>Second, </em>even if that test were somehow otherwise apposite, claimant does not dispute that the parties both understood, over the entire course of his employment, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>would be working outside of Oregon, without any contemplation that at some time in the future claimant would be relocated to Oregon to perform work within this state. <em>Compare Quinton, </em>146 Or App at 347-48 (no expectation that the employee would return to Oregon), <em>with Moe, </em>142 Or App at 67-68 (both the employer and the employee contemplated the employee\u2019s return to Oregon). Consequently, the <em>sine qua non </em>of the permanent employment relation test was not satisfied here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> As explained more fully below, ORS 656.126(1) provides that a worker who \u201ctemporarily leaves the state\u201d incident to his employment retains coverage while absent. The \u201cpermanent employment relation\u201d test establishes factors designed to determine \u201cthe extent to which the claimant\u2019s work outside the state is temporary.\u201d <em>Northwest Greentree, Inc. v. Cervantes-Ochoa, </em>113 Or App 186, 189, 830 P2d 627 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\"> Claimant also argues, alternatively, that even if some out-of-state workers of Oregon employers might not be \u201csubject workers,\u201d in the circumstances presented here and under a proper application of the permanent employment relation test, claimant is, nevertheless, entitled to coverage as a \u201csubject worker.\u201d We address, and reject, that contention below. <em>See </em>212 Or App at 634-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> OES 656.126(2) addresses the obverse circumstance, <em>viz., </em>when a \u201cworker from another state\u201d is \u201ctemporarily within this state doing work\u201d for his or her employer. That provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">\u201cAny worker from another state and the employer of the worker in that other state are exempted from the provisions of this chapter while that worker is temporarily within this state doing work for the employer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u201c(a) If that employer has furnished workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage under the workers\u2019 compensation insurance or similar laws of a state other than Oregon so as to cover that worker\u2019s employment while in this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201c(b) If the extraterritorial provisions of this chapter are recognized in that other state; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201c(c) If employers and workers who are covered in this state are likewise exempted from the application of the workers\u2019 compensation insurance or similar laws of the other state.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\"> <em>See, e.g., Quinton v.
