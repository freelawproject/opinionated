J.</author>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the issue is whether defendant\u2019s operation of a coffee \u201ccart\u201d violates a deed restriction that prohibits building a \u201cbuilding\u201d on the property on which the cart is located and that requires the property to be used as a parking lot. The trial court concluded that the operation of the coffee cart does violate the deed restriction. One of the defendants appeals, arguing that the trial court should have construed the deed restriction narrowly in favor of the free use of the property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. The McKay family owned two parcels of commercial property located in Florence. On one parcel, the family operated McKay\u2019s Market. The adjacent parcel consisted of a parking lot that was located in front of an auto parts store that was owned by the Picketts.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In 1979, the McKays sold the parking lot property to the Picketts, who wanted to use the lot to provide parking for their auto parts store. The parties, however, agreed to a restriction concerning the use of the parking lot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">\u201cRESTRICTION: The GRANTEES herein, their heirs and assigns agree not to build any building on said property, with the possible exception of an extension of the existing building of Florence Auto Parts \u2014 east to a point no closer than 87 feet from the Northeast corner of Lot 8 and no closer than 50 feet from the Southeast corner of Lot 10. The remaining portion of said described property will remain as a parking lot and McKAY GROCERY CO. will have right of ingress and egress on said parking lot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">In 2004, defendant JF\u2019S Investments (defendant) entered into a lease/purchase agreement of the Picketts\u2019 store and the parking lot. Defendant was aware of the deed restriction before closing. Defendant purchased a prefabricated structure from which to sell coffee. The structure is variously labeled by the parties a \u201ccart,\u201d a \u201chut,\u201d a \u201ctrailer,\u201d a \u201cshack,\u201d and a \u201cbuilding.\u201d Whatever the appropriate label \u2014 we have somewhat arbitrarily employed the term \u201ccart\u201d \u2014 the structure measures eight feet by 12 feet and consists of four walls, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>windows, and a pitched roof, all constructed on a trailer chassis. Defendant towed the cart into place on the parking lot and then removed its wheels. Defendant did not ask permission from the McKays to operate the business on the parking lot. Defendant removed a portion of the asphalt covering the parking lot near the cart in order to install water, sewer, and electrical lines and also installed curbing and landscaping. Defendant connected the cart to the utility lines and then recovered the parking lot surface. The cart itself occupied two parking spaces. And, when the business was operating, lines of waiting cars occupied between one and four additional spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">A dispute later arose about whether defendant lawfully could operate the business on the parking lot. Plaintiff McKay\u2019s Market ultimately initiated this action, seeking a declaration that defendant\u2019s coffee cart violated the restrictions in the deed that prohibited building any buildings on the property and that required the property to be used as a parking lot. Defendant contended that the operation of the coffee cart did not violate the restriction, because defendant had not \u201cbuil[t]\u201d the cart and because the cart did not constitute a \u201cbuilding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The trial court concluded that the operation of the coffee cart violated the deed restriction in two independent respects. First, the court concluded that the operation of the cart ran afoul of the prohibition on \u201cbuild [ing] any building.\u201d The court reasoned that the wording of the restriction was ambiguous in that it reasonably could have been intended to embrace small structures like defendant\u2019s coffee cart or could have been intended to be more narrowly focused on larger, permanent structures. The court turned to extrinsic evidence of the intentions of the McKays and the Picketts in negotiating the deed restriction and, on the basis of that evidence, resolved the ambiguity in favor of the McKays. According to the court, the parties who negotiated the deed restriction plainly intended that structures like defendant\u2019s coffee cart not be permitted on the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Second, the court concluded that defendant\u2019s operation of the coffee cart ran afoul of the independent restriction that, with the exception of a limited extension of the auto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>parts building, \u201c[t]he remaining portion\u201d of the property \u201cwill remain as a parking lot.\u201d The court found that \u201cthe parking lot is not just being used and remaining as a parking lot with this structure because it is used as a place of business for another business\u201d on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in arriving at both conclusions, although its brief is devoted almost exclusively to the court\u2019s first conclusion\u2014 that the operation of the cart violated the restriction against \u201cbuild[ing] any building.\u201d As to that conclusion, defendant contends that the court erred in considering extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions at all, because the restriction that defendant not \u201cbuild any buildings\u201d unambiguously has no application to defendant\u2019s operation of a coffee cart. Even if the restriction is ambiguous in that regard, defendant argues, the court erred in considering the particular kind of extrinsic evidence that plaintiff offered in this case, because that evidence amounted to nothing more than the subjective understandings of the parties to the original deed restrictions. In defendant\u2019s view, such evidence \u2014 while perhaps properly considered in the context of other contractual disputes \u2014 may not be considered when the dispute concerns the meaning of a deed restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">As to the trial court\u2019s second conclusion, defendant briefly argues that the court erred in concluding that the operation of the coffee cart violated the restriction that the property be used as a parking lot, because the property remains \u201cprimarily a parking lot, with parking spaces and travel lanes.\u201d According to defendant, nothing in the wording of the restriction requires that the parking lot be used <em>exclusively </em>as a parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">For defendant to prevail on appeal, it must persuade us that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant violated the deed restriction in both respects. Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant\u2019s operation of the coffee cart violated the requirement that the parking lot remain a parking lot, we need not address defendant\u2019s other contentions about whether the court also erred in concluding that operating the cart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>amounted to building a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of the deed restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The applicable legal principles are familiar. When we interpret any written instrument, our objective is to ascertain the meaning that most likely was intended by the parties that entered into it. ORS 42.240 (\u201cIn the construction of an instrument the intention of the parties is to be pursued if possible [.]\u201d). That objective applies to the interpretation of contracts, including deed restrictions. <em>Yogman v. Parrott, </em>325 Or 358, 364, 937 P2d 1019 (1997) (citing ORS 42.240). We ascertain the meaning most likely intended by the parties by means of a three-step inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 361-63. We begin with the text of the disputed provision in the context of the instrument as a whole. <em>Id. </em>In examining the text of the disputed provision we determine whether that provision is ambiguous, for, if the provision is unambiguous, we enforce the provision according to its terms as a matter of law. <em>Eagle Industries, Inc. v. Thompson, </em>321 Or 398, 405, 900 P2d 475 (1995). A contractual provision is \u201cambiguous\u201d only if it is capable of more than one plausible and reasonable interpretation. <em>Batzer Construction, Inc. v. Boyer, </em>204 Or App 309, 313, 129 P3d 773, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 366 (2006). If the disputed provision is ambiguous, we proceed to a second step that involves examining extrinsic evidence of the contracting parties\u2019 intent. <em>Yogman, </em>325 Or at 363. If resort to such extrinsic evidence does not resolve the ambiguity, then we proceed to a third and final step, namely, resort to \u201cappropriate maxims of construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In this case, we conclude that the parties\u2019 dispute may be resolved at the first level of analysis. The deed restriction prohibits building any building on the property \u201cwith the possible exception of an extension of the existing building of Florence Auto Parts.\u201d The restriction then proceeds to describe precisely \u2014 in terms of feet from the lot boundaries\u2014 how far that exception extends. In the very next sentence, the restriction continues, \u201cThe remaining portion of said described property will remain as a parking lot[.]\u201d It is clear \u2014 defendant expressly concedes the point \u2014 that \u201cthe remaining portion\u201d refers to the portion of the property that is not covered by the exception for extending the building. Thus, the restriction plainly requires that the portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>property that is not covered by the exception for extending the existing auto parts building \u201cwill remain as a parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">It is also clear that, with the operation of defendant\u2019s coffee cart, the remaining property does not \u201cremain as a parking lot.\u201d Defendant dug up portions of the parking lot, installed utilities, and moved onto the parking lot a structure that takes up two parking spaces, along with installing curbs and landscaping. The operation of the business further takes up between one and four additional parking spaces as customers wait in line to purchase drinks from the cart. In no ordinary sense does the \u201cremaining portion\u201d of the property \u201cremain a parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Defendant\u2019s only argument to the contrary is that, even though its activities necessarily require portions of the parking lot to be devoted to other activities, the property remains \u201cprimarily\u201d devoted to parking. The deed restriction, however, does not require that the remaining part continue to be devoted \u201cprimarily\u201d to parking. It requires that the \u201cremaining portion of said described property\u201d \u2014 that is, everything not subject to the exception for extending the existing auto parts building \u2014 \u201cremain as a parking lot.\u201d We are not permitted to add qualifications to contractual provisions that the parties did not include. ORS 42.230 (\u201cIn the construction of an instrument, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted [.]\u201d); <em>Holloway v. Republic Indemnity Co. of America, </em>341 Or 642, 651-52, 147 P3d 329 (2006) (citing ORS 42.230).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that defendant\u2019s operation of its coffee cart violated the restriction in the deed that required the premises to remain a parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
