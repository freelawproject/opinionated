Thompson, </em>211 Or App 390, 155 P3d 53 (2007), in which, on remand from the Supreme Court, we held that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s advice was not constitutionally inadequate under <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>340 Or 452, 134 P3d 955 (2006). In his petition for reconsideration, petitioner contends that we erred by not considering his federal constitutional claim. After a careful reexamination of the record, we agree with petitioner and therefore allow his petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">However, on this record, we disagree with petitioner that the federal constitution commands a different result. In his petition for reconsideration, petitioner focuses on the following statement in our original opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">\u201cHere, it is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel told him that he could be deported as a result of his plea. That petitioner was virtually certain to be deported \u2014 and would not get the hearing to contest his deportation that counsel also told him that he would have \u2014 does not render counsel\u2019s advice constitutionally inadequate under <em>Gonzalez.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">According to petitioner, this statement constitutes a \u201crecognition\u201d by this court that petitioner was affirmatively misadvised by his trial counsel of the immigration consequences of his conviction and, therefore, that counsel\u2019s advice was ineffective under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>In its order granting relief, the post-conviction court concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">\u201cBy the time [petitioner] pled guilty * * * the charges to which he pled were aggravated felonies, which carry automatic removal (deportation). He did not have the right to hearing, he did not have any legal avenue to avoid deportation. Under [this court\u2019s opinion in] <em>Gonzalez v. State, </em>he should have been advised that he would automatically be deported.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">(Emphasis in original.) Our statement \u2014 that petitioner \u201cwould not get the hearing to contest his deportation that counsel also told him that he would have\u201d \u2014 mischaracterizes that ruling, as well as the evidence in the record, and we withdraw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In his affidavit, defense counsel testified that he did not \u201cexplain the intricacies of a deportation hearing or the results of any deportation hearing * * He also told petitioner that those details were beyond his area of expertise. Petitioner\u2019s own testimony before the post-conviction court reflects that he <em>did </em>have a deportation hearing. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s advice was not erroneous. We conclude that defense counsel\u2019s representation did not fall below the \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d necessary to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 688, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> In his second amended petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner alleged that he was denied effective and adequate assistance of trial counsel under both the United States and Oregon constitutions because, among other things, his trial counsel provided \u201cfalse and affirmatively misleading)\u2019 advice by telling him that he \u201cmay\u201d be deported when \u201cas a required matter of immigration law the direct consequences\u201d of his conviction was \u201ceternal banishment, eternal denial of naturalization, and permanent exclusion from the United States.\u201d Although he presented no separate argument under the federal constitution, the trial court granted petitioner\u2019s post-conviction relief petition \u201cbased upon <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>191 Or App 587[, 83 P3d 921] (2004), <em>[rev\u2019d, </em>340 Or 452, 134 P3d 955 (2006),] Article 1, \u00a7 11 of the Oregon Constitution, and the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States[.]\u201d It is thus necessary for us to address petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
