He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission into evidence of hearsay statements made by the three-year-old victim to her mother. He also asserts that the trial court committed plain error in admitting evidence of statements that the victim made to a doctor, in violation of defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. Finally, he argues that the trial court violated his right to a jury trial by sentencing him under Measure 11 rather than under the sentencing guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are undisputed. The material facts pertain primarily to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, in which he challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>made by the state. The state correctly anticipated that the court would later rule that G, the victim of defendant\u2019s offenses, was not competent to testify at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It therefore made a motion <em>in limine </em>to determine whether her mother could testify about statements that G had made to her concerning the abuse. Because the facts of the case are primarily relevant to that motion, except where noted, we draw the facts from the record of that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">At the time of the offenses for which defendant was convicted, G and mother lived in a trailer park in Sweet Home. G was three years old. G\u2019s great-grandmother lived in a trailer a few spaces away. Defendant, who lived in Lafayette, is great-grandmother\u2019s son and G\u2019s great-uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">At the hearing on the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>mother testified to the facts that follow. Sometime in September, October, or November of 2000, G spent a night with great-grandmother in her home. When mother picked G up the next morning at about 8:30, defendant was there. Mother testified that, sometime between a week and a month later, G spent the night with mother\u2019s aunt. She complained to mother\u2019s aunt that urinating was painful, and mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>aunt told mother about the complaint when she picked G up the next day. Mother, who had herself been sexually abused as a child, became concerned that G had been abused. Later that evening, mother took G to the grocery store. As they walked from the parking lot to the store, using a tone she described as \u201cfriendly\u2019 and \u201cplayful,\u201d she asked G, \u201c[H]as anybody ever touched you in your private parts?\u201d G said, \u201cYes.\u201d Mother asked her, \u201cWell, now who would do a thing like that?\u201d G responded, \u201cMy Uncle Bob,\u201d referring to defendant. Mother asked her where he had touched her, and G pointed to her genital area. Mother then asked her where the touching had happened, and G told her that it had happened at great-grandmother\u2019s home. Mother decided to make a doctor\u2019s appointment to have G examined, and she asked her no further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">According to mother\u2019s testimony, around the same time, some of G\u2019s behavior changed. Mother testified that, in addition to complaining that it hurt to go to the bathroom, \u201cshe didn\u2019t want anyone to wipe her, and she very seldom would wipe herself.\u201d According to mother, G had not previously had any trouble wiping herself and had been comfortable with allowing adults to do it for her. Mother testified that G also became uncomfortable with changing her clothes with anyone around, which had not previously been the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Mother also testified that G would no longer go to the bathroom by herself. A day or two after G told mother that defendant had abused her, mother and G were at great-grandmother\u2019s home when G had to use the bathroom. She would not go by herself, so mother accompanied her. As they walked down the hall toward the bathroom, they passed great-grandmother\u2019s guest bedroom. According to mother, G stopped and, without any prompting, said, \u201cThis is where Uncle Bob was touching me. He had me on the bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">At the hearing on the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>the state also called Dr. Chervenak, a doctor at a child victim assessment center, as a witness. She testified that she examined G on November 22,2000. Chervenak testified that, after giving G a physical examination, she excused mother and a nurse from the room and interviewed G privately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201cMy routine at that point is to remind them that I\u2019m a doctor. And so I say, \u2018I\u2019m a doctor and I see lots and lots of kids that have been hurt or touched in ways they didn\u2019t like.\u2019 And I pause. And I say, \u2018Did that ever happen to you?\u2019 And then I write down what they answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">\u201cQ: You said those things to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201cA: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201cQ: What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201cA: She said, Yes.\u2019 And I said to her, \u2018Can you tell me more about that?\u2019 And when she\u2019s saying this part, she says yes, she\u2019s looking down at the floor. And I said, \u2018Can you tell me more about that?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Uncle Bob.\u2019 And then she looked up and she looked right at me and she said, \u2018He was naked. He did not have clothes on.\u2019 And she was very\u2014 she had kind of a serious expression on her face when she said that. And I asked her to tell me more about \u2014 I said, \u2018Can you tell me more about that?\u2019 And she said, \u2018His knot was moving around a lot.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">\u201cAnd I happened to have a \u2014 I have a lot of stuffed animals in the room- \u2014 and I had a stuffed bear sitting next to me, and I picked up the stuffed bear, it\u2019s about this big, and I said, \u2018Can you point to the bear, where is this knot? Where would the knot be on this bear?\u2019 And she pointed at the crotch of the bear, where the genital area would be located. And I asked [G], \u2018Where did Uncle Bob touch you?\u2019 And she said, \u2018In his house.\u2019 And then I asked her, \u2018Where on your body did Uncle Bob touch you?\u2019 And she looked at me and pointed to her genitalia and she said, \u2018He touched me right here.\u2019 And she said that with \u2014 it was sort of emphatic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Chervenak testified that G indicated that defendant had touched her genitalia with his hands and with his penis. The doctor asked \u201cif anything had touched her mouth * * *.\u201d She testified that G told her, \u2018Yes. I was choking real bad.\u201d When Chervenak asked G what had touched her mouth, G replied, \u201cHis knot.\u201d According to Chervenak, G then spontaneously said, \u201cI told him to stop.\u201d She next testified that she asked G whether defendant had said anything when that was happening and G \u201csaid he went, \u2018Okay, okay, okay,\u2019 and she put her two hands up like this.\u201d G also told her that she was crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The trial court ruled that G\u2019s hearsay statements to mother were admissible under OEC 803(18a)(b). At defendant\u2019s trial, as the state had anticipated, the court ruled that G was unavailable as a witness because she was not competent to testify. Thus, mother testified about the statements that G made at the grocery store and at great-grandmother\u2019s home. The state also called Chervenak to testify. Among other things, she testified about the statements that G made to her. Defendant did not object to that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">At the close of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of both first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual abuse. The trial court imposed mandatory minimum sentences pursuant to ORS 137.700. It sentenced defendant to 75 months in prison, with 10 years\u2019 post-prison supervision, on the sexual abuse conviction and 100 months in prison, with 20 years\u2019 post-prison supervision, on the sodomy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On appeal, defendant makes three assignments of error. In the first, he challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling on the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>He argues that the court erred in concluding that the state had satisfied the requirements of OEC 803(18a)(b). In particular, he contends (1) that the state did not establish that the time, content, and circumstances of G\u2019s statements provided adequate indicia of reliability, (2) that her statements did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy constitutional concerns, and (3) that the state did not offer sufficient corroborative evidence that the abuse occurred or that defendant had an opportunity to engage in the abuse. We write only to address defendant\u2019s argument concerning corroborative evidence of his opportunity to engage in the abuse; we reject his other arguments without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">OEC 803(18a)(b) provides, in part, that a statement made by a person concerning an act of abuse is not excluded as hearsay under certain circumstances. If the declarant was under 12 years of age when the statement was made and is unavailable to testify at trial,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">\u201cthe statement may be admitted in evidence only if the proponent establishes that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide indicia of reliability, and in a criminal trial that there is corroborative evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>act of abuse and of the alleged perpetrator\u2019s opportunity to participate in the conduct and that the statement possesses indicia of reliability as is constitutionally required to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><em>Id. </em>Defendant argues that there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant had the opportunity to commit the acts that G alleged. Specifically, he asserts that there was no evidence that he was ever alone with G, much less evidence that he was alone with her for such a time that he could commit the charged acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Defendant reads too much into the requirement for corroborative evidence of the opportunity to participate in the alleged conduct. OEC 803(18a)(b) does not require <em>dis-positive proof </em>of such an opportunity; it requires only <em>evidence </em>of an opportunity. In <em>State v. Reed, </em>173 Or App 185, 194, 21 P3d 137 (2001), we explained that corroborative evidence is independent evidence that tends to strengthen, confirm, or make more certain the matter in support of which it is offered. Mother\u2019s testimony that defendant was at great-grandmother\u2019s home when she picked G up supports and strengthens the conclusion that defendant had an opportunity to abuse G. Evidence that defendant was alone with G for a period of time would certainly constitute stronger corroboration, but it is not required in order to satisfy OEC 803(18a)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Because there is evidence in the record that supports the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant had the opportunity to participate in the conduct for which he was convicted, we are bound by that finding. <em>See State v. Arellano, </em>149 Or App 86, 90, 941 P2d 1089 (1997), <em>rev dismissed, </em>327 Or 555 (1998) (if evidence in the record supports a trial court\u2019s findings on preliminary evidentiary matters, those findings are binding on appeal); <em>State v. Renly, </em>111 Or App 453, 468 n 12, 827 P2d 1345 (1992) (\u201cWhether evidence corroborates an act of sexual conduct and defendant\u2019s participation is a preliminary question of fact, because it concerns the admissibility of evidence.\u201d). We therefore reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting Chervenak\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>about G\u2019s statements. He does not challenge the testimony on hearsay grounds; rather, he asserts that its admission violated his right under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the admission of the doctor\u2019s testimony at trial, but he contends that we should review it as plain error. In response, the state argues, among other things, that a reasonable dispute exists about whether G\u2019s statements to Chervenak were \u201ctestimonial\u201d under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">We agree with the state. We will review an unpreserved error of law only if the question of law at issue is obvious \u2014 that is, not reasonably in dispute. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that the confrontation right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment requires that \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay of an unavailable declarant is not admissible unless the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. 541 US at 68. The Court declined to explain what \u201ctestimonial\u201d means, beyond concluding that statements elicited during police interrogation qualify. However, in <em>Davis v. </em>Washington,_US_, 126 S Ct 2266, 165 L Ed 2d 224 (2006), the Court refined the distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay. It explained that, where the circumstances show that the primary purpose of the statements was not to assist the police in investigating a crime, but rather to \u201cenable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\u201d the statements are not testimonial__US at_, 126 S Ct at 2273.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In this case, a reasonable dispute exists as to whether G\u2019s statements were made primarily for purposes of diagnosis and treatment rather than to assist in a police investigation. There were no police officers present when Chervenak interviewed G, and there is no indication in the record that Chervenak conducted the interview specifically for use in later criminal proceedings or was otherwise acting as an agent or proxy for the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">This is not a case like <em>State v. Pitt (A120428), </em>209 Or App 270, 147 P3d 940 (2006), in which we held that the trial court committed plain error in admitting into evidence two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>interviews with child victims that were videotaped at a child advocacy center. There, the record indicated that the center operated in partnership with the district attorney\u2019s office, provided a number of services related to child abuse investigation, housed a grand jury, and did not offer mental health treatment. It further indicated that the interviews were videotaped by a police officer with the intent that the tapes would be turned over to law enforcement or Child Protective Services. <em>Id. </em>at 273. We concluded that the interviews were \u201cconducted for the express purpose of furthering a police investigation, with a police officer recording them and with the interviewer explicitly attempting to solicit information from the children that would be useful for [the] defendant\u2019s prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279. We therefore held that the children\u2019s videotaped statements were \u201cunquestionably testimonial, because their primary purpose was to \u2018establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Davis,_US at_, 126 S Ct at 2273). <em>See also State v. Mack, </em>337 Or 586, 593, 101 P3d 349 (2004) (statements were testimonial given that they were made to a DHS worker who took over a police interview when the interviewing officer was unable to establish dialogue with the victim and who elicited statements so that the police could videotape them for use in a criminal proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Because the record before us does not reflect facts such as those that were established in <em>Pitt, </em>we cannot conclude that it is beyond dispute that G\u2019s statements to Chervenak were testimonial. In short, G\u2019s statements to Chervenak are arguably akin to the statements in <em>Davis </em>that were made primarily for a purpose other than to assist in a police investigation. It follows that admission of the statements into evidence was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In his third assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court violated his right to a jury trial by sentencing him under Measure 11<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than under the sentencing guidelines. We reject that assignment of error without discussion. The trial court did not err in imposing sentence as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> To protect the victim\u2019s privacy, we refer to her as \u201cG\u201d and to her mother as \u201cmother.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\"> Measure 11 is codified at ORS 137.700 to 137.707.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
