J.</author>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Claimant seeks review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board reversing an order of an administrative law judge (ALJ) and upholding employer\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s occupational disease claim for an employment-related condition known as \u201cpleural plaques.\u201d We affirm the board\u2019s order holding that claimant has not established an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The facts are undisputed. Claimant has noncompensable, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, related to cigarette smoking. Because a chest x-ray showed pleural plaques, an asbestos-related condition, claimant was referred to Dr. Dorsett Smith for an asbestos evaluation. Smith reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cThe patient had a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, which revealed multiple, typical bilateral asbestos-related pleural plaques. There was one calcification in the coronary artery and a few calcifications in the aorta noted. The patient did not have any mass lesions consistent with lung cancer or evidence of a mesothelioma. I did not see significant diffuse pleural disease. The patient did not have evidence of asbestosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Smith stated that he did not find any evidence of impairment related to claimant\u2019s asbestos exposure, but recommended that claimant \u201cremain under surveillance related to his prior asbestos exposure.\u201d Other physicians concurred in that diagnosis and the recommendation for chest x-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Claimant sought benefits for an occupational disease claim for asbestosis and/or pleural plaques, and employer denied both conditions. Claimant requested a hearing. In the absence of evidence that claimant suffers from asbestosis, the ALJ upheld employer\u2019s denial of that condition. However, the ALJ held that claimant\u2019s pleural plaques, which the parties agree are caused by claimant\u2019s work exposure to asbestos, constitute a compensable occupational disease. On employer\u2019s appeal, the board reversed the ALJ, holding that, because the pleural plaques do not require medical treatment and do not cause any impairment of function or interrupt or modify any of claimant\u2019s vital functions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>claimant has not established the existence of a \u201cdisease\u201d under ORS 656.802(l)(a). On claimant\u2019s petition, we conclude that the board\u2019s finding that claimant does not have a \u201cdisease\u201d is supported by substantial evidence and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">As pertinent here, ORS 656.802(l)(a) defines an occupational disease as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201cany disease or infection arising out of and in the course of employment caused by substances or activities to which an employee is not ordinarily subjected or exposed other than during a period of regular actual employment therein, and <em>which requires medical services or results in disability </em>or death [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">(Emphasis added.) Further, ORS 656.802(2)(d) requires that the \u201c[e]xistence of an occupational disease * * * be established by medical evidence supported by objective findings.\u201d It is undisputed that claimant has pleural plaques that were caused by his exposure to asbestos at work. The points in contention are whether that condition is a \u201cdisease\u201d and, if so, whether the disease requires \u201cmedical services.\u201d One physician referred to claimant\u2019s condition as a \u201cdisease.\u201d However, the consensus medical opinion is that claimant\u2019s pleural plaques are benign and asymptomatic and do not cause any impairment of claimant\u2019s breathing, but that they are a sign that he is at higher than normal risk for developing adverse asbestos-related conditions, including cancer. The unanimous recommendation is that, although claimant does not currently require medical treatment, he should be monitored with annual chest x-rays. In claimant\u2019s view, that condition is a \u201cdisease,\u201d and the required chest x-rays are \u201cmedical services,\u201d within the meaning of ORS 656.802. Employer agrees with the board that, in the absence of some impairment of claimant\u2019s vital functions, there is no disease, per <em>se. </em>Because w\u00e9 agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that claimant does not currently suffer from a disease, we do not address whether the recommended x-ray monitoring for the progression of claimant\u2019s condition is a \u201crequired medical service! ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> In <em>Mathel v. Josephine County, </em>319 Or 235, 875 P2d 455 (1994), the court considered whether a heart attack caused by on-the-job stress was an injury or a disease. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>court noted that there is no statutory definition of the term \u201cdisease\u201d and therefore referred to the dictionary to determine its meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">\u201cThe ordinary meaning of the term \u2018disease\u2019 is \u2018an impairment of the normal state of the * * * body; \u2018sickness, illness.\u2019 <em>[Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>648 (unabridged ed 1993)]. \u2018Sickness\u2019 is defined in part as \u2018the condition of being ill.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 2111. \u2018Illness\u2019 is defined in part as \u2018an unhealthy condition of the body or mind.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1127.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><em>Mathel, </em>319 Or at 240. The court\u2019s construction of the statute becomes part of the statute itself. <em>Stephens v. Bohlman, </em>314 Or 344, 350 n 6, 838 P2d 600 (1992); <em>accord Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Woda, </em>166 Or App 73, 81, 998 P2d 226, <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 361 (2000). Thus, a disease requires some \u201cimpairment of the normal state of the body\u2019 or a condition of \u201cillness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The board found that \u201cit is clear from the medical evidence as a whole that the condition has not resulted in any impairment of function\u201d and found on that basis that the record does not establish the presence of a disease. The board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Compare Johnsen v. Hamilton Electric, </em>90 Or App 161, 164, 751 P2d 246 (1988) (in the absence of disability, symptoms or a need for treatment, findings on claimant\u2019s lungs consistent with a \u201cpre-asbestosis condition\u201d are not a \u201cdisease\u201d), <em>with Brown v. SAIF, </em>79 Or App 205, 717 P2d 1289, <em>rev den, </em>301 Or 666 (1986) (although evidence showed that claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos might result in a disease in the future, exposure was not by itself an injury). We conclude, further, that the board\u2019s standard of impairment of function is consistent with the definition adopted by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We reject claimant\u2019s contention that our opinion in <em>K-Mart v. Evenson, </em>167 Or App 46, 51, 1 P3d 477, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 191 (2000), requires a different conclusion. There, we considered the compensability of diagnostic testing for a worker who had been exposed to the bodily fluids of a person infected with HIV. We agreed with the employer that the claimant had not shown that she had a disease. We concluded, nonetheless, that the testing was compensable under the statutory definition of \u201ccompensable injury,\u201d ORS 656.005(7)(a), reasoning that an \u201cinjury\u201d for the purpose of that statute is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u201charm, damage or hurt\u201d that requires medical services. 167 Or App at 50. We explained that the statute makes no distinction between medical services directed at the cure of an existing, identifiable disease and medical services directed at diagnosis of a condition. Distinguishing <em>Johnsen </em>and <em>Brown, </em>we reasoned that, in the occupational <em>injury </em>context, the absence of an identifiable disease or disability was not fatal to the claim. We concluded that the diagnostic tests that had been recommended for the claimant in order to rule out a serious, potentially life-threatening condition were \u201crequired medical services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. Here, we conclude that ORS 656.802 requires claimant to establish that he suffers from a disease and substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that claimant does not suffer from a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
