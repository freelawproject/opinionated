Christie argues that there was insufficient evidence to support (1) a finding that petitioner John Hayes (John) was in fear of imminent bodily injury, and (2) a finding that he was in imminent danger of further abuse. <em>See </em>ORS 107.710(1). On <em>de novo </em>review, we conclude that John did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was in fear of imminent bodily injury. <em>Rosiles-Flores v. Browning, </em>208 Or App 600, 602, 145 P3d 328 (2006). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">John and Christie were married in 2002, and a petition for dissolution of marriage was filed in 2005. They have two children, ages 3 and 5. As part of the dissolution proceeding, the parties completed mediation regarding child custody and agreed to a stipulated general judgment of dissolution. The children would reside primarily with Christie at her mother\u2019s home in McMinnville, and John would have parenting time with the children, initially, for two weekends each month, from 7:00 p.m. on Friday evening to 7:00 p.m. on Sunday evening. The parties later agreed to increase John\u2019s visitation to three weekends each month because things had been \u201cgoing very well\u201d between the parties. The stipulated general judgment of dissolution was sent to John\u2019s attorney, but was never signed by John.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">On April 21, 2006, John received a letter from the Department of Human Services (DHS) stating that it was classifying recent allegations of child neglect, as to Christie, as \u201cfounded.\u201d The letter stated that, although no reports of sexual abuse were made, DHS had concerns about the safety of the children, based on information that Christie had been involved in a relationship with a registered, but untreated, sex offender. Consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement, Christie delivered the children to John that same day. John was concerned for the children\u2019s safety and upset regarding the DHS letter; he contemplated not returning the children to Christie. That weekend, Christie attempted to speak to the children, but was not successful and left telephone messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>On April 23, Christie called John before 7:00 p.m. to see if he had left his residence to return the children to Christie. Although John was not always punctual, Christie became extremely concerned when John did not arrive by 8:00 p.m., an hour after the designated return time. Christie called John\u2019s home again and spoke with his girlfriend. She asked to speak to John, but his girlfriend refused, saying that John did not want to speak to Christie. John\u2019s girlfriend also explained that, because of the DHS letter, they were keeping the children. Christie again asked to speak to John, and his girlfriend again refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Christie called back several times, but never spoke to John that night. Christie then called the Dallas Police Department for assistance in retrieving the children. After speaking to Christie about the situation, Officer Vidrio went to John\u2019s home to speak to him regarding the children\u2019s return. John told the officer that he did not believe that the children were safe because of the DHS assessment and showed the letter to the officer. John did agree to return the children, and Christie sent her mother\u2019s friend, Welty, to pick them up.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Later that evening, Christie again called the Dallas Police Department because Welty had knocked on John\u2019s door for five to 10 minutes, but received no response. Because Officer Vidrio was on call elsewhere, he asked Officer Calef to respond. After a briefing from Officer Vidrio, Officer Calef spoke with Christie regarding John\u2019s failure to answer the door and allow Welty to pick up the children. Officer Calef drove to John\u2019s home and met with Welty. The officer also knocked on the door with no response; he and Welty then left without the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On April 25, John filed a petition for an <em>ex parte </em>restraining order. In his petition, he alleged that Christie had threatened that her \u201cbrother would take my life\u201d and \u201cthat [Christie] herself would cause bodily harm to my [children\u2019s] care provider and myself.\u201d John also alleged that, during their marriage, Christie had threatened him with bodily injury when they disagreed on issues concerning the dissolution and custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>At the hearing, all parties mentioned above testified to the events of April 23. Christie denied threatening John or his girlfriend at any time that night. Additionally, both Welty and Christie\u2019s mother confirmed that they were present when Christie called John\u2019s home; they did not hear Christie make any threats over the telephone or mention her brother\u2019s name. Christie\u2019s mother testified that Christie was very upset when John\u2019s girlfriend would not let her speak to John. Officer Vidrio denied that John mentioned any threats by Christie against him or his girlfriend, or that he had had any conversations with John\u2019s girlfriend other than saying \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">John\u2019s girlfriend testified, in contradiction to Officer Vidrio\u2019s testimony, that she had told the officer that Christie had threatened her. Specifically, she testified that Christie had threatened to \u201ckick [her] face in and beat [her] ass,\u201d and that John\u2019s girlfriend believed Christie.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">John admitted that he did not speak with Christie at any time that evening. He also attributed the threats of bodily harm alleged in his petition to threats made by Christie\u2019s boyfriend and her brother in November 2005:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201c[CHRISTIE\u2019S COUNSEL:] * * * What do you mean when you said [in your petition] that [Christie] would cause you bodily harm, what does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201c[JOHN:] She has * * * people come over, and * * * her boyfriend * * * to kick my ass, or her brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201c[CHRISTIE\u2019S COUNSEL:] And she said these things to you that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">\u201c[JOHN:] No, she had \u2014 she told my mom that. It\u2019s on that one police report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\u201c[CHRISTIE\u2019S COUNSEL:] That police report dated November of 2005?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">\u201c[JOHN:] Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">\u201c[CHRISTIE\u2019S COUNSEL:] So this was not \u2014 this is not threats that she made on April 23rd. You\u2019re saying this is regarding an incident back in November?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">[JOHN:] Yeah;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Additionally, on April 23, John knew that Christie\u2019s brother was incarcerated and would not be released for about 30 to 40 months. Although he did not personally hear Christie\u2019s threats, John was afraid of Christie because of \u201c[w]hat she can do, yeah. I mean, I have her kids.\u201d John never signed the stipulated judgment of dissolution; however, he testified that he would have \u201c[i]f it [weren\u2019t] for the DHS[ ] letter I got * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Both parties testified that, in November 2005, John kept their son for 13 days and refused to return him to Christie. During that incident, Christie retrieved their son from John\u2019s mother\u2019s home and told John\u2019s mother that her brother would \u201ckick [John\u2019s] ass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The trial court found that John \u201cwas afraid that [Christie] was going to come down and get him because he had the children.\u201d Despite acknowledging that John never spoke to Christie on April 23, the trial court issued the FAPA restraining order based on the petition\u2019s allegations of bodily injury and on petitioner\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201c[THE COURT:] And then when [the petition] says how has [Christie] threatened you, then [John] goes and talks about things that happened within the 180 days but not the things that happened on [April 23,] because he was saying that the brother threatening him was not happening on April 23, because [John] admits he never talked to [Christie], that it happened at an earlier time when the brother was, I assume from what he was talking, was not in jail. And [Christie] caused \u2014 well, that cause bodily injury to my children\u2019s care provider], John\u2019s girlfriend,] and myself. That might have been that night where [John\u2019s girlfriend] said [Christie] said so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u00ab\u2021 sji ifc % \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m satisfied that, given the fact that * * * a liberal reading of what [John] put down [in his petition], even though it was in a different order and [he] wrote down things in one line when he should have put it in a different line or a different box, is enough to allow for a restraining order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">After the trial court issued the order, the parties spoke at length regarding child custody and visitation. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>parties seemed very committed to the children\u2019s well-being and safety; John stated that he was still willing to sign the stipulated judgment of dissolution, and Christie stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">\u201cIf the relationship with [my boyfriend] is the only thing that [John] has a problem with, my relationship is nothing to me. My children are everything to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Christie challenges the trial court\u2019s findings that there was sufficient evidence that she placed John in fear of imminent bodily injury and in imminent danger of further abuse. On <em>de novo </em>review, we agree with Christie that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Our opinion in <em>Fielder v. Fielder </em>outlines the requirements to issue a FAPA restraining order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">\u201c[(1) the <em>petitioner] </em>has been the victim of abuse <em>committed by the respondent </em>within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition, that [(2)] there is an imminent danger of further abuse <em>to the petitioner </em>and that [(3)] the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">211 Or App 688 at 693, 157 P3d 220 (2007) (citing ORS 107.718(1) (emphasis added)). A petitioner must satisfy all three requirements for a FAPA restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The analysis of ORS 107.718(1) starts by determining whether John is a \u201cvictim of abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> John alleges that he is a victim of abuse because Christie placed him in fear of imminent bodily injury. Establishing \u201cfear of imminent bodily injury\u201d does not require overt threats, subjective fear by the petitioner, or physical violence. <em>Fielder, </em>211 Or App at 693-94 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>However, even if a petitioner makes subjective assertions of fear, a FAPA restraining order will not be affirmed when there is insufficient evidence that the alleged conduct creates an imminent danger of further abuse and a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner. <em>Roshto v. McVein, </em>207 Or App 700, 704-05, 143 P3d 241 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The trial court found that John\u2019s allegations regarding the threat of Christie\u2019s brother \u201ckicking his ass\u201d were attributed to the November 2005 incident. John admitted that Christie did not threaten him or speak to him at any time during the night of April 23. Threats on that night by Christie, if any, were directed toward John\u2019s girlfriend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, we find credible the testimony of Officer Visidro that neither John nor his girlfriend relayed that any threats were made by Christie to John. John has not proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Christie placed him in fear of imminent bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Based on the record before us, John has not shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was in fear of imminent bodily harm; we therefore reverse the FAPA restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\"> \u201cAbuse\u201d under ORS 107.705(1) is defined in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">\u201c(1) * * * <em>the occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">\u201c(a) Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">\u201c(b) <em>Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-14\">\u201c(c) Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> Under PAPA, the definition of \u201cabuse\u201d limits the conduct to sustain a FAPA restraining order to acts between family or household members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\u201c(3) \u2018Family or household members\u2019 means any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">\u201c(a) Spouses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">\u201c(b) Former spouses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">\u201c(c) Adult persons related by blood, marriage or adoption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">\u201c(d) Persons who are cohabiting or who have cohabitated with each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWZ\">\u201c(e) Persons who have been involved in a sexually intimate relationship with each other within two years immediately preceding the filing by one of them of a petition under ORS 107.710.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-13\">\u201c(f) Unmarried parents of a child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">ORS 107.705(3). Christie argues that threats between her and John\u2019s girlfriend cannot be the proper basis for a FAPA restraining order, because John\u2019s girlfriend is not a \u201cfamily or household member.\u201d Because we agree that, even if Christie threatened John\u2019s girlfriend on April 23 in addition to the November 2005 incident, John was not in imminent danger of further abuse, we do not address the issue of whether threats against a third party may sustain such an order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
