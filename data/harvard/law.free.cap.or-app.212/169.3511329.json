J.</author>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Defendant appeals a conviction for possession of a controlled substance, <em>former </em>ORS 475.992(4)(b) (2001), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 475.840(3)(b) (2005). On appeal, he assigns as error the imposition of a dispositional departure sentence after he entered a plea of no contest. He argues that (1) the trial court could not lawfully impose an upward dis-positional departure sentence based on his persistent involvement in criminal activities unrelated to the conviction in this case without also finding that he possessed a separate malevolent quality, and (2) he was entitled to jury findings regarding aggravating factors under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution before an upward departure sentence could be imposed. We affirm for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In support of his first argument, defendant relies on this court\u2019s opinions in <em>State v. Perez, </em>196 Or App 364, 102 P3d 705 (2004), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>340 Or 310, 131 P3d 168 (2006),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>113 Or App 134, 831 P2d 712 (1992), to argue that the trial court erred when it failed to \u201cfind a separate malevolent quality in [defendant] over and above noting defendant\u2019s prior convictions.\u201d The state responds that OAR 213-008-0002(1)(b)(D), the applicable sentencing guideline rule, does not require an express finding of a \u201cmalevolent quality\u201d and that our discussion in those cases about such a quality \u201cis simply an explanation as to the meaning of the persistent-involvement factor and when the record will support [such a] finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The state is correct. OAR 213-008-0002 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\u201c(1) Subject to the provisions of sections (2) and (3) of this rule, the following nonexclusive list of mitigating and aggravating factors may be considered in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>whether substantial and compelling reasons for a departure exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">sfc \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201c(b) Aggravating factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201c(D) Persistent involvement in similar offenses or repetitive assaults. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Nowhere in the text of the rule does it require a separate finding of a malevolent quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Moreover, defendant\u2019s reliance on our opinions in <em>Kennedy </em>and in <em>Perez </em>is misplaced. We did not in those cases purport to add to the requirements of the rule. In <em>Kennedy, </em>our discussion regarding a malevolent quality was in the context of explaining the import of an example given in the commentary to the rule. We stated with regard to the factor of persistent involvement that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">\u201cis intended to capture, for sentencing purposes, a separate malevolent quality in the offender represented by the repetitive nature or pattern of the offender\u2019s criminal behavior over and above simply counting the number of offenses in an offender\u2019s criminal history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">113 Or App at 137-38. Similarly, in <em>Perez, </em>we quoted the above language from <em>Kennedy </em>with reference to the trial court\u2019s finding in that case that \u201cfor criminal justice purposes,\u201d the defendant was a \u201cpsychopath.\u201d 196 Or App at 372-73. In neither case did we hold that a trial court must make an additional finding that a defendant has a malevolent quality before the court can find an aggravating factor under OAR 213-008-0002(1)(b)(D). Rather, our intention was to explain the purpose of the rule. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s initial argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Defendant argues alternatively that he was entitled to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), on the issue of whether he had engaged in persistent involvement in similar offenses. However, he did not ask for a jury trial on that issue in the trial court even though his counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>aware of the holding in <em>Blakely. </em>Nonetheless, defendant urges that we should review his claim of error as error apparent on the face of the record under ORAP 5.45. In light of defendant\u2019s waiver of his jury trial right on the underlying offense and his failure to assert any right to a jury trial at sentencing, particularly in light of the fact that his trial counsel expressed that he was aware of the holding in <em>Blakely, </em>the record does not clearly show that the trial court erred. <em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 162-70, 130 P3d 780 (2006); <em>Perez, </em>340 Or at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\"> The Supreme Court in <em>Perez </em>reversed our holding in that case that the record demonstrated error apparent on the face of the record when the defendant was not furnished a jury trial on the issue of whether aggravating factors existed for purposes of an upward departure sentence. It held that it could properly be inferred from the record that the defendant chose to have the trial court, rather than a jury, find the aggravating facts. 340 Or at 318.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
