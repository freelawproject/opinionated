ORS 426.130(1)(b). He argues that the state did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that any of the statutory criteria for involuntary commitment have been satisfied. On <em>de novo </em>review, we find that appellant clearly suffers from a mental disorder and was delusional at the time of the commitment hearing. One examiner and the trial court were persuaded that the remaining statutory criteria for commitment were demonstrated by the acuity of appellant\u2019s mental illness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the other examiner observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence of danger to self or others. Certainly, [appellant] presents in a flamboyant, occasionally loud fashion and very delusional, but I hear no threat to others or himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUG\">\u00ab\u00ed{c \u00edj\u00ed ifc \u2021 %</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABa\">\u201cHe has an apartment, apparently, that he can return to. He seems to have a good understanding of tenant law[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">We agree with that examiner\u2019s characterization of the evidentiary record. Moreover, the state presented no evidence at the hearing of the circumstances that led to appellant\u2019s detention that may have demonstrated that he was a danger to himself or to others, or was unable to provide for basic personal needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard imposed by the legislature for involuntary commitment requires that the state offer evidence that makes it \u201chighly probable\u201d that the person is mentally ill as defined by ORS 426.005(1)(d). <em>State v. Waites, </em>71 Or App 366, 369, 692 P2d 654 (1984). Under the particular circumstances of this case, we conclude that the state did not satisfy its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\"> ORS 426.005(1)(d) provides that a \u201c \u2018[m]entally ill person\u2019 means a person who, because of a mental disorder\u201d is \u201c[d]angerous to self or others\u201d or \u201c[u]nable to provide for basic personal needs and is not receiving such care as is necessary for health or safety.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
