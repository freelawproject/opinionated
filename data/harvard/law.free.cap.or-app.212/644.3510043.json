We vacate the trial court\u2019s award of costs to defendant and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The material facts are undisputed. Plaintiff s vehicle was damaged when defendant rear-ended it in an automobile accident on April 3, 2003. Plaintiffs car was properly repaired. On May 21, 2004,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plaintiff sent a written demand to defendant for $4,271 for the car\u2019s diminished value after repairs. In response, defendant tendered an offer of $3,200 on June 2, 2004. On June 9, 2004, plaintiff filed a complaint in circuit court, requesting economic damages of $4,271, costs, and attorney fees under ORS 20.080. On August 30, 2004\u2014 after plaintiff filed her complaint \u2014 defendant served plaintiff with an offer of judgment under ORCP 54 E for $3,636, exclusive of costs, disbursements, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The case went to arbitration, and plaintiff received an award for damages of $3,300. She was also awarded attorney fees of $828.50, although the attorney fee statement she submitted reflected fees of $5,482.33. The arbitrator denied both parties\u2019 requests for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The award was filed on April 20, 2005. On April 26, 2005, pursuant to ORS 35.425(6), plaintiff filed and served on defendant her written exceptions to the amount of attorney fees awarded and to the denial of her costs. Defendant filed his response to plaintiffs exceptions on May 4, 2005, asserting, among other things, that plaintiff was not entitled to recover any fees incurred after August 30, 2004, the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>defendant\u2019s offer of judgment under ORCP 54 E. Defendant also requested his claimed costs of $414.00, pursuant to ORCP 54 E(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant did not serve his response on plaintiff until June 9, 2005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">A hearing was held on May 6, 2005. At that time, the court concluded that defendant\u2019s offer of judgment under ORCP 54 E operated to limit plaintiffs entitlement to attorney fees to those incurred as of the date of that offer and, accordingly, awarded plaintiff attorney fees of $1,267.67. The court also considered defendant\u2019s request for costs, despite plaintiffs objection on the ground that it was untimely under ORS 35.425(6). The court subsequently awarded both parties costs \u2014 plaintiff in the amount of $271.95 and defendant in the amount of $414.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Plaintiffs first assignment of error on appeal concerns the interplay between ORS 20.080(1) and ORCP 54 E. ORS 20.080(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201cIn any action for damages for an injury or wrong to the person or property, or both, of another where the amount pleaded is $5,500 or less, and the plaintiff prevails in the action, there shall be taxed and allowed to the plaintiff, at trial and on appeal, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees for the prosecution of the action, if the court finds that written demand for the payment of such claim was made on the defendant not less than 10 days before the commencement of the action * * *. However, no attorney fees shall be allowed to the plaintiff if the court finds that the defendant tendered to the plaintiff, prior to the commencement of the action * * * an amount not less than the damages awarded to the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">ORCP 54 E provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u201cE(1) Except as provided in ORS 17.065 through 17.085 [concerning compromise with an injured worker], the party against whom a claim is asserted may, at any time up to 10 days prior to trial, serve upon the party asserting the claim an offer to allow judgment to be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>against the party making the offer for the sum, or the property, or to the effect therein specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cE(3) If the offer is not accepted and filed within the time prescribed, it shall be deemed withdrawn, and shall not be given in evidence on the trial; and if the party asserting the claim fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the party asserting the claim shall not recover costs, prevailing party fees, disbursements, or attorney fees incurred after the date of the offer, but the party against whom the claim was asserted shall recover of the party asserting the claim costs and disbursements, not including prevailing party fees, from the time of the service of the offer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">As noted, the trial court concluded that both the statute and the rule applied; therefore, because plaintiffs arbitration award ($3,300) was greater than defendant\u2019s prefiling settlement offer under ORS 20.080(1) ($3,200), but less than defendant\u2019s post-filing offer of judgment under ORCP 54 E ($3,636), plaintiffs attorney fee recovery was limited to fees incurred as of the date of defendant\u2019s offer of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">On appeal, plaintiff challenges that conclusion. Citing <em>Colby v. Larson, </em>208 Or 121, 297 P2d 1073, <em>on reh\u2019g, </em>299 P2d 1076 (1956), she argues that, because ORCP 54 E and ORS 20.080(1) are in direct conflict, the specific provisions of ORS 20.080(1) must prevail over the general provisions of ORCP 54 E.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">We recently decided this precise issue contrary to plaintiffs position. In <em>Bell v. Morales, </em>207 Or App 326, 336, 142 P3d 76 (2006), we held that both the statute and the rule could be given full effect because the legislature, in replacing <em>former </em>ORS 17.055 (1953), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1979, ch 284, \u00a7 199 (the predecessor offer-of-judgment statute) with ORCP 54 E, had eliminated the conflict between the two that had concerned the court in <em>Colby. </em>Thus, the trial court did not err in applying ORCP 54 E to limit plaintiffs award of attorney fees accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Plaintiffs second assignment of error challenges the court\u2019s award of costs to defendant. According to plaintiff, because defendant did not file and serve his written exception to the arbitrator\u2019s denial of his costs within the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>required by ORS 36.425(6), the court erred in upholding that exception. Although, under ORCP 68 B,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we generally review a trial court\u2019s decision to award costs for abuse of discretion, <em>see, e.g., Mosley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>165 Or App 304, 313, 996 P2d 513 (2000), where, as here, the court\u2019s decision is based on an interpretation of statute, we review for errors of law. <em>See Selective Services, Inc. v. AAA Liquidating, </em>126 Or App 74, 78-79, 867 P2d 545 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">ORS 36.425(6) describes the procedure for objecting to an award or denial of attorney fees and costs awarded by an arbitrator. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\u201cWithin seven days after the filing of a decision and award under subsection (1) of this section, a party may file with the court and serve on the other parties to the arbitration written exceptions directed solely to the award or denial of attorney fees or costs. Exceptions under this subsection may be directed to the legal grounds for an award or denial of attorney fees or costs, or to the amount of the award. * * * A judge of the court shall decide the issue and enter a decision on the award of attorney fees and costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Notwithstanding the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cmay,\u201d we have previously concluded that the first sentence of ORS 36.425(6) establishes a mandatory seven-day time limit for filing exceptions to the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>Webster v. Harmon, </em>205 Or App 196, 200, 134 P3d 1012 (2006) (trial court erred in upholding the defendant\u2019s exceptions to an arbitrator\u2019s attorney fee award where the defendant did not file his exceptions within the statutory time limit).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Defendant does not dispute that he did not file written exceptions directed to the arbitrator\u2019s denial of his claimed costs within the statutory time limit. Rather, defendant argues that, because \u201cORS 36.425(6) requires the Trial Court to exercise <em>de novo </em>review of the arbitrator\u2019s fee and costs decisions upon the filing of exceptions [,]\u201d once <em>plaintiff </em>filed her exceptions to those decisions, <em>all </em>of the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>decisions regarding fees and costs were placed at issue before the court. Defendant also asserts that \u201cORCP 15 and ORCP 68 grant to the Trial Court discretion to be flexible in the procedures and time lines regarding requests for and objections to attorneys fees and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We disagree with defendant in both respects. Defendant\u2019s first argument is premised on his understanding \u2014 and the trial court\u2019s \u2014 that ORS 36.425(6) requires the trial court to review the arbitrator\u2019s fee and cost decisions <em>de novo. </em>While we are unpersuaded that this would be significant in any event, we note that it is incorrect. <em>Foust v. American Standard Ins. Co., </em>189 Or App 125, 133-34, 74 P3d 1111 (2003) (\u201cUnder [ORS 36.425(6)], the arbitrator\u2019s decision cannot be supplanted by an independent determination by the trial court on a new record. * * * Rather, as pertinent here, review is limited to determining whether the arbitrator correctly applied the law in awarding or denying attorney fees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">More significantly, there is nothing in the text or context of ORS 36.425(6) to support defendant\u2019s argument that the court was free to consider his untimely exceptions to the denial of costs simply because the other party to the arbitration filed timely exceptions to the arbitration award. To agree with defendant would require us to add additional words to the text of the statute, contrary to ORS 174.010.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although, to be sure, defendant\u2019s entitlement to costs was dependent on the trial court\u2019s resolution of the question whether ORCP 54 E applied in this context, that fact nonetheless does not excuse defendant from registering his objection to the arbitrator\u2019s denial of his costs by timely filing his written exceptions as required by ORS 36.425(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Chase v. Vernam, </em>199 Or App 129, 110 P3d 128 (2005), to support his position is misplaced. In <em>Chase, </em>the issue was whether the trial court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>in considering the plaintiff\u2019s untimely objections in evaluating the reasonableness of the defendants\u2019 request for attorney fees under ORCP 68 C(4)(b). We held that it did not, concluding that \u201ca court retains whatever discretion it may otherwise have to award or deny fees even if there is not a timely objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In this case, the question is not whether the court may properly consider a party\u2019s untimely objections to a request for attorney fees under ORCP 68 C(4)(b), but whether the court may consider a party\u2019s untimely exception to an arbitrator\u2019s award. We have already answered that question in the negative \u2014 under ORS 36.425(6), the timely filing of an exception to an arbitrator\u2019s award or denial of fees or costs is a prerequisite to the court\u2019s consideration of that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">ORCP 15 also does not aid defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We assume defendant refers specifically to ORCP 15 D, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cThe court may, in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or allow any other pleading or motion after the time limited by the procedural rules, or by an order enlarge such time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In <em>Husted v. SCI Oregon Funeral Services, </em>Inc., 209 Or App 45, 49, 146 P3d 376 (2006), we held that ORCP 15 D did not excuse the plaintiffs untimely filing of her attorney fee statement under ORCP 68 C(4)(a), because the plaintiff had never sought an extension under the rule and because the court plainly had not exercised its discretion under it. The same is true here. Even assuming that ORCP 15 D applies to the time limits for filing exceptions to an arbitrator\u2019s award, defendant did not request an extension under the rule. Nor did the trial court rely on its discretion under that rule in allowing defendant\u2019s exceptions. Instead, the court apparently concluded that the timely filing of plaintiffs exceptions brought all of the arbitrator\u2019s fee and cost decisions properly before the court. As we have determined, that conclusion was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Because defendant did not timely file his exceptions to the arbitrator\u2019s denial of his costs, the trial court erred in upholding those exceptions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the trial court\u2019s award of costs to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Award of costs to defendant vacated; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> The judgment also awarded plaintiff costs; that portion of the judgment is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> Although the demand letter is dated May 21, 2003, the certified mail receipt reflects a postmark date of May 21, 2004, and the parties do not argue otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\"> The parties treat that request as defendant\u2019s written exception to the arbitrator\u2019s denial of his costs, as do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b699-10\"> Apparently, the document was delivered to the wrong address on May 4, 2005, and it was not until June 9, 2005, that it was actually served on plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> That rule provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">\u201cIn any action, costs and disbursements shall be allowed to the prevailing party, unless these rules or other rule or statute direct that in the particular case costs and disbursements shall not be allowed to the prevailing party or shall be allowed to some other party, or unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\"> ORS 174.010 provides, in relevant part, that the office of a judge in the construction of a statute is to \u201cdeclare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> In addition to ORCP 15, defendant also invokes ORCP 68 as providing a basis for the trial court\u2019s authority to treat filing deadlines with some flexibility, but provides no analysis or support for that position. We reject that argument without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b704-5\"> In light of this conclusion, we need not decide the effect of defendant\u2019s failure to timely <em>serve </em>his exceptions on plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
