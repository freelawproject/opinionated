J.</author>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Appellant challenges an order adjudicating him to be a mentally ill person and continuing his commitment to the Department of Human Services. ORS 426.301 - 426.307. He asserts that (1) the trial court improperly, on its own motion, admitted into evidence the precommitment investigation report pertaining to his original commitment and cross-examined him on the basis of that report and (2) the state failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that, because of a mental disorder, he was unable to provide for his basic needs. ORS 426.005(1)(d)(B). On <em>de novo </em>review, <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>274 Or 59, 61, 545 P2d 97 (1976), we agree with both of appellant\u2019s challenges. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Appellant was originally involuntarily committed in September 2005 on the grounds that he was dangerous to himself and could not provide for his basic needs. As his term of commitment approached its end in March 2006, the Department of Human Services certified that appellant was still mentally ill and in need of further treatment. ORS 426.301(1). The certification alleged that appellant was mentally ill due to his inability to provide for his basic personal needs. Appellant protested further commitment and requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">At the time of the hearing on continuing commitment, appellant had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He talked incessantly throughout the hearing, repeatedly expressing his interest in leaving the hospital and managing his own affairs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to appellant\u2019s numerous comments, Dr. Bruce Johnstone, appellant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, and Diane Bowman, appellant\u2019s social worker, testified concerning the effects of appellant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Appellant requires both medication for his mental disorder and blood pressure medication. Johnstone testified that, if appellant were released, he would \u201cprobably stop taking his medication because he does not believe he needs the medication.\u201d Johnstone further testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201c[if appellant] does not take his medicines * * * he starts taking drugs. Alcohol and street drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201c* * * [If released,] [h]e would stop taking his medications, and he would become vulnerable to drugs, and he would become restless [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">However, when examined further, Johnstone explained that his opinion was based not on his personal observations of appellant, but, instead, on information in a patient history he was \u201cnot sure exactly\u201d the origins of. Johnstone stated that, \u201cusing * * * [that] history as a guide, I would believe he would be [likely to begin drug use again] ,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Regarding appellant\u2019s blood pressure medication, Johnstone stated that appellant \u201cruns the risk \u2014 increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and (indiscernible) damage the more days he has high blood pressure.\u201d However, he agreed that \u201cthat\u2019s not a near future thing\u201d necessarily resulting in harm in the next weeks or even months.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Bowman explained that appellant\u2019s only plan to obtain housing was based on a misconception of certain social services, and that, otherwise, appellant had no viable plan for shelter. Bowman also explained that, in order to obtain housing, appellant would have to participate in interviews \u2014 and that, in his current condition, especially without taking medication, he would be unlikely to receive assistance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Following that testimony, the trial court, over appellant\u2019s objection, admitted into evidence the precommitment investigation report from the original commitment. The investigator who prepared that report was not present at the hearing. The court then relied on the content of that report to examine appellant regarding whether he would engage in substance abuse upon release. Appellant responded by repeatedly denying that he would engage in substance abuse, but \u201cjust want[s] to smoke cigarettes and eat candy bars and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>potato chips.\u201d He explained, \u201cI don\u2019t use meth, crack cocaine or none of that stuff. I smoke cigarettes and eat candy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The trial court concluded that appellant still suffered from a mental illness and was unable to meet his basic personal needs. Consequently, the court ordered that appellant be committed for an additional period not to exceed 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">ORS 426.130 allows the involuntary commitment of a \u201cmentally ill\u201d person to the Department of Human Services for a period not to exceed 180 days. ORS 426.301(1) provides for the continued commitment of a person who has been committed under ORS 426.130 when the person \u201cis still mentally ill and in need of further treatment.\u201d As relevant here, a \u201cmentally ill person\u201d is \u201ca person who, because of a mental disorder,\u201d is \u201c[u]nable to provide for basic personal needs and is not receiving such care as is necessary for health or safety.\u201d ORS 426.005(1)(d)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> In order to commit a person on the \u201cbasic needs\u201d ground, \u201c[t]he state must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the individual, due to a mental disorder, is unable to obtain some commodity (e.g., food and water) or service <em>(e.g., </em>life-saving medical care) without which he cannot sustain life.\u201d <em>State v. Bunting, </em>112 Or App 143, 145, 826 P2d 1060 (1992). To meet that standard, the state must show, again by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cthere is a likelihood that the person probably would not survive in the near future because the person is unable to provide for basic personal needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146; <em>see also State v. Puha, </em>208 Or App 453, 461-62, 144 P3d 1044 (2006) (reiterating <em>Bunting\u2019s </em>standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence standard is rigorous. To be \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d evidence must be of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness.\u201d <em>State v. Howell, </em>53 Or App 611, 617, 633 P2d 14 (1981). The evidence must establish that \u201cthe truth of the facts asserted is highly probable.\u201d <em>State v. Jayne, </em>174 Or App 74, 77-78, 23 P3d 990, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>admission of, and reliance on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the precommitment investigation report from the original commitment proceeding violated ORS 426.095(4)(d)(C) and the principles stated in <em>State v. Hitt, </em>179 Or App 563, 41 P3d 434 (2002). The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard, and we accept that concession as well founded. Under ORS 426.095(4)(d)(C), a precommitment investigation report cannot be admitted if the author is not \u201cpresent during the proceeding to be cross-examined,\u201d unless the statute\u2019s protections are waived. Here, the investigator was not present at the continuation of commitment hearing, and neither appellant nor his counsel, on his behalf, waived the statute\u2019s requirements. Further, the record of the initial commitment hearing was not \u201cautomatically incorporated into the record\u201d of the continuation of commitment proceeding. <em>Hitt, </em>179 Or App at 566 n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The state contends, nevertheless, that, even without the erroneously admitted exhibit and the responses from appellant that the trial court elicited in its examination based on that document, the record is still sufficient to show that continuation of commitment was warranted because appellant would likely fail to take his medication, would be unable to find housing, and would engage in substance abuse. We disagree that on this record those concerns, individually or collectively, warranted continuation of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u201cThe refusal to take medication is not sufficient, by itself, to prove an inability to provide for basic * * * needs,\u201d unless the evidence shows that the allegedly mentally ill person \u201ccannot function without medication[ ].\u201d <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>190 Or App 202, 211, 78 P3d 125 (2003); <em>see also State v. Baxter, </em>138 Or App 94, 98, 906 P2d 849 (1995) (\u201c[B]y itself, failing to take medication is not sufficient if it causes only a speculative threat.\u201d). Here, Johnstone acknowledged that any risk from appellant\u2019s failure to take his blood pressure medication was \u201cnot a near future thing.\u201d Further, the record does not show that appellant would be \u201cunable to function\u201d without medication for his mental disorder. Rather, the only possible detriments suggested in this record that could occur if appellant failed to take that medication are that appellant might be unable to find housing promptly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>might engage in substance abuse. However, neither of those concerns justifies continuation of commitment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Homelessness, alone, is not sufficient grounds for a \u201cbasic needs\u201d commitment. <em>Baxter, </em>138 Or App at 99. Rather, the record must persuasively establish that, because of the totality of the circumstances, \u201cappellant [if homeless] \u2018probably would not survive in the near future.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hayes, </em>202 Or App 63, 67, 121 P3d 17 (2005) (quoting <em>Bunting, </em>112 Or App at 146). Here, as in <em>Hayes, </em>although appellant\u2019s \u201cprospects of finding housing * * * were, at best, uncertain,\u201d <em>id,., </em>the record does not establish the requisite threat to appellant\u2019s survival in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The state contends, nevertheless, that, under our opinion in <em>Cunningham, </em>appellant\u2019s inability to articulate a coherent \u201cplan\u201d for obtaining shelter and managing his finances can be a sufficient ground for commitment. <em>Cunningham </em>is, however, materially distinguishable. In <em>Cunningham, </em>the appellant refused to take medication and \u201ccould not function without\u201d it, had no available income, had lost 40 pounds in the preceding two months, and had no \u201creasonable plan for obtaining the necessities of life.\u201d 190 Or App at 212-13. Here, in contrast, the evidence did not demonstrate that appellant \u201ccould not function\u201d without his medication \u2014 and, in fact, appellant identified one agency that might assist him in managing his social security income and, perhaps, in finding housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Finally, in some circumstances, the prospects of an allegedly mentally ill person engaging in substance abuse because of his or her untreated disorder can present such a threat as to warrant a \u201cbasic needs\u201d (or \u201cdanger to self\u2019) commitment. <em>Cf. State v. Linde, </em>179 Or App 553, 559-62, 41 P3d 440 (2002) (addressing same issue). However, once again, the record here is inadequate. As noted, Johnstone\u2019s testimony in that regard was based entirely on a patient history of unknown origin. Further, the references to appellant\u2019s history of substance abuse in the original precommitment investigation report were inadmissible \u2014 and, in all events, in the related colloquy with the trial court, appellant adamantly denied that he would engage in substance abuse. What <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>remains is appellant\u2019s testimony that he simply wants to \u201csmoke cigarettes and eat candy bars and potato chips.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\"> Appellant receives social security income; however, the record does not disclose the amount of those payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\"> Johnstone stated that he received a patient history from another doctor but did not know whether the information in that history was firsthand.
