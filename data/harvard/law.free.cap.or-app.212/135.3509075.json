The trial court sentenced him to two concurrent terms of 75 months in prison. In addition, the court ordered that defendant be subject to a term of post-prison supervision (PPS) for \u201c20 years minus time actually served in custody.\u201d Defendant did not object to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Defendant now appeals, arguing that the trial court committed plain error in imposing a PPS term of 20 years, less time served. According to defendant, the maximum term of PPS for first-degree sexual abuse, a Class B felony, is 10 years, less time served in prison. The state concedes that the trial court erred. We agree and accept the concession. ORS 161.605 provides that the maximum indeterminate sentence for first-degree sexual abuse is 10 years. ORS 144.103 then provides that a person who has been convicted of first-degree sexual abuse shall serve a term of PPS equal to the maximum statutory indeterminate sentence less time served in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
