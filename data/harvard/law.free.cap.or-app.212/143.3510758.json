Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in giving the so-called \u201cemergency\u2019 instruction, UCJI 20.08.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She argues, particularly, that (1) defendant was not entitled to that instruction because the evidence established that any \u201cemergency\u2019 that existed \u201cwas created by [defendant\u201d; and (2) in all events, the instruction, as a categorical matter, is \u201crepetitive, unnecessary, confusing[,] and constitutes an improper comment on the evidence\u201d and should never be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We reject both of plaintiffs arguments. The evidence here did support the giving of the instruction; defendant\u2019s account, if credited, demonstrated that he had been \u201csuddenly placed in a position of peril <em>through no negligence of [his] own.\u201d </em>UCJI 20.08 (emphasis added). <em>See Lane v. Brown, </em>138 Or App 34, 906 P2d 821 (1995), <em>aff'd, </em>328 Or 42, 970 P2d 206 (1998). The proper resolution of plaintiffs second challenge lies elsewhere. <em>See id. </em>at 38-42 (Landau, J., concurring) (exploring tensions, and ostensible contradictions, in case law pertaining to \u201cemergency\u2019 instruction and proposing to \u201cleave it to the Supreme Court to impose limitations on the emergency doctrine or, better yet, abandon it altogether\u201d); <em>cf. Lane v. Brown, </em>328 Or 42, 45 n 1, 970 P2d 206 (1998) (observing that the plaintiffs had failed to preserve for appellate consideration the argument \u201cthat the emergency instruction is redundant and confusing and should be abolished\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> UCJI 20.08 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cPeople who are suddenly placed in a position of peril through no negligence of their own, and who are compelled to act without opportunity for reflection, are not negligent if they make a choice as a reasonable careful person placed in such a position might make, even though they do not make the wisest choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
