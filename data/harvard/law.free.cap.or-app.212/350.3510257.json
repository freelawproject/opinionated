J.</author>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Petitioner, a certified public accountant, seeks review of a final order of the Board of Accountancy (the board), which assessed a civil penalty and required him to attend four hours of ethics-based continuing professional education courses. The board\u2019s order was based on the determination that petitioner performed certain tax services for his clients pursuant to a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement in violation of ORS 673.345(3) and OAR 801-030-0005(4) (Jan 1, 2004). As amplified below, we conclude that (1) petitioner\u2019s \u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u201d constituted a proscribed \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement and (2) the board\u2019s determination that petitioner performed tax return preparation services for clients pursuant to such an arrangement is supported by substantial evidence and comports with substantial reason. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We review the board\u2019s conclusions of law for legal error, ORS 183.482(8)(a), and its factual findings for substantial evidence, ORS 183.482(8)(c). Consistently with the latter standard, the following facts, as found in the board\u2019s final order, are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Petitioner has been certified by the board since 1999. In early 2004, petitioner distributed a flyer in a local newspaper advertising his services. The flyer promised a \u201cProfessional Service Warranty which <em>guarantees you the largest refund possible with the lowest tax liability or our services are free.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Potential clients responded to the flyer and engaged petitioner to prepare tax returns. Petitioner intended to honor the terms of the \u201cProfessional Service Warrant/\u2019; specifically, if a client had been able to demonstrate that a tax return prepared by petitioner had not resulted in \u201cthe largest refund possible with the lowest tax liability,\u201d petitioner would have refunded that client\u2019s fees. However, no client ever sought to avoid payment or to obtain a refund under the terms of the \u201cProfessional Service Warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Shortly after petitioner caused the flyer to be distributed, the board received a complaint alleging that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u2019 violated prohibitions against false and misleading advertisements and against providing tax return preparation services on a \u201ccontingency fee\u201d basis. The board informed petitioner of the complaint, and he responded. After an investigation, the board issued a notice of proposed civil penalty for use of false or misleading advertising and for violation of ORS 673.345(3) and OAR 801-030-0005(4) (Jan 1, 2004),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which, as described in detail below, prohibit certified public accountants from performing services pursuant to a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Petitioner requested and received a hearing, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a proposed order. In the proposed order, the ALJ determined that petitioner had violated ORS 673.345(3) and OAR 801-030-0005(4) (Jan 1, 2004) and that the sanction proposed by the board \u2014 a $500 civil penalty and four additional hours of continuing professional education \u2014 was appropriate. Petitioner submitted exceptions to the proposed order, and the board subsequently issued a final order, which substantially adopted the proposed order. The core of the board\u2019s reasoning was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cThe Board concludes that Respondent charged fees for the preparation of tax returns, contingent on his services producing the lowest tax liability and the highest tax refund, in violation of the OAR 801-030-0005(4)(c)(B). Respondent admitted the wording [of the \u2018Professional Service Warranty] could be misconstrued, and that he would have refunded fees, if a client had been able to demonstrate that the condition precedent, a determination of lower tax liability for the client, had been met. Respondent admitted to providing services to customers who responded to the advertising flyer, and to his intention to honor the promise of a refund if the conditions were met. We infer that Respondent provided services pursuant to the contingent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>offer made in the flyer. Therefore, the Board concludes that Respondent\u2019s provision of services under the wording of the advertisement flyer was a provision of services under a contingency fee agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">\u201cThe Board has considered Respondent\u2019s exceptions, but does not find them persuasive. Respondent asserts that his testimony that he did not prepare tax returns for a contingent fee was unchallenged and that no client \u2018signed or asked for\u2019 a contingent fee. (Exceptions at 1). On the contrary, Respondent testified that potential clients responded to his flyer and that he served clients with the intention of honoring the advertised offer. The fact that no client demanded a refund does not nullify the fact that Respondent established his fees for tax services pursuant to an arrangement in which no fee would be charged unless a specified result \u2014 the lowest possible liability and largest possible refund \u2014 was obtained. Respondent offered a contingent fee for the work and clients engaged him under that arrangement, which he intended to honor. If that were not the case, Respondent\u2019s advertisement would have been patently false.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">On judicial review, petitioner raises two principal contentions. First, he asserts, the board erred as a matter of law in concluding that the \u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u201d constituted a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement within the meaning of ORS 673.010(8) and ORS 673.345(3). Second, petitioner contends that, even if the \u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u201d described in the abstract a \u201ccontingent fee,\u201d there is no evidence, much less substantial evidence, that he ever actually provided tax return preparation services for clients pursuant to an agreement that included that \u201cwarrant/\u2019 as a material term. We address, and reject, each of those challenges in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Petitioner\u2019s first, definitional contention presents a straightforward question of statutory construction. Accordingly, we begin by examining the pertinent statutory text in context. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ORS 673.345(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\u201cA holder of a permit [to engage in the practice of public accountancy] * * * may not prepare for a contingent fee an original or amended tax return or a claim for a tax refund for any client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">ORS 673.010(8) defines \u201ccontingent fee\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201ca fee established for the performance of any professional service and directly or indirectly paid to a licensee <em>pursuant to an arrangement in which no fee will he charged unless a specified finding or result is attained, </em>or in which the amount of the fee is otherwise dependent upon the finding or result of such service. The board by rule may further define \u2018contingent fee.\u2019 A fee is not contingent if the fee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201c(a) Is fixed by courts or other public authorities; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201c(b) In tax matters, is determined based on the results of judicial proceedings or the findings of governmental agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">(Emphasis added.) The pertinent portions of the applicable administrative rule, OAR 801-030-0005(4) (Jan 1, 2004), are virtually identical to those statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Petitioner first contends that the \u201cProfessional Service Warrant/\u2019 was not, and could not be, a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement because it contemplates that, if the client could demonstrate that the services did not achieve the promised result, petitioner would <em>refund </em>the fee. That is, in petitioner\u2019s view, the \u201cwarrant/\u2019 is, at most, a \u201cmoney back guarantee\u201d\u2014 and such an arrangement necessarily assumes that the client has paid a fee: \u2018What the advertisement states is that monies <em>already charged </em>may be refunded.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s emphasis.) In sum, petitioner contends that a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement means that no payment is made for performance of professional services unless or until a specified result is obtained. Conversely, if payment is made, even if the professional\u2019s ultimate entitlement to retain that fee depends on some specified condition, the payment is not a \u201ccontingent fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The board remonstrates that petitioner conveniently recasts the \u201cwarrant/\u2019 and construes the statute in such a way as to elevate form over substance, sanctioning subterfuge. The board emphasizes that the \u201cwarranty\u201d does not state that \u201cmonies already charged may be refunded\u201d; rather, it guarantees that petitioner\u2019s services will achieve a particular result \u2014 \u201cthe largest refund possible with the lowest tax liability\u201d \u2014 or \u201cour services are <em>free.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In that event, the board asserts, the client ultimately will have no obligation to pay and, thus, ultimately \u201cno fee will be charged.\u201d In a related sense, the board suggests that petitioner\u2019s construction of ORS 673.010(8) and ORS 673.345 would allow practitioners to subvert the statutory policy \u2014 a policy of prohibiting accountants, with respect to the performance of certain services, from basing their fees on results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>obtained \u2014 simply through the ploy of inverting the \u201ccontingency,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>by promising a refund if the contingency did not occur, rather than not requiring payment until the contingency did occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">We proceed to context. Several provisions are instructive. First, and most proximately, the operative language, \u201cin which no fee will be charged unless a specified finding or result is obtained,\u201d must be juxtaposed with the immediately adjacent and interconnected phrase, \u201cor in which the amount of the fee is <em>otherwise </em>dependent upon the finding or result of such service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cOtherwise,\u201d as so used, necessarily refers to the circumstances described in the first phrase \u2014 and, in so doing, functionally equates \u201cfee * * * charged\u201d with \u201cthe amount of the fee.\u201d So understood, a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement is one by which either (1) the professional is not entitled to receive a fee \u201cunless a specified finding or result is obtained\u201d or (2) the professional\u2019s fee will \u201cotherwise\u201d vary depending on the results achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">That formulation corroborates the board\u2019s construction. The statutory design focuses on the contingent nature of the accountant\u2019s ultimate entitlement to the fee, and not on the timing of the payment for professional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Other aspects of statutory context, including other provisions of ORS 673.345 prohibiting \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangements, confirm that the <em>sine qua non </em>of a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d agreement is whether the accountant\u2019s ultimate entitlement to a fee depends on the results achieved. Significantly, subject to certain exceptions, including the prohibition in ORS 673.345(3), accountants are generally permitted to enter into \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangements in relation to the performance of services. ORS 673.345(2)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cA holder of a permit under ORS 673.150 or a business organization registered under ORS 673.160 may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201c(A) Perform for a contingent fee any professional service for a client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\u201c(B) Receive a contingent fee for any professional service performed for a client.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Thus, subject to specified exceptions, accountants may perform professional services for a contingent fee and receive a contingent fee for services performed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In addition to the exceptions stated in ORS 673.345(3), paragraph (2)(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, a holder or business organization may not accept a contingent fee under paragraph (a) of this subsection from a client for whom the holder or business organization, or any of the partners, officers, shareholders, members, managers or owners of the holder or business organization, performs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201c(A) <em>Client attestation services', </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201c(B) A compilation of a financial statement for the client, if the compilation report does not disclose a lack of independence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">(Emphasis added.) \u201cAttestation\u201d for these purposes means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">\u201c[T]he opinion of a licensee as to the reliability or fairness of information that is used for guidance in the financial transactions of, accounting for or assessing the status or performance of, commercial and noncommercial enterprises, whether public or private, following the completion of an audit, in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">ORS 673.010(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The thrust of the paragraph (2)(b) exceptions is that accountants who render certain opinions on behalf of a client, on which the client and others are expected to rely, are prohibited from having a \u201cpiece of the action\u201d in that client\u2019s affairs by way of \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangements. That is, the accountant\u2019s professional role as an honest and neutral actor in those circumstances is not to be compromised, even potentially, by the fact that his or her income may depend on the outcome or consequences of his or her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Again, that context supports the board\u2019s construction and application of ORS 673.010(8) and ORS 673.345(3) in this case. For purposes of the prohibition on \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangements, it makes no ultimate difference, functionally, whether an accountant who performs \u201cclient attestation\u201d services (a) agrees with the client that no fee must be paid unless a specified contingency occurs or (b) gives a \u201cmoney back guarantee\u201d in the event that that contingency does not occur. The \u201cvice\u201d \u2014 the potentially compromising entanglement of self-interest \u2014 is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">We note, finally, by way of analogy \u2014 if not precise <em>PGE </em>\u201ccontext\u201d \u2014 parallels in prohibitions on certain \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangements in the legal profession. Specifically, Oregon Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cA lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge or collect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201c(1) any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of spousal or child support or a property settlement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201c(2) a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Arrangements by which a lawyer promised \u201cYou get the house, or my services are free\u201d or \u201cAcquittal or your money back\u201d would, doubtless, run afoul of those prohibitions. <em>See, e.g., Louisiana State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Nader, </em>472 So 2d 11, 13 (1985) (lawyer\u2019s promise of a \u201crefund\u201d of fees if he did not achieve a particular result violated the prohibition on contingent fee arrangements in criminal cases: \u201c[A] promise to refund [a] fee if the promised outcome is not achieved * * * is * * * clearly a contingent fee arrangement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The same is true here. The proper focus under ORS 673.010(8) and ORS 673.345 is not on <em>when </em>petitioner received payment for services, but, rather, on whether his ultimate fee entitlement was contingent. Because here petitioner\u2019s ultimate entitlement to payment is dependent on the \u201cresult\u201d of his services, the \u201cor our services are free\u201d promise described a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement for purposes of those statutes. The board correctly so concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Petitioner contends, nevertheless, that the \u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u201d is not a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d device for a second reason, viz., that it merely states that he \u201cwill provide what every accountant is expected to deliver to his or her clients\u201d \u2014 that is, it is simply a \u201cpromise of competent performance\u201d and a promise to \u201cprovide services to the best of [his] ability\u201d \u2014 and not of a \u201cspecified result.\u201d Again, petitioner\u2019s characterization of the warranty is selectively self-serving. \u201c[T]he largest refund possible\u201d coupled with the \u201clowest tax liability\u2019 is, in fact, a \u201cspecified result\u201d \u2014 as opposed to generic promises of competent and diligent performance \u2014 and petitioner\u2019s fee entitlement was contingent upon achieving those results.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Finally, with respect to the statutory definition of \u201ccontingent fee,\u201d petitioner asserts that the \u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u2019 here falls within the exception for fees \u201c[i]n tax matters [that are] determined based on the results of judicial proceedings or the findings of governmental agencies.\u201d ORS 673.010(8)(b). Petitioner apparently reasons that, because the Internal Revenue Service and state revenue departments are \u201cgovernmental agencies,\u201d the client\u2019s entitlement to a refund of fees based on the \u201clargest refund possible with the lowest tax liability\u201d benchmark depends on the \u201cfindings\u201d of such \u201cagencies.\u201d Again, that argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Petitioner\u2019s proposition fails in the first instance because, if true, it would render the prohibition in ORS 673.345(3) a nullity. \u201cContingent fee\u201d arrangements with respect to tax return preparation services will, necessarily, depend on determinations by federal and state revenue authorities. Beyond that, as noted, the definition of contingent fees in ORS 673.010(8) is derived from UAA, section 14(o)(3), which, in turn, was derived from the AICPA\u2019s Code of Professional Conduct, Rule 302(2). <em>See </em>212 Or App at 355 n 3. The commentary to Rule 302 describes the scope of that exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cA fee is considered determined based on the findings of governmental agencies if the member can demonstrate a reasonable expectation, at the time of a fee arrangement, of substantive consideration by an agency with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>member\u2019s client. <em>Such an expectation is deemed not reasonable in the case of preparation of original tax returns.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, ORS 673.010(8)(a) and (b) are inapposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We turn to petitioner\u2019s second principal argument. Petitioner contends that, even assuming the \u201cProfessional Service Warrant/\u2019 describes a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement, there is no evidence, much less substantial evidence, that he ever actually performed services pursuant to such an arrangement. Specifically, petitioner contends that, because his flyer was not an \u201coffer\u201d capable of acceptance, and because the terms of the flyer were not incorporated into his subsequent written agreements with his clients, the terms of the flyer never became a term of his contracts with his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">An advertisement may or may not, depending on various circumstances, constitute an offer. <em>See Kane v. League of Oregon Cities, </em>66 Or App 836, 840, 676 P2d 901, <em>rev den, </em>296 Or 829 (1984) (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 26 (1981)). As the <em>Restatement </em>explains, advertisements of goods and services \u201care not ordinarily intended or understood as offers.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 26 comment b. However, under certain circumstances, depending on the language of the advertisement itself, it is \u201cpossible to make an offer by an advertisement directed to the general public.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Kane, 66 </em>Or App at 840 (concluding that, because no \u201creasonable person in the position of [the] plaintiff would have been led to believe that [the] defendants\u2019 announcement was an offer,\u201d the plaintiffs purported \u201cacceptance\u201d did not form a contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Here, the board based its finding that petitioner had, in fact, performed services pursuant to the terms of the \u201cProfessional Service Warrant/\u2019 on three predicate factual determinations: (1) prospective clients contacted petitioner\u2019s office in response to the advertising flyer that included the \u201cwarrant/\u2019; (2) petitioner did, in fact, perform tax return preparation services for at least some of those individuals; and (3) petitioner remained committed throughout to honoring the terms of the \u201cwarranty.\u201d Each of those predicate findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>is supported by substantial evidence \u2014 and we do not understand petitioner to contend otherwise. Specifically, at the hearing, petitioner testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cQ. And so did you intend to adhere to th[e] professional service warranty when you advertised it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cA. As a warranty, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\"><em>% </em>\u2021 \u00ed{\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cQ. And did anybody bring this little flyer into your office and say, \u2018I saw your ad, and I want you to do my taxes\u2019? Or anything close to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cA. We had clients respond to the flyer and contact us to provide services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cQ. Okay. And so I guess then did you subsequently provide tax services to those clients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cA. Yes[J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">Hi * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cQ. * * * So when you used the flyer, did you have an intention to honor that professional service warranty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">\u201cA. The warranty, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">\u00ab\u00edj\u00ed iji iji ifc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">\u201cQ. And so if [clients] brought their refund back to you and demonstrated that you did not get them the lowest tax liability, would you have refunded your fee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">The question thus narrows to whether those facts rationally support the board\u2019s ultimate inference that the \u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u201d was a material term of petitioner\u2019s agreement, with at least one client, to provide tax return preparation services. In <em>City of Roseburg v. Roseburg City Firefighters, </em>292 Or 266, 271-72, 639 P2d 90 (1981), the court described the scope of our review in such circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">\u201cThe substantial evidence rule is not entirely dispositive in reviewing findings which embody inferences. An inference has two parts: a primary fact plus a deduction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The evidence directly establishes only the truth of the primary fact or facts from which an inference may be derived therefrom. Rational bases may exist for more than one inference to be drawn from the same primary fact, and the factfinder (i.e., the agency) has the task to decide which one to draw. The court does not substitute its judgment as to which inference should be drawn, but it must review for the existence of a rationale. The rationale is reviewed for soundness, not for conformity to judicial preference. Judicial review of an inference is thus in two stages: (1) whether the basic fact or facts are supported by substantial evidence, and (2) whether there is a basis in reason connecting the inference to the facts from which it is derived. It is a twofold review for substantial evidence and, in a sense, for \u2018substantial reason [.]\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cOn judicial review, the court will not substitute its judgment for that of the agency in drawing an inference, but the court must be satisfied that agency judgment has actually been exercised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Here, petitioner contends that the board\u2019s ultimate inference does not comport with substantial reason. In that regard, petitioner emphasizes that there is no evidence that the \u201cProfessional Service Warranty\u201d was included as a term of any written agreement with any client and that no client ever demanded a refund pursuant to the \u201cwarranty.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We note, at the outset, that the board was not obligated to credit petitioner\u2019s testimony that his oral or written agreements with clients did not \u201cspecifically\u201d \u201cincorporat[e] th[e] flyer language.\u201d Indeed, petitioner did not present as exhibits copies of any written agreements for tax return preparation services \u2014 and, in all events, petitioner identified nothing in those written agreements that precludes the existence of additional terms. The mere existence of subsequent written agreements with clients does not preclude the possibility of additional terms or make the board\u2019s inference unreasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the undisputed evidence that no client withheld payment or demanded a refund based on the \u201cwarranty\u2019 is similarly unavailing. The absence of client \u201cenforcement\u201d could be the result of a variety of circumstances, any of which would not contradict the board\u2019s ultimate inference, including (a) petitioner did, in fact, achieve the promised \u201ccontingent\u201d result and, thus, was entitled to the fee; (b) petitioner failed to achieve the specified result, but the client was ignorant of that failure; or (c) petitioner failed to achieve the specified result, and the client elected not to pursue the matter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Conversely, regardless of when, precisely, an \u201coffer\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d took place, the board could reasonably infer from the predicate facts that petitioner did, in fact, provide services pursuant to an agreement that incorporated the payment terms specified in the advertising flyer. In particular, the fact that clients retained petitioner after responding specifically to the flyer with its \u201cor our services are free\u201d language and the fact that petitioner intended throughout to act in accordance with that representation reasonably supports an inference that the parties mutually understood that the promise of \u201cthe largest refund possible with the lowest tax liability or our services are free\u201d was a material term of the agreement for provision of professional services. The board\u2019s analysis and result comport with substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-6\"> The 2004 version of the rule was effective at the time the board issued its final order. However, the rule was amended, altering some of the language, in September 2005. Those amendments became effective January 2006, seven months after the board\u2019s final order in this case. The 2006 amendments did not materially alter the substance of the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> Ultimately, the board withdrew the false advertising allegation. That matter is not at issue on judicial review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> The \u201ccontingent fee\u201d definition in ORS 673.010(8) and the \u201ccontingent fee\u201d provisions of ORS 673.345 were added to ORS chapter 673 in 1999 and 2001. Or Laws 1999, ch 322, \u00a7 2; Or Laws 2001, ch 313, \u00a7\u00a7 1,2. Both were derived, albeit not verbatim, from the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA), sections 14(o)(3) and 14(o)(1)(B), respectively. Those sections of the UAA are, in turn, derived from the' American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\u2019 (AICPA) Code of Professional Conduct, Rule 302. The commentaries for those sources do not address their application to \u201cguaranteed refund\u201d arrangements. The parties here have not identified, and we have been unable to find, any legislative history pertaining to that matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\"> OAR 801-030-0005(4) (Jan 1, 2004) provided, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">\u201cContingent fees.

The \u201cperform\u201d and \u201creceive\u201d formulations appear to be congruent. The legislative history does not disclose why the Oregon legislature opted for such a \u201cbelt and braces\u201d approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> Neither party has invoked the parol evidence rule or discussed its application to this case. There is no discussion in the record or briefs, and there is no evidence in the record, regarding whether the written agreements described were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>integrated\u201d for purposes of that rule. Again, the written agreements are not in the record and we express no further opinion on their relevance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> In a related sense, petitioner contends that, absent evidence that he actually refunded a client\u2019s money, \u201cspeculation\u201d that he would, in fact, have done so is insufficient to prove that he acted pursuant to a \u201ccontingent fee\u201d arrangement. Petitioner misapprehends the board\u2019s analysis. The board did not base its determination on some prediction of petitioner\u2019s putative future conduct. Rather, the board focused, appropriately, on petitioner\u2019s admitted intent to honor the \u201cwarranty\u201d as being probative of his understanding of his enforceable obligations to his clients.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
