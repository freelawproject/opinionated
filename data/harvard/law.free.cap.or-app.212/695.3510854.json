ORS 419B.100. At the time that the dependency petition was filed, child was a resident of Mexico. The state concedes that ORS 419B.100 \u201cdoes not appear to permit a juvenile court to take jurisdiction over a child living in another country * * We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>Cf. State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Kennedy, </em>66 Or App 89, 94, 672 P2d 1233 (1983) (concluding, under former version of juvenile code, that \u201cpersonal jurisdiction over a child in a dependency proceeding is proper when the child is a resident or a non-resident who is taken into custody within the state\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
