The evidence was properly admitted pursuant to the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule <em>(see, People v Buie, </em>86 NY2d 501; <em>People v Brown, </em>80 NY2d 729; <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number><em>Montgomery, </em>224 AD2d 914). Because the evidence is admissible under an independent hearsay exception, \"we reject the bolstering concept as inapplicable in this case\u201d <em>(People v Buie, supra, </em>at 509; <em>see also, People v Lewis, </em>222 AD2d 1058). Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the People are not required to demonstrate a pressing need for the evidence as a prerequisite to its admissibility <em>(see, People.v Buie, supra, </em>at 509). The tape was evidence of a \"powerfully probative nature\u201d <em>(People v Buie, supra, </em>at 513), the value of which outweighed its potential for prejudice <em>(see, People v Lewis, supra). </em>(Appeal from Judgment of Supreme Court, Monroe County, Mark, J. \u2014 Attempted Robbery, 1st Degree.)
