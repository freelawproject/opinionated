The note was not paid, but on July 14th, 1875, was finally renewed at four months for $1700, and on its renewal Broivn again pledged the stock as collateral, but the powers of attorney still remained in blank as aforesaid. This note still remains wholly due and unpaid. The said certificates of stock, ever since August 8th, 1874, have remained in the possession of tbe plaintiff, but lie never gave any notice of such possession or of his interest therein, either to the South Side Fire Insurance Company or to the defendant, until March 13th, 1878, when he notified Lafferty thereof by the following letter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-12\"><em>\u201c </em>Thompson, Bell <em>&amp; </em>Co., Bankers,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-13\">Pittsburgh, March 13th, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-14\">\u201cI-Iugh Laeeerty, Esq., Ass, S.

At the dissolution of the company Brown appeared by its books to be the owner of the fifty shares of stock aforesaid, and there was nothing to indicate on the books any transfer of said stock by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">On July 13th, 1876, out of the assets of the company, Lafferty declared a dividend to the stockholders of $15 per share, and on February 13th, 1877, a further dividend of $8 per share. Each of these dividends, at the time it was declared, was publicly advertised in the Pittsburgh <em>Daily Dispatch </em>on four successive days, but plaintiff, in point of fact, saw none of said advertisements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">At the time the company went into dissolution it was expected that its assets would pay to the stockholders fifty per cent, of the stock owned by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">At the time the first dividend was declared the Union Savings and Deposit Bank presented to Lafferty the following paper:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\">\u201cFor value received, we, the undersigned, John Brown, R. A. Brown, and J. C. Brown, do hereby assign, transfer, and set over to the Union Savings and Deposit Bank that dividend of the South Side Fire Insurance Company soon to be declared by said South Side Fire Insurance Company, and estimated to be fifty per cent, of the entire amount of the stock now owned and paid up by us in said company. The same to be applied toward the payment of our note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\">\u201c Witness our hands and seals this 1st day of October, A.D. 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-11\">\u201c John Brown.

On the faith of this paper, and without any knowledge or notice of the claim of James M. Bell, trustee, Lafferty paid the full amount of the first and second dividends, to wit, $1150, to the Union Savings and Deposit Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-14\">On February 19th, 1879, Lafferty declared a third and final dividend of $1.50 per share of stock, but before he had paid over the amount thereof, viz., $75, accruing on Brown\u2019s stock, he received notice from the plaintiff, as set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-15\">At the time of paying the dividends to said Union Savings and Deposit Bank the certificates were not produced or required to be produced by Lafferty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>It is the usual practice of all corporations to refuse to allow stock to be transferred without the return of an outstanding certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">The assignment was made to the Union Savings and Deposit Bank as collateral security for a debt actually due and owing by said Brown to the bank at the date of the exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">If the Court should be of the opinion that upon the foregoing statement of facts, the plaintiff is entitled in this action to recover from the defendant any or all of the foregoing dividends declared by him, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant for the amount of such of said dividends as the Court may be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, with interest from the date at which said dividends were declared and costs of suit. And if the Court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled in this action to recover any of said dividends, then j udgment to be entered for defendant, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">The Court entered judgment as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">\u201c Under the facts within stated we are of opinion that the plaintiff' is entitled to recover the amount of the dividend paid by the defendants after notice of plaintiff\u2019s claim, but not for the amount paid before such notice. Judgment is therefore now directed to be entered for plaintiff and against defendant for $75, with interest from the date said notice was given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-10\">Plaintiff then took a writ of error, assigning as error the above ruling of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-11\"><em>Thomas M. Marshall </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-12\">The mere fact that Bell had not transferred the stock on the books of the company is not important. He could have enforced his right at any time: Wood\u2019s Appeal, 11 Norris, 379. The assignment to the Union Savings Bank did not in terms cover the stock in question. Lafferty knew the certificates were out, and should have required their production: N. Y. &amp; N. H. R.R. Co. <em>v. </em>Schuyler, 34 N. Y., 30. The advertisement of the dividends goes for nothing unless the plaintiff had actual notice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-13\"><em>John S. Ferguson </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-14\">Plaintiff has kept silence for four years. The corporation has been dissolved by decree of Court for over two years. Plaintiff cannot now invoke the doctrine of constructive notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>R.R.
