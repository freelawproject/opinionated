L. Harinton, and offered to prove by him:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-19\">1st. That Joseph Calvert was surety on the note in suit, and that fact was known to George Good at the time he took the note in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-20\">2d. That the money which constituted the consideration of the note offered in evidence by the plaintiff was obtained some time previous to the giving of the note, and at the time T. L. Harinton obtained the last $1500, which was a part of the consideration of the note; at that time it was agreed that T. L. Harinton should get some one as surety for the money loaned to said T. L. Harinton, but no one was obtained as security for the money loaned until some time after the last $500 was loaned, and that the witness saw the note aud signed it as drawn by George Good before it was signed by Joseph Calvert as surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-21\">3d. Defendant proposes to show by the witness on the stand and other witnesses, at the time the note became due, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>on the 4th of December, 1873, that it was agreed between T. L. Harinton and George Good, that if he would pay the interest on said note in advance, from time to time, as George Good should demand the payment of the same, that the time of payment of said note should be extended for one year from that date, and that said interest as aforesaid was paid according to the terms of the agreement between George Good and T. L. Harinton, which resulted in the extension of the time of payment of the note in suit, George Good said that they would just let it go and say nothing about it to Calvert, the surety on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-6\">4th. That when the note fell due, according to the terms of the extension as specified in paragraph 3d, on the 4th of December, 1874, it was further agreed between George Good and T. L. Harinton that the time of payment of said note should be extended for another year, from the 4th of December, 1874, to the 4th of December, 1875, by said Harinton agreeing to pay George Good the interest in advance, and from time to time in instalments as George Good should call on said H\u00e1rinton for its payment; that the said contract was carried out and the interest paid, from time to time, as George Good called on said T. L. Harinton for its payment, the last payment being made on the 17th of July, 1875, and that at that date or when the note fell due, according to the second extension, the said George Good said to Harinton that they would say nothing about this agreement to said Calvert as security ; if they did he would not remain on the note longer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">5th. Defendant proposes to prove that when the note came due on December 4th, 1873, T. L. Harinton, the maker of the note in suit, was solvent, and the note could have been collected from him, and that he remained solvent and was solvent on the 17th of July, 1875, when the last instalment of interest was paid according to the terms of agreement specified in paragraph 4th, and that the note could have been collected at that date; and that when the note came due on the 4th of December, 1875, according to the terms of extension as agreed upon between Harinton and Good, said T. L. Harinton was insolvent, and that the note could not have been collected from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\">Counsel for plaintiff objected on the ground, <em>inter </em>alia, that this action being brought by an executor, the witness being a party to the suit as commenced, a joint maker, and George Good, the opposite party and assignor of the thing in controversy dead, the witness is incompetent to testify of matters occurring in the lifetime of the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The Court below overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">October 12th, 1880, verdict for the defendant, and subsequently judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">The plaintiff took out a writ of error, assigning as error, <em>inter </em>alia, the ruling of the judge as above set forth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-8\"><em>Samuel L.

When one sets up a defence that the other cannot use or that is personal to himself, the principal is a competent witness: Miller <em>v. </em>Stem, 2 Barr, 286 ; Talmage <em>v. </em>Burlingame, 9 Barr, 21 ; Swanzey <em>v. </em>Parker, 14 Wr., 441 ; Simpson <em>v. </em>Bovard, 24 P. F. Smith, 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-13\">The act of April 15th, 1869, did not change the law on this question: Simpson <em>v. </em>Bovard, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b148-14\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"APc\">It is clear that Harinton was not incompetent on the score of interest. He was no party to the suit on trial. As to him it had been finally ended by his confession of judgment. A verdict for the defendant could not have released him. And though, in general, a verdict against a surety will entitle him to recover besides the debt the costs of suit, it would not be so in the CRse where the surety has taken defence on a ground entirely personal to him. If he had failed in such a defence he could not make the principal pay the costs of his contest: Simpson\u2019s Exrs. <em>v. </em>Bovard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>24 P. F. Smith, 351. The other errors assigned were in effect considered and passed upon when this case was here before.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
