There is not a single scintilla of evidence been offered by which a jury could fix the location of this tract. But it is a matter immaterial in the judgment of the Court where the real and true southern line of that tract is, as it appears from the evidence that the plaintiff not only went upon the ground to ascertain that line, but that he went to Absalom Farwell, one of these defendants, for information as to where the line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>was ; that he directed the plaintiff to go to Norris Mayers, who knew where the line was, and he would show it to him. He went to Norris Mayers and inquired of him for the information, as directed, who told him, not by going on the ground and pointing it out to him, but by telling him how and where he would find it, and the plaintiff says he went according to the direction of Mayers. Norris Mayers, a witness called by the defendants, admits that the plaintiff came to him for this information, and that he gave him directions how and where he would find the line; that he directed him to the line he knew of, and the only line he knew anything about was the Baird line; that he had been- over the line twice and knew of that line, but did not know of the other line run by Mr. White. It would appear from the testimony of Mr. White that there was no such line run upon the ground until 1874, when he run it and marked it. Mayers testified also that the line he knew of was near where Mr. Baird had run it, and that he had been acquainted with that line for twenty years. The plaintiff alleges he went to find the line as Mayers had directed him, and that he found the line according to the directions given by Mayers, and that he cut all the timber up to it that he was to cut under the contract. He also testified that he afterwards got Mr. Baird, a surveyor, to run the line and mark it on the ground for him, and that he went over the job the second time and cut all the timber up to that line that was fit to make salable posts. If he has done this then he has performed his share of the contract according to the terms of it, and he would be entitled to recover in this action of the defendants the balance due, although it may subsequently turn out that the real and proper line of the tract Avas twenty or twenty-five rods further south; we instruct you that that would not prevent the plaintiff from recovering for all the posts he delivered according to the terms of the contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">Defendants excepted to this part of the charge.

There was no evidence in the case fixing the southern line of the tract. There was no official survey produced showing either the lines or the adjoiners, and if there was some testimony as to the northern line of the Willing tract that proved nothing. Under these circumstances, when Kohler acted under the information given to him by Mayers, to whom he was referred by Farwell, and who directed him to the Baird line, even if that was a mistake of Mayers, it would be a very harsh measure of justice to deny Kohler compensation for the timber which he had actually cut and delivered under his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
