Plaintiff called the defendant as his only witness, and she testified that she owned two or three houses and other real estate, and continued: \u201cI was willing, if it was just, to pay it. I asked Mr. Kreiter what became of certain interests they owned together, and supposed the sale of those interests had made the settlement between them. He insisted that note remained after settlement. I did not believe it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>do not. I believe the note was found among Mr. Miller\u2019s private papers after his death and brought to me. I think he had filed it away in an envelope without cancelling it. I have the envelope. I think the acceptances are there also. I gave the note very unwillingly, and gave it with tears in my eyes. He upbraided me for it. I said it should be paid if * it was just, but I believed there had been a settlement. After speaking in that way I asked him if he would give me that note and take mine. He said he would. The note he held was worthless, as there was no estate, and he was very willing to get mine. . . . Since the death of my husband I have had a constant struggle to get along. It never has been convenient for me to pay the note since I gave it to Mr. Kreiter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">1 have never had funds in my hands at any time without great inconvenience to pay the note.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">The Court, Henderson, J., charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-8\">\u201c As at present advised, we are of opinion that the payment of the note in question is optional with the defendant. It is only to be paid at the convenience of the defendant, Mrs. Miller. Her convenience is a matter of her own concern and comfort. It is not for the Court and jury to determine. Your verdict, therefore, should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-9\">Plaintiff excepted to the charge. The jury found for the defendant, and judgment was entered on the verdict. The plaintiff took a writ of error, assigning as error the charge of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-10\"><em>J. C. McAlarney </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-11\">Defendant, by the terms of the note, limits her convenience to the time when she has funds in hand or is of ability to pay. The rule is well settled, that whenever the language of a written contract will permit, it should be so construed as to support rather than to destroy its legal obligation: Lewis <em>v. </em>Tipton, 10 Ohio State, 88 ; Edwards on Bills, 154 ; Jones <em>v. </em>Eisler, 3 Kansas, 134 ; Byles on Bills, 6 Ed., 152 ; Canover <em>v. </em>Stillwell, 34 New Jersey, 57 ; 2 Parsons on Contracts, 4 Ed., 18 ; Guier <em>v. </em>Page, 4 S. &amp; R., 1 ; Chitty on Bills, 12 Am.

The plaintiff accepted the note with a full understanding of its terms. He was willing to refer the payment of it to the plaintiff\u2019s own sense of honor when she should herself consider it as convenient. He called the defendant as a witness, and she testified that it was not and never had been convenient for her to pay it. What would there have been to have left to the jury ? Surely not to disbelieve the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence, and that the only evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
