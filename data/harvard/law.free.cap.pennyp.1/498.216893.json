H. Burdick and Lucy M. Burdick, his wife, in right of the wife, against G. L. Strong, Byron Edmunds, and John Cowicks, to recover damages for a levy upon and sale of certain goods and chattels as the property of the husband of the plaintiff\u2019, which were alleged to belong to the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-14\">Upon the trial in the Court below before Galbraith, P. J., it appeared in evidence that May 16th, 1877, G. L. Strong recovered judgment against S. H. Burdick and John A. Dustin for $106.92. Under an execution issued upon this judgment, Edmunds, one of the defendants, a constable, levied upon the following property, viz.: About 100 bushels of corn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>in the.crib, 30 bushels on the wagon; about 4 tons of ha}'- in the barn; 2 ploughs ; a quantity of corn-stalks; 5 bushels of oats; 1 two-horse wagon, nearly new; 4000 feet hemlock lumber, dry; 1 grindstone; 1 mowing machine; 1 heifer calf; 2 pigs; 1 straw stack. On the 13th day of November the constable sold all of the above property, except the wagon, to various bidders, for $94.89.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">Prior to the sale, the plaintiff gave to the constable, and posted on the barn, copies of the following notices:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-7\">\u201cNotice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-8\">\u201c <em>Mr. Edmunds: </em>I forbid you to sell any of the property you have advertised on my premises for sale. If you sell my property for Squire Burdick\u2019s debts, or my interest in property here on my premises, I will prosecute to recover my property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-9\">\u201cI also forbid any person or persons to buy any of the above-mentioned property, for it belongs to me and not Squire Burdick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-10\">\u201cLucy Burdick.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-11\">\u201c Notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-12\">\u201c <em>Mr. Edmunds: </em>I forbid you to sell any of the property, or my interest in any of the property here on my premises that you have levied on and advertised for sale, for it is mine, and I will use all lawful means to recover my property and damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-13\">\u201c I also forbid any person or persons to buy any of the above-mentioned property exposed here for sale by Mr. Edmunds, the present constable of Mill Village.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-14\">\u201c Lucy Burdick.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-15\">Upon the trial the plaintiff claimed only six of the above-designated articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-16\">Counsel for defendant asked the Court to charge, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-17\">\u201c3. That if part of the property claimed by Mrs. Burdick belonged to her and part was owned by her husband, then her claim of ownership to the whole was a fraud upon the creditors of her husband, and must defeat her right to recover in this action for any part of the property, and the verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-18\">The Court answered this point as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-19\">\u201c 3. This point is refused. It would be a severe rule that would defeat the claim of a wife to property belonging to her because the evidence fails to substantiate her owmership in all the effects in controversy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Counsel for defendant excepted to this answer. December 10th, 1880, verdict for the plaintiff for $60; upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">Defendant took a writ of error, assigning as error the answer to the above point.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-7\"><em>G. A. Allen </em>and <em>L. Rosenzweig, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-8\">The ruling of the Court below in this case would render fraud easy, place officers of the law executing writs of execution in a precarious position, and make it impossible for them to do justice to creditors and at the same time do justice to third parties owning a portion of property levied upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-9\">Creditors have certainly a right to seize and sell whatever property the defendant or defendants in an execution may own, but the rule as stated by the Court below would cover it up under a false claim of the wife, simply because a portion of the property levied upon really belonged to the wife.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-10\"><em>Benson </em>and Brainerd, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b506-11\">October 31st, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A9A\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AQv\">The answer of the Court to the defendant\u2019s third point, which is the only error here assigned, was entirely right. The mere fact that the plaintiff claimed as belonging to her all the goods levied upon and advertised to be sold, and gave notice of such claim at the sale, when she afterward was only able to establish her claim to a part, was certainly not <em>per se </em>a fraud on the creditors of her husband. She may have honestly believed that she was the owner of them all, and failed to substantiate her title from defect of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
