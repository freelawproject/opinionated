All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">Upon the trial in the Court below, W. R. Stevenson testified for the defendant that he was city engineer up to April, 1878 ; that he was one of the sewer commission, and the other members -were the street committee; that he was not sure he did anything with reference to assessing damages; that as a member of the board he got up the plans ; that after they were made out and submitted to the commission, in 1877, there was a movement made for the construction of the sewer; that nobody viewed the property with him ; and that there was no one in connection with him in fixing the schedule of assessment and value of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-8\">Counsel for defendant asked the Court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-9\">That by the provisions of the act of Assembly, before the ordinance for the construction of a sewer in Spring Street was passed, it was essential that a board of viewers, or some other body officially performing the duties of viewers, should go on and view the property liable to assessment, and make a schedule showing the total cash value of the same and the amount each property will be liable to pay, and unless such view was made by said board, or other official body, such ordinance was invalid, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-10\">The Court affirmed this point, and charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-11\">\u201c Under our view of the law there is but a single question to submit to you. That this assessment was made and the notice of the amount in accordance with the law duly published, is not controverted. But the defendant says there was no view of the premises as provided for by the act of Assembly of May 1st, 1876. That there having been no view, the ordinance under which the plaintiff' claims to have the authority to do the work and charge the assessment upon the lot was void, and of no effect, and for that reason he saj^s your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-12\">\u201cThe ordinance providing for the laying of a sewer on Spring Street was passed January 29th, 1878. The date of this ordinance it is material for you to remember, as we will leave the question to you. [It leaves you to find whether the city engineer and the commission viewed these premises as a body before the passage of this ordinance of January 29th, 1878. Viewing afterward would not do. You must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>decide whether they viewed these premises prior to the passage of the ordinance. In pursuance of that fact, did they make a map, or cause one to be made of the district, showing the different lots and the amount of assessment upon each, made in pursuance of this view and after it. If they did, your verdict should be for the plaintiff. If not, for the defendant.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">Now, as to who should make this view is an important question. [It is not enough for one of the city commission to go there. All of them may go there on different days, but it is not enough. There must be an official act. They must go in a body. It is not necessary that all be present, but a majority must.] [In order to see who should make this view we refer to Section 1 of the act of March 11th, 1872. The civil engineer and street committee of the city shall form this commission for this purpose. The officers to make such view were the street committee of the city council together with the city engineer.] The plaintiff has given in evidence who they were, and they formed the commission whose duty it was, under the adoption of this ordinance, to have gone on the premises and made view. The first section of the act of May 1st, 1876, is as follows: (Act read.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">It is alleged by the defendant that there was no view by this commission, as provided by law, before the passage of the ordinance; and that such map and plan was not attached before its adoption, as provided. That there was a draft made by the city engineer, commenced, I believe, in 1876, of the whole of the city districts, and the draft made of all, including this one, attached to the ordinance before the passage is certain. There is evidence here sufficient, perhaps, for you to find that that was adopted by council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-8\">\u201c As far as the making of the plan, we think, there is evidence of its being approved by the commission and council, but did they go upon the premises and view them, and then make up the assessment after that ? [The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff; it was thrown upon the defendant and the burden was shifted.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-9\">[Are you satisfied that such a view was made by this commission as a body before the passage of this ordinance ? If you are so satisfied, then your verdict will be for the plaintiff; if you are not so satisfied, it will be for the defendant.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-10\">May 9th, 1881, verdict for the defendant, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-11\">The plaintiff took a writ of error, assigning as errors the answer to defendant\u2019s points and those portions of the charge within brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Isaac Ash </em>and <em>F. W. Hays </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\">The act of May 1st, 1876, is blind legislation, so far as many cities of the State are concerned. By none of the acts by which Oil City has been governed are there constituted any officers known as \u201c the board of viewers.\u201d The duty of making such view is not-imposed on any officer of the city. All has been done that was required. Township of Ridgway <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 9 Norris, 453. The defence is purely technical.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-7\"><em>J. D. Hancock </em>and <em>McCalmont &amp; Osborn </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-8\">The requirements of the act of May 1st, 1876, were wholly ignored.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b430-9\">Oct. 31, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"APN\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"A5e\">The commission required by the act of March 11th, 1872, relative to sewers in Oil City, was such a board of viewers as was contemplated by the act of May 1st, 1876, and which made it imperative that such board should view the property liable to assessment for the cost of construction of the sewers. It was properly, therefore, submitted by the learned Court to the jury to find whether such a view was made by this commission as a body before the passage of the ordinance. The errors assigned are, therefore, not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
