Now, therefore, your petitioners would respectfully remonstrate against any change of grade for said Troy Hill Eoad. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>from that now established, for the reasons hereinbefore set forth ; and your petitioners will ever pray.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">Upon the trial in the Court below, before Kirkpatrick,!., the defendant offered evidence to prove that the main portion of the property abutting upon that street was unfit for building purposes, and that the improvement was ma\u00f1nly a mere roadway connecting two districts of the city, for the purpose of showing that it was for general and not local benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">The evidence was rejected under exception. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">He also offered to prove that the property assessed was used for farming purposes, in order to show that it was rural, and not the subject of local assessment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">The testimony was rejected under exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-10\">The defendant asked the Court to charge that it appearing from the testimony that the property, at the time of the adoption of the acts of Assembly, was in Reserve Township, and not under the jurisdiction of the city, the assessments were unauthorized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-11\">The Court declined the point, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-12\">\u25a0May 25th, 1881, verdict for plaintiff, $281.46, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-13\">Plaintiff then took a writ of error, assigning as errors, the rejection of the evidence as above, and the refusal of defendant\u2019s points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-14\"><em>Slagle </em>and <em>Wiley </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-15\">Defendant was not estopped by his remonstrance. It shows that the work was of a general and not a local character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-16\">To constitute an equitable estoppel, it must appear that the party had made an admission clearly inconsistent with the evidence he proposes to give, that the other party has acted upon the admission, and that he will be injured by allowing the truth of the admission to be disproved. One is only estopped from alleging the truth when his assertion of a falsehood or silence has been the inducement to action by the party, which would result in loss but for the estoppel: Patterson v. Lytle, 11 Pa. St., 53 ; Musser v. Oliver, 21 Pa. St., 862; Reel <em>v. </em>Elder, 62 Pa. St., 308.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-17\">The acts of a party done in ignorance of his rights will not operate as an estoppel, unless others have acquired rights on the faith of them: Newman <em>v. </em>Edwards, 34 Pa. St., 32 ; Duncan\u2019s Appeals, 43 Pa. St., 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-18\">These rules are distinctly recognized by the case of Bidwell v. Pittsburgh, 85 Pa. St., 417.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>W. B. </em>Rodgers, city solicitor, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">An estoppel may as well arise by acts done during the progress of a matter as by acts before its inception: Graff <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh and S. R.R. Co., 7 Casey, 489; Cumberland Valley R.R. Co. <em>v. </em>McLanahan, 9 P. F. Smith, 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">When a party has acted upon a particular construction of a contract which has been acquiesced in by the other, the latter is estopped from contesting it as the proper construction : Mercer Mining and Manufacturing Co. <em>v. </em>McKee, 27 P. F. Smith, 170.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b433-8\">November 14th, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AMUQ\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AOm\">Without entering upon an examination of the several points raised on this record, we think, upon the undisputed evidence, the defendant below was clearly estopped by the petition to the council, in which he united with others, from taking the defence of which he now seeks to avail himself. lie admitted in that petition that he expected to pay his quota towards the cost of grading and paving, and that the road would be a local benefit to him by making \u201c the markets easy of access and convenient \u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
