That the original plan was evidence of a dedication by John Harris of the land in controversy as and for the \u201c English burying-ground,\u201d and being supplemented by proof that the same had been used for seventy years as a burial-ground, was, in the absence of proof to the contrary, conclusive that the said land was thus dedicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>6. That if the jury find under the evidence that the land in controversy was dedicated by John Harris for a burying-ground for the English-speaking citizens or inhabitants of Harrisburg, and that the same was used as such \u201c English burying-ground \u201d for. upwards of seventy years, and that the remains of the dead formerly buried there have since been removed, and that the said ground had been, at the time this suit was brought, abandoned for burial purposes, and was used by defendants for other purposes, the title and right to the possession of the ground was in the lineal descendants of John Harris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">The questions raised by these points were covered by the main charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">The Court, Henderson, J., charged, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-8\">\u201c We start, then, with the fee in John Harris. What else have we ? It is not pretended that this property, by description, was devised by him. The theory of the plaintiffs seems' to be that he died intestate as to this property. Although it is argued that even if it did pass to the executors under the clause of the will directing it to be sold, still the devisees entitled to the proceeds may elect to take it as real estate. We prefer to meet the question at the threshold. The plaintiffs are impressed, if not embarrassed, by the absence of possession for so long a time; and hence wo find their explanation in the allegation that the property was dedicated by him through whom they claim to the special use of a \u2018 burying-ground.\u2019 We have looked through the evidence in vain to find any act of dedication by John Harris. The ancient plan of the town of Harrisburg bears on its face'this piece of ground marked as the\u2018English burying-ground,\u2019 but where is the evidence that this was the act or done by the direction of John Harris ? It is sufficient, we confess, to indicate the purpose for which it was used at the time of the acknowledgment of the draft by the persons named, and it may be conceded that these persons were his executors. It does not, however, appear, that the same was made in their character as such. What then, whether as executors or otherwise ? How does this act of theirs tend to show a dedication by him any more than a grant or gift ? It is evidence that it is a true plan of the boi\u2019ough, and it may be conclusive in all disputes between the parties to it and the inhabitants of the borough. That is, it may indicate lines and determine locations. But beyond this there can be no pretence that it can abridge or enlarge titles or rights of property. It may show, and we think it does, that the right of possession was not in them or in the heirs of John Harris, deceased; but it does not determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>estate in possession or limit it to a mere easement or special use. We think it does not operate on the title at all. The fact then is that the possession has been out of plaintiffs and those through whom they claim for eighty years and upwards. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim to possession now is not strengthened in the least by the mere fact that up until recently, if you please, the ground was used as a graveyard, which is now abandoned. For it cannot be that this indication of the \u2018 English burying-ground \u2019 of itself on the ancient plan is evidence of a dedication by the founder of the town, or that the fee remained in him or his heirs. As this case now stands I incline to the opinion that the evidence tends to show that John Harris parted with the possession in his lifetime. It may have been an absolute gift accompanied by possession, without restriction or limitation to a special use ; the act of a broad-gauged, generous man, the founder of a city, who knew well the capacity and growth of his people, and made no attempt to hedge them in with graveyards. It is useless to talk now of the fee remaining in him for the benefit of his heirs-at-law, in the face of his well-considered will, after a possession adverse to anything like a claim of ownership for a period of over eighty years. Nor is this the ordinary case of an easement, public or private, where, from non-user or abandonment, the possession reverts to the owner of the fee. And yet whilst it may be admitted that the use of a piece of ground is not inconsistent with a dedication to this purpose, we do most earnestly hold that against those in possession such dedication is not to be presumed or inferred from the use. Then have we anything more in this case ? The words upon the plan can indicate nothing more than the marks upon the ground.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">After answering the various points presented in accordance with the foregoing general charge, the Court said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">\u201c And now, upon the whole case, I am clearly of the opinion that the plaintiffs have made out no case for the jury, and must therefore direct you to find in favor of the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\">Plaintiff excepted to the charge, \u00e1nd to the answers to the points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\">\u25a0May 5th, 1880, the jury found a verdict for the defendants, upon which judgment was entered January 21st, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">The plaintiff took a writ of error, assigning for error the charge and the answers of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-11\"><em>Hamilton Alricks </em>and <em>Levi B.

It was admitted the fee was in John Harris, the founder. Pie died in 1791, never having parted with it. As he died intestate as to this land, the fee became vested in his descendants. How, then, could mere possession \u201cnot inconsistent with the fee being in them,\u201d divert their title ? To constitute a valid title by possession twenty-one years hostile possession was necessary, not to be made out by inference, but by clear and positive proof: Rung <em>v. </em>Shoneberger, 2 Watts, 23 ; Hawk <em>v. </em>Senseman, 6 S. &amp; R., 21 ; Mercer <em>v. </em>Watson, 1 Watts, 330 ; Comegys v.
