The learned Judge says there was no evidence on this point, and the counsel for the defendant says there was such evidence. But in order to settle this controversy, we should have before us the evidence given in the Court below ; the whole of it, and that properly certified. Instead-of this, we have what the counsel for the defendant calls extracts from the testimony, and what the counsel for the. plaintiff designates as no testimony at all. Under such a presentation of the case, we can do nothing; the matter resolves itself into a mere question of verity between the Court and the counsel, the Court having the advantage of a <em>prima facie </em>presumption in favor of its correctness, and the counsel unsupported by any legal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Under such circumstances nothing is left for us but to affirm the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
