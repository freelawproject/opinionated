Neither William Nesbit nor his widow, Martha Adair, left any children, and William Adair died in 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-12\">Upon the trial below, before Bredin, J., the above facts having been given in evidence, the Court directed a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff, reserving the question, \u201c whether, under the will of William Nesbit, deceased, Mrs. Martha Nesbit took a fee simple to the land in dispute, and if so whether the plaintiff', administrator c. t. a. of Martha Adair, deceased, can under her will maintain this ejectment and recover the land in dispute as sued for.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-13\">Verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-14\">January 19th, 1880, the Court filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-15\">\u201c Both parties here claim under the will of William Nesbit, deceased, and the plaintiff also claims under the will of Martha Adair, deceased, who was the widow of said William Nesbit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-16\">\u201c The second clause of William Nesbit\u2019s will is: \u2018I allow my beloved wife all my real and personal property, with the following exceptions.\u2019 To my oldest sister\u2019s children five dollars each, \u2018 which shall be the full dowry unto them from my personal and real estate.\u2019 The next clause bequeaths five dollars to John Nesbit, testator\u2019s brother, \u2018 which shall be a full dowry of my real and personal estate.\u2019 Then follow several clauses giving legacies of money and personal chattels to James Nesbit and Allen Nesbit, brothers, and to Eobert Johnston, nephew, and Ann Johnston, niece, of tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>tator. These clauses contain no words indicating that the legacies given are intended to be in full of legatee\u2019s share of the estate. The ninth clause is: \u2018 And it is further my will that the real and personal property in the county of Beaver (the property is now in Lawrence County. \u2014 Judge), and known by the name of William Nesbit, without respect to any personal legacy, shall be undivided until the decease of my wife, and she shall have the whole right, title, and interest thereof.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">\u201c The tenth clause is,\u2018 If, after her decease, any personal or real property remains, it shall be equally divided between James Nesbit, Allen Nesbit, Robert E. Johnston, and Ann Johnston.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">\u201c William Nesbit had no children, and does not seem to have owned any other real estate than that for which this suit is brought, being the same which by bis will he directs to remain undivided until the decease of his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">\u201cThe first question is: Did Martha Nesbit, afterwards Martha Adair, take a fee simple in the real estate, under said will? That the phrase, \u2018all my real and personal property,\u2019 is sufficiently broad to carry the fee, will not be questioned. C. J. Tilghman, in Morrison <em>v. </em>Semple, 6 Bin., 98, says: \u2018 I can conceive no expressions more comprehensive.\u2019 It is true, in the clause under consideration, there is super-added,\u2018with the following exceptions.\u2019 And if we could strike out from the ninth clause the words, \u2018 and she shall have the whole right, title, and interest thereof,\u2019 and from the tenth clause the words, \u2018 if any personal or real property remains,\u2019 we would have no difficulty iu concluding that the devise in the second clause was so limited by the ninth and tenth clauses that Mrs. Nesbit only took a life estate thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-9\">\u201c The words referred to, however, so destroy any attempted limitation, if such was intended, as to render these clauses litigatory and void for that purpose. The words quoted are the antidotes, neutralizing the effect of the poison in those clauses that would otherwise control the second clause of the will. We consider that the decision in Jauretehe <em>v. </em>Proctor, 12 Wright, 466, and the opinion of Judge McQuffin as to the personal estate taken by the widow under this will, as affirmed by the Supreme Court, settle this question in favor of those claiming under the widow, and in effect decide that the estate given her by the will of William Nesbit, is a fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-10\">\u201c These decisions do not conflict, we think, with Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Anders, 6 W. &amp; S., 218, and Smith <em>v. </em>Bell, 6 Peter\u2019s Rep., 68, referred to by counsel for defendant. In both those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>cases the devise was part of the same clause that gave the property to the widow. Taken as a whole, and the clauses could not be divided into parts and the parts separately construed, the intention of the testator was plain in each instance to give but a life estate to the widow. In the will before us the reverse is the case. To reduce the estate given to the widow to a life estate, the clauses must be mutilated and cannot be taken as a whole, or the effect is to enlarge, rather than limit the estate given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">\u201cWe hold, therefore, that the widow of William Nesbit took a fee simple in the land in dispute under his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">\u201cThe next question arises on the will of the widow, Martha Adair, deceased. In the preamble to her will she states that she is desirous of having her worldly matters arranged now, while mental and bodily ability remain. She then gives a number of legacies by items, one to ten inclusive, and by item eleven directs that the balance of her estate be sold by her executor as soon as convenient after her decease, and that he dispose of the proceeds of sale, after the foregoing legacies, debts, necessary expenses, including $60 for gravestones for her own and William Nesbit\u2019s graves, are paid, by dividing the balance between Samuel McFate and the legatees aforenamed in the will, share and share alike. While it is highly probable that Mrs. Adair, either ignorant of her lights or respecting the wishes of her husband, did not look upon this land as hers to dispose of, yet there is nothing in the will itself to show that she intended to die intestate of any part of her estate, and such intention is not to be presumed. Raudenbach\u2019s Appeal, 6 Norris, 51 and cases referred to,\u00a3 where the words of the testator will carry the whole.\u2019 The will expressing her desire to arrange her worldly matters, and the direction to sell the balance of her estate therein contained show, on the other hand, that she did not intend to die intestate as to any part of her estate. The words \u00a3 balance of my estate,\u2019are sufficiently comprehensive to include all her remaining property, real and personal. See Busby <em>v. </em>Busby, 1 Dallas, 226; French <em>v. </em>McIlhenny, 2 Bin., 25, and other cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-8\">\u201cThe power to sell being given to the executor, the acts of Assembly extend to the administrator with the will annexed the right to recover the land by action, as his powers under the direction in this will belong to him <em>virtute officii. </em>See Lantz <em>v. </em>Boyer, Administrator, 31 P. F. Smith, 325.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-9\">\u201cWe, therefore, give judgment on the verdict for the plaintiff for the land described in the writ, with six cents damages and costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-10\">The defendant then took a writ of error, assigning \u2022 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the Court erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff on the point reserved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-6\"><em>D. B. &amp;. E. T. Kurtz </em>and <em>Dana &amp; Long </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-7\">It was held below, and is argued here, that so clearly and palpably does it appear by this will that the testator intended to give an absolute fee simple in this farm to his widow, that all the provisions inconsistent therewith and directing otherwise must become inoperative, because rejsugnant to this plain, paramount intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-8\">If this is so, then the clauses, \u201c in full dowry of my real property,\u201d and \u201c in part of a legacy,\u201d have no meaning; the whole of the ninth item positively directing that the property therein mentioned \u201c shall remain undivided until the decease of my wife, Martha,\u201d is of no effect; and the gift over, the tenth item, after her decease, to the four persons named, is to be totally void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-9\">But all parts of a will are to be construed in relation to each other, and so as, if possible, to form one consistent whole. And that construction is to be adopted that will give to every expression some effect, rather than one that will render any of the expressions inopierative. Jarman\u2019s Rules, 7th and 16th ; Redfield on Wills, part 1, 427; Earp\u2019s Will, 1 Parsons, 457 ; Leightner &amp; Leightner, 6 Norris, 148.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-10\">A very distinguishing feature of our case is that the positive direction in 9th item, \u201c it shall be undivided until the decease of Martha,\u201d is not a let or hindrance upon her powers as an interdiction of sale would be; it implies a division among the four after the death of the widow, who should come into possession under the next item. It was not contemplated that she should divide. The direction is directly upon the land itself, and is to be taken in connection with the next item, which has the same words, \u201c it shall be equally divided between James, etc.\u201d \u201c It shall remain undivided till her death \u201d carries the implication of a division afterwards as strongly as if expressly directed. That division implied is the same immediately afterwards directed, and shows the purpose to include the farm in this gift.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-11\">The question as to whether the will of Martha Adair carries the real estate of testatrix turns upon the extent of the meaning of the phrase \u201c balance of my estate,\u201d as shown by the words themselves, and as explained by the whole will. We must not forget that the heir can only be disinherited by express devise, or necessary implication ; in the construction of a will of doubtful meaning every fair intendment is to be made in his favor: Rule 5th, Jarman\u2019s Rules for Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>struetion, etc.; Bender <em>v. </em>Dietrick, 7 W. &amp; S., 284; Hitchcock <em>v. </em>Hitchcock, 11 Casey, 393; Cowles <em>v. </em>Cowles, 3 P. F. S., 175; Rupp <em>v. </em>Eberly, 29 P. F. S., 141; Miller <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 Phil. R.,_343.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">And this rule should be observed with more strictness than in England, because our laws of inheritance are more equal: McIntyre <em>v. </em>Ramsey, 11 Harris, 317.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">The disposition of proceeds negatives any idea of real estate. All the purposes of the will are realized by the sale and distribution of the goods and the proceeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\">Ho doubt that the word <em>estate </em>may include lands ; nor is it contended that the phrase, \u201c balance of my estate,\u201d might not pass real estate in a proper case. But in this from the use of the word \u201c balance,\u201d as well as all that precedes and follows, it is evident that the mind of testatrix is only contemplating <em>personalty. </em>At all events, so uncertain is it that she intended her lands, that the judicial mind is left in doubt and uncertainty; in which case the principle must apply that the heir cannot be disinherited by conjecture: Brown <em>v. </em>Dysinger, 1 Rawle, 408; Hunter\u2019s Estate, 6 Barr, 97.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-9\"><em>McMichael &amp; McConnell </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-10\">As to all this property, the testator says, \u201c it is my will that it shall be undivided until the decease of my wife.\u201d In these words, it seems to be claimed, is to be found the important limitation, which is to reduce the fee given in the second clause to a life estate in the wife. But we cannot see how any such intent can be tortured out of them. They do not in any way limit the quantity of the estate given. They do not have any reference to the <em>quantum </em>of the estate, but-simply to the manner in which the devisee should hold, use,, and retain the property, the <em>quantum </em>and extent of the estate in which had been already fixed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-11\">The testator doubtless meant to express by these words-his request or his direction, that his wife should keep and. hold all the property he gave her, both real and personal, together and intact during her life. But seeming to think that such a request or direction might be construed into a limitation of her absolute estate, he immediately adds \u201c and she shall have the whole right, title, and interest thereof;\u201d <em>not for her </em>lifetime, as he would undoubtedly have said,, had the thought been in his mind, but absolutely, as the words import.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-12\">If these words are imperative, they are in restraint of alienation and are repugnant and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-13\">\u201c An attempted restraint on alienation is inoperative and void, it being beyond the power of a devisor, after having, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>created a fee simple, to make it inalienable:\u201d Williams and wife <em>v. </em>Leech, 4 Casey, 89; Naglee\u2019s Appeal, 9 Casey, 89; Kepple\u2019s Appeal, 3 P. F. Smith, 212; Jauretche <em>v. </em>Proctor, 12 Wright, 466.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-6\">When we pass to the 10th clause of the will, we find that the testator did not himself understand that he had restricted or prevented the division or disposal of the property, either in whole or in part; on the contrary his language, \u201c if, after her decease, any personal or real property remains,\u201d clearly implies that he did not expect it would all remain, and that it was possible none of it would remain. It indicates that he understood the effect of the words he had just before used, viz.: \u201c she shall have the whole right, title, and.interest thereof,\u201d was to give his wife the entire estate, and that she might, and possibly would, dispose of it as her need required, or as she pleased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-7\">It is evident from the whole will of Martha Adair that she did not intend to die intestate as to any part of her estate. It is contended that moneys on hand and choses in action would not pass by the residuary clause; that as to them she died intestate; that \u201c thus the intendment that she did not intend to die intestate as to any part of her estate \u201d is disproved. This argument is fully answered by the opinion of Justice Gordon in the case recently decided in this Court: Appeal of the Boards of Home and Foreign Missions, 10 Pitts. Legal Journal, 99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-8\">The word \u201c estate \u201d is one of the greatest extension: Zerbe <em>v. </em>Zerbe, 84 Penna. State, 147 ; Rossetter v. Simmons, 6 S. &amp; R., 452.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-9\">No presumption of an intention to die intestate as to any part of the estate is to be made when the words of the testator will carry the whole: Stehman <em>v. </em>Stehman, 1 Watts, 466; Little\u2019s Appeal, 31 P. F. Sm., 190 ; Raudenbach\u2019s Appeal, 87 P. St. R., 51.
