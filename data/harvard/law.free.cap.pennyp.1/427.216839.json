A subsequent rule provided that \u201c in appeals from the judgments of justices of the peace, no declaration shall be required, but the prothonotary shall enter the plea of <em>nil debet </em>to the transcript, and put the cause upon the issue docket; and, on the trial, the merits on both sides shall be heard, without regard to the form of action.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b433-13\"><em>Held, </em>that there was no inconsistency between these rules, and that the latter did not abrogate the former.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajl\">Error to the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Westmoreland County.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-15\">Appeal of John Guffey and J.

On the 3d of February, 1881, the plaintiff filed a narr. copy of account and an affidavit of claim. The affidavit set forth:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">\u201c That the annexed account against the Webster Coal Company is correctly copied from the book of original entry of Harding &amp; Bro.; that the charges were made in said books at or about the time of their respective dates; that the goods for which said charges were made, were sold and delivered as charged; that the charges are correct, and the account just and true as stated; that there is now due and owing thereon the sum of sixty-one and 17-100 dollars, with interest from the 24th day of March, A.D. 1880; that no part of said sum has ever been paid or in any manner settled, and that there are no deductions or offsets of any kind, except such as are therein specified and credited.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\">On the 5th of March, 1881, the plaintiff entered judgment under the following rule of Court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\">Rule op Court, No. 10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-9\">\u201c In actions on recognizances, judgments, mortgages, liens of mechanics and materialmen, municipal claims, transcripts from the Orphans\u2019 Court, policies of insurance, book accounts, bonds, bills, notes, and other instruments of writing, for the payment of money, and all actions on contract for the payment of money, either express or implied, and whether the same be in writing or not, <em>and in appeals from the judgments of justices of the </em>peace, if the plaintiff shall file on or before the return day of the writ, with his declaration or statement, <em>or in cases of </em>appeal, <em>on or before the first day of the term to which the appeal is </em>entered, an affidavit stating the amount he verily believes to be due from the defendant, together with a copy of the book entries or instrument upon which the suit is brought, or where the claim is not evidenced by writing, a brief setting forth a full and detailed statement of the same, verified as aforesaid, he shall be entitled to judgment at any time on or after the third Saturday succeeding the return day of the writ, in original cases, or <em>in </em>appeals, <em>succeeding the first day of the term to which the appeal is </em>entered, unless the defendant shall have previously filed an affidavit of defence, setting forth fully the nature and character of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-10\">On the 7th of March the defendants took a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off, contending that the above rule of Court was abrogated by rule No. 19, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-11\">\u201cIn appeals from the judgments of justices of the peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>no declaration shall be required, but the prothonotary shall enter the plea of m, <em>debet </em>to the transcript, and put the cause upon the issue docket; and on the trial the merits on both sides shall be heard without regard to the form of action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">The Court below, Hunter, J., opened the judgment as to the defendant Hazlett, he having shown by affidavit good grounds of defence, but refused to strike off the judgment and discharge the rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">To this ruling defendant Guffey excepted and took a writ of error, assigning that the Court erred in entering judgment for want of an affidavit of defence and in refusing to strike off the judgment as to John Guffey.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-8\"><em>Hazlett </em>&amp; <em>Williams </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\">With the exception, perhaps, of the learned counsel of the defendant in error, it was the understanding of all the gentlemen of the bar that rule No. 10, as far as it relates to appeals, was abrogated by rule No; 19, and in all the appeals filed since the. adoption of the rule permitting such judgment, a judgment for want of an affidavit of defence is unknown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-10\">Rule No. 19 dispenses with all interlocutory pleadings. Being inconsistent and repugnant the later rule prevails.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-11\"><em>W H. Klingensmith </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-12\">By rule No. 10 the option is given to the plaintiff' to file his narr., etc., and compel the defendant to file his defence or proceed under rule No. 19. In either ease, or under either rule, the result is the same, viz., a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-13\">No advantage is taken of a defendant, for .before he can be called upon to exhibit his defence, the plaintiff is required to exhibit his cause of action.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b435-14\">November 7th, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Anc\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AE3\">We perceive no inconsistency between rules No. 10 and No. 19 of the Court below. The case as against Guffey was clearly within rule 10, and the affidavit of claim was entirely sufficient. If he was not a member of the firm sued as the Webster Coal Company he should have set it up by an affidavit of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
