J. McConnaghy against B. F. Douglass and others for $131.33. This judgment was assigned to the Indiana County Deposit Bank. An execution was issued upon it, under which levy was made upon the real estate of Douglass, including the tracts described in the above agreement, and they were sold October 5th, 1877, to the Indiana County Deposit Bank. Deeds from the sheriff for the same were duly executed, acknowledged, and delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-8\">On the 2d of August, 1879, E.

Irvin, as individuals and as a firm, as garnishees, on the following day. The garnishees pleaded <em>nulla bona.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-10\">On the trial in the Court below the above facts appeared in evidence, and it was admitted by the parties, for the purpose of the suit, that at the time ,of the service of the attachment on the garnishees and since, there was so large a sum of money due from these garnishees to Mr. Douglass on the sale of timber as would satisfy this judgment, and more than satisfy it, if it were legally applicable on this attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-11\">W.

How many years have you been operating on it?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-13\">\u201cAnswer.

This is the third year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201c Q. IIow long will it be yet before you will have all the timber removed ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">\u201cA. We have about another winter\u2019s work on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-7\">\u201c Q. How long would it take you to remove all the timber from that land, to proceed with it as rapidly as possible? What is the shortest space of time in which you could have removed all of the timber on that land?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-8\">\u201cA. If we had good and favorable weather we could have done it in three years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-9\">He further testified that no security had been given for the removal of the timber under the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-10\">Upon this state of facts, counsel for the plaintiff asked the Court to charge,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-11\">1. The sale of the timber upon which the indebtedness of the garnishees arose to B. E. Douglass was in law a severance of the timber from the land, which had the effect of converting it into personal property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-12\">2. After said sale, the interest of Douglass, the -vendor of said E. A. &amp; W. D. Irvin, was personal property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-13\">3. Such interest was not bound by judgments entered up against Douglass and others, the vendors of said E. A. &amp; W. D. Irvin, and levy and sale of it as real estate conveyed no title <em>to the </em>purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-15\">4. Such indebtedness stands on the same footing as any other debt, and is subject to attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-16\">5. Under the evidence, it being admitted that there is sufficient in the hands of the garnishees, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-17\">The Court, J. H. Orvis, J., refused all of these points, and charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-18\">We being of the opinion that the interest in the four tracts of land in Indiana County, sold by B. E. Douglass to E. A. <em>&amp; </em>W. D. Irvin, by articles of agreement of January 6th, 1873, was real estate, the.legal title to which remained in the vendor, the same was bound by the judgments against him in Indiana County. The interest of Douglass in these lands having been assigned to the Indiana Deposit Bank as collateral security for notes held by said bank, and subsequently having been sold at sheriff\u2019s sale and purchased by said bank, no right to recover the purchase-money remained in B. E. Douglass, and therefore direct you to find a verdict against the plaintiff and in favor of the garnishees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-20\">Plaintiff excepted to the answers to the points and the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-21\">May 23d, 1881, the jury found a verdict for the garnishees, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Au5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Plaintiff then took a writ of error, assigning as error the rulings of the Court as above set forth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-6\"><em>McEnally </em>and <em>McCurdy </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">If the interest of Douglass, as vendor, after his sale to the Irvins of the timber, with nine years to remove the same, was real estate, so that judgments entered up against him would be a lien upon that interest and hold the balance of the purchase-money, then it would appear to follow that the purchase-money would not be the subject of attachment: <em>Stewart v. </em>Coder, 1 Jones, 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">If the purchase-money claim was only personal property, the judgments against Douglass would be no lien, the sheriff\u2019s sale would pass no title, and, under the evidence in this case, plaintiff would be entitled to recover. The authorities are few, and none cover the precise point: 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7 271 ; Soller on Executors, 194, 195 ; Huff <em>v. </em>McCauley, 3 P. F. Smith, 206 ; Pattison\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith, 297 ; McClintock\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith, 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-9\">The assignment to Stewart as trustee not being recorded for thirty days was void, and does not affect .the attachment: Wallace <em>v. </em>Wainwright, 6 Norris, 263.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-10\"><em>Murray &amp; Gordon </em>for the garnishees, defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-11\">Before the' contract, the timber growing on the land was realty, and the rule is that it continued to be real until the owner should give it a different character: Roger\u2019s <em>v. </em>Gilinger, 6 Casey, 188 ; Shepherd\u2019s Touchstone, 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-12\">Much the greater portion of this timber interest was an undivided half, and could not be severed without the consent, in writing, of the other joint owners : Act May 4th, 1869, \u00a7 1, Purdon, 1467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-13\">It was treated as real estate by the parties from first to last: Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 545.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-14\">The time given in the contract for its removal is three times as long as the time necessary for that purpose, and it is stipulated that the timber should not be severed until other security was given: Huff <em>v. </em>McCauley, 3 P. F. Smith, 206 ; McClintock\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith, 366 ; Yeakle <em>v. </em>Jacob, 9 Casey, 376 ; Addison on Contracts, 31 ; Crosby <em>v. </em>Wadsworth, 6 East, 610 ; Pattison\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F.

By this agreement the Irvins were to remove the timber within nine years from the date of the agreement, and as to certain parts of the land no timber was to be cut until satisfactory security was given by the vendees for the amount of timber they proposed to cut. As no immediate severance was in contemplation, it is clear, according to McClintock\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. E. S., 365, that it remained real estate, subject to the lien of judgment against the vendor. His title passed to the sheriff\u2019s vendee, and w\u00fath it his. claim to the purchase-money. It was not then subject to the attachment, and the charge of the learned Court below was entirely right.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
