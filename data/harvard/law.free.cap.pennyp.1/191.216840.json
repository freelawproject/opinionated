To which settlement and allowance the said Georgia E.

Jacobs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-12\">Jacobs died January 5th, 1881, and left surviving him his widow, the said Georgia E. Jacobs, and one daughter, Anna B. Sieber, wife of Isaac N. Sieber. Both the widow and daughter made application to the register for letters of administration on the estate. The proceedings were certified to the Orphans\u2019 Court, which, J unkin, P. J., January 31st, 1881, made a decree directing letters to issue to Geoz\u2019gia E. Jacobs, widow, and Benjamin Jacobs, a brother of the decedent, jointly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-13\">Nrom this decree Anna B.

Tier interests are antagonistic to the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-9\">She can have no greater interest in the estate than the contract gives her.

In this case it is claimed the widow is deprived of that right by reason of her ante-nuptial settlement. If she had, in consideration of such a settlement of a specific sum, released all right of dower and all interest of every kind in the residue of the real and personal estate of her husband, there would be some force in the position taken. That, however, is not this case. Here she is to have one-fourth part of his personal estate and one-third part of the annual income of his real estate. Her interest in his estate is thus little less than if no marriage contract had been executed. She has a direct interest in the settlement of the estate. The Court committed no error in directing letters of administre tion to be issued to the widow and brother of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
