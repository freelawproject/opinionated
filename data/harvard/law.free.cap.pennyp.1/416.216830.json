Bell for $1848.72, \u201cthe first instalment of this mortgage and the interest due the second instant,\u201d and assigned \u201c the said instalment and interest \u201d to Bell. This instrument was recorded the same day. Contemporaneously Bell executed the following paper:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-33\">\u201c Whereas John Gilpin has this day assigned to me the first instalment of said mortgage and the interest due upon the mortgage debt up until the 2d inst.

Hare, in trust for the firm of Hare &amp; Son, $500 of the second instalment of the mortgage, payable April 1st, 1875, by an instrument recorded the same day. This portion of the second instalment was subsequently assigned by Piare to James H. Bell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">On the 28th of May, 1874, Gordon assigned to G. C. Orr the balance of the instalment due April 1st, 1875, being $935.72, and the instalment due April 1st, 1876, being $785.82, together with all the interest on the whole amount unpaid up to April 1st, 1876, and guaranteed payment of the same. This assignment was recorded the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">On the 10th of April, 1875, Gordon transferred to Orr the instalment due April 1st, 1877, with the interest on the whole sum then due and payable, and guaranteed the payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">Judgment was obtained upon the <em>scire facias </em>issued on the mortgage June 20th, 1877, and under a <em>levari facias </em>the sheriff sold the real estate to Bell, September, 3d, 1877, for $6000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-10\">Pending these proceedings, Gordon, July 11th, 1877, assigned to Orr, for the better securing the payment to him of the full amount previously assigned, \u201c all the rest and residue of the said mortgage not held or assigned,.....the surplus thereof, after sale of the property, if any, to be paid to me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-12\">The fund in Court for distribution after payment of the costs, etc., was $5568.73. The auditor made a <em>pro rata </em>distribution among all of the instalments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-13\">Upon exceptions to this distribution being filed, the Court found, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-14\">\u201c Bell, owner of first instalment and of interest due April, \u201974, claims priority of payment over the other instalments, because said instalment and interest was assigned to Gilpin, his assignor, and payment thereof guaranteed by the mortgagee, of which assignment and guarantee Orr had notice on the record before his purchase of the second and third instalments, and as sustaining this position quotes Erb\u2019s Appeal, 2 Penna. Rep., 296 ; Himes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 8 Watts, 39, and Datesman\u2019s Appeal, 27 P. F. Smith, 243. He claims that Gordon being a guarantor of the amount now owed by Bell, it is against equity for him or Orr, his subsequent assignee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>with notice, to take out of Court money realized on the judgment while any part of the first instalment and interest due So guaranteed remains unpaid, alleging the insolvency of Gordon. On the question of Gordon\u2019s insolvency, the auditor refused to hear proof. If we took the view entertained by Bell, we would require proof of the insolvency of both Gordon and Hall. A guarantor agrees to pay if the debtor cannot, a surety if the debtor does not. \u201c A contract of suretyship being a direct liability to the creditor for the act to be performed by the debtor, a guarantee being a liability only for his ability to perform this-act.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">Reigart <em>v. </em>White, 2 P. F. Smith, 440. A guarantee of payment at maturity of a debt is an agreement^to pay if the debtor does not; it is a direct liability and rather an undertaking of suretyship than of technical strict guarantee. See same case, page 441.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">If, therefore, Gilpin was the owner of the first instalment and interest, having made no surrender of his rights either against the mortgagor or mortgagee, we think the equity claimed might be successful. As it is, however, the arrangement between Gilpin and Bell has entirely changed the position of the parties, and instead of the first instalment being entitled to priority, it is postponed to the second and third instalments. This arrangement was evidently made for the benefit of the mortgagee, as Mr. Gilpin had no further interest in the mortgage ; its effect was to release Gordon from his guarantee altogether, and to postpone the first so as to enable Gordon to make advantageous sales of the second and third instalments. If Gordon had been absolutely bound as a surety on the record, such an arrangement would have released him, which position we think so plain as to require no citation of authorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-8\">Hall was no doubt the person who procured Bell to pay and take the assignment from Gilpin, and Gilpin.acted for the benefit of his guarantor. The effect of this, as Gordon must accept it <em>cum </em>onere, is to give Hare &amp; Son a priority also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">We therefore hold that the fund must be applied first to pay the second and third instalments, and the balance be distributed <em>pro rata.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-10\">The Court decreed distribution:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-11\">To Gr.

Patton </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-14\">When Gordon, the mortgagee, assigned the first instalment and interest, with a guarantee that it would be paid at maturity, it would be against equity to allow him to take the money out of court and thus defeat his own guarantee. Gordon was allowed to participate in the fund to the extent of $432.14: Datesman\u2019s Appeal, 27 P. F. Smith, 248 ; Erb\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. &amp; W., 299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-15\">Orr had no superior equity to Gordon: Himes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 8 Watts, 39. He had notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-16\">The undertaking of Gordon was that of a surety: Campbell <em>v. </em>Baker, 10 Wr., 243 ; Reigart v. White, 2 P. F. Smith, 440.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-17\"><em>J. Gilpin </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-18\">Appellant urges that inasmuch as Gordon guaranteed the payment of the first instalment to Gilpin, the guarantee became an incident, though not expressed, of Gilpin\u2019s assignment to Bell. The form of the receipt or assignment given by Gilpin expressly shows that the position of Bell was that of payer merely, doubtless acting for Hall, and making the payment after maturity of the instalment. As between Bell and Gordon it was an actual payment and liquidation of the first instalment, and no implication or legal deduction can be drawn that the guarantee of Gordon to Gilpin would pass and enure to-the benefit of Bell as against Gordon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-19\">It is clear that this is not of the character of cases where the payment to Gordon or his assignee would be interfered with or restrained. If the first assignee is not fully paid, hd has his remedy on the guarantee: Hancock\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey, 156; Donley <em>v. </em>Hays, 17 S. &amp; R., 400 ; Moore\u2019s Appeal, 11 Norris, 309.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b425-20\">November 7th, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AJj\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"Akz\">This decree is affirmed upon the opinion of the learned judge in the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"AKP\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
