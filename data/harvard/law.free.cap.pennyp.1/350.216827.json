In a feigned issue to determine the ownership of moneys deposited in bank to the credit of plaintiff eleven years before suit, defendant proved that the deposit slip was in his handwriting, that at the time of the deposit plaintiff was his business agent, that he, defendant, deposited moneys to the credit of plaintiff to be used in defendant\u2019s business, and that after this deposit there was a discrepancy in his account with plaintiff of about the amount of the slip which could not be found. Neither party remembered the transaction. The accounts between them had been settled long before. Upon the discovery of the credit, plaintiff'wrote to defendant: \u201cThe probabilities are that you deposited it to save bringing the moneys home or for some specific purpose and reported to me, and I have forgotten to draw it out.\u201d The Court charged, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cIf he (defendant) gave it to Payne (plaintiff) for any illegal or improper purpose it would be an executed gift, and lie could not take it back.\u201d <em>Held, </em>there being no evidence of an improper purpose or of gift that this was error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b356-14\">2. The Court further charged the jury: \u201c Was it deposited for a specific purpose ? to wit, in the name of N. H. Payne, to be used in the business of Egbert, or Egbert &amp; Brown, by Payne, as their agent? If not, then it would seem to' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>be a gift, in some mysterious way, to this plaintiff. There is no evidence of a specific purpose for which this was deposited, because there is no evidence upon either side, whether for a specific or general purpose.\u201d <em>jSeld, </em>that it was error, being a virtual withdrawal of the case from the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-6\">3. Defendant asked the Court to charge the jury that if they believed that the defendant deposited the money in dispute to the credit of the plaintiff as the agent of defendant for the purpose of having the money placed to defendant\u2019s credit in his account with plaintiff, and the money was never used for the purpose for which it was deposited, or in any other way for the benefit of defendant, then the money belongs to defendant. <em>Held, </em>that it ought to have been affirmed without qualification.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-7\">Error to the Court of Common P eas of <em>Crawford County.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-8\">Feigned issue, wherein N. H. Payne was plaintiff and M. C. Egbert defendant, to determine to which of said parties a deposit of $1888.12 in the Second National Bank of Titus-ville belonged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-9\">On the trial in the Court below, before Church, P. J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-10\">For some years prior to 1870 M. O. Egbert, the defendant, and the firm of Egbert &amp; Brown, of which he was a member, were extensively engaged in the business of producing and shipping oil. The principal office of the firm was in New York, but they did business along Oil Creek, and at Pittsburgh, and in Philadelphia. N. H. Payne, the plaintiff', as agent for Egbert and Egbert &amp; Brown had almost exclusive charge of their business along Oil Creek. Large sums of money were from time to time deposited by them to his credit in the banks at Titusville and. at other places in the oil country, and he drew on them personally as he required money, usually for $5000 at a time. He sent them balance-sheets every month, which were vii\u2019tual settlements of the accounts, crediting them with the money received and charging them with that expended. There -was a final settlement between them in August, 1870. About that time Payne, according to his own testimony, was worth four or five thousand dollars, and had something convertible into money, besides a farm and some interests in wells.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-11\">In the fall of 1880 the cashier of the Second National Bank of Titusville called the attention of Payne to the fact that there was a credit on the books of the bank of $1883.12 to P. H. Payne. Upon investigation the following deposit slip upon which the credit had been given was found:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-12\">\u201c Deposited in the Second National Bank by N. H. Payne, Titusville, Pa., January 28th, 1870, current, 1883.12.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-13\">By mistake it had been entered to the credit of <em>P. </em>II. Payne instead of <em>N. </em>H. Payne. The slip was in the handwriting of the defendant, Egbert. The cashier testified: \u201cWe both concluded then that the writing on the slip was. Dr. Egbert\u2019s. He (Payne) did not recall the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>under which the deposit was made when I showed him the slip. lie did not know anything about it and said it must have been a deposit the doctor had made for him which he had overlooked. I told him there was no question but that the deposit had been intended for N. II. Payne, and we would at once correct it on the books. He then said he supposed he could check against or draw it at any time. I told him that as he had no recollection as to the transaction, and as we both had concluded that the writing on the slip was Dr. Egbert\u2019s, that before we paid it, it would perhaps be better to write to Dr. Egbert and see if he had any recollection of it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">Thereupon plaintiff wrote to defendant, and received a reply, which Letters were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">\u201cFranklin, Pa., October 8th, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\">\u201c Dr. M.

He says to me, you have a balance in bank here, which has been here a long time. On investigation I find that there was deposited to the credit of N. II. Payne, Januai'y 29th, 1870, $1883.12, which was never drawn out. On reference to the deposit slip I think the N. Ii. Payne is in your handwriting. I am unable thus far to find my old book of that date to show how it came to be overlooked. <em>The probabilities are that you deposited it to save bringing the money home, or for some specific purpose, and reported to me, and 1 have forgotten to draw it out. </em>One thing, however, is certain, I accounted to Egbert &amp; Brown for all money received from them, so there is no possibility of them having auy claim on it. Egbert &amp; Brown\u2019s account on their bank books is settled and closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-11\">\u201c Hyde said no other person could draw this but myself, and he could not refuse my check, but asked as a favor that I would leave it until he was sure there was no mistake about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-12\">\u201c I wish you would write me stating that auy money deposited by you to my credit in their bank was my property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-13\">\u201c Very respectfully, N.

Besides this I have quite a distinct recollection that at one time in settling our accounts there was an apparent deficiency of about this sum in the amount which I ought to have, and that the account was settled by me with that apparent disadvantage. You certainly have never had any reason to suppose that I was owing you such an amount as -would have been the case, if the amount had been charged to you as a payment from me. But there will be no difficulty in determining to whom this belongs, as the books will show for themselves. If it shall appear to be yours I will cheerfully join in an order for its payment to you, and I will expect you to do the same in my behalf if the facts so require. In the meantime I think it proper that the balance be allowed to remain in bank until we can ascertain the facts, and have written the bank to that effect.

Statements of a witness, a fact must have been as claimed, because of the existence of other facts, are not evidence and ought to be disregarded by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-16\">Counsel for defendant asked the Court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-17\">\u201c That if they believe that the defendant; M. C.

C. Egbert deposited it, for his own purpose, for N. H. Payne as the agent, either of himself, or Egbert &amp; Brown, how did he happen to make the deposit of currency of $1883.12? Would it have been natural or reasonable to have made it $2000, $1800, $1900, or $1850 \u2014 some even sum? He deposited in currency, cash, bank notes, silver, gold and pennies. It took even copper to make this currency, and it seems to have been in currency and not drafts or checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-20\">\u201c This $1883.12, according to the looks of the paper, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>pears as if it had been deposited in currency. He must have been to some trouble, or rather some counting of currency, to have deposited $1883.12. It took some silver, and for the two odd pennies he would have to give copper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">\u201c [Has he explained to your satisfaction that it was his money? If he gave it to N. H. Payne for some purpose, or, if he gave it to N. H.

This is affirmed, provided you find the facts as stated there, that the deposited money was never used for the purpose for which it was deposited. Was it deposited for any specific purpose? We are given no account of it. Was it for a specific purpose ? It does not seem to be deposited in opening an account, or rather, what a person would call a running account. There does not seem to be any other item to the credit of N. H. Payne, or drawn by him. It just seems to be specifically deposited ; not for the purposes of opening a bank book. A bank book does not seem to have been given to Egbert or Payne. Was it deposited for a specific purpose? to wit, in the name of N. H. Payne, to be used in the business of Egbert, or Egbert &amp; Brown, by Payne, as their agent. If not, then it would seem to be a gift, in some mysterious way, to the plaintiff. There is no evidence of a specific purpose for which this was deposited, because there is no evidence upon either side, whether for a specific or a genei\u2019al purpose. Egbert does not know anything about it, and does not tell you he does. That <em>\u2018 </em>must have been \u2019 whatever Payne says about it, and <em>I </em>must have been \u2019 whatever Egbert says about it, a verbal argument of both, just as counsel argued upon the subject to-day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-9\">\u201c The legal propositions are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-10\">\u201c Plaintiff\u2019s first point read:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-11\">\u201c Answer.

Smith, 287 ; Sims <em>v. </em>Bond, 5 Barn. &amp; Ad., 389.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-16\">There was better evidence that it was a gift than that it belonged to Egbert. The fact that the deposit slip was in Egbert\u2019s handwriting was the only evidence that he deposited the money, and there being no clear explanation of the transaction, the jury might have found that it was a gift. If a gift, it would be wholly immaterial whether it was for a legal or illegal, a proper or improper purpose. What the Court in effect say is, that if it was a gift for any purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>whatever, the giver could not take it back, and this is certainly the law. The witness had no right to state inferences.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Ami2\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, January 2d, 1882, by</p>\n<author id=\"Acf\">Sterrett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The single question of fact, involved in this feigned issue, was whether the money deposited in the Second. National Bank of Titusville, January 28th, 1870, to the credit of Payne, the plaintiff below, belonged to him or to Egbert, the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The deposit having been in the name and'to the credit of Payne, the money was <em>prima facie </em>his, and the burden was thus cast on Egbert of proving that it belonged to himself and not to the plaintiff below. He undertook to do this by proving that the money was deposited by himself, as was shown in the deposit slip in his own handwriting, and by introducing other testimony tending to prove that the deposit -was made, not for the individual use and benefit of Payne, but for the purpose of enabling him to use it in the business, either of Egbert himself, or of Egbert <em>&amp; </em>Brown, of which firm Egbert was a member, and for both of which parties Payne was then acting as agent, and that the money having never been applied to the use of either Egbert &amp; Brown or Egbert, still belonged to the'latter. <em>A </em>single question of fact solely for the consideration of the jury was thus presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">There appears to have been no exception to the admission or rejection of testimony, at least none is urged here, but the complaint is that the charge of the Court was calculated to prejudice and mislead the jury. In that portion of the charge which constitutes the first assignment of error the learned judge, referring to Egbert, thedefendant below, says: \u201cP\u00edas he explained to your satisfaction that it was his money ? If he gave it to Payne for some purpose; if he gave it to Payne for any illegal or improper purpose, it would be an executed gift, and he could not take it back.\u201d This suggestion of a gift for an illegal or improper purpose was unwarranted by anything that appears in the record, and was calculated to invite the jury to an inquiry in which their only guide was vague suspicion or conjecture. There was no testimony tending to prove a gift either for a proper or an improper purpose. It is scarcely necessary to cite authorities to show that this was error. In Stauffer <em>v. </em>Latshaw, 2 Watts, 165, it is said : \u201c To submit a fact destitute of evidence as one that may nevertheless be proved, is an encouragement to err which cannot be too closely observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>or unsparingly corrected.\u201d The same general principle is recognized in Sartwell <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 8 Harris, 117 ; Newbaker <em>v. </em>Alricks, 5 Watts, 183 ; Whitehill <em>v, </em>Wilson, 3 P. &amp; W., 405. The contention of the defendant below was fairly and clearly presented in his prayer for instructions. The testimony was quite sufficient to justify the submission of that proposition to the jury, and it should have been affirmed without the qualifications complained of in the second assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Some of the remarks made by the learned judge in that connection were not warranted by the testimony and cannot be regarded as harmless. On the contrary, when considered in connection with the previous suggestion that the money may have been given <em>\u201c </em>for an illegal or improper purpose,\u201d they were calculated to mislead the jury, and for aught we know may have had that effect in that portion of the answer covered by the third assignment. The defendant\u2019s point was virtually negatived, and the case withdrawn from the jury, by an assumption of fact which the testimony did not justify. Speaking of the money the learned judge says: \u201c Was it deposited for a specific purpose, to wit, to be used in the business of Egbert, or Egbert &amp; Brown, by Payne as. their agent ? If not, then it would seem to be a gift, in some mysterious way, to this plaintiff. There is no evidence of a specific purpose for which this was deposited, because there is no evidence upon either side for a specific or general purpose.\u201d Being thus instructed that there was no evidence that the money was deposited either for a general or specific purpose, connected with the business of Egbert, or the firm of which he was a member, the jury was necessarily driven to the conclusion that it \u201c was a gift, in some mysterious way,\u201d to Payne, as suggested by the Court, or that there was nothing in the case to rebut his <em>prima facie </em>right to the money, based on the fact that it was deposited to his credit. In either view the result would be the same, \u2014 a verdict in favor of the plaintiff\u2019 below. The radical error in this part of the answer is in assuming that there was no testimony, for the consideration of the jury, tending to sustain the contention of the defendant below. If such had been the fact, it would have been the duty of the Court to have withdrawn the case from the jury by directing a verdict for the plaintiff, but there was evidence, both direct and circumstantial, which it was the province of the jury to consider, and from which they might, perhaps, have found the facts substantially as embodied in defendant\u2019s proposition. The rule is, as stated by the present Chief Justice in Howard Express Company <em>v. </em>Wile, 14 P. F. Smith, 201, \u201c where there is any evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>dence which alone would justify an inference of the disputed fact, it must go to the jury, however strong or persuasive may be the countervailing proof.\u201d Among other items of evidence, tending to sustain defendant\u2019s view of the case, is the letter addressed to him, by Payne, in October, 1880, in which the latter, speaking of the deposit, says: \u201c On a reference to the deposit slip, I think the N. H. Payne is in your handwriting. I am unable thus far to find my old book of that date to show how it came to be overlooked. The probability is, that you deposited it to save bringing it home, or for some special purpose, and reported to me, and I have forgotten to draw it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Other facts and circumstances, which need not be referred to, had a similar leaning, and, on the whole, we are of opinion that the plaintiff in error has just reason to complain of the charge and the manner in which the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
