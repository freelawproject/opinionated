The Court below, September 20th, 1879, quashed the execution and opened the judgment, letting the defendants into a defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-7\">The case was then put at issue, and on the trial in the Court below before Kirkpatrick, J., the plaintiff proved the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-8\">The by-laws of the plaintiff- association provided for the election of its officers, including the treasurer, annually on the first Saturday in December. On the 10th of December, 1875, James McMullen was elected treasurer. The bond in suit was executed March 10th, 1876. He was acting as treasurer at the time. He was re-elected treasurer December 8th, 1876, December 14th, 1877, and December 13th, 1878. About August 9th, 1879, McMullen absconded, owing the association up to September 1st, 1879, a balance of $13,716.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-9\">The Court charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-10\">\u201c As you have discovered, this action is brought by the Mutual Building and Loan Association of McKeesport against the former treasurer and his sureties on his bond. It is claimed by the plaintiffs that this treasurer was largely a defaulter and embezzler in point of fact, and this is established by the undisputed testimony in the case. Eor the purpose of recovering the amount thus short in his accounts this action was instituted and is now pressed against his sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-11\">\u201c To this action so brought it has been suggested by way of defence (and as it will appear more clearly when we answer plaintiffs\u2019 points) that under the terms of the bond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>sureties were only liable for one year, and that at most they only can be held for the year of office first held by him and for which he gave bond. That is the view of the case we entertain after a somewhat careful examination of the authorities bearing on the subject, and after having listened as we have to the very elaborate and learned discussion of the ease this morning. And we so instruct you. This brings us to the point presented by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, which we will proceed to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-3\">\u201c 1. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys ask the Court to charge the jury, that under the evidence the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the amount of the deficit for the entire period of service as treasurer by James F. McMullen, from the date of his appointment in December, 1875, till he ceased to act in August, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-4\">\u201c And in answering thereto, refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">\u201c 2. If the Court refuse to charge as required in the first point, then the Court is requested to charge the jury that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover for any deficit arising out of the transactions of the first year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">\u201c Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">\u201cIf we are in error we can hereafter correct ourselves upon a motion for new trial, and if then we persist in the opinion we now entertain,- our opinion can be reversed by the Supreme Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-8\">Counsel for plaintiffs excepted to the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-9\">February 1st, 1881, verdict for plaintiffs for $245.26, on which judgment was subsequently entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-10\">The plaintiffs then took a writ of error, assigning as error the answer of the Court to their first point.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-11\"><em>George Shiras, Jr., </em>and <em>John Ewing Speer, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-12\">Under the definition of the word \u201c continue,\u201d it is evident that the meaning of the bond is that'it shall apply to successive terms, and that so long as he shall be treasurer the surety shall be bound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-13\">Where there is no restriction the officers may continue to hold and exercise their offices after the expiration of the year, until they are superseded by the election and qualification of other persons in their places, as when they are elected for a term and there is no restriction by the constitution of the corporation to that term alone, or where they are elected for a term and until their successors are elected and qualified : Foot <em>v. </em>Prowse, Strange, 625; Queen <em>v. </em>Corporation of Durham, 10 Mod., 146 ; King <em>v. </em>Lisle, Andrews, 163; McCall <em>v. </em>Byram Mfg.

To say that it was a continuous holding of office in contemplation of the wording of the bond, which contains no provision, express or implied, for liability for any future or other terms than the existing one to which McMullen was elected, and which term by all the testimony in the case expired December 10th, 1876, would do violence to the plain meaning of the words, and would be working gross injustice to sureties: Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Savings and Loan Co. <em>v. </em>Odd Fellows\u2019Hall Association, 12 Wr., 446.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b440-10\">November 14th, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ah2\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"Anun\">The bond of the defendant, as treasurer of the corporation plaintiffs, might undoubtedly have been so drawn as to make the obligors liable not only for the term to which he was then elected, but to any subsequent term he might hold the office by re-election. But it was simply \u201c during his continuance in said office,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>which necessarily meant the term of the office to -which he had then been elected, namely, for one year. We cannot stretch the language so as to make sureties liable beyond the letter of their engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
