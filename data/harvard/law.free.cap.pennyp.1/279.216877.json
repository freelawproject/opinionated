I copied our lease from the other man\u2019s lease, but 1 was not lawyer enough to put that in. . . . We were to pay him a dollar a day as long as we chose to hold it that way.

If we did not conclude to hold it I supposed it was to be dead. ... We did not agree to pay a dollar a day absolutely, \u2022whether we intended to operate or not. We were to have an option as long as we chose by paying a dollar a day. ... I may have forgotten to write out that part of the lease more plainly and fully, not being used to writing articles.

We did not agree to pay a dollar a day absolutely after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>thirty days as long as the lease run. ... I cannot tell exactly how long after the thirty days, but I' met Hartman and he said something about that lease, and I said: \u201cYou can do just what you please with that lease, for we don\u2019t want that lease.\u201d . . . Every time he said anything to me about it I said we didn\u2019t intend to have anything to do with that lease, because we didn\u2019t intend to hold it to operate it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">Upon cross-examination he said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">\u201c Question.

Certainly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-13\">Conrad Hartman, the plaintiff, and his wife, S. Hartman, testified that the agreement was that the defendants would commence in thirty days, and if they didn\u2019t they were to pay a dollar a day until they would commence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-14\">The Court charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-15\">\u201c We are requested to instruct you on the points presented by the plaintiff, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-16\">\u201c1. That the written contract between the parties, dated the 16th day of May, 1877, given in evidence in this case by the plaintiff, as the foundation of his action, is the law between the parties; and under its provisions, if the jury find from the evidence that the defendants did not commence to operate for oil on the premises therein described within thirty days from its execution, to wit, on or before the 16th of June, 1877, or at any time thereafter hitherto, plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action one dollar per day for each and every day from the said 16th day of June, 1877, to the commencement of this suit, on the 9th day of July, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-17\">\u201c We answer this pointinthe affirmative, as qualified in the general charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-18\">\u201c 2. That under the terms and provisions of the said written agreement it was the duty of defendants to proceed and operate for oil on the territory therein described on or before the 16th of June, 1877, and on failure to do so, unless prevented by the plaintiff, plaintiff is entitled to recover in. this action, as stated in first point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-19\">\u201c We answer this point in the affirmative, as qualified in the.general charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-20\">\u201cWe are required to give our opinion as to the true comstruction of this article of agreement. We have made it the' rule by which the rights of these parties must be determined.,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>and [we instruct you to be governed by this article in making up your verdict, and as we construe it jmu will construe it, and apply that construction to the facts as proven].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">\u201cThe party of the first part, in consideration of certain stipulations, conditions, and covenants, leases to the parties of the second part, their- successors and assigns, a certain tract of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">\u201c [In this lease the rights of the defendants are made to depend upon the performance of the covenants given in the lease. One of these covenants required the parties of the second part to commence operations for miuing purposes within thirty days from the execution of the lease, or if they do not, it requires them to pay to the party of the first part one dollar per day until work is commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">\u201cThese are the clear covenants. Now there is a provision that \u2018 after the expiration of the aforesaid thirty days the parties of the second part shall pay to the first party the sum of one dollar per day, when all the provisions of this lease shall be accorded to the said second parties during the payment of the said one dollar per day to the said first party/</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY9\">\u201c We think that means this: Eirst, That the parties of the second part must commence operations under this contract within thirty days. Second, That'if they do not, they pay one dollar a day until work is commenced. Third, If they do not commence work they have the right, under this covenant, to hold this lease as long as they pleased by paying to the party of the first part one dollar per day; but this right conferred upon them of holding as long as they pleased, upon the payment of one dollar per day, does not destroy the right of the plaintiff (under this covenant on their part to pay one dollar per day) to call upon them for the payment of one dollar per day for at least a reasonable time after they have failed to put down a well.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">\u201c Observe these terms: \u2018 The parties of the second part covenant to commence operations for said mining purposes within thirty days from the execution of this lease, or thereafter pay to the party of the first part one dollar per day until work is commenced/</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-10\">\u201c <em>\u2018 Provided, </em>That after the expiration of the aforesaid thirty days, the second party shall pay to the first party the sum of \u2022one dollar per day, when all the provisions of this lease shall be accorded to the said second parties during the payment of the said one dollar per day to the said first party/</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-11\">\u201c [So long as they see fit to keep this lease in life, it will be \u25a0continued in life. But they would not be permitted under that clause to so use it as to destroy the plaintiff's right to recover the sum of one dollar a day for a reasonable time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>after they failed to put down a well. If the defendants held the lease without giving notice of their determination not to go on to put down a well, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, at least, until they should notify the plaintiff that they did not intend to go on and put down a well. That is the instruction for the present. Now, what time did they notify him that they would not hold it any longer ? If you take that view of the case, you give them a verdict of one dollar a day up to that time.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">\u201cYou will find your verdict under these instructions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">Counsel for defendants excepted to the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-8\">May 7th, 1830. Verdict for the plaintiff, $331.82, upon which, subsequently, judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-9\">The defendants took out a writ of error, assigning as error the answer to plaintiif\u2019s first point, and the portions of the charge within brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-10\"><em>B. J. &amp; A. B. Reid </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-11\">In that part of the charge in which the jury were instructed to be governed by the articles in making up their verdict, the Court excluded the parol evidence of what was said and agreed on at the execution of the lease, which would have thrown light on what was obscure in the writing: Selden <em>v. </em>Williams, 9 Watts, 9 ; Chalfant <em>v. </em>Williams, 11 Casey, 212. The Court was driven to intei\u2019polate into the contract what neither party contended for, namely, that the lessees would be bound to pay the forfeit for a reasonable time, or until they gave notice to the lessor that they did not intend to operate. Clearly there is no warrant in the writing for that construction. Which of the other alternatives, then, is the more reasonable and consonant with the time spirit of what is written ? Is it likely that the parties intended or expected that, for not going to the probably fruitless expense of operating, the lessees could be compelled to pay a dollar per day for fifteen years ? Either that or our construction, by which they had the right to keep the lease alive as long as they saw proper to pay the forfeit for not working, and at the same time the lessor\u2019s rights are protected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-12\">The vice of the defendant iu error\u2019s contention and the Court\u2019s instructions to the jury is that they alike ignore that written clause in the lease qualifying the printed covenant to pay a forfeit. Unless that clause means what we contend it means, it is wholly useless and insensible, and might as well have been left out. For, if left out, the part remaining would bear precisely the construction that the defendant in error puts upon the whole instrument as it is.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Boggs &amp; Weidner </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">There is nothing in the wording of the proviso itself that removes the covenant to operate or pay the dollar a day, abridges the terms of the lease, or forfeits the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">The alleged parol agreement is utterly at variance with the written lease: Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, 17 P. F. Smith, 462 ; Miller <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Casey, 386 ; Shepler <em>v. </em>Scott, 4 Norris, 332 ; Callan <em>v. </em>Lukens, 8 Norris, 134.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">The view of the Court that defendants below should be responsible for the dollar per day until they gave notice of their intention to forfeit, was a middle course which has done them no injustice.'</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-9\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AMo\">There is nothing in the charge to the jury of which the plaintiff in error has any right to complain. The terms of the written lease were very clear, and there was no discrepancy between the written and the printed part. The lessees were to commence operations within thirty days, or thereafter pay one dollar a day until work was commenced. Allowing full effect to all the parol evidence, there was nothing to contradict or vary the writing. It is all the same thing in different words. The lessees cannot pretend that they could hold on to the lease indefinitely without paying anything, and the idea propounded that the failure to pay a dollar the first day after the thirty days expired, <em>ipso facto, </em>forfeited the lease cannot be entertained for a moment. It was, at least, the part of the lessees to put an end to it by a surrender, or an offer to surrender it.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
