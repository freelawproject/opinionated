G. </em>Eberman, for the defence, testified in substance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-12\">I wrote this agreement at the request of Austin Niles. I never had any conversation with Mr. Perrine or Mr. Giebner, nor did Bailey, Niles, and I have any talk about the terms of this agreement, but only talked about getting Perrine, Giebner, Bailey, Niles, and myself together to see what we could do about the matter. I gave it to Niles to submit to the other parties mentioned in the contract, and we were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>get together to see if it was satisfactory. I never saw the contract since until to-day. I never had at any time a conversation with <em>W. </em>E. Porter, the use plaintiff, relative to this contract or the conditions of it. There was no agreement between me and Mr. Niles, or any other person, by which Niles was to give to <em>W. </em>E. Porter the article in evidence. I first learned that W. E. Porter had become security for Austin Niles within a year past, some time last fall or winter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">Upon cross-examination the witness said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">\u201c I think I wrote the mortgage at the same time I wrote the article. My understanding was, in case we executed the paper, all of us, and delivered it, that we back-bail or secure Mr. Porter in case he bailed Mr. Niles, either by bond or agreement, executed with him or to him, to the amounts mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-8\">The witness also testified as to the conversation with Niles at the time the agreement was written as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-9\">\u201c Niles, T. S. Bailey, and myself had a conversation on the street a few days before the paper was written, at which time Niles said he wanted to g'et Perrine, Ur. Giebner and us together for the purpose of making some arrangement to give him assistance if he needed it. The day this paper was written, Mr. Niles said he could not get the parties together, and that he wanted- me to write such a paper or agreement, as he proposed going on it with them so that they could see what he proposed doing. He said that he proposed assigning to us if we could agree a number of coal and land leases in Springfield township, this county, contracts for the purchase of a large lot of land in Sandy Lake and Worth townships, this county, and in Mineral township, Venango County, and some oil leases on Mill Creek and near Raymilton. After some conversation I wrote the first clause of the article, down to the description of the property to be assigned, and then learned from him that he had not the leases and contracts with him; he told me that he had them at his home; I told him that I could not make the paper as I intended, a full assignment, without having the papers themselves so that I could describe them in the article ; he said that I could then go on and refer to the contracts and leases in a general way, so that when he showed the papers to Bailey, JL\u2019errine, and Giebner, that they could see what he proposed to do, and if they'were satisfied with his proposition, he would make an assignment on the articles and contracts to us ; he said he would go and see each one of them, and if they were satisfied with his proposition, we would all meet together and close the matter up \u2014 make some final arrangement. I then wrote on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the article, described in general terms the contracts, leases, and lands, as being the property he proposed giving the defendants. I then wrote at his dictation the latter part of the article, setting forth what he would assign to the defendants if his proposition was accepted. This paper I signed, and Niles took it away for the purpose, as agreed upon between us, of showing the other defendants his proposition to them, and he said that if the other defendants were satisfied with his proposition, that we would all get together, and he would assign them the contract and leases, and deliver them\u2019 to us. I never saw any of the contracts or leases mentioned or spoken of by Niles.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\"><em>Daniel Perrine </em>for the defence testified in substance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">Niles said he would get the articles and leases together and get us together,' and assign them over to us, and if he did not fulfil his agreement, his part of it, this article would not be binding on any of us, no one; that this article was a mere form to see what he could get the parties to do. He said this before I signed the article. It was a promise he made, as I was careful about it. He did not transfer to me or any of 'the defendants to my knowledge any of the leases. I did not understand we were to keep Porter clear.\u2019 We were to come on back of Porter. My understanding of it was, if Porter wanted bail we were to go on with Porter. We were-not to keep Porter clear, but merely to enable Porter to get the money, Porter being first liable and we afterward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">This testimony was substantially corroborated by T. S. Bailey and E. X. Giebner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">Defendant also introduced testimony to show that in 1875 Niles sent certain of the leases described in the contract to an agent with instructions to form a company and sell them, and that in 1877 Niles had cancelled one of these leases, and in 1880 assigned another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-10\">Plaintiff in rebuttal read portions of the deposition of Niles testifying that he had permission from the defendants to sell the Niehel and Curry leases, that he was to take charge of the property, and that he managed it and advised with them up to April ist, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">Defendant presented certain points, which, so far as material, will be found in the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-12\">The Court charged the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-13\">\u201c The case has been tried and argued by the counsel on both sides without especial reference to the particular issue raised by the pleadings, and as if it were denied upon the part of the defendants that the writing given in evidence was executed. It has been tried as if the pleas were <em>non e'st </em>factum, covenants performed with leave, etc., and the Court will treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>it as the counsel on both sides have treated it, as if it were tried under those allegations. The plaintiff alleges that by the writing given in evidence, signed and sealed by the plaintiff and each of the defendants, and dated MarJi 22d, 1876, the defendants, for the consideration expressed in the writing, obligated themselves to indemnify or secure William E. Porter -against any loss he might Sustain by reason of his becoming bail or surety for Austin Niles to an amount not exceeding $3500. That upon the faith of that agreement Porter did become security for Niles and did pay and sustain damage and loss, and that defendants are, by the express terms of the writing, bound to pay to Niles for the use of Porter the amount of damage and loss sustained, within the stipulated limits of $3500, which Porter has sustained by reason of his becoming such security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">\u201c [Assuming now and for the present defendants deny that the writing dated March 22d, 1876, was intended by the parties to be obligatory from its date, provided Porter did become security for Niles and sustained loss thereby, then the construction of the writing, its legal import and the liability of the defendants in this suit, brought in the name of Niles as the legal plaintiff, are matters to be determined by the Court. And we go upon this assumption, that any want of definiteness in the description of interests in the leases and articles of agreement for the purchase of real estate which Niles'transferred to the defendants as the consideration of their obligation to indemnify Porter, will not avail as a defence. In other words, the defendants are bound by their contract as expressed in the writing itself. And if the interest transferred to the defendants by the writing subsequently proved to be of but little value, this would not exempt defendants from the obligation to indemnify Porter, as the same is expressed in the writing.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">\u201c If the writing became obligatory on the defendants from its date as before mentioned, which will be for you to determine, then we may safely infer from its terms that Niles expected the interests and property which he transferred to defendants would increase in value, speculative or otherwise, and from the evidence you may possibly believe that defendants had similar expectations, because you will observe by the writing that in a certain contingency, that is, the contingency that Niles himself should indemnify Porter, or pay the debt for which Porter became liable \u2014 then this property was to be retransferred, excepting certain interests which the defendants were to retain; but, be this as it may, the writing itself shows that Niles desired credit; that to obtain it he needed some one ..to become .his security; that he ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>pected 'William F. Porter to become such security; that defendants knew that he expected Porter to become his security, and knowing this fact, and in consideration of the property and interests transferred to them, they agreed to secure Porter from loss he might sustain by becoming such security, up to the sum of $3500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">\u201c The writing bears its testimony that its purpose was to insure credit to Niles by defendants\u2019 agreement to indemnify Porter against loss in c\u00e1se he should become Niles\u2019s security. This being the deliberate written engagement of the defendants, I mean if you shall, under the instructions we shall presently give you, find that the writing was intended to be binding at its date, the defendants ought in some manner be compelled to comply with that engagement, to the extent that Porter has sustained loss within the limits mentioned in the article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\">\u201c [The defendants contend, that even if the writing became a valid contract as of its date, that Porter was no party to it, and hence that there can be no recovery in Niles\u2019s name for his benefit. The fact that Porter was not a party to the writing, we think, ought not to avail defendants. Having .agreed with Niles to indemnify Porter, if Porter, in good faith and upon the faith of defendants\u2019 agreement, incurred liability for Niles, it occurs to us that even-handed justice requires them to do so.] But how shall they be compelled to comply with their agreement ? Porter cannot, in his own name as legal plaintiff, bring suit upon the covenants contained in the writing of March 22d, 1876, because he is no party to it. He cannot maintain assumpsit against defendants, because they have received neither money nor property for his (Porter\u2019s; use, or to be paid over to him, and they hold neither money nor property as his trustee, and we are unable to think of any form of action in which he could maintain a suit in his own name against the defendants ; and if this be so, the defendants would escape all liability, and Porter would be entirely without remedy unless his right to indemnity from the defendants may be enforced by this suit in the name of Niles, for his benefit. It is not, in our opinion, the case of an assignor of a chose in action, and indeed we attach no importance in this regard to the fact that Niles has assigned the writing to Porter. [The case is rather analogous to that of an agent who, either by prior parol authority or by subsequent parol ratification, enters into a contract in his own name, under his own seal, for the benefit of his principal, in which latter case the action upon a sealed instrument would be maintained in the name of the agent for the benefit of the principal, and in which the defendants, if they knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>contract was for the benefit of the principal, who had not signed or sealed the paper, could take no other defence than such as would be available against such principal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">\u201c [We, therefore, with some doubts as to the correctness of our opinion, but which you are to take from us as the law of the case, instruct you that if you shall find that the writing of the 22d of March, <em>1876, </em>was only signed by the parties defendant, whether they were all together at one time or not, or whether the writing was then dated or not, if it was intended to be a subsisting obligation when they should all have signed and sealed it, then we say the plaintiff can recover, provided that you further find that upon the faith of that writing Porter did become security for Niles, and did honestly and in good faith incur liability therefor, which he has since paid.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">\u201c On the part of the defendants it is claimed, that at the time wheu the several defendants attached their signatures and seals to the paper which bears date March 22d, 1876, it was understood and agreed between each of them and Niles that the writing should not be operative as an obligation against them until Niles should procure the leases, articles of agreement, etc., mentioned in the writing, and assign them to the defendants, and not until all of the defendants should meet together with Niles and consummate and perfect the agreement, and they say that it never was so consummated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\">\u201c Now, gentlemen, you have got the position of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-9\">\u201c \"Whether this writing ever had an existence or not, binding upon the parties, is a question of fact for the determination of the jury under the evidence ; that is, whether it was ever delivered, or so far executed as to be intended by the parties to be presently binding upon them, that is a question of fact for the determination of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-10\">\u201c If it was so executed and became operative as an instrument, what that instrument means, its interpretation, is a matter for the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-11\">\u201cNow, we say, if you find, what the defendants allege to be the fact, from the evidence in the case, that this writing never was intended by the parties to be obligatory until something further was done, then we say to you that the plaintiff cannot recover, because in that event the writing never had a legal existence, although it may have been signed, and in this connection we will read and affirmatively answer the defendants\u2019 second and fourth points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-12\">* * <em>* </em>* * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-13\">\u201c The defendants, in addition to the two points I have previously answered in connection with the statement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>position of the defendants, present two other points, that I will now answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">\u201c \u2018First: That as the present suit is an action of covenant on a contract, or supposed contract, between Austin Niles, the plaintiff, and the defendants for violation or breach of covenants contained in said contract, which was assigned to Porter, for whose use said suit is brought, the use plaintiff, Porter, has no other or greater rights under said contract than, the legal plaintiff, Niles, and unless Niles could recover in said action Porter could not.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">\u201cThis point is answered in the affirmative, but in so answering it the attention of the jury is called to -the instructions in the general charge, to the effect that this suit may be sustained in the name of Niles and for the benefit of Porter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-8\">\u201cThird point of defendants: \u2018That unless the jury find from the evidence that Niles acted as the agent of Porter, and informed the defendants of his agency, or that Porter communicated with defendants and was induced to or influenced by them to become bail for Niles, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-9\">\u201c This point we answer in the negative, as we have already substantially answered the position taken in the general charge to the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-10\">Defendants excepted to those portions of the charge within brackets, and to the answers to their first and third points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-11\">March 15, 1881.
