Pleas <em>non assumpsit, </em>payment with leave, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">The facts of the case are sufficiently set forth in the opinion of the Court below, Bredis, J., upon a question of law reserved at the trial:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">\u201cIn the fall of 1873,plaintiff's intestate and defendant (brothers-in-law) were the owners of adjoining lots fronting on the principal street of the city of New Castle, the buildings on which had been destroyed by fire. During that fall defendant erected on the rear of his lot a stone building, since known as the \u2018 Stone Fort,\u2019 the west walls of which were placed one-half on the land of plaintiff. In February, or March, 1874, the piaintiff\u2019s intestate commenced the erection of a brick storehouse on the front part of his lot, and built one-half of the east wall on the adjoining lot. The jury have, by their verdict, found that defendant, who was the owner of the adjoining lot when the excavation was made, and while part of the cellar wall was building, gave his consent to one-half the wall of Euwer\u2019s storehouse being erected on his ground, and verbally agreed to pay half the cost of the west wall aforesaid, when he used it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\">\u201c Before completion of the cellar wall, on the 23d of April, 1874, defendant sold his lot to Captain Gilliland. Gilliland paid part of the cost of the cellar wall to Long, the builder thereof, at Euwer\u2019s .request, and settled with Euwer for one-half the brick wall erected after his purchase, giving Euwer his judgment-bond for the amount, which bond remains unpaid. Afterwards the title of Gilliland was purchased by defendant at sheriff\u2019s sale, and defendant revested with the ownership of said lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">\u201c The plaintiff\u2019, on the trial of this action, contended that the use of the wall by Gilliland, vendee of the defendant, was a use under the agreement between plaintiff and defendant, and in law a use by defendant, and made defendant liable to pay for one-half of the wall used by the building erected by Gilliland on the adjoining lot purchased from defendant. The jury were instructed, if they found from the evidence that defendant agreed to pay for one-half of the wall (about to be erected by plaintiff between the lots), on said wall being used by defendant, to render a verdict for plaintiff for one-half the cost of the wall used, -with interest from date of use, reserving the question whether the evidence showing such use to be by defendant\u2019s vendee, and not by defendant, the plaintiff could recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-10\">\u201c The city of New Castle has no ordinance on the subject of party walls, and there is no statute on the subject affecting this case, unless it be \u00a7 4, of act of 1849, No. <em>377 </em>(P. L. 600).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201c Without contract, therefore, Euwer would have had no right to build the wall beyond his own line, and, if he did so, the ad joiner could have treated it as a trespass, and compelled it to be taken down, or could have used it without paying anything for it. See Sherred <em>v. </em>Cisco, 4 Sandford, 480. We are of opinion that the parol license to erect the wall, followed by the expenditure of money in its erection by Euwer, was, after such erection, not revocable by Henderson, or his assigns. See Le Fevre <em>v. </em>Le Fevre, 4 Sergeant &amp; Eawle, 244, referring to Short <em>v. </em>Taylor. Sufficient importance was not, however, we think, given at the trial to the fact that when Gilliland purchased, the cellar wall was not completed. We can see no reason why the license might then not have been revoked on paying to Euwer the amount expended by him on the faith of such license. This position was not, however, taken at the trial, and can, therefore, have but an indirect bearing on the question before us. Defendant was, of course, under no obligation to use the wall to support any building he might see fit to erect on the adjoining lot. He was only to pay when he used it; the use was optional with him. This is not the case of Burlock <em>v. </em>Peck, 2 Duer, 90, where defendant bound himself in writing to pay for one-half the wall <em>when </em>used, a covenant broad enough under the circumstances to cover use by a grantee of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">\u201cWe are of opinion that since the act of 1849, if not always, outside the city of Philadelphia, the first builder\u2019s interest in a party wall is \u2018 in law what it always was in fact, an interest in the realty,and not a mere personal right:\u2019 Knight <em>v. </em>Beenken, 6 Casey, 374. That a verbal agreement to pay the half cost of the wall, when the party promising uses the wall, does not alter the legal position of the parties. It is but an agreement to do what the law would compel him to do. The owner of the house has no charge against anybody for the half thus built on his neighbor\u2019s land, but the wall is his own, and the neighbor cannot use it without paying for so much of it as he intends to use, and on paying he may use it, and then the wall becomes a common wall, and each lot becomes appurtenant to the other, so far as needed for its support. The owner of the wall has, therefore, a contingent claim against the adjoining lot-owner, that he shall pay for his share of the wall before using it, though it is half on his own ground. The price to be paid is consequently a fixed lien on the lot, to be enforced by i\u2019estraining the full use of it until the wall is paid forEoberts <em>v. </em>Bye, 6 Casey, 377.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">\u201c Though the statutes in regard to party walls in the city of Philadelphia are not in force in the city of New Castle, yet the principles thereby adopted are entitled, we think, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>weight in deciding the question before us. The agreement of Euwer and Henderson had the effect of putting them in the same position towards each other in regard to their party walls, as though they had been subject to the statutes in force in Philadelphia. If Euwer had exercised his clear right to restrain the use of the wall until paid for, this difficulty could not have arisen. If Henderson had not become re-vested with the ownership of the adjacent lot, we doubt if this action would have been thought of by Euwer. Euwer\u2019s dealings with Gilliland were inconsistent with a claim on defendant, and his demand has no equity, except the subsequent use by Henderson of a wall for which he had not been compensated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">\u201c We think the view we take of the law protects the rights of all parties. Euwer is now dead. A few years will relieve his estate from any liability on verbal promises made by him. To hold that Henderson\u2019s right to compensation for a future use of the party wall of the \u2018 Stone Fort \u2019 is only against Euwer would be consistent with plaintiff\u2019s position here, but not with justice or equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-7\">\u201c If the contract has the effect claimed by plaintiff, why is the claim not for half of the entire wall ? Why should plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery be measured and limited to so much of the wall as used by defendant\u2019s vendee? Will plaintiff be entitled to a new action on every additional use of the wall ? All these difficulties and inconsistencies vanish when the principle we have adopted as ruling this ease is applied. It is simple, clear, and effective, and, while it secures rights, avoids litigation, does justice to the original parties to the agreement, and to their heirs and assigns forever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-8\">\u201c And now, to wit, November 3d, 1880, the counsel for plaintiff agreeing that judgment shall be entered for defendant <em>non obstante </em>veredicto, as though the point reserved had been broad enough to cover the fact admitted, that defendant\u2019s agreement to pay for the wall when he used it was not in writing, and that defendant sold to Gilliland by articles of agreement before the brick wall, for half of which this suit is brought, was commenced, the Court do, on payment of jury fee, direct the prothonotary to enter judgment in favor of defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-9\">The .entry of judgment for defendant was assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-10\">The act of April 10th, 1849, \u00a7 4, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-11\">\u201c In all conveyances of houses and buildings, the right to and compensation for the party wall built therewith, shall be taken to have passed to the purchaser, unless otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>expressed, and the owner of the house, for the time being, shall have all the remedies in respect to such party wall as he might have in relation to the house to which this is attached.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">This act applies only to Philadelphia County.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-7\"><em>Dana &amp; Long </em>and <em>McMichael &amp; McConnell </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-8\">The act of 1849 applies only to Philadelphia. This was an express contract, not running with the land, but personally binding Henderson: Weld <em>v. </em>Nichols, 17 Pick., 538 ; Bloch <em>v. </em>Isham, 7 Am. Law Reg., N. S., 8 ; Burlock <em>v. </em>Peck, 2 Duer, 90.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-9\"><em>D. B. </em>and <em>E. T. Kurtz </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-10\">The contract put the parties in the same position with regard to party walls as residents of Philadelphia County, under the act of 1721, under -which it has been held that the first builder has no lien upon the land of the second builder, but that his claim is a personal charge against the builder of the second house: Ingles <em>v. </em>Bringhurst, 1 Dallas, 341 ; Hart <em>v. </em>Kucher, 5 S. &amp; R., 1 ; Todd <em>v. </em>Stokes, 10 Pa. St., 156.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-11\">The obligation to pay rests only on the party using the wall, and when he uses it. In Bloch <em>v. </em>Isham, supra, the covenant was to pay when the covenantor, <em>his heirs or </em>assigns, used the walls; and in Burlock <em>v. </em>Peck, supra, the covenantor was to pay for the wall <em>when used. </em>Henderson did not use the wall within the spirit of the contract.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b473-12\">October 31st, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AUm\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">We are of the opinion that the judgment of the Court below was right. Henderson was originally liable upon his personal contract to pay for the party wall when he used it. He never did use it. It was broken into, and used by his vendee, Gilliland, who gave his bond and judgment to Euwer, not in any sense as collateral for Henderson, but as payment. The claim against Henderson was merged and extinguished, and it could not be revived by Henderson\u2019s subsequently becoming the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale of Gilliland\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
