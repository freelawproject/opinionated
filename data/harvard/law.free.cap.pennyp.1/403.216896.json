J., dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the petition at the cost of the relators and filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">\u201c The relators claim themselves to be organized, and to have for these years brought themselves within the definition in said section. The respondents neither admit nor deny that allegation to be true, but aver that during said years there were other associations of individuals within the county who organized aud brought themselves within the definition and provisions of said section aud act, and to whom the said sum of $600 was paid for said years. The said other associations are averred to be \u2018 The Crawford County Central Agricultural Society,\u2019 \u2018The French Creek Valley Agricultural Society,\u2019and \u2018The Oil Creek Valley Agricultural Society.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">\u201c The relators, in their replication, deny that the two last-named societies are organized under the above-named fourth section, but aver them to be joint stock companies, having a membership largely composed of citizens of adjacent counties, and hence are not entitled to the benefit of said section in said recited act. This raised a question of fact, and thereupon a jury trial was waived, and the question of fact submitted to the Court; and thereupon we find that the French Creek Valley Agricultural Society was, in 1877, duly and fully organized under the provisions of said act, and the fourth section thereof, and did, during its existence, comply with the provisions of said section by filing with the commissioners of the county an affidavit, made necessary by that section, to entitle them to the benefits of said section. The said last-named society has members in and receives contributions from persons living in adjacent counties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">\u201c This being, therefore, found as a fact, the other questions are raised by the pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">\u201c This is, therefore, a claim and demand by the CrawTord County Agricultural Society from the County of Crawford, for the sum of $700, being $100 for each of the years, 1861, 1864, 1866, 1872, 1874,1878, and 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\">\u201c [Tbe answers of respondents averring that the county paid out during these years the sum of $100 per annum to some one of the other agricultural societies organized under the act of 1851, is a sufficient reply to the application on the part of the relators for payment for these years.] The\u00abfourth section, under which payment is claimed, provides \u2018 that but one such society in any county shall be entitled to receive such appropriation in any one year under the act.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-11\">\u201c [The money, therefore, by law appropriated for these societies, is no longer in the' county treasury, and, of course, cannot be reached in this or any other proceeding,] and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the mandamus asked for only extends to these years, it must, of course, be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">\u201c What I say in addition must be treated as extrajudicial, for there is not a word said about the future, nor is a mandamus asked for, for the present or any future year. Inasmuch, however, as counsel on both sides, in their argument adverted to the present and future, and this opinion may prevent further litigation, I deem it proper to say that the Crawford County Agricultural Society, the relator in this case, is, under the fourth section of the act of 1851, before recited, and under the facts in this case, not the only society in this county organized and conducted under the section, and is not the only society in the county which has adopted the constitution and voluntarily raised the contributions for the promotion of agricultural knowledge and improvement, as defined in said section, and has not the exclusive right, by virtue of priority of organization, or otherwise, to the benefits of the said section, or of the money appropriated thereunder. To entitle any such society, however, to this money, the requisite' affidavits and statements must be annually made to the commissioners, and, of course, we cannot say that in the future, any, or if one, more than one such society will, in any one year, or at all, make such statements, attested by affidavit, or required by said act. Without quoting the act <em>in ipsissimis </em>verbis, I construe it to contemplate the fact that there may be in a county more than one such organization. It says: \u2018Any number of individuals, etc.,\u2019 not the first set or first number of individuals, etc., and further, \u2018 any society <em>now </em>organized \u2019 may do so and so. The last proviso certainly contemplates that more than one such society may receive the whole or a portion of said appropriation. It says \u2018 <em>but one such society in any one county </em>shall receive such appropriation in <em>any one year?</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">\u201c [In short, the whole question, within the limit, of course, of the two provisos, is altogether within the discretion of the custodians of the county funds, to wit, the county commissioners. The latter might, if they saw fit, probably divide the appropriation equally and annually between the several agricultural societies, or might, as I understand they have heretofore done, and intend in the future to do, equitably make alternate appropriations of the said $100 among the several societies who bring themselves within the act. This discretion of the county commissioners has been, and as we believe, rightly exercised, and we cannot control it if we would, and. we would not control it if we could.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">The relators then took a writ of error, assigning as errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>those portions of the opinion within brackets, and that the law of the opinion was wrong and its conclusions erroneous.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-6\"><em>H.
