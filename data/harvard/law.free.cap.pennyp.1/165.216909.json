Where the Court below made a perfectly fair and correct presentment of the case as it stood upon the contract between the parties, .but charged: \u201c If they (the defendants) in taking that measurement perpetrated a fraud for the purpose of deducting or getting coal without paying for it, he (plaintiff) would not be bound by that, because there is no law that would require you to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>out an agreement which was made with a view to perpetrate a fraud.

The wagon to be filled full of, and the heapage put on with fine charcoal on the job; heapage to be with a twenty-bushel box of twenty-six hundred and ninety cubic inches per bushel. The wagon to be gauged upon the furnace bank by the said Lauth, Thomas &amp; Co., or their authorized agent, at the lowest parts of the bed, and the load so gauged shall be the standard load from which to determine all others.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that it would not be competent for the plaintiff to prove fraud in the measurement by proving what amount of coal ought, in the opinion of witnesses, to be produced from a cord of wood such as the plaintiff used when coaled in the manner in which he coaled it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-7\">3.

L. J.. charged the jury, <em>inter </em>\u2022alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-29\">\u201c It is alleged on the part of the plaintiff that the measurements of the coal-beds made by the defendants would not agree with the measurements by him. It is stipulated in the agreement that the measurement shall be made in a particular way, and the measurement shall be made by a rule governing measurements of this kind; that in this case, as a matter of law, we instruct you their measurements would be binding upon the plaintiff in this case, unless plaintiff satisfies you that there was fraud in their measurements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201c [They may have stipulated that a bed should be measured and that a load should be gauged according to the measure stipulated in the agreement, but in making that measurement have used deception or fraud; why then, as a matter of course, the plaintiff would not be bound by it. In this case, though the plaintiff has consented that the defendants should make these measurements, and also shall have the option of determining certain things connected with the measurement of this charcoal, and unless the plaintiff himself satisfies you that there was fraud practiced in such measurement, then as a matter of law we instruct you that he is bound by their report of measurement. He agreed to abide by their measurements made in a particular way, and he cannot after that go and claim that he is not getting a fair measurement. lie agreed with the defendants that they should pay him six cents a. bushel for all the charcoal delivered by him in that year upon the furnace banks, measured in that way, not measured in some other way. The plaintiff is bound by it. But if they, in taking that measurement, perpetrated a fraud for the purpose of deducting or getting coal without paying for it, he would not be bound by that, because there is no law that would require you to carry out an agreement which was made with a view to perpetrate a fraud. But the plaintiff must satisfy you that there has been fraud perpetrated in the measurement of this coal.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">\u201cThere is no dispute as to the contents of the bushel. There have been testified to by witnesses on the stand, four or five different standards for a bushel to measure charcoal. No two of them agree in every particular. But they will have nothing to do with the finding of your verdict. .If there were no stipulations in the agreement as to what the bushel shall contain and how it should be measured, there would be room for dispute on that point; but the agreement stipulates what the bushel should be by which it was to be measured, and also how the loads were to be measured and the number of bushels ascertained; and consequently there can be no room for dispute, except that the measurements were made fraudulently. If these provisions were put into the agreement for the purpose of measuring and ascertaining the amount of this coal, and if they did not act fraudulently in the measurement, then \"Walker is bound by it; and it makes no difference whether the defendants got more charcoal by the operation or less, the plaintiff' would be bound by it, or whether the plaintiff' got more by it, the defendants would equally be bound by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">\u201c The only question for you to determine in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>concerning the measurement of this coal by the defendants. If they were made by these defendants or their agents in an honest and upright manner, and without fraud, then this contract is to be observed in every particular and the plaintiff is bound by their measurement. If there was fraud perpetrated in the measurement of this coal by these' defendants or their agents, then it is not binding upon the plaintiff, and he -would be entitled to recover the amount of coal you find was delivered by him and for which he has not been paid. This is the only real question in the case, and you must consider everything that may throw light upon that question. If you find from the evidence that this measurement -was made fraudulently, then the plaintiff has a right to recover; but if you find that it was made without fraud, then he is bound by their measurement, for he agreed to be bound by it in the articles of agreement. If you find that these measurements were not fraudulently made, but were made wit'h the articles of agreement with a view of honestly ascertaining the actual number of bushels of charcoal delivered, then the plaintiff' is bound by it, and then he has been paid for all the coal he has delivered, except in the amount of $41.60, and they have tendered him that and more and have paid the money into Court. If you find there is only due the plaintiff' the sum of $55 or less, then your verdict should be for the defendants, because that money has been tendered him, and it is deposited here in Court for him. [But if you find that he is not bound by their measurement, then you must ascertain the number of bushels he has not been credited with by the defendants, with 2690 cubic inches for a bushel, at the price per bushel as stipulated in the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">\u201c You will now take this case and consider all the evidence that throws any light upon that part of the case, and render a verdict accordingly.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-7\">Verdict for the plaintiff for $507.78, which the Court subsequently reduced to $400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">Judgment entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-9\">The defendants took a writ of error, assigning for error the admission of the testimony under exception as above specified, and those portions of the charge of the Court contained within brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-10\"><em>A.

The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AlQt\">Green, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The charge of the learned judge of the Court below was a perfectly fair and correct presentment of this case, as it stood upon the contract of the parties. But ~we encounter a practical difficulty in sustaining what he said to the jury on the subject of fraud. There was nothing legally inaccurate in his remarks as to the effect of fraudulent practices by the defendants in the measurement of the coal. If there were evidence in the case to which those remarks would be applicable, we would affirm the judgment without a moment\u2019s hesitation. But, after a most patient and careful examination of the charge of the Coart, of the argument of the learned and able counsel for the plaintiff, and of the testimony in the cause, we are unable to discern any evidence of fraudulent conduct on the part of the defendants. The learned judge said several times in his charge that if fraud was perpetrated by the defendants or their agents, in the measurement of the coal, then the measurement was not binding upon the plaintiff, and he could recover, for the actual amount delivered. But in no part of the charge is there the least testimony tending to prove fraud, nor is any such testimony submitted to the consideration of the jury. The plaintiff admits, to its fullest extent, the binding character of his obligation to abide by the very precise method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>measurement prescribed in the contract. Was that method observed ? If it was, the plaintiff is concluded. by the results. If it was not, it is his duty to show it by testimony. He cannot discharge that duty by showing that different results would have followed if a different method had been pursued. Above all, it would not be competent to prove fraud <em>in the </em>measurement, by proving what amount of coal ought, in the opinion of witnesses, to be produced from a cord of wood, such as the plaintiff used when coaled in the manner in which he coaled it. The very object of the agreement was to avoid all such uncertain modes of measurement, and the litigation which would naturally result from resorting to them, by prescribing a particular and exact method. In this case the very method fixed by the contract was adopted, and a most precise and definite measurement of the beds in question was made, a record of which was kept and given in evidence. There is not a particle of testimony to contradict either the fact of that measurement or its accuracy. Nor is there any evidence showing that' the number of bushels to the load, as ascertained by that measurement, was incorrectly returned, or credited to the plaintiff. Topi\u2019ove that a teamster when he asked for a <em>square cut, </em>was met with a smile, is entirely too indefinite and uncertain a method of establishing so grave a charge as fraud in the. measurement. It was equally incompetent to make out such a charge by proving what the beds measured at another time, before or after the delivery of coal under this contract, as that was not in accordance with the terms of the contract. If the plaintiff was dissatisfied with the results of the measurement, he should at once have complained to the defendants, and then a re-measurement could have been made while the contract was being performed. But this he did not do, and he now seeks to accomplish such results by resorting to methods not permitted by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">It is to be regretted that a more precise designation of the evidence tending to show fraud has not been furnished to us. For lack of sueff information we have been compelled to expend valuable time, which <em>we </em>cannot spare, in searching through a large mass of testimony for details of evidence which would support the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. With a perfect willingness to find it if it existed, and to sustain the action of the Court below in submitting the case to the jury on the question of fraud, if we could do so, we have been quite unable to discover the evidence necessary for that purpose, and we are therefore obliged to reverse the judgment on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
