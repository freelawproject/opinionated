B Kaufman trustee to sell the real estate of Frederick Pyle, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">Frederick Pyle died September 4th, 1879, leaving eight children, viz.: George W. Pyle, W. C. Pyle, Sarah, wife of John Sylvius, Emma R., wife of Christian Wise, Joseph Pyle, .Philip Pyle, Allen G. Pyle, and Frederick Pyle, Jr., since deceased, and three grandchildren, William H., Henrietta S., and George F., all minor children under the age of fourteen years, of Mary C. Leonard, deceased, a daughter of the said Frederick Pyle. Letters of administration were granted September 8th, 1879, to George W. Pyle and W. C. Pyle, the two eldest sons of the decedent. On the 9th day of October, 1880, the petition of Joseph Pyle, one of the heirs, was presented to the Orphans\u2019 Court asking for an inquest to make partition of the real estate of the decedent, which petition was amended October 30th, 1880, by adding the name of Julius B. Kaufman, guardian of the Leonard minors. An inquest was awarded, and the proceedings were returned and confirmed <em>nisi </em>November 15th, 1880. The same day the Court granted a rule on the heirs and legal representatives of deceased to come into court November 27th, 1880, to accept or x\u2019efuse the x\u2019eal estate, or show cause why the same should not be sold. This rule was continued until November 29th, on which day one of the purparts was accepted. No cause was shown, and December 2d, 1880, Joseph Pyle ft re-sen ted a petition asking for the sale of the unaccepted i\u2019eal estate, and on the 4th of December his attorney obtained a rule on the administrators to produce their bond and take out an oi\u2019der for the sale of the real estate in ten days. On December 13th, 1880, the affidavit of W. C. Pyle, one of tlie administrators, was filed, setting forth \u201c that the said administrate i\u2019s are ready with their bond, which they will pi\u2019esent at the next sitting of the Coui\u2019t on December \u2014\u25a0, 1880, and if said bond with the sureties on the same ai\u2019e approved by the said Orphans\u2019 Coui\u2019t, they will then ask for an order to sell as directed by the Court.\u201d December 20th, 1880, the Court granted a rule on the administi\u2019ators to come into court December 25th, 1880, and present their petition, asking for an order to sell the l\u2019eal estate, and their bond for approval. On that day George W. Pyle, one of the administrators, came into court, asked for an order of sale, and pi\u2019esented his bond. The other administrator did not appear or unite in the bond. On the same day the appellant and six others of the ebildi\u2019en of the decedent filed a petition asking the Court to appoint Christian Wise trustee to sell the real estate, and the bond of Wise was presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The decree of the Court was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">\u201cNow, December 25th, 1880, the administrators not uniting in qualifying to make sale as per order of past date, the Court declined to approve the bond presented by one of the administrators, and now appoint as trustee J. B. Kaufman, Esq., as trustee to sell the real estate, he being guardian for some of the heirs, and order bail in the sum of |26,000, first to be approved by the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">George \"W. Pyle appealed, and assigned as error that the Court erred in not granting an order to sell to him as one of the administrators, and in appointing a trustee to sell against the wishes of the majority of the heirs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-8\"><em>B. F. Davis </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-9\">According to the act of February 24th, 1834, a trustee to sell is only appointed <em>after </em>an order to sell is made, and in case the executor or administrator neglects or refuses to execute the order. In this case there could be no neglect or refusal of the administrator to execute any order of sale, since no order was made previous to the appointment of the trustee: Neeld\u2019s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith, 113. The appellant was ready to sell, and presented his bond. He is in no wise liable for the neglect or disobedience of his co-administrator. His joinder in the petition for the appointment of Wise was no refusal: Shomo\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith, 356; McClellan\u2019s Appeal, 4 Harris, 116 ; Baughman\u2019s Estate, 4 L. Bar., 5th October, 1872 ; Snyder\u2019s Appeal, 12 Casey, 166.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-10\"><em>W. R. Wilson </em>and A. <em>M. Frantz </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-11\">These administrators trifled with their duty and the court. The sale of real estate is a responsible trust. No one is so well qualified to exercise a sound discretion in the selection and appointment as the local judges. The Superior Courts will not interfere, except in cases of gross abuse: Neeld\u2019s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith, 113. In point of fact it is not true that the order of sale was made after the appointment of the trustee. When a day for acceptance is fixed, and the property is not accepted, and no cause shown, it is virtually determined that it shall be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-12\">It was not a definitive decree.

We cannot say that-such appears in this case. The Court declined to approve the bond presented by one of the administrators. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>One reason given was that the other administrator had not united in the bond. Without better knowledge of all the circumstances, \u2014 known to the Court below, \u2014 and which we do not possess, we cannot say that there was error in this.</p>\n<p id=\"AU1\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
