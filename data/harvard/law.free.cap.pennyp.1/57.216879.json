As the owners may be non-residents or unknown, the policy has been to charge the lands themselves with the taxes, and to enforce payment by a sale of the lands charged. In order, however, to make a valid sale for taxes, certain requisites, without which no title wall pass to the purchaser, are necessary. The land must have been unseated at the time of the assessment of the taxes. An assessment must have been made by competent authority identifying the land assessed by the adjoiners or otherwise, with reasonable certainty; the taxes must have been due and unpaid for one whole year before the sale; the land must have been sold by the treasurer of the county, and his deed therefor must be acknowledged in open court. Where all these requisites exist, and there is no redemption from the sale within two years, the title of the former owner is divested and that of the purchaser becomes complete. But if either of them be absent no title passes by the sale. When land is assessed as unseated the presumption is that that is its condition until the contrary is .shown. When unseated lands are described, valued, and . returned by the assessor under a warrant from the county commissioners for that purpose, and the commissioners have charged them with taxes, an assessment has been made by competent authority; and if the owners suffer such taxes to remain unpaid for one whole year, the treasurer without a warrant from the commissioners may make a sale and convey a good title to the purchaser. But the treasurer has no authority to make an assessment. He is, under the statute, merely an executive officer, empowered to enforce, by a sale, charges duly made and ripe for such action before his duty begins. There is no particular form or mode prescribed by law in which the books shall be kept and the assessment made. Each county may have a practice of its own. If the assessment is actually made, the manner of doing it is not material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-10\">\u201c As evidence of an assessment of taxes, for the non-pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ment of which the treasurer\u2019s sale of 12th June, 1820, was made, the defendants have given in evidence the original return of the triennial assessment for Mifflin township for the year 1817, brought from the commissioners\u2019 office of Columbia County, with the proper warrants of the commissioners to the assessors, which, among other tracts, contains the following: \u201c Warrantee, Catharine Longenberger,acres 361, rate 1; owner, G. Long, rate 364, 5-1. They have also given in evidence a certified paper purporting to be an extract from the assessment of unseated lands, certified by the clerk of the commissioners of Columbia County, under the county seal, to be a true copy of the taxes assessed upon the Catharine Longenberger tract, for the years 1818 and 1819, taken from the assessment remaining in the commissioners\u2019 office of the said county, and showing the following extract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">Warrantee.

In obedience to this plain direction of the law this certified paper was received in evidence. The law presumes it to be a true extract until the contrary appears in the evidence. If it be a true extract, as certified to by the commissioners\u2019 clerk, it shows an assessment and charge of county taxes against the Catharine Longenberger tract for the years 1818 and 1819, for the payment of which the land itself was bound. In connection with this they have also given evidence of a treasurer\u2019s sale of unseated lands for the years 1818 and 1819, made 12th of June, 1820, showing a sale and deed to George A. Frick of the Catharine Longenberger tract, 364 acres; county tax, $1.16, road tax, $1.16, total, $2.32; sold for $5.94. I he deed is dated 10th July, 1820, and is duly acknowledged. If you find that this tract was duly assessed and charged with taxes by competent authority for the years 1818 and 1819, as shown by the certified extract in evidence, and any of such taxes re-mained due and unpaid for one whole year before the treasurer\u2019s sale, then the sale and deed made by him for such taxes conveyed the title to the purchaser, and divested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>title of the then owner of the land. The recital in the treasurer\u2019s deed of more taxes than appear to have been charged upon the books, does not in itself vitiate the sale. If there were any taxes due and unpaid for one whole year before the sale, whether they were for county or road purposes, the sale, if made for such unpaid taxes, was valid. But if such taxes were paid before the sale,then the sale was void; and the purchaser took no title whatever under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">\u25a0 \u201c You will have out with you the certified paper referred to, and also the books relied upon as evidence to show a valid assessment of taxes against this tract by the county commissioners; and whether or not a valid assessment of taxes was made against it for the years 1818 and 1819, by the county commissioners, as alleged by the defendants, and whether or hot the treasurer\u2019s sale of 1820, to George A. Frick, was made for any of such taxes so assessed, and remaining due and unpaid for one whole year before the sale, are questions we submit to you upon all the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">\u201c [In support of the sale and deed of the treasurer to George A. Frick, dated 5th August, 1822, the defendants have given in evidence the original return of the triennial assessment for Mifflin township for the year 1820, brought from the commissioners\u2019 office of Columbia County, with the proper warrants of the commissioners to the assessors, which among other tracts contains the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">\u201c\u2018Warrantee, Catharine Longenberger; adjoiners, etc., A. Clark; acres, 216; valuation, $321; tax, $1.07.\u2019 They have also given in evidence a certified extract from the assessment of unseated lands, certified by the clerk of the commissioners of Columbia County, under the county seals, to be a true copy of the taxes assessed upon the Catharine Longenberger tract as unseated for the years 1820 and 1821, taken from the transcript or assessment of taxes remaining in the commissioners\u2019 office of said county, showing a county tax of $1.07 for 1820, and a county tax of 53|- cents for 1821. It appears that the treasurer\u2019s sale book of the sales made in 1822 is not to be found; but the deed of the treasurer recites such sale to George A. Frick, for the consideration of $5.23. It recites county'taxes for 1818 and 1819, blank; and road tax for 1820, $1.07, and road tax for 1821, 53-J cents. The deed is duly acknowledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\">\u201cNow, you will observe that this deed recites that the sale was made for road taxes for 1820 and 1821, but there is no evidence of any assessment of road taxes for those years against this tract. The recital in the deed is the only mention of road taxes made in connection with it for the years 1820 and 1821. The amount of taxes in the deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>however, corresponds in each year with the amount of county tax, as shown by the certified extract, for the same years. It is contended by the defendants that the recital in the deed that the sale was made for road taxes, is a mistake ; and that in fact the sale was made for county taxes duly assessed against the land for those years. Whether or not it was made for road taxes, or for county taxes for the corresponding years, is a question we submit to you. You will have out with you the deed, together with the certified extract and the books relied upon to show a valid assessment of county taxes for the years 1820 and 1821, and you will have to determine for yourselves, from all the evidence, whether, in fact, the sale was made for road taxes or county taxes. If you find that it was for road taxes, then the treasurer's deed of 5th August, 1822, conveyed no title, as there is no evidence of an assessment of road taxes for 1820 and 1821. But if you find it was for county taxes charged by the county commissioners against the land for the years 1820 and 1821, based upon the valuation of the triennial assessment of 1820, which taxes remained due and unpaid for one whole year before the sale, then the purchaser, George H. Frick, acquired thereby the legal title.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">\u201c When there has been a valid assessment of unseated land, and a sale for taxes which have remained due and unpaid for one whole year before the sale, and there is an allegation of payment of the taxes before the sale by the owner,' or some other person inuring to his benefit or having an interest in the lands, the burden of proof is upon him alleging such payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">The Court answered certain points of the plaintiffs, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">\u201c Fourth. That while charges upon a tract of land made by the commissioners are evidence of assessment, yet where it is shown that such charges were not made for the purpose of, and as assessments for the years corresponding with such alleged assessments, such charges are explained, and do not constitute valid assessments.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">\u201c Answer: This point is answered in the affirmative. If the charges were not made by the commissioners for the purpose of, and as assessments for the years corresponding with the alleged assessments, .such charges would not, in themselves, constitute valid assessments; but still, the records of the commissioners\u2019 office, charging the land as unseated, with arrears of taxes, are evidence for the jury, to be considered by them in determining whether a valid assessment was in fact made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">\u201c Seventh. That it is too late now, over fifty-six years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>from the date of the treasurer\u2019s deed of 1822, and the frequent sales and conveyances from that date, made by the owners at that time and since, and the erection of valuable improvements by the purchaser, to allege an error or mistake in such deed, to the effect that the recital of road taxes for which the sale was made, was in fact intended to mean county taxes. That a court of equity would not reform such deed at this time in accordance with such alleged mistakes, under such evidence of mistake as is now before the Court so as to affect these plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">\u201cAnswer: Refused.

It is true that there is no evidence of any assessment of road taxes against this tract for these years (1820 and 1821), and if you find that this sale in 1822 was, in fact, for road tax, then the treasurer\u2019s deed conveyed no title. But if you find it was made for county taxes charged by the county commissioners for the years 1820 and 1821, based upon the valuation of the triennial assessment of 1820, which remained due and unpaid for one whole year before the sale, then the purchaser, George A.

That to make the treasurer\u2019s sales of 1820 and 1822 respectively valid, it must appear that as to the former there was a valid assessment of county taxes for the years 1818 and 1819 respectively, and the taxes assessed and unpaid for one whole year prior to 1820; and that as to the sale of 1822, it must appear thei\u2019e were road taxes assessed for the years 1820 and 1821; and that unless such assessments appear to have been made, the said sales are void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-12\">\u201cAnswer: Refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The Court answered certain points of the defendant, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">\u201cFifth.

Therefore, if the jury find from the evidence submitted in the case that among the records of the commissioners\u2019 office of Columbia County, there appears a regular assessment of taxes upon the Catharine Longenberger tract of land for the years 1818 and 1819, or either of them, and that the land was unseated at the time, the sale made by the treasurer in 1820, as shown by his deed in the evidence in the cause, <em>prima facie </em>conveyed to and vested in George A.

That it appearing by competent and sufficient evidence that there appears among the records of the said commissioners\u2019 office an assessment of one dollar and seven cents in the year 1820, and of fifty-three and a half cents in the year 1821, upon the said tract of land; and by the deed of the treasurer that a sale of the said tract was made by him in the year 1822, for the said amount of taxes, to George A. Frick, the said sale and deed from the treasurer conveyed to the said purchaser <em>prima facie </em>the title to the said tract.\u201d \u201c Answer: I cannot say as a matter of law that the deed of oth August, 1822, by the treasurer to George A. Frick, conveyed to the latter the title to the land. This is a question for the jury, and we have fully stated the question for their determination respecting this deed in our general charge. If the sale of 1822 was made not for road taxes, as recited in the deed, but for county taxes for the corresponding years of 1820 and 1821, which.had been duly and regularly charged by the county commissioners against this land, and if any of such county tax remained due and unpaid for one whole year, before the sale, then the treasurer\u2019s sale and deed conveyed a good title to George A. Frick.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-10\">. \u201c Ninth. That the title thus vested in George A. Frick could only be defeated by showing a payment of the taxes before the sale ; that the only evidence offered to show such payment of taxes is contained in the deposition of Christian Btrack; that these depositions are inconsistent with each other, and are positively refuted by the official records of Columbia County. Moreover, they in no part contain evidence of any payment of the said taxes before the sale; and there is, therefore, no evidence in the cause of such payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cAnswer: If the evidence shows a treasurer\u2019s sale to George A. Erick, in 1820 or 1822, for taxes regularly assessed by competent authority against the laud as unseated, and remaining due for one whole year before the sale, then such sale vested in George A. Frick a good and valid title to the land, unless in fact such taxes were paid before sale. We have said to you that where there has beeu a valid assessment of unseated lands, and a sale for taxes overdue one year, and there is an allegation of payment of taxes before the sale by the owner or some other person inuring to his benefit, or having an interest in the lands, the burden of proof is upon him alleging such payment. It appears from the evidence that Bell and Biddle held a mortgage upon the Catharine Longenberger tract, which was given to them by Jacob Bower in 1802. Holding this mortgage upon the land, they (Bell and Biddle) had such an interest in the land that not only made it to their interest, but gave them the right to pay the taxes assessed against the land during the continuance of the lien of their mortgage upon it. It is contended by the plaintiffs that Bell and Biddle, as such mortgagees, paid the taxes for several years \u2018before, and several years after these tax sales, as well as for the years for the taxes of which the sales were made. Whether they so paid is an important question in this cause to be determined by the jury. No receipts for the taxes have been produced ; but the plaintiffs allege that receipts by the proper officer for the taxes for the years for which those sales were made had been given, and were accidentally destroyed by fire in 1852. The deposition of Christian Strack is relied upon by the plaintiffs to prove such receipts. When tax-receipts are thirty years old, and are in the possession of the proper custodian of the title-papers of an estate, such receipts, if produced, would be evidence, without proof of the handwriting of the treasurer whose signature is to them. If such receipts are destroyed, evidence may be given by parole, of their previous existence, and although the witness may not be able to give the name of the officer who signed the receipts nor the particulars of .the receipts themselves, further than that they purported to have been the receipts of the proper officers for the years for which the land was assessed, yet if the testimony satisfies the jury that the taxes had been paid and receipted for before sale by the treasurer, the treasurer\u2019s sale made for such taxes so paid would be void. If Christian Strack is believed, he, as one of the administrators of Henry Bower, had the custody of his title-papers, including that of the Catharine Longenberger tract. He states that he applied for and obtained from the Court an order for the sale of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tract in 1842 ; that he learned it had been sold for taxes in 1820; that he had the tax sales examined and examined the title-papers of this tract, and found tax-receipts for the years 1816, 1817, 1818, 1819, 1820, and up to 1824, for State, county, and road taxes; that the receipts were to Bell and Biddle, and appeared to come from the proper officers of Columbia County. He says these receipts were burned when the house of the witness was destroyed by fire in 1852. The defendants have also put in evidence another deposition of Christian Strack, which they rely upon to show that he has made contradictory statements about the receipts. Both of these depositions have been read in your hearing, and have been commented upon by counsel. When the title, apparently regular on its face, based upon record evidence, is sought to be overthrown or defeated by parole evidence, it is the duty of the jury to examine that evidence with care, and to be fully satisfied not only that the witness had the means of knowing the facts which he states, but also that his testimony is reliable and worthy of belief, and that he possessed intelligence and memory by which he was able to state the facts, evidencing payment with such clearness as to prevent mistake. The receipts which Mr. Strack says were destroyed, if they were the receipts of the county treasurer, were official documents of equal credit with the records in the office charging the taxes. But as the records still exist, they must be taken as <em>prima facia </em>evidence, and stand good, unless the parole proof of payment satisfies the jury that the omission to credit the payment on the books was the fault or neglect of the treasurer. What credit you ought to give to the testimony of Christian Strack is wholly for you to determine. His general character for truth has not been assailed, nor does it appear that he has any interest in this ease. How far his testimony in the two depositions which have been read to you tend to show that he is inconsistent with himself, and how far his statements affect his credit, we leave wholly to your consideration. You will consider the opportunities which the witness had to acquire a knowledge of the facts stated, as well as all the circumstances stated by him, and which otherwise surround or exist in the ease, and applying a sound, careful, and impartial judgment, you will determine, from the evidence, whether in*fact those taxes were paid before the sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">Plaintiff's excepted to the charge and the answers to the points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">The jury found for the defendants.

Such certificate is <em>per se </em>evidence, although merely secondary. The certificate was not admitted until a witness was called to show that Kriekbaum was the clerk of the commissioners. But such certified extract is evidence only by virtue of the act of Assembly. Without this the \u201cextract \u201d was not evidence. The act of Assembly not having been complied with, can it be made evidence by 'supplemental testimony ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-8\">\u201c When copies are made evidence by statute, the mode of authentication must be strictly pursued. The copy may be strictly accurate, yet, if the certificate be defective, it is of no avail:\" Smith <em>v. </em>United States, 5 Peters, 292.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-9\">The certificate states, among other things, that it was \u201c taken from the transcript of assessment,\u201d etc. The law knows of no \u201c transcripts of assessments.\u201d It must be an \u201c extract \u201d from the \u201c assessment books,\u201d and taken from \u201c the assessment remaining in the commissioners\u2019 office.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-10\">It was apparent, on its face, that it was not an extract from any assessment book. There was no valuation, the very essence of an \u201c assessment.\u201d It was not for one year, as the law requires assessments to be made. It gave amounts in separate columns, under county and road taxes, severally for the years 1818 and 1819. No assessor could legally make such an assessment, and it was therefore legally impossible that such paper could be a true copy, taken from \u201c the assessment remaining in the commissioners\u2019 office.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-11\">The original record was in court, and showed the paper to be false and manufactured.

The certificates of the clerk' of the commissioners, we think, substantially followed the provisions of the act of Assembly making them evidence. They were therefore admissible. They were certified to be extracts from the assessment on record of the assessment of unseated lauds in the commissioners\u2019 office. Undoubtedly they were open, to attack, and might be shown to be false and fabricated. This was attempted, but it is a mistake to suppose that this raised a question as to their admissibility to be decided by the Court. They were not secondary, but primary evidence. Evidence was giveu as to their truth, the original records were produced, and the question was fairly submitted to the jury, whose province it was to decide it. It was shown that the commissioners and treasurer occupied the same room for their respective offices, and the fact that the book from which the extracts were taken had in one part of it also a record of the treasurer\u2019s sales, was not conclusive against it as being also a record of assessments. Such a mode of keeping the record is irregular, but certaiuly does not destroy the book as evidence that the land was charged or assessed for the taxes for which it-was sold, when it is shown <em>aliunde </em>to be the record of the commissioners. This might be by the oral evidence of the clerk, or by his certificate under the act of Assembly. Nor do we think that there was any material error in the manner in which the testimony of Christian Strack was submitted. The jury could not have been misled by the remarks of the learned judge to suppose that they ought to apply any other rule than that which is usual and proper in civil eases, \u2014 that they ought to be satisfied of the existence and destruction of the receipts. Upon a careful examination of all the assignments of error we can discover nothing of which the plaintiffs have any just right to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
