St. 1899) provides that: \u201cIn all eases where any personal property shall be sold to any person, to be paid for in whole or in part in installments, or shall be leased, rented, hired or delivered to another on condition that the same shall belong to the person purchasing, leasing, renting, hiring or receiving the same whenever the amount paid shall be a certain sum, or the value of such property, the title to the same to remain in the vendor, lessor, renter, hirer or deliverer of the same, until such sum, or the value of such property, or any part thereof, shall have been paid, such condition, in regard to the title so remaining until such payment, shall be void as to all subsequent purchasers in good' faith, and creditors, unless such condition shall be evidenced by writing executed, acknowledged and recorded as provided in eases of mortgages of personal property.\u201d This statute was enacted to put an end to the abuses in cident to what is known in this state as \u201cconditional sales of personal prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>evty,\u201d whereby, under- agreements between the vendor and vendee, undisclosed to the public, the title to the property should remain in the vendor in the nature of a lien until the purchase money should be paid. Upon the faith of the ostensible ownership of the party in possession, credit would be extended to him by third parties, and when they sought to subject the property to attachment or execution such vendor would interpose, and claim the property under the assertion that the title had never passed from him. To effectuate the declared public policy of the state in this 'statute, the courts of this state have given to it a broad and rigid construction, to the effect that its policy was for \u201cinspiring confidence that' in all sales of personal property, when possession was delivered to the vendee, as to creditors and purchasers the vendor\u2019s title must be held to have been absolutely passed, unless upon the public registry books of the land there appear in the manner provided by law some reservation .of a right therein.\u201d Straus v. Rothan, 102 Mo. 266, 14 S. W. 940. Of, as stated in Johnson-Brinkman Co. v. Central Bank, 116 Mo. 571, 22 S. W. 813, 38 Am. St. Rep. 615, it \u201cwas manifestly intended to invalidate numerous devices which had sprung up for the evasion of the statute.\u201d This court\u2019s observation is that no class of business concerns so assiduously and persistently seek to circumvent and get around this statute as manufacturers and' vendors of machinery, and the like, who seek to exploit their products in the country districts through local agents. Unwilling, for trade reasons, to- sell outright on credit, or to not have it known to the public the terms upon which the goods are committed to the given party for sale, they call to their assistance the most astute counsel to construct contracts after such a fashion that, while imposing upon the retailer all the burdens-of a purchaser, if insolvency or bankruptcy overtake him he may be held technically to be a mere factor. This court is constantly plagued with these controversies, when it is within the power of such merchants by a plain and unambiguous contract to place its relationship to such goods beyond reasonable debate. And it is a wholesome rule that where such contracts, drawn by such claimants, are ambiguous or uncertain, to construe them most strongly against the claimant. Gillet v. Bank, 160 N. Y. 549, 55 N. E. 292.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b821-4\">In re Rabenau, 118 Fed. 471, this court took the pains to discuss in detail a contract quite germane in many important respects to the one -under review. In recognition of the principles of law therein announced this court thought, in affirming the action of the referee, that was decisive - of this case. The propositions there asserted, supported by controlling authorities, may be summarized as follows: If the goods are consigned to be sold for the consignor, who is to regulate the price and terms of sale, the factor is an agent, and the contract is one of bailment. But if the consignee is to sell upon terms fixed by himself, and is bound to pay to -the consignor a fixed price, the contract is one of sale. If the consignor may sell at any price he likes, and receive payment, though he is bound if he sells the goods to pay the consignor for them at a fixed price and a fixed time, it is a sale. When the identical thing delivered is to be restored, or in its altered form of money, the contract is one of bailment, and the title to the property is not changed; but when there is no obligation to restore the specific article, and the receiver is at liberty to return another thing of equal value or the money value, he becomes a debtor to make a return, and the title to the property is changed; it is a sale. \u2019 And, further, it is of no consequence how often or positively it may be asseverated, in the form of the contract, that the party- of the first part, as principal, consigns to the party of the second part, as agent, on commission, and the like. This will be treated by the courts as mere words without controlling effect, if, taking the whole instrument by its four or eight corners, and all the collateral facts, in p\u00e1ri materia, it appears in its essence to be that the consignee is at liberty to sell at a price and on terms fixed by himself, being answerable to the owner for a fixed price, it is none the less a sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b821-5\">Stripped of mere formalism, it is apparent from the contract in question that the burdens cast upon the Hymes Buggy &amp; Implement Company are what would be imposed upon and assumed by any vendee. It was to pay freight-age, the taxes, the insurance, to house and care for the goods, pay all expenses of their sale, and to bear any and all loss of their destruction or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>t\u00e9rioratlon, while answerable to the party of the first part for the fixed price!.I am finable to find in this contract any express provision fixing a time when the consignee could, of his own .motion, return the goods. The only provision touching this aspect-of the case is the following: \u201cIt is further agreed that this contract is to remain in force unless cancelled and annulled by said first party until Oct. 1st, 1904, at. which time said second party agrees if required by said first party, to return all goods remaining on hand unsold at the expiration of this contract to them at their warehouse in Kansas City, in good order and free of all freights and charges.\u201d From which it appears that the return of any unsold goods depended solely upon whether it be \u201crequired by said first party.\u201d ' If the party of the first part does not require the return, the party of the second part cannot compel it. The contract in this respect is wholly unilateral.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b822-4\">Turning to the testimony of the managing representative of the claimant, it appears that at the end of each year the agent of the company visited the house of Hymes Buggy &amp; Implement Company and took an inventory of the goods on hand, and left them there. In its practical effect, this was nothing more than means of ascertaining whether or not the house had sold more goods than it had accounted and paid for. There was no time fixed when this process or cours\"' might end, except that, \u201cshould the second party hereto sell out or otherwise dispose of his business at any time prior to the expiration of this contract, the right to \u2019declare this contract cancelled and annulled from and after the date of such sale or transfer is reserved to party of first part without prejudice.\u201d Aside from this provision, bearing the earmarks of a conditional sale, its evident purpose was to safeguard the vendor agaifist loss in such contingency. If the Hymes Buggy &amp; Implement Company sold the goods on time, it was required to take good notes, guarantied by its indorsement thereon. The object of this clearly was to better the security of the vendor for the purchase money. The balance, after satisfying the vendor\u2019s claim, was to be returned to the vendee. Just as in the case of other conditional sales, the goods were to be paid for when sold by the vendee for cash. The so:called consignee, like any other vendee, was left at full liberty to sell the goods at any price he might obtain, and pocket the profits; and, if he saw fit to sell at a less sum than that for which he was to respond to the vendor, he must pocket the loss. The fact that the consignee was to report monthly his sales, and make payments thereon, does not alter the status of the vendor and vendee. In re Rabenau, 118 Fed., loc. cit. 475.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b822-5\">The Court of Appeals of this state (which has most to do with these transactions because the amount in controversy usually makes that the court of last resort) gives to such contracts under the state statute the construction in harmony herewith. In Bicking v. Stevens, 69 Mo. App. 168, it is held that, where the consignee is to sell the consigned goods upon terms fixed by himself, and is bound to pay the consignor a fixed price at stated times, the contract is one of sale; \u201cand the fact that the payment is to be made on the contingency of the consignee\u2019s selling does not affect the character of the transaction as a sale.\u201d The contract there provided that the consignor should ship out the goods on consignments, to be sold on the consignor\u2019s account. The consignee was, on the 1st of each month, to render an account of the amount of sales made during the previous month; and, just as in the case at bar, he was to itemize the goods remaining unsold in stock. The accounts of sales were rendered, accompanied with note or cash for goods sold during the previous month. The court held that \u201cthe time in which the purchase money was to be paid\u2014whether in so many days or months, or upon the happening of some contingent event, as a resale\u2014did not affect the character of the transaction as a sale. The provision in relation to payment did not suspend the transfer of title. The sale was complete and the title passed when the goods were delivered and the purchaser put in full possession and control of them.\u201d The court cited and reviewed the authorities on this question, fully sustaining the proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b822-6\">There is another fact in this case. In the Exhibit C, which is an account of part of the goods in controversy, shipped on the 15th day of September, 1901, is set out on its face the contract of sale, with terms and prices different from the contract in question. These stipulations are as follows: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>goods as below enumerated to be well made, of good material, and to wort when properly managed, according to the Manufacturer\u2019s Printed Warranty. I, or we, hereby agree to make you payment for same in Kansas City par funds. (Exchange and Express charges prepaid.) If account is not paid when due, to draw interest at ten per cent from maturity. I, or we, hereby agree to give notes or acceptances for the amount of goods, as per terms of payment, when called upon to do so, and to make no claim for shortage or damage after ten days from receipt of goods. No interpretation or verbal understanding of this contract not mentioned herein, will be recognized. All orders taken subject to approval of John Deere Plow C\u00f3., and also agree that the title to and ownership of all goods which may be shipped as herein provided, shall remain in, and their proceeds in case of sale, shall be the property of John Deere Plow Co., and subject to their order until full payment shall have been made. If owing to the large lines you carry, you find it necessary to ship sort a portion of the orders, you may do so and we will make no claims for any allowance therefrom. Prices subject to change with\u2022out notice.\u201d This falls exactly within the inhibition of the statute respecting conditional sales. ' It also appears from the findings of the referee that the bills rendered by the claimant, on which the goods were shipped, contained the following: \u201cSold to the Hymes Buggy &amp; Implement Company.\u201d In Cooper Wagon &amp; Buggy Co. v. Wooldridge, 98 Mo. App. 648, 73 S. W. 724, it is held that, where the application of the purchaser for goods expressed a conditional sale, the vendor wrote on the bill of sale the words, \u201cTerms: Comm. Con.,\u201d indicating commission consignment, it was held that, notwithstanding the words \u201cTerms: Comm. Con.,\u201d the contract was a sale, and not on commission. It is true that in Sturm v. Boker, 150 U. S. 312, 14 Sup. Ct. 99, 37 L. Ed. 1093, it was held that, where the contract of sale was clearly expressed in a written contract between the parties, it could not be varied by the terms of the printed billhead of the invoice. But it does not control this ease, in so far as the bill of sale above referred to is concerned, for the reason that the bill of sale on its face shows that the Hymes Buggy &amp; Implement Company, in its written application for the goods, specified that they should be sold upon the conditions and terms therein specified; and when the goods were shipped thereon, it was an acceptance of the offer, and made a specific contract. Bankr. Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, \u00a7 70, 30 Stat. 566 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3451], defines the title which the trustee in bankruptcy acquires. Subdivision 5, in specifying the property which passes to the trustee, says: \u201cProperty which prior to the filing of the petition he could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him.\u201d Under this contract the Hymes Buggy &amp; Implement Company had the right to sell the goods to whom and at what prices it pleased, being answerable only to the claimant for a fixed sum; and beyond question the purchaser would have acquired a good title as against the claimant. As held in Re Pekin Plow Company, 112 Fed. 308, 50 C. C. A. 257, and in Moline Plow Company v. Spilman (D. C.) 117 Fed. 746, the trustee in bankruptcy stands in the same position as the creditors of the estate pursuing .goods under legal process. Therefore the trustee is entitled to claim the goods as against the vendor under a conditional sale. This view of the law is affirmed in McFarlan Carriage Co. v. Well, 99 Mo. App. 642, 74 S. W. 878.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-3\">In respect of the case of In re Galt, 120 Fed. 64, 56 C. C. A. 470, without conceding its controlling effect upon the statute of this state as construed and applied by its courts, it is sufficient to say that the contract in that case was materially different in important particulars from the one at bar. In that case the contract specifically fixed \u201cthe sum of 5 per cent, on all cash sales.\u201d It is also provided that the consignee was \u201cto settle for all w\u00e1gons sold by him as agent, make all sales and take all evidence of indebtedness therefor for and in the name of said party of the first part, upon such blanks as the party of the first part shall furnish, and remit the cash and notes received for- said wagons to the party of the first part in the following manner: the cash to be remitted as early as the day following the date of sale, by draft, etc., payable to the_ order\u201d of the consignor, \u201cand the notes to be transmitted every thirty daysj or as much oftener as said second party may de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>sire.\u201d The contract also specifically provided that \u201cthe party of the second part further agrees to -sell all wagons shipped him under the within agreement within twelve months from the date of shipment, and in cas\u00e9 of any failure or neglect to do so agrees to settle at the expiration of that time, or at any time thereafter when called upon to do so, for all wagons and parts of wagons remaining on hand unsold, [at]- prices hereinbefore stated,\u201d in a certain manner. From which it is apparent that the contract not only fixed the price at which the property should be sold, but the amount of the consignee\u2019s commission, and it fixed a timq when, and the conditions on which, the property consigned might be returned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b824-4\">Counsel for claimant calls special attention to the case of Metropolitan National Bank v. Benedict Company, 74 Fed. 182, 20 C. C. A. 377. That case, in its controlling facts, is essentially different from the one under consideration. The Benedict Company, owner of the goods, by correspondence with Stern Auction &amp; Commission Company, consummated an agreement between them by which the latter company consented to take the goods by an acceptance in writing, which specified on its face that they took them under consignment, to be sold at the prices submitted in the letter from the Benedict Company, with an express agreement that it would sell \u201cwithout any charges of commission.\u201d The memorandum acceptance furthermore provided for a specific time when the agreement should expire, \u201cthat no part of the assignment (consignment) shall remain unsold or unpaid for by February 1st, 1895.\u201d Unquestionably, if at the end of that time the goods remained unsold and unpaid for, restitution belonged to the assignor. And therefore, when the Metropolitan National Bank, with notice of this agreement, took an assignment in the nature of a mortgage on the goods to secure a debt of Stern Auction &amp; Commission Company to the bank, -it was properly held that as between the parties It was a consignment on bailment. Judge Caldwell, who wrote the opinion, laid much stress upon the construction given to this agreement by the parties thereto. ' But surely he did not mean to say that any unknown construction placed upon the contract by the parties thereto could affect the rights of third parties who had dealt with the consignee as the apparent owner, in ignorance of such private interpretation. Throughout the examination of the managing agent of the claimant in the case gt bar, its counsel, by leading questions pregnant with suggestive answers had this agent state that the contract in question was simply a consignment on commission; but when this question was put to Mr. Hymes, the managing party of the Hymes Buggy &amp; implement Company, he answered, in effect, that the contract would have to' speak for itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b824-5\">Other.reported cases are pressed upon the consideration of the court by claimant\u2019s counsel, which are not deemed in point, or of controlling effect, as they depend upon states of fact easily differentiated from the contract in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b824-6\">In conclusion, -it does seem to me that, if wholesale dealers can set up a ' retail merchant, as in this ease, in a large establishment, with no outward or visible sign of the bailment or agency, enabling him to obtain credit on the faith of his apparent ownership, and then, when attachments or bankruptcy overtake the debtor, come forward with concealed contracts of so ambiguous and double aspect as this contract presents, and maintain a special ownership in the remnant of the debtor\u2019s goods, the state statute, designed to put an end to secret liens or ownership, is of no avail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b824-7\">'Independent of the foregoing considerations, there is a fatal objection to the claim as a preferred creditor to the extent of the $1,442.25 on account of goods sold, and not paid for by the bankrupt. There is no evidence in this record tending to show that this money was on hand at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy, or that it went into or was mingled with the mass of assets that passed to the control of the trustee in bankruptcy. Metropolitan National Bank v. Campbell Com. Co. (C. C.) 77 Fed. 705; Bircher v. Walther, 163 Mo. 461, 63 S. W. 691. So far from the claimant\u2019s evidence bringing the claim within the rule laid down in the foregoing cases, the testimony of the witness \u2022 Hymes, introduced by the claimant, is that the money realized on sale of the goods \u201cwas deposited in bank,, used in the business, or sent .to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>John Deere Plow Company.\u201d This is far short of the proof required under the equity rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b825-3\">It results that the motion for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b825-4\">Tom-H.

Under a stipulation of the parties, both cases are to be considered upon the same record.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">In May, 1904, the Hymes Buggy &amp; Implement Company (hereinafter called the \u201cImplement Company\u201d), a copartnership, was declared a bankrupt upon a petition in involuntary bankruptcy brought by the creditors of that firm, and the case was sent to a referee. The plow company presented a petition to the referee, in which it.set forth that on the 15th day of September, 1903, it entered into a written contract with the implement companjr for the consignment of goods to be sold on commission; that under the contract certain goods, wares, and merchandise were consigned to the implement company for sale on commission and at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy the implement company had on hand goods consigned to it under the contract of the value of $1,390. It was also alleged that the implement company had sold, but had not accounted for to the plow company, certain other goods received and held under the contract to the amount of $1,442.25, and which sum the implement company had retained and placed in its' own business, in violation of the terms and provisions of the contract and without the knowledge or consent of the plow company. The petition prayed for an order for the delivery of the goods unsold and for the allowance of the claim of the plow company for $1,442.25 as a preferred claim.' The prayer of the petition was denied by the referee, and the case certified .to the District Court, where the finding of the referee was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The contract between the plow company and the implement company is in the following, words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-10\">\u2022\u2018This agreement, made and entered into this 15th day of September, 1903. by and between John Deere Plow Co., of Kansas City, Missouri, incorporated under the laws of the State of Missouri, party of the first part, and Hymes Buggy &amp; Impl.

Dodge v. Norlin (C. C. A.) 133 Fed. 363, 366, 367; Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, 194 U. S. 296, 24 Sup. Ct. 690, 691, 4.8 L. Ed. 986. The case presents two principal questions : First, whether the contract and order above set out, taken together, constitute evidence of a conditional sale or of an agency; second, whether or not the plow company is entitled to have the sum of $1,442,25, the proceeds of sales of goods made under the contract, and which had not ' been paid to it, allowed as a preferred claim. We think it was an agency contract. It is not a contract in which the consignee can sell at any price, or on any , terms he may choose, but, as we understand it, it is a contract or consignment of goods to be sold on commission by the consignee, as agent for the consignor, for cash. The plow company had the right, under the contract, to require the goods returned, and in this it lacks one of the necessary elements of a contract of sale, namely, to pay money, or its equivalent, for the goods delivered, with no obligation to return. In'the case of Met. Nat. Bank v. Benedict Co., 74 Fed. 182, 20 C. C. A. 377, this court had under consideration a contract wherein the consignee agreed \u201cto realize for consignment of ready-made clothing of Benedict Company, as per memorandum received of Henry Benedict, president of the Benedict Company, net prices as per memorandum, without any charges of commission, freight, or any other charges,\u201d and in which the consignee also agreed <em>\u201cto </em>keep the amount of the consignment at all times, until the agreement expires, fully insured'against fire or other damage, and that no part of the assignment shall remain un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>sold nor unpaid by February 1st, 1895.\u201d And the court held that the contract was not a sale, but a contract of factorage, which passed no title to the consignee. In disposing of the case, the court, speaking through Judge Caldwell, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-4\">\u201cThe- money to be paid by the commission company was not upon a sale of the goods to that company, <em>but </em>upon a sale of the- goods by that company. The commission company was never to pay for the goods as upon a purchase by it, but only to account for the proceeds of the sale of them at prices fixed by the- contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Other authorities to the same effect are Sturm v. Boker, 150 U. S. 312,14 Sup. Ct. 99, 37 L. Ed. 1093; Davis v. National Exchange Bank, 91 U. S. 618, 23 L. Ed. 214; Hunt v. Wyman, 100 Mass. 198; Powder Co. v. Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 24 L. Ed. 973.; Reaper Co. v. Raynor, 38 Wis. 119; Union Stockyards &amp; Transit Co. v. Western Land &amp; Cattle Co., 59 Fed. 49, 7 C. C. A. 660; Weir Plow Co. v. Porter, 82 Mo. 23; Mon. Man. Co. v. Jones, 96 Wis. 619, 72 N. W. 44; In re Galt, 120 Fed. 64, 56 C. C. A. 470. In the case last cited, in considering a contract quite similar to the one here, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">\u201cIt was nof contemplated that Galt should ever own these wagons. He was to sell them to others for the company; his commissions to be the amount which he1 might receive over the prices stated in the contract. The proceeds, whether in' cash or in notes of the purchasers, were to be immediately returned to the company; the notes being- guarantied by Galt. This was a del credere commission, and not a sale. The company could compel a return of the goods not sold. Galt had not the option to pay for them in money. Even with respect to the goods unsold within twelve months, the option for their return or payment was with the company, and not with Galt; ' and nowhere in the agreement does the latter covenant to pay for these goods, as in the case of a sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The contract in this case must be read in its entirety, and its construction is not to be gathered from any separate provision of it. It is upon the whole contract that we must search for the intention of the parties, and a careful scrutiny of the agreement before us, in the light of legal principles, compels us to the conviction that it must be held to be a contract of agency, and that the title to the goods in the hands of the\" implement company at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy did-not pass to. the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">A careful examination of this record and the adjudicated cases leads us to the conclusion that the plow company is not entitled to a priority over other creditors to funds in the hands of the trustee. to the amount of. $1,442.25, for the reason that it does not appear that any of the money received from the sale of goods made under the contract actually passed into the hands of, or are held by, the. trustee. The owner of a fund which has been misappropriated by one who held it in trust cannot follow it in the hands of the trustee unless he can trace the trust fund in kind or in specific property into \u2022 which it has been converted, or, if the fund has been mingled with the trustee\u2019s other property, to establish a charge on the mass of such property for the \u00e1mbunt \u00f3f this fund. In other words, he can secure a preference out of the proceeds of the estate of the insolvent only where he can trace the trust property or fund, in its original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>or pome substituted for,m, in the estate which comes-into the hands of the trustee. . , . . _ \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\">In the case of Spokane Co. v. First Nat. Bank, 68 Fed. 979, 16 C. C. A. 81, in disposing of a similar question, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\">\u201cWe are jinable, to assent, to the proposition that, because,a trust..fund; has been .used by the insolvent,in .the .course of his. business, the general creditors of the estate ar\u00e9 by that amount benefited,-and that, therefore, equitable consi,derationa require that Iffe owner of the trust fund be paid out of the estate to their postponement or exclusion. * * * Both .the settled principles of equity and the weight of authority sustain the view that the plaintiff\u2019s right to establish-his trust-and'recover -his fund must :depend upon his ability- to prove that his property is. in. its original or a substituted form in the hands of the defendant.\u201d \". \u2019 . ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">\u25a0 Met.

While conceding the rule to be as above stated, it is said on behalf of the plow company that this was .a Missouri- contract; therefore the decisions of' that state; sho\u00fc\u2019ld be taken as controlling. in this ease. The decisions- \u00f3f . Abe-. Supreme Court of Missouri to which our attention has been, directed are to the- effect -that, where the trust futid is mingled--with the property of the trustee, th\u00e9 owner of the trust fund is entitled; to a preference upon the, entire body of the trustee\u2019s est\u00e1te in insolvency upon the ground' that -the - trust fund has enhanced the estate, and thus given to. the cestui,.que tru\u2019st'an equity superior to that of general'creditors. \u2019The\"trouble in applying this proposition to :the present cas\u00e9' ife that-the evidence in the c\u00e1se, as We have already suggested, does hot sliow' that' the proceeds of the goods sold bythe bankrupt prior to the adjudication, which were received, but not accounted for, by it, ever came ill to the hands of the trustee in 'bankruptcy, either in their original or in some substituted form. But be this'as it may, the question is not upon the construction of'a contract, but upon a . rul\u00e9 of preference in \u00e9quity, and upon that question the fed\u00e9r\u00e1l decisions must control in this court, and they'are \u00bf11 to! the effect that iii a c\u00e1se such as the one before us the preference cannot be.allowed. '</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">It follows from thes\u00e9 conclusions th\u00e1t the order of the District Court must be reversed, with directions to entei* an order directing that the plow company recover from, the trustee in bankruptcy the property which the trustee received from the b\u00e1rikrupt, or th\u00e9 proceeds of it; that its'claim! for the proceeds of the property sold, but not accounted for, prior to; the Adjudication in b\u00e1nkriiptcy, be allowed, and that'the last-mentioned claim be permitted to participate in any dividend or dividends upb'n the same basis as other creditors of the bankrupt.
