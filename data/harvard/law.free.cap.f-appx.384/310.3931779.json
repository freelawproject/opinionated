The intermediate appellate court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal, and Miller filed a state postconviction application seeking leave to file an out-of-time petition for discretionary review (PDR), which was granted. After the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) refused the PDR, Miller brought a state postconviction application challenging his conviction; the TCCA denied this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">Miller then sought relief in federal court by filing the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, which the district court dismissed as barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations. This dismissal was based on the district court\u2019s conclusion that, in light of <em>Salinas v. Dretke, </em>354 F.3d 425 (5th Cir.2004), Miller\u2019s out-of-time PDR was not part of the direct review process for purposes of calculating the federal limitations period. We are now presented with Miller\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">In order to obtain a COA, one must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), (2). When, as is the case here, the district court\u2019s denial of federal habeas relief is based solely on procedural grounds, \u201ca COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Following the district court\u2019s dismissal of Miller\u2019s petition, the Supreme Court held that when \u201ca state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is not yet \u2018final\u2019 for purposes of\u201d the one-year limitations period. <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 681, 686, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009). Although the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jimenez, </em>its reliance on <em>Salinas </em>to conclude that Miller\u2019s petition was untimely was, in light of <em>Jimenez, </em>erroneous. <em>See Womack v. Thaler, </em>591 F.3d 757, 757-58 (5th Cir.2009). Consequently, Miller has shown that reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. Further, we conclude that Miller has satisfied the COA standard with respect to whether reasonable jurists would debate that his petition states a valid constitutional claim. <em>See Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT Miller a COA on the issue whether his petition was barred by the statute of limitations in light of <em>Jimenez, </em>we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment, and we REMAND for further proceedings consistent with <em>Jimenez. See Womack, </em>591 F.3d at 758; <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). We express no opinion on the ultimate disposition of Miller\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
