On appeal, Creason argues that his sentence is unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Au_\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Creason was a 53-year-old music minister who worked at a Baptist Church in Leesburg, Georgia. In 2007, Creason\u2019s 27-year marriage ended in divorce. In 2008, Creason\u2019s income dropped precipitously, causing Creason to experience significant financial troubles, including approximately $60,000 in credit card debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">In August 2008, Creason entered a Leesburg bank, displayed a gun and directed the bank teller and manager to give him money. During the robbery, the teller surreptitiously triggered the silent alarm. After Creason emptied the teller\u2019s cash drawer, he forced the teller and manager at gunpoint into the bank\u2019s vault area, where he took more money, for a total of about $36,000. Because Creason\u2019s ex-wife formerly had worked at the bank, the bank manager knew Creason and begged him not to hurt her. Creason agreed, but told her that if she identified him he would come back and \u201cget her.\u201d As Creason left, he took the bank\u2019s surveillance tape. Police apprehended Creason within minutes of his departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">B. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">Creason pled guilty to armed bank robbery and brandishing a firearm during the bank robbery. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated an advisory guidelines range of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count One (armed bank robbery) based on an adjusted offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of I. The PSI noted that Count Two (brandishing a firearm) carried a statutory, mandatory minimum, seven-year consecutive sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), and that the advisory guidelines sentence for that count was 84 months, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b), the seven-year mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">Creason filed several objections to the PSI, but later withdrew all of them except his objection to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a downward variance. At the sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the PSI and its guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">Creason acknowledged that he was subject to the mandatory minimum seven-year sentence on Count Two, but asked the district court to vary his sentence downward as to Count One for a total sentence \u201cas close to the seven year mark as you can.\u201d In support, Creason pointed out that he had no criminal record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>served for years in the ministry and held a significant role in his church and community. Creason personally addressed the court, acknowledged his mistake and requested leniency so he could care for his family. The district court stated that it had received and read a number of letters written by church members on Creason\u2019s behalf. The government requested a sentence within the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The district court acknowledged that Creason\u2019s case was \u201cunusual,\u201d noting specifically that Creason, at 53, had no prior criminal history, had done \u201can outstanding job\u201d serving his church congregation and had been under emotional and financial stress at the time of the offenses. On the other hand, the district court emphasized that the crime Creason committed was a very serious offense that was fraught with dangerous potential given Creason\u2019s use of the gun. The district court highlighted the fact that someone could have been killed during the robbery and that \u201chowever upset you may have been, ... if some family had to bury a family member there or either your family had to bury you, that would be little consolation, because it is just that type of offense.\u201d The district court stated that \u201cnotwithstanding ... the clear fact here that [Creason was] a person without a criminal background, that does not erase the serious nature of this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The court described its dilemma by stating, \u201cthe problem for the Court becomes, one, how to give you some credit that you obviously deserve for being exemplary in your life up to this point, but at the same time the Court is required to punish the conduct appropriately because it is not just about Mr. Creason. It is about what the message is to others in society when it comes to deterring crime or bad criminal choices.\u201d In light of the foregoing, the court acknowledged the advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines and the factors set forth under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court then imposed a 51-month sentence, at the low-end of the advisory guidelines range, for Count One and the mandatory 84-month sentence for Count Two, to be served consecutively, for a total of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The district court explained that a downward variance was \u201cnot appropriate under the facts as I\u2019ve stated and as I found them,\u201d and that it had taken those facts \u201cinto account in sentencing at the lower end of the guidelines for the first Count....\u201d When Creason objected to the denial of his request for a downward variance, the court noted that in addition to the reasons it had provided previously, it declined to impose a total sentence close to seven years\u2019 imprisonment because \u201cit would in effect mean that there would be no sentence for the primary offense of armed robbery.\u201d Creason filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. Then, we look at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">The party who challenges the sentence has the burden to show that it is unreasonable in light of the record and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Creason argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately explain its refusal to impose a downward variance as to Count One.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record clearly shows otherwise. Indeed, the district court took great pains to explain to Creason why it believed a sentence below the advisory guidelines range on Count One was not appropriate. The district court pointed to the serious nature of the armed robbery, the danger Creason posed to himself and the public in committing the offense, the desire to deter such offenses and the interest in imposing a just punishment for both offenses. Contrary to Creason\u2019s claim, the district court explicitly considered Creason\u2019s personal history and lack of prior criminal record, but concluded that those mitigating facts did not warrant a sentence below the advisory guidelines range. The district court also explicitly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in choosing the sentence. Under our precedent, the district court\u2019s explanation was more than adequate. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">We also reject Creason\u2019s contention that a 51-month sentence on Count One, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable. Bank robbery is a very serious offense. As the district court stressed, Creason\u2019s decision to rob a bank using a gun placed both himself and others in the bank in extreme danger. The district court concluded that the fact that Creason, up to that point, had lived a law-abiding life helping others did not outweigh the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of his offense and deter others and thus did not warrant a sentence below the advisory range. Creason has not given us a reason to disturb the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[Tjhe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>court abused its discretion in imposing a total 135-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">For all these reasons, Creason failed to carry his burden to show that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AIjt\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational <em>or </em>vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the advisory guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-10\">. We find meritless Creason\u2019s suggestion that the district court misapprehended his argument for a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range as a request for a downward departure under Part K of the guidelines. Despite the district court\u2019s occasional reference to a \u2019\u2019departure,\u201d it is clear from the transcript as a whole that the district court understood Creason was seeking a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
