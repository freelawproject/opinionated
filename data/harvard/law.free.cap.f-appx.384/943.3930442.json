United States, </em>417 F.3d 1189, 1196 (11th Cir.2005). The district court properly concluded that Merritt alleged nothing that brought into question the procedural aspects of the forfeiture. (R.l-14.) And, it properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review the merits of a properly executed administrative forfeiture for the reasons stated in its memorandum opinion and order. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-21\">Additionally, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision not to exercise equitable jurisdiction. As in <em>Valderrama, </em>Merritt \u201creceived all the required notice ... in sufficient time to challenge the forfeiture proceeding. \u2018It is inappropriate for a court to exercise equitable jurisdiction to review the merits of a forfeiture matter when the petitioner elected to forego the procedures for pursuing an adequate remedy at law.\u2019 \u201d 417 F.3d at 1197 (quoting <em>In re Matter of Sixty Seven Thousand Four Hundred Seventy Dollars ($67,470.00), </em>901 F.2d 1540, 1545 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"ATpY\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
