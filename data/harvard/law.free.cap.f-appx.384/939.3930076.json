He argues on appeal that the BIA erred when it determined that he had failed to establish that he suffered past persecution and had a well-founded fear of persecution should he be returned to Liberia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-25\">As an initial matter, the government argues that Collins did not exhaust his claim before the BIA that he had established a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-26\">\u201cWe review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Amaya-Artunduaga v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review .unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(holding that the BIA\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>review of an issue does not satisfy the exhaustion requirement). An applicant has not exhausted his administrative remedies where he \u201cwholly failed\u201d to raise a claim or issue before the BIA. <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1228 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">In his brief on appeal to the BIA, Collins recited the three-part test necessary for establishing a well-founded fear of persecution, and he argued that it could be established even where there is only a ten percent chance that the feared harm will materialize. Therefore, we conclude that Collins did not \u201cwholly fail\u201d to argue this issue before the BIA, and we have jurisdiction to address Collins\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Collins next argues that he established past persecution on the basis of imputed political opinion because he presented evidence that (1) he received numerous death threats because the public associated him with former Liberian President Charles Taylor, (2) his wife was arrested and detained because she was Collins\u2019s spouse and because of Collins\u2019s association with Taylor, and (3) in 1990, a rebel made him sit in the dirt while holding a gun to his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Where, as here, the BIA issues its own opinion and does not adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). To the extent that the decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254 (11th Cir.2006). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, \u201c[ujnder the substantial evidence test, we review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255 (quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004)). Thus, \u201ca finding of fact will be reversed only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to any alien determined to be a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the Act. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). \u201cA refugee is defined as one who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicant bears the burden of proof of establishing that he is a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA similarly must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The burden of proof for withholding of removal, however, is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d and thus, is \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the standard for asylum relief. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, an applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Credible testimony may be enough to meet the petitioner\u2019s burden without corroboration. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. If the BIA fails to make an explicit adverse credibility determination, we accept the petitioner\u2019s testimony as credible. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">In order to establish asylum based on past persecution, \u201cthe applicant must prove (1) that [ ]he was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation mai'ks omitted). \u201c[P]ersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1353 (internal quotation marks omitted). Threatening phone calls do not necessarily rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>Silva, </em>we held that the petitioner did not suffer past persecution where she received a written death threat and several threatening phone calls during a one month period. <em>Id. </em>at 1237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Persecution is not established by short periods of detention during which the petitioner does not suffer any serious physical injuries. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Djonda, </em>we held that no persecution occurred when a alien was detained for 36 hours after participating in a political rally, and during his detention, police officers beat him severely enough to warrant a two-day hospital stay, several medications, and two weeks of rest. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, we found that an alien had not established past persecution when he was arrested while participating in a student demonstration, interrogated and beaten for five hours, detained for four days, without showing any physical harm, subsequently monitored by Iranian authorities, and forced to appear before a university discipline committee and an Islamic court. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">However, it may not be necessary for a petitioner to show serious physical injury if he has demonstrated \u201crepeated threats combined with other forms of severe mistreatment.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1009 (11th Cir.2008) (citing examples). Moreover, we \u201cmay consider a threatening act against another as evidence that the petitioner suffered persecution where that act concomitantly threatens the petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009 n. 7. Finally, when assessing whether the petitioner has established past persecution, we consider the cumulative impact of the mistreatment he suffered. <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Here, even when viewed cumulatively, we conclude that the primarily verbal threats and Collins and his wife\u2019s brief detentions during which they suffered no physical injuries do not compel the conclusion that Collins suffered past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Finally, Collins argues that he established an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of future persecution. He contends that despite the end of violent combat in 2003, Liberia is not a safe place. He supports this claim by noting that President Obama renewed Liberia\u2019s temporary protected status last year and by citing to information contained in the 2008 country report for Liberia. He argues that his life or freedom would be endangered if he returned to Liberia, because of his past association with former President Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Proof of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on the same basis. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. However, if the claimant cannot establish past persecution, he may show a well-founded fear of persecution by establishing \u201ca fear of persecution in his country of nationality on account of a protected ground, a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution if [he] returns to that country, and that he is unable or unwilling to return because of his fear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352. This fear must be \u201cboth subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. The petitioner can satisfy the subjective component through credible testimony that he genuinely fears persecution on the basis of the grounds alleged and the objective component by showing that he has a \u201cgood reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289-90 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">\u201cAn applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... if under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352 (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the fact that a petitioner\u2019s family remains in the country without incident may contradict the petitioner\u2019s claims that he has a well-founded fear of persecution if he is returned. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259. Finally, the BIA is \u201centitled to rely heavily on country reports, and the substantial evidence test does not allow [this Court] to reweigh ... from scratch the importance to be placed on\u201d a country report. <em>Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1175 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">As an initial matter, Collins notes that the 2008 country report for Liberia indicates that despite the end of the 1999-2003 civil war and the fact that the government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, significant problems have continued, including mob violence and vigilantism, police abuse, arbitrary arrests, and government corruption. He argues that the information in the country report supports his assertion that he is likely to be targeted if he returns to Liberia. However, we will not consider the 2008 country report because it is not part of the administrative record on appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (noting that \u201cthe court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d). But, we also note that the 2007 country report is part of the administrative record, and it contains a similar recitation of the problems that still plague Liberia.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Collins has a well-founded fear of persecution, because he did not offer evidence to show that his subjective fear of persecution remained reasonable despite the end of Liberia\u2019s civil war and the elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>tion of a new president. Because Collins has failed to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits, he also necessarily has failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. For the above-stated reasons, we deny Collins\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-17\">. Collins failed to raise his CAT claim in his initial brief on appeal; thus, he has waived the claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
