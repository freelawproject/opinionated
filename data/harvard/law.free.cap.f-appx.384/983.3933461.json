For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">Thampi, who was employed as Manatee\u2019s Projects and Engineering Manager, was terminated on February 12, 2007, by his supervisor, Tim Hochuli. Thampi filed a third amended complaint against Manatee, asserting a procedural due process claim (\u201cCount 1\u201d), a First Amendment retaliation claim (\u201cCount 2\u201d), and a Title VII retaliation claim (\u201cCount 3\u201d). Counts 2 and 3 were based on Thampi\u2019s allegation that he was terminated because he was listed as a witness in an internal discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>nation complaint filed by a former coworker, Delores Crockett. Thampi also alleged that, \u201cin further retaliation for ... exercising] his First Amendment rights for being a witness ... [Manatee] used derogatory, false, and/or distorted information designed to derail [his] job offer with Sarasota County.\u201d In response to a motion for summary judgment filed by Manatee, the magistrate dismissed Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Thampi filed a motion to compel discovery, asserting that Manatee had failed to respond to his discovery requests and engaged in an <em>ex parte </em>communication with the magistrate\u2019s law clerk. At a ease management conference, the magistrate stated that communications with a law clerk do not \u201cmean anything,\u201d and that \u201cthe only thing that counts\u201d was a written order. Thampi\u2019s counsel requested an additional 90 days to file amendments to the pleadings, which the magistrate granted after stating that he \u201cd[id not] care\u201d that Tham-pi should have received discovery earlier. The magistrate also granted, in part, Thampi\u2019s motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Manatee filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to Counts 2 and 3 of Thampi\u2019s third amended complaint. Manatee argued that simply being listed as a possible witness on an internal complaint did not constitute \u201cspeech\u201d for First Amendment purposes or \u201copposition\u201d under Title VII. Manatee acknowledged that it provided reference information to Sarasota County (\u201cSarasota\u201d), but it contended that the two employees who served as references for Thampi had no knowledge of Thampi\u2019s lawsuit when they provided the references, and it provided Thampi\u2019s personnel records in response to a public records request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The evidence showed that Thampi was listed as a witness in a January 19, 2007, internal discrimination complaint that Crockett had filed against Hochuli. A February 2, 2007, notice sent to Hochuli stated that an employee in his department had filed a complaint of illegal harassment or discrimination, but did not identify the complainant or any witnesses. On March 1, 2007, Thampi provided a statement to Manatee\u2019s human resources investigators in connection with the Crockett investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">Thampi stated that Crockett informed him around January 4, 2007, that she had listed him as a witness in her discrimination complaint against Hochuli. Thampi told Crockett \u201ctry to leave me out of this,\u201d although he subsequently agreed to allow Crockett to list him as a witness. Hochuli stated that he had never seen Crockett\u2019s complaint, but he received a final report, which contained a list of witnesses, including Thampi. Dale Garcia, Manatee\u2019s Senior Human Resources Manager, never informed Hochuli who Crockett had listed as a witness in her complaint, and Garry Dye, Manatee\u2019s Director of Human Resources, never discussed Crockett\u2019s complaint with anyone outside of human resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">Dan Gray and John Zimmerman stated that Jody Kirkman, an employee of Sarasota, called them in September 2007, because Thampi had listed them as professional references. When they spoke with Kirkman, neither Gray nor Zimmerman were aware that Thampi had filed a lawsuit against Manatee. Kirkman stated that he obtained Thampi\u2019s personnel files from Manatee and recalled seeing a \u201cGoogle search\u201d printout that referenced a lawsuit Thampi had filed against Manatee. Kirkman did not know whether the Google search was conducted by Manatee\u2019s or Sarasota\u2019s human resources department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Thampi filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that his \u201cpartic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>ipation as a witness\u201d in the Crockett investigation constituted \u201cspeech\u201d protected by the First Amendment. Thampi stated that his speech involved a matter of public concern, because it involved racial discrimination by a governmental body. Thampi contended that a causal connection between his being listed as a witness and his termination was established by temporal proximity and the fact that Manatee\u2019s human resources employees knew about his status as a witness in the Crockett complaint. Thampi contended that Manatee took adverse employment actions against him because he served as a witness in the Crockett investigation, filed an EEOC charge, and filed the instant lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The magistrate granted Manatee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The magistrate found that Thampi did not engage in speech protected by the First Amendment because Thampi did not intend to speak when his name was placed on Crockett\u2019s internal complaint form. He noted that, even if Thampi did speak, the speech was not \u201con a matter of public concern.\u201d The magistrate also pointed out that there was no evidence that Hochuli was aware of Thampi\u2019s connection to Crockett\u2019s complaint when Thampi was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The magistrate noted that Thampi mentioned in his response to Manatee\u2019s motion for summary judgment that Manatee retaliated against him for filing the instant lawsuit; however, he declined to consider this claim, because it was not set forth in Thampi\u2019s third amended complaint and, therefore, was not properly pled. Based on these findings, the magistrate dismissed Count 2 of Thampi\u2019s third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">With respect to Thampi\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim, the magistrate found that simply being listed as a witness in Crockett\u2019s discrimination complaint did not fall within the scope of Title VII\u2019s opposition clause. The magistrate further found that Thampi failed to show a causal connection between his termination and his being listed as a witness, because there was no evidence that Hochuli was aware of Tham-pi\u2019s status as a witness when he terminated Thampi. The magistrate again noted that Thampi abandoned any claim that Manatee retaliated against him based on the filing of the instant lawsuit, because he failed to raise this claim in his third amended complaint. Accordingly, the magistrate granted Manatee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Counts II and III of Thampi\u2019s third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">\n<em>A. Retaliation Claims Based on the Filing of the Instant Laivsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">\u201c[We] review[ ] a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Galvez v. Bruce, </em>552 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of fact and compels judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Swisher Intern., Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 71, 175 L.Ed.2d 233 (2009); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">\u201cA pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d and \u201c[e]ach allegation must be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), (d)(1). Recently, we have recognized a tightening of liberal pleading standards, such that \u201ca complaint must now contain sufficient factual matter, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>cepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>American Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2010), quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); compare <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S.Ct. 992, 998, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (finding that the petitioner\u2019s complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)\u2019s pleading requirements \u201cbecause it g[ave] respondent fair notice of the basis for petitioner\u2019s claims\u201d). However, even the liberal pleading standard set forth in <em>Swier-kiewicz </em>\u201cdoes not afford plaintiffs with an opportunity to raise new claims at the summary judgment stage.\u201d <em>Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald and Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cA plaintiff may not amend her complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">A review of Thampi\u2019s third amended complaint shows that Thampi failed to allege retaliation based on the filing of his lawsuit. In fact, Thampi alleged in his third amended complaint that Manatee provided false and damaging information to Sarasota in retaliation \u201cfor being a witness.\u201d If Thampi believed that Manatee had provided this information in retaliation for filing his lawsuit, he could have included this in the third amended complaint. Thampi\u2019s third amended complaint fails to satisfy even the liberal pleading requirement of <em>Swierkietoicz, </em>because it fails to give Manatee any notice that Thampi will be pursuing a claim of retaliation based on the filing of the lawsuit. <em>See Swierkiewicz, </em>534 U.S. at 514, 122 S.Ct. at 998. Even Thampi\u2019s motion for leave to file his third amended complaint contains no mention of retaliation based on the filing of the instant lawsuit. Furthermore, although Thampi raised the issue in his memorandum of law in support of his motion for summary judgment, new claims may not be raised at the summary judgment stage, unless the plaintiff seeks to amend his complaint in accordance with Rule 15(a). <em>See Gilmour, </em>382 F.3d at 1314-1315. Thampi contends that the district court should have allowed him to pursue his claims of retaliation based on the filing of the lawsuit, because Manatee responded to the merits of the claims. However, Tham-pi cites no case law in support of this assertion, and <em>Gilmour </em>specifically provides that plaintiffs may not raise new claims at the summary judgment stage. <em>See Gilmour, </em>382 F.3d at 1314-15. Accordingly, because Thampi never amended his complaint to include a claim of retaliation based on the filing of his lawsuit, such a claim was not properly pled, and the magistrate did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Manatee on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">\n<em>B. Retaliation Claims Based on Thampi Being Listed as a Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">As an initial matter, Thampi\u2019s argument focuses on whether his being listed as a witness in Crockett\u2019s complaint constituted protected speech under the First Amendment or protected conduct under Title VH. Thampi fails to argue and, therefore, has abandoned any argument, that he was retaliated against based on the actual statements he provided to investigators in March 2007. <em>See Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 972 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cIt is well settled in this circuit that an argument not included in the appellant\u2019s opening brief is deemed abandoned\u201d). Thampi has also abandoned any claim that his being listed as a witness in Crockett\u2019s internal complaint constitutes protected activity under Title VTI\u2019s participation clause. <em>See Davis, </em>516 F.3d at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>\n<em>i. First Amendment Retaliation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, \u201ca plaintiff must establish first, that his speech or act was constitutionally protected; second, that the defendant\u2019s retaliatory conduct adversely affected the protected speech; and third, that there is a causal connection between the retaliatory actions and the adverse effect on speech.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Hendrix, </em>423 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). For an employee\u2019s speech to warrant First Amendment protection, \u201cthe employee must have (1) spoken as a citizen and (2) addressed matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Boyce v. Andrew, </em>510 F.3d 1333, 1341 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cDeciding whether a government employee\u2019s speech relates to his or her job as opposed to an issue of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343 (quotation omitted). We have held that, where an employee\u2019s concerns about sexual harassment focused on the conditions of her own employment and were not spoken in public, but instead, were made in the form of a complaint to an official body, the speech was not a matter of public concern. <em>See Morgan v. Ford, </em>6 F.3d 750, 755 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Thampi\u2019s being listed as a witness in Crockett\u2019s complaint does not constitute speech protected by the First Amendment for two reasons. First, Thampi did not \u201cspeak\u201d on any matter. When he was informed that Crockett had listed him as a witness, Thampi did not express any opinion on the merits of Crockett\u2019s complaint or indicate what he would tell investigators. In fact, he initially asked Crockett to \u201cleave [him] out of this.\u201d Second, even if simply being listed as a witness constituted \u201cspeech,\u201d it is impossible to say that the speech was on an issue of public concern. <em>Boyce </em>instructs courts to examine the content, form, and context of a given statement to determine if the speech involves an issue of public concern. <em>See Boyce, </em>510 F.3d at 1343. Here, there is no content, form, or context to examine, because Thampi had not spoken at the time that he was terminated. Even if one could assume that Thampi would testify in Crockett\u2019s favor, the testimony would be given in private and would focus on a co-worker\u2019s conditions of employment. Thus, the speech would not involve a matter of public concern. <em>See Morgan, </em>6 F.3d at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Thampi would not be entitled to relief on his First Amendment retaliation claim, even if his being listed as a witness constituted speech protected by the First Amendment, because he failed to show that he was terminated in retaliation for his willingness to serve as a witness in the Crockett investigation. <em>See Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 1250. In his deposition, Hochuli stated that he had never seen Crockett\u2019s complaint, although he received a final report containing a list of witnesses. This final report would not have been compiled until well after Thampi was terminated, as the investigation into the complaint continued at least through March 2007, when Thampi was interviewed by investigators. Furthermore, Garcia and Dye both stated that they never informed Hochuli of the identity of the witnesses listed in the Crockett complaint. Thampi cites no evidence rebutting these statements. Accordingly, because Thampi\u2019s being listed as a witness does not appear to constitute \u201cspeech\u201d protected by the First Amendment, and because Thampi failed to establish a causal connection between his being listed as a witness and his termination, the magistrate did not err in granting Manatee\u2019s motion for summary judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>Thampi\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim. <em>See Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">\n<em>ii. Title VII\u2019s Opposition Clmtse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Under Title VII\u2019s opposition clause, an employer may not retaliate against an employee because the employee has opposed an unlawful employment practice. <em>EEOC v. Total Sys. Serv., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff may show that: (1) he participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment decision. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cTo establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse actions were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>292 <em>F.3d </em>712, 716 (11th Cir.2002). Close proximity in time between the protected activity and the adverse employment action \u201cis insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to causal connection when there is unrebutted evidence that the decision-maker did not have knowledge that the employee engaged in protected conduct.\u201d <em>Brungart v. Bell-South Telecomm., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Manatee does not dispute that Thampi\u2019s termination constituted an adverse employment action. However, Thampi has not engaged in activity protected by Title VII\u2019s opposition clause. Thampi at first protested being listed as a witness, asking Crockett to \u201ctry to leave [him] out of this,\u201d although he eventually agreed to the listing. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Thampi, at any time prior to his termination, told Crockett or any other Manatee employee the nature of his proposed testimony. Although \u201copposition\u201d does not require \u201cactive, consistent behavior,\u201d it requires at least the disclosure of an individual\u2019s position or opinion on a matter. <em>Crawford v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville and Davidson County, </em>555 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 846, 851, 172 L.Ed.2d 650 (2009) (holding that \u201c \u2018[o]ppose\u2019 goes beyond \u2018active, consistent\u2019 behavior\u201d and includes instances in which an individual \u201chas taken no action at all to advance a position <em>beyond disclosing it </em>\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, simply being listed as a witness on an internal complaint form, without actively volunteering to serve as a witness or offering some indication of the nature of the proposed testimony does not constitute \u201copposition\u201d under Title VTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Nevertheless, even if Thampi\u2019s being listed as a witness on Crockett\u2019s complaint constituted \u201copposition,\u201d he has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, because he failed to show a causal connection between his being listed as a witness and his termination. <em>See Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 970. Although Thampi was terminated only weeks after he was listed as a witness, he presented no evidence establishing that Hochuli knew, when he terminated Thampi, that Thampi was listed as a witness in Crockett\u2019s complaint. <em>See Shannon, </em>292 F.3d at 716; <em>Brungart, </em>231 F.3d at 799. As discussed above, all of the evidence submitted to the magistrate indicates that Hochuli was unaware that Thampi was listed as a witness at the time he terminated Thampi. Because Thampi has failed to show a causal connection between his being listed as a witness in Crockett\u2019s complaint and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>termination, he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII. Accordingly, the magistrate did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Manatee on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">\n<em>C. Magistrate\u2019s Failure to Recuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Generally, we review a magistrate\u2019s decision not to recuse himself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Thomas v. Tenneco Packaging Co., Inc., </em>293 F.3d 1306, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2002). However, where a party fails to seek recu-sal of the magistrate in the district court, we review the magistrate\u2019s decision not to recuse himself for plain error. <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983). Under plain error review, the party raising the issue has the burden to show that (1) there is error (2) that is plain (3) that affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights and (4) \u201cnot correcting the error would seriously affect the fairness of the judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, a magistrate should disqualify himself if his \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d or if the magistrate \u201chas a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), (b)(1). \u201cThe general rule is that bias sufficient to disqualify a judge must stem from extrajudicial sources ... and must be focused against a party to the proceeding.\u201d <em>Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651. \u201cAn exception to that rule is made when a judge\u2019s remarks in a judicial context demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it constitutes bias against a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cNeither a trial judge\u2019s comments on lack of evidence, rulings adverse to a party, nor friction between the court and counsel constitute pervasive bias.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">As an initial matter, because Thampi did not seek recusal of the magistrate judge, we review Thampi\u2019s bias argument for plain error. <em>See Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651. Thampi\u2019s claims of bias rest upon (1) Manatee\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication with the magistrate\u2019s law clerk, and (2) the magistrate\u2019s \u201chostile\u201d statements made at the case management conference. Thampi\u2019s claims fail for several reasons. First, Thampi cites no binding case law providing that a magistrate must recuse himself if one party engages in an <em>ex parte </em>communication with the magistrate\u2019s law clerk. <em>See United States v. LeCroy, </em>441 F.3d 914, 930-31 (11th Cir.2006) (providing that an error is not plain if there is no relevant case law). Second, the magistrate\u2019s comments at the case management conference did not \u201cdemonstrate ... pervasive bias and prejudice.\u201d <em>See Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651. Thampi cites two instances in which the court responded \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t really care\u201d when his attorney stated that he had been put at a disadvantage. However, two comments demonstrating \u201cfriction between the court and counsel\u201d do not constitute \u201cpervasive bias.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Finally, Thampi failed to show that either of the two alleged errors affected his substantial rights. <em>See Farley, </em>197 F.3d at 1329. The magistrate\u2019s comments at the case management conference were made in response to Thampi\u2019s request for a 90-day extension of the period in which to file amendments. Ultimately, the magistrate granted this request. The magistrate also granted, in part, Thampi\u2019s motion to compel discovery, ordering that Manatee provide the discovery Thampi had requested. Thampi does not allege that he was prejudiced by any of the magistrate\u2019s rulings. Accordingly, the magistrate did not plainly err in failing to recuse himself, and we affirm the grant of summary judgment in Manatee\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"AEPm\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">.
