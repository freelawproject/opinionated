Nervil argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-23\">In 2004, Nervil pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 371, 2113(a), (d), and bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d), and received a sentence of 36 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. In March 2009, the district court found that Nervil violated a condition of his supervised release when he battered his girlfriend by strangling her. The district court revoked Nervil\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to time served and four years of supervised release, with the condition that Nervil complete a domestic intervention program.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">In November 2009, the government petitioned to revoke Nervil\u2019s supervised release for failing to participate in the intervention program. According to the petition, Nervil failed to attend five counseling sessions at the Dade Family Counseling Service. The advisory guideline range provided a sentence of three to nine months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">At the revocation hearing, the government recounted Nervil\u2019s criminal history and the lenient sentences he had received previously. The government requested that the district court sentence Nervil to eight months of imprisonment because Nervil had \u201cresisted treatment\u201d and \u201cdenied any wrongdoing,\u201d missed counseling after he began promoting local recording artists, and failed to submit documents required to obtain approval for his travel. Nervil admitted violating a condition of his supervised release, and he requested a sentence \u201cat the low end of the guideline range.\u201d Nervil argued that he had attended 17 counseling sessions, had missed one session because of work, and had otherwise complied with the terms of his release. The district court asked why Nervil had missed his sessions, and Nervil responded that he could not \u201cafford\u201d the sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Raul Vidal of the Dade County Family Counseling Service testified at the revocation hearing. Vidal stated that Nervil had incurred about $170 in past due fees and the Service later reduced Nervil\u2019s counseling fee to $20 per session, after which \u201che continued to miss sessions.\u201d Vidal opined that Nervil\u2019s finances were \u201cnot the reason that he stopped going\u201d to counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The district court found that Nervil had \u201cviolated the terms and conditions of supervised release and revoke[d] the period of supervised release.\u201d The district court sentenced Nervil to six months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. The district court ordered that \u201c[a]ll other conditions\u201d imposed at his previous revocation proceeding were to \u201cremain in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">Nervil argues that the district court failed to consider all factors relevant to his sentence and imposed a greater sentence than necessary, but the district court was familiar with the circumstances of Nervil\u2019s case and imposed a reasonable sentence. The district court expressed concern that Nervil had failed to \u201ctake [the condition of his supervised release] as seriously as [he] should have\u201d and found that Nervil\u2019s \u201cexplanations\u201d for failing to attend counseling were \u201c[in]sufficient.\u201d After it \u201ccarefully considered the statements of all parties and the information contained in the violation report,\u201d the district court concluded that a term of imprisonment followed by supervised release in which Nervil completed a domestic counseling program was necessary to impress Nervil about the need to comply with the law, deter Nervil from similar misconduct, and address Ner-vil\u2019s violent tendencies. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A)-(B), (a)(2)(D). The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence in the middle of the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">Nervil\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
