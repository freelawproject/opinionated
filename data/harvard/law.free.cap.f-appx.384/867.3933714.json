He included his wife, Olga Sidorova, as a derivative beneficiary on his application. On appeal, Ladnov argues that he suffered past persecution in Estonia because of his ethnicity and race, so he should be presumed as having established a well-founded fear of future persecution. He argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in classifying the past persecution as mere \u201cincidents of harassment and discrimination\u201d that did not rise to the level of persecution. Ladnov argues that the BIA and IJ erred when determining if he was persecuted because they failed to aggregate the events of \u201cdiscrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>nation, ostracism, and violence\u201d he faced in Estonia. He contends that the facts of his case are similar to those of the applicants in <em>Matter of O-Z &amp; I-Z, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 23 (BIA 1998). He contends that his expert witness and the Estonian country report provided uncontroverted evidence that the Estonian government is unwilling or unable to protect him. He further contends that conditions in Estonia have not improved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the determination by the BIA that an applicant is statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283. We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">An alien who arrives or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), INA \u00a7 208(a)(1). To qualify for asylum, the alien must be a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), INA \u00a7 208(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that his statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). We have defined persecution as an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted). \u201cMere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). \u201c[E]mployment discrimination which stops short of depriving an individual of a means of earning a living does not constitute persecution.\u201d <em>Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1340 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that although petitioner suffered employment discrimination, lost his job as a taxi driver, and was forced to take menial work, he was not persecuted).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">An applicant who has demonstrated past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). However, when an applicant fails to demonstrate past persecution, he must establish that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing (1) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (2) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which he is a part. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(2), (b)(3)(i). An alien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>who cannot demonstrate past persecution also has the burden of showing that it would not be reasonable for the alien to relocate in the home country, unless the persecution is by the government or is government-sponsored. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Under the INA, an alien shall not be removed to her country of origin if her life or freedom would be threatened in that country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), INA \u00a7 241(b)(3). This standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than the well-founded fear standard for asylum. <em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1010-11 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, if an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally is unable to qualify for withholding of removal or deportation. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision affirming denial of Ladnov\u2019s petition for asylum and withholding of removal. In concluding that Ladnov was ineligible for asylum, and consequently, withholding of removal, the BIA noted that Ladnov testified regarding \u201csignificant incidents of harassment and discrimination at the hands of ethnic Estonians in October 1993 and April 1998.\u201d However, the BIA noted that despite this harassment Ladnov was able to obtain a degree in mechanical engineering and receive a visa to study in the United States. The BIA also adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning regarding past persecution. Thus, we review the portion of the IJ\u2019s order that discusses this issue. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Contrary to Ladnov\u2019s assertion, the IJ stated that he cumulatively considered the events that Ladnov described, but found that they did not rise to the level of persecution and appeared to be isolated incidents. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination. Ladnov complained that he was ostracized as a child and developed a speech impediment. Regarding the 1993 school-dance attack, Lad-nov was called names and suffered a broken nose from an attack. Regarding the 1998 tram-stop incident, Ladnov was hit and suffered a split lip, hematomas, and a headache. All of these may have been harmful, but did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (noting that persecution is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d). Moreover, considering that large intervals of time elapsed between the events that Ladnov described, substantial evidence exists to indicate that these events did not rise to the level of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The IJ noted that Ladnov alleged that he was deprived of jobs in Estonia because of his ethnicity. However, the IJ found that Ladnov\u2019s \u201ccontention finds little documentary support in the record.\u201d Ladnov testified that he applied for 25 or 30 mechanical engineering positions in Estonia, but was denied all of them because he had a Russian accent when he spoke Estonian. He also noted that he worked \u201codd-jobs to survive\u201d because he was unable to obtain a mechanical engineering job. Thus, although he could not find a mechanical engineering position, he was able to find other work, so this alleged employment discrimination did not constitute persecution. <em>See Barreto-Claro, </em>275 F.3d at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning regarding Ladnov\u2019s failure to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of future persecution. In pertinent part, the IJ noted that Ladnov\u2019s family remained in Estonia, and that the incidents to which Ladnov testified occurred many years ago. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Thus, the IJ correctly noted that Ladnov failed to demonstrate that Estonia has \u201ca pattern or practice\u201d of discriminating against other dark-skinned people. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). Moreover, Ladnov did not show that \u201ca reasonable possibility\u201d exists that he will be persecuted. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Although Ladnov argues that the facts of his case are similar to those of the petitioner in <em>Matter of O-Z &amp; I-Z, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 23, the BIA found that the mistreatment cited in <em>Matter of O-Z &amp; I-Z-</em>was significantly more severe than the incidents of harassment and discrimination described by Ladnov. In <em>Matter of O-Z &amp; I-Z, </em>the respondents suffered a series of violent attacks, in which they were physically harmed, over a two-year period. <em>See Matter of O-Z &amp; I-Z, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 23. Here, Ladnov testified to events of discrimination he endured as a child, the 1993 school-dance incident, the 1997 marriage license incident, the 1998 tram-stop incident, and his inability to find a mechanical engineering job. These events occurred far apart and appear to be \u201ca few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d so they do not constitute persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Moreover, Professor Ralph S. Clem\u2019s affidavit does not indicate otherwise. Although Clem noted that an \u201cextremely hostile atmosphere\u201d exists in Estonia \u201cfor persons of ethnic Russian descent,\u201d he could not definitively state whether Lad-nov would be persecuted if he returned to Estonia. Clem also did not state that the government was unwilling or unable to protect Ladnov. Instead, Clem attested that \u201cLadnov would very likely be subject to continued discrimination in the workplace, and quite possibly, continuing physical danger, in Estonia because of his Russian ethnicity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In addition, the United States Department of State\u2019s 2007 Country Report for Estonia does not support Ladnov\u2019s contentions. The Report noted that the Estonian government \u201cgenerally respected the human rights of citizens and the large ethnic Russian noncitizen community,\u201d and that problems only existed in some areas. The report noted that \u201c[\u00a1Instances of overt hostility based on ethnicity or race were infrequent, but they occurred.\u201d The report also noted that Estonian law \u201cprohibits incitement to hatred, violence, or discrimination\u201d based upon, <em>inter alia, </em>nationality, race, skin color, language, and social origin. Thus, the evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Farquharson, </em>246 F.3d at 1320. Because Ladnov fails to satisfy his burden to obtain asylum, he fails to satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"Al_\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">. Ladnov fails to challenge on appeal the BIA's denial of protection under the CAT. Thus, he has abandoned this issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \"[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned,\u201d and that \u201cpassing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal, and such issues are deemed abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
