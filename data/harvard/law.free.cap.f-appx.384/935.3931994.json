Davis contends (1) the district court violated his right to equal protection by considering the crack cocaine Guidelines range as part of its sentencing decision, and (2) his sentence is proeedurally and substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm Davis\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">For the first time on appeal, Davis argues the district court violated his right to equal protection because the crack cocaine Guidelines are unconstitutional based on their racially disparate impact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Davis relies on the 2007 Sentencing Commission\u2019s Report and Amendment 706 which altered the Guidelines so that the crack/powder ratio varies at different offense levels between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1. Davis argues this Court should reject the disparity because it is arbitrary and based on \u201cunsound judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">The district court\u2019s consideration of the crack cocaine Guidelines was not plain error. We have not held the post-Amendment 706 crack cocaine Guidelines violate equal protection. Similarly, the Supreme Court has made no such holding. Moreover, the legitimacy of the rationale behind the continued sentencing disparity remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>a matter of debate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Davis has failed to show the court plainly erred by considering the crack cocaine Guidelines in fashioning his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Davis argues his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the court treated the crack cocaine Guidelines as mandatory and failed to sentence him based on a \u201c1-to-l\u201d crack to powder cocaine ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to calculate or incorrectly calculated the Guidelines, treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Once we conclude the district court made no procedural errors, we will then consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence,\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it is not supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 600. A district court\u2019s \u201cunjustified reliance\u201d on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor \u201cmay be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">We conclude Davis\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable. First, the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines, explicitly acknowledged the Guidelines were advisory and expressly stated it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Second, the district court considered Davis\u2019s request for a downward departure. Finally, the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence is sufficient to allow for meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Davis\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable because the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Davis\u2019s history and characteristics and the nature of the offense, show his sentence is sufficient but not greater than necessary to fulfill the statutory purposes of sentencing. Moreover, the record reflects that the court gave due consideration to mitigating factors because Davis\u2019s sentence fell in the middle of the Guidelines range and was substantially below the statutory maximum of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to depart below Davis\u2019s Guidelines range based solely on the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. 558. Accordingly, we affirm Davis\u2019s sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AesK\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-12\">. For purposes of this appeal, we deny the Government's motion to dismiss and assume <em>arguendo </em>that the sentence-appeal waiver contained in Davis's plea agreement is unenforceable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-13\">. Davis's mention of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), was not sufficient to implicate an equal protection challenge because the <em>Kimbrough </em>holding did not relate to the constitutionality of the amended crack cocaine Guidelines. Thus, the plain error standard applies. <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>489 F.3d 1117, 1125 (11th Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, \"there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>469 F.3d 963, 966 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b962-7\">. Currently, pending legislation in the House of Representatives would impose a \"1-to-l\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio with regard to statutory penalties. <em>See </em>Fairness in Cocaine Sentencing Act of 2009, H.R. 3245, 111th Cong. (2010). By contrast, the Senate recently approved a bill which only would contain an \"18-to-l\u201d crack-to-powder cocaine ratio. <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, S. 1789, llith Cong, (as passed by Senate, March 17, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
