He has also moved for leave to file a reply brief out of time. We have a duty to examine the basis of its jurisdiction, sua sponte, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement in a civil case. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). As \u00a7 2254 actions are civil in nature, Charles\u2019s notice of appeal had to be filed within 30 days following the entry of the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his \u00a7 2254 application. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a); <em>Archer v. Lynaugh, </em>821 F.2d 1094, 1096 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-22\">Although Charles\u2019s notice of appeal was marked as filed by the district court 11 days after it was due, it would be timely if the prison mailbox rule were applicable, given that Charles mailed it before the expiration of the limitations period for filing his notice of appeal. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988); Rule 4(c)(1). The prison mailbox rule does not apply to Charles\u2019s notice of appeal, however, as it was delivered to prison authorities for forwarding to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal, as reflected in the address on the envelope that contained the notice of appeal. <em>See Houston, </em>487 U.S. at 272-73, 108 S.Ct. 2379 (\u201c[Djelivery of a notice of appeal to prison authorities would not under any theory constitute a \u2018filing\u2019 unless the notice were delivered for forwarding to the district court.\u201d); <em>see also Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186-87 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Thompson v. Rasberry, </em>993 F.2d 513, 515 (5th Cir.1993). Similarly, Charles\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris (IFP) also was mailed by Charles before the expiration of the time period for appealing but was addressed and mailed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AWY\">Charles did not move for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal with us, and none of his filings contained any assertion of good cause or excusable neglect for filing a late notice of appeal. The district court\u2019s orders granting Charles a certificate of appealability and leave to proceed IFP contained no statement regarding the timeliness of his notice of appeal or any mention of good cause or excusable neglect for Charles\u2019s late filing of his notice of appeal. As Charles\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, his appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 213-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360; <em>see also Mann v. Lynaugh, </em>840 F.2d 1194, 1198-1199 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
