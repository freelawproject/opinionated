We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-23\">In 1996, Brown was convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the judgment on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-24\">In 1998, Brown moved to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, asserting that the sentencing court improperly enhanced his sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d), and that counsel failed to raise this issue on direct appeal. In denying Brown\u2019s motion, the District Court determined that Brown\u2019s sentence was properly enhanced based on three prior violent felony convictions for aggravated battery, resisting arrest with violence, and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-25\">Brown attempted to challenge his sentence enhancement again in 2008 by filing a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The District Court dismissed the petition as an attempt to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, explaining that Brown was required to obtain the authorization of the court of appeals to file such a motion. Brown then unsuccessfully moved for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In 2009, Brown filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania challenging his sentencing enhancement. The District Court dismissed the petition, concluding that Brown was required to seek relief under \u00a7 2255. The District Court stated that a \u00a7 2255 motion was not an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d remedy because the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals had denied his request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The District Court also rejected Brown\u2019s argument that a \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d because he had no means to raise a claim of actual innocence under <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). The District Court denied Brown\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration, which presented additional arguments in support of his habeas petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">As recognized by the District Court, motions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Although a petitioner may challenge a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a \u00a7 2255 motion is not inadequate or ineffective because the petitioner is unable to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatekeeping requirements. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Brown has not made such a showing. The fact that Brown was unable to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatekeeping requirements does not render a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d Brown\u2019s case is also distinguishable from <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), in which we allowed the petitioner to raise a <em>Bailey </em>claim under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner in that case had no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that <em>Bailey </em>may have negated. <em>Id. </em>at 251. Although Brown contends that the Supreme Courts\u2019 decision in <em>Begay </em>prohibits the use of one of his prior convictions to enhance his sentence, <em>Begay </em>held that a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 139, 128 S.Ct. 1581. Brown\u2019s sentence was not enhanced based on such a conviction and <em>Begay </em>is inapplicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The District Court also rejected Brown\u2019s argument that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2008), which held that a conviction for simple battery under Florida law constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, supports the conclusion that his sentence was improperly enhanced. The Supreme Court has since reversed <em>Johnson, </em>holding that the sentencing court erred in enhancing the defendant\u2019s sentence based on his pri- or simple assault conviction. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1269-72, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Brown\u2019s sentence, however, was enhanced based on his prior conviction for aggravated battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045, not simple battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03. Thus, his reliance on <em>Johnson </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Finally, the District Court did not err in denying Brown\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">. In <em>Bailey, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant could not be convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) unless the government proved that the defendant \"actively employed the firearm during and in relation to the predicate crime.\u201d <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 247 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\">. In addition, Brown contends that <em>Begay </em>prohibits the use of his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon to enhance his sentence, but it does not appear that his sentence was enhanced based on such a conviction. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>S.D. Fl. 98-cv-08425, Magistrate Judge's Report at 11 (stating that Brown\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on his convictions for aggravating bat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tery, resisting arrest with violence, and burglary).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
