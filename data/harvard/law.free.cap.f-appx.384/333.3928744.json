A certificate of appealability was granted to review whether trial counsel was ineffective for opening the door to testimony by Palacios\u2019s accomplice, Omar Escobedo, that Palacios attempted to kill an eyewitness to the crime, Patricia Salazar. <em>Palacios v. Thaler, </em>No. 08-41043 (5th Cir. Sep.11, 2009) (unpublished; single-judge order). Because the certified question was rejected on the merits by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in Palacios\u2019s state ha-beas action, we must defer to the state court\u2019s adjudication unless it was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d). To find an unreasonable application of federal law, this court must determine that the state court\u2019s ruling was objectively unreasonable and not simply erroneous or incorrect. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. Martinez v. Johnson, </em>255 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">To demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, Palacios must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A failure to establish either prong defeats the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate prejudice, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To meet this standard, he must show the error undermines confidence in the reliability of the verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">Assuming, arguendo, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, Palacios nevertheless fails to show a reasonable probability that the jury\u2019s verdict was affected by Escobedo\u2019s testimony that Palacios attempted to kill Salazar. Palacios asserts that the testimony affected the outcome of his trial because it gave credibility to the State\u2019s theory of the case, it suggested that he wanted to cover up the murder, and it \u201ceffectively destroyed\u201d his theory that Escobedo was the murderer. According to Palacios, in the absence of the evidence concerning Salazar, the weight of the evidence would have tipped in his favor. He emphasizes testimony by a forensic analyst that residue from a firearm is more likely to be found on the back of a shooter\u2019s hand than his palm. He highlights the analyst\u2019s testimony that gunshot residue was detected on the back of Esco-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>bedo\u2019s hands but not on the back of Palac-ios\u2019s hands. He notes the analyst\u2019s finding that \u201cEscobedo either discharged a firearm, handled a discharged firearm, or was in close proximity to a discharged firearm.\u201d Palacios also relies upon the prosecutor\u2019s repeated emphasis of Escobedo\u2019s testimony concerning the alleged attempt to kill Salazar.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The defense\u2019s theory of the case was that Escobedo killed the victim and was lying about Palacios to save himself. Counsel\u2019s opening the door to additional inculpatory testimony by Escobedo did not \u201cdestroy\u201d that theory. The jury credited Escobedo\u2019s testimony despite his self-serving account of the events. <em>See Palacios v. State, </em>No. 04-03-00200-CR, 2004 WL 2533239, at *3 (Tex.App.-San Antonio Nov.10, 2004). Even without Escobedo\u2019s testimony about Salazar, there was ample evidence to support a guilty verdict. Es-cobedo testified that he saw Palacios shoot the victim twice and kill him. He testified that Palacios fought with the victim inside of the house, shot the victim inside of the house, followed the victim into the street, hit the victim on the head with the butt of his gun, kicked the victim, then shot the victim again in the street as the victim tried to get up from the ground. After his own gun jammed, Palacios took Escobedo\u2019s .380 caliber gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Escobedo testified that he assumed that Palacios took his gun to shoot the victim. According to Escobedo, Palacios hit the victim again in the back of the head with the butt of Escobedo\u2019s gun, using enough force to break the gun. Palacios and Es-cobedo heard sirens and ran from the scene. Escobedo testified that, as they started to run away, he grabbed the two guns from Palacios. While they were running, they realized that they were going to be apprehended, and Palacios took his own gun back from Escobedo.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">A police officer corroborated Escobedo\u2019s account by testifying that he saw two men (whom he later identified as Escobedo and Palacios) running a half-block from the crime scene who appeared to be concealing something at their waistlines and to be exchanging something that could have been two handguns. Escobedo\u2019s testimony also was corroborated by testimony from a crime lab analyst that eight particles of substances consistent with gunshot residue were found on Palacios\u2019s right hand, while only one particle was found on Escobedo\u2019s right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">In light of all of the evidence of Palac-ios\u2019s guilt, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland. See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 694, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052; \u00a7 2254(d). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir.
