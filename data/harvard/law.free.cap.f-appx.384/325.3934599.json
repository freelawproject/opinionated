Cortez argues, for the purpose of preserving the issue for possible Supreme Court review, that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and thus is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a) because the Sentencing Guidelines account for a prior conviction both to increase his offense level and to calculate his criminal history score. Cortez further contends that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense because his conduct was not violent and that the guidelines range did not properly account for his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for reentering.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Cortez\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). We have also previously rejected the argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Cortez\u2019s arguments concerning the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors amount to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of these factors and the appropriateness of his within-guidelines sentence. This disagreement does not suffice to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Cortez has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable, and he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 405 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 54, 175 L.Ed.2d 44 (2009); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
