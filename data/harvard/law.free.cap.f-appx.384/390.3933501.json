In 2009, Rich filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 824, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), Rich argued that the jury instruction for his CCE offense impermissibly enlarged the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Rich appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition. He argues that the district court erred by relying on the savings clause test set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Our review is de novo. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 900-04, we held that in order to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause, the petitioner must set forth a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. Rich argues that rather than the test set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>we should employ the savings clause test set forth by the Seventh Circuit in <em>In re Davenport, </em>147 F.3d 605, 611 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">Rich has not shown that the facts of his case are not controlled by <em>Reyes-Requena. </em>Absent an en banc decision by this court or intervening Supreme Court decision explicitly or implicitly overruling <em>Reyes-Re-quena, </em>we are bound by the precedent established in <em>Reyes-Requena. See United States v. Rodriguez-Jaimes, </em>481 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.2007). We note, however, that Rich\u2019s reliance on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s <em>Davenport </em>test is flawed because <em>Davenport </em>also contains an actual innocence requirement. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 902-03 &amp; n. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">Rich has not demonstrated that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 under the reasoning set forth in <em>Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830. Accordingly, the judgment of the court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
