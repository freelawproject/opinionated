In his earlier appeal, we vacated Ehrlich\u2019s conviction for aggravated identity theft and remanded the case for the district court to determine, in light of <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 1888-89, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), whether Ehrlich knew that the identification he used belonged to another person. <em>See United States v. Ehrlich, </em>334 Fed.Appx. 216, 217 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(\u201cEhrlich I </em>\u201d). On remand, the district court, at a bench trial, determined that the stipulated facts established the requisite knowledge element, and re-adjudicated Ehrlich guilty of aggravated identity theft under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). On appeal, Ehrlich makes the following two arguments: (1) the district court erred by failing to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>his \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) charge because the government waived its opportunity to prove the knowledge element by failing to argue, at the first bench trial, that the stipulated facts established that element; and (2) evidence presented at the trial on remand was insufficient to establish the knowledge element.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Ehrlich first argues that the government waived the opportunity to prove the knowledge element for aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). The basis for that waiver, according to Ehrlich, is the fact that the government did not argue at the first bench trial that the stipulated facts established the knowledge element. Ehrlich does not assert that this court\u2019s mandate in <em>Ehrlich I </em>was unlawful, but rather, he contends that the mandate did not address, and therefore did not supplant, the doctrine of waiver. Finally, while he concedes that he did not raise before the district court his arguments <em>concerning </em>waiver, he contends that the district court, on remand, nevertheless committed plain error by not <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing the \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) charge on the basis of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s compliance with our mandate. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe mandate rule is simply an application of the law of the case doctrine,\u201d that \u201coperates to create efficiency, finality, and obedience within the judicial system so that an appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829-30 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">\u201cAccordingly, when acting under an appellate court\u2019s mandate, a district court cannot vary it, or examine it for any other purpose than execution; or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent error, upon a matter decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has been remanded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, \u201c[t]his court has recognized three exceptions to the mandate rule: (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>trary decision of law applicable to that issue, or (3) the prior appellate decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">In this case, we conclude that the mandate rule forecloses Ehrlich\u2019s arguments concerning waiver. Specifically, our mandate in <em>Ehrlich I, </em>directing the district court to determine whether the stipulated facts established the knowledge element required to sustain Ehrlich\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), effectively gave the government another opportunity to prove that element. Accordingly, Ehrlich\u2019s true bone of contention is not with the district court\u2019s undertakings on remand, but rather with our mandate in <em>Ehrlich I. </em>Ehrlich does not, and cannot, challenge this mandate on appeal. Further, we conclude that none of Ehrlich\u2019s other arguments on appeal concerning this issue have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">On the merits, Ehrlich argues that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove the knowledge element for his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Specifically, he asserts that, under <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>the government, in order to prove the knowledge element circumstantially, needed to provide evidence of the manner in which he obtained his victim\u2019s identification information. Additionally, he asserts that the district court\u2019s finding of the knowledge element based on his use of the victim\u2019s identification to obtain various lines of credit amounted to speculation because a person successfully may obtain credit based on a completely fictitious identity. Finally, he attempts to distinguish <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>595 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir.2010), on the ground that, in that case, the defendant, over a period of years, submitted the victim\u2019s identification information to rigorous governmental verification processes. <em>Id. </em>at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence to uphold a conviction. <em>See United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cWe will not reverse a conviction for insufficient evidence in a non-jury trial unless, upon reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, no reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Schaltenbrand, </em>930 F.2d 1554, 1560 (11th Cir.1991). Additionally, \u201c[t]he evidence may be sufficient even if it does not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">To establish a violation of \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), \u201cthe government must prove that the defendant: (1) knowingly transferred, possessed, or used; (2) the means of identification of another person; (3)without lawful authority; (4) during and in relation to a felony enumerated in \u00a7 1028A(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 606-07 (11th Cir.2007) (footnote omitted), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Flores-Figueroa, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886. Moreover, in <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) requires the Government to show that the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.\u201d 556 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">In <em>Holmes, </em>we gave some guidance as to proof of the knowledge element. In that case, evidence at trial showed, among other things, that the defendant used the victim\u2019s identification information to obtain a line of credit to purchase a car. 595 F.3d at 1256-57. Reviewing Holmes\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge as to the knowledge element, we held, that \u201ca reasonable jury could have found that [the defendant] would not have sought credit using [the victim\u2019s] personal information if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>[the defendant] were not confident that [the victim] likely had an actual credit history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Additionally, in <em>United States v. Gomez-Castro, </em>we clarified that <em>Holmes </em>\u201cestablishes that the government can rely on circumstantial evidence about an offender\u2019s misuse of a victim\u2019s identity to prove the offender knew the identity belonged to a real person.\u201d 605 F.3d 1245, 1249 (11th Cir.2010). Further, we noted that <em>Flores-Figueroa\u2019s </em>discussion of the ease of proving the knowledge element based on evidence of how the defendant obtained the victim\u2019s identification information \u201cdoes not foreclose the possibility of proving knowledge in a more difficult case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Here, we conclude from the record that sufficient evidence supported the district court\u2019s finding concerning the knowledge element. Notably, the stipulated facts established that Ehrlich successfully used his victim\u2019s identification to obtain fairly large amounts of credit on various occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Ehrlich\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"App\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
