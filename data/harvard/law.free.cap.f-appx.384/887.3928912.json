The district court construed Schanck\u2019s petition as a motion to vacate, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and denied the motion as successive. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-21\">Schanck was convicted of four drug crimes and was sentenced to imprisonment for life. This Court affirmed his convictions. <em>United States v. Schanck, </em>120 F.3d 273 (11th Cir.1997). Schanck later moved to vacate his sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. Schanck requested a certificate of appealability, which both the district court and this Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-22\">Schanck petitioned for a writ of audita querela. Schanck argued that his sentence of life imprisonment was unconstitutional under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-23\">The district court did not err by dismissing Schanck\u2019s petition. Because Schanck \u201cis collaterally attacking his sentence as violating the United States Constitution, the proper avenue of relief is [section] 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005). Schanck previously filed a motion to vacate and failed to obtain permission from this Court to file a successive motion. 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). \u201cWithout authorization, the district court lack[ed] jurisdiction to consider [Schanck\u2019s] second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The dismissal of Schanck\u2019s petition for a writ of audita querela is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
