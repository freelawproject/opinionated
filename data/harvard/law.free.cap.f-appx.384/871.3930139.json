On appeal, McCaslin argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants by (1) adopting defendants\u2019 factual allegations and failing to acknowledge potential genuine issues of material fact; (2) finding that she could not satisfy a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, and alternatively, could not show that the defendants\u2019 legitimate non-discriminatory reason was pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>textual; and (3) finding that she could not satisfy a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 836-37 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">I. Genuine Issues of Material Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2). \u201cThe movant bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion by identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of genuine issues of material fact.\u201d <em>Baldwin County v. Purcell Corp., </em>971 F.2d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir.1992) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Once the movant satisfies this responsibility, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to rebut the movant\u2019s showing with sufficient evidence. <em>Id. </em>The nonmoving party must provide more than a \u201cmere scintilla of evidence\u201d to survive such a motion and there must be \u201csufficient disagreement\u201d in evidence to support a jury question. <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotations omitted). Likewise, \u201cthe mere existence of <em>some </em>alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <em>genuine </em>issue of <em>material </em>fact.\u201d <em>Baldwin County, </em>971 F.2d at 1563 (quotation omitted). Finally, the \u201cnon-moving party\u2019s failure to prove an essential element of a claim renders all factual disputes as to that claim immaterial and requires the granting of summary judgment. ...\u201d <em>Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm\u2019t, </em>193 F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Here, McCaslin generally asserts that the district eourt erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants because the court adopted facts contrary to her evidentiary submissions and failed to resolve genuine issues of material fact. While the district court did appear to have adopted, without elaboration, the defendants\u2019 version of the facts over McCaslin\u2019s, the district court\u2019s reliance on the defendants\u2019 factual submissions was not erroneous. Most of McCaslin\u2019s allegations that she offered to prove the essential elements of her claims were unsupported by the record and thus, any factual inconsistencies were immaterial. <em>See Herzog, </em>193 F.3d at 1247. Specifically, McCaslin failed to rebut defendants\u2019 showing that the BMA was a city department of Birmingham because, contrary to her allegations, McCaslin\u2019s own evidentiary submissions supported this finding. Furthermore, as discussed in context below, McCaslin failed to sufficiently rebut defendants\u2019 showing that she neither applied for the position of Assistant Curator of Education, nor that she was a qualified candidate. While McCaslin did sufficiently rebut defendants\u2019 allegation that she had only limited volunteering experience with the BMA, even when construing this fact in McCaslin\u2019s favor, this nevertheless did not create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Herzog, </em>193 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">II. Title VII Racial Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cfail or refuse to hire ... any individual\u201d based on, among other things, \u201csuch individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). In evaluating a Title VII disparate treatment claim supported by circumstantial evidence, as here, we use the Supreme Court\u2019s burden-shifting framework as described in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004). Under this framework, the plaintiff in a race discrimination failure-to-hire case has the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, which she can do by showing that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she applied and was qualified for a position that the defendant was seeking to fill; (3) despite her qualifications, she was rejected; and (4) the position was filled with an individual outside of her protected class. <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </em>408 F.3d 763, 768 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">If, however, an employer fails to announce a position formally and instead uses informal and subjective procedures to identify a candidate, then a plaintiff need not show that she applied for the position. <em>Id. </em>at 768. Rather, she only has to prove that the employer had \u201csome reason\u201d to consider her for the position. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">If a <em>prima facie </em>case is established, the employer has the burden to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the employment decision. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. Once an employer articulates a legitimate non-discriminatory reason, the plaintiff, in order to survive a motion for summary judgment, must show that the proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination. <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Here, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor on her race discrimination claim because McCaslin failed to satisfy the second prong a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination. McCaslin failed to apply for the position of Assistant Curator of Education. Specifically, McCaslin \u201capplied\u201d for the position of \u201cSlide Organizer\u201d in a 1999 letter to Andrews. The position at issue here, Assistant Curator of Education, was not created until seven years <em>after </em>McCaslin expressed interest. As the district court properly concluded, it is unreasonable to infer that McCaslin\u2019s 1999 letter to the BMA was an application for a position filled almost seven years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">McCaslin contends that the BMA hired the Assistant Curator of Education candidate without advertisement or competition, and therefore, in order to establish a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case, she need not prove that she applied, only that the BMA had some reason to consider her for the position. <em>See Vessels, </em>408 F.3d at 768. Indeed, the record indicates that the BMA created the position solely for the candidate upon her completion of a master\u2019s degree. However, even if we were to construe this hiring procedure as informal and subjective, McCaslin still fails to satisfy the modified second prong of a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination because she is nevertheless unqualified to be a candidate for the position. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The record reflects that all of the curators employed by the BMA have earned a master\u2019s degree, at minimum. Alternatively, while McCaslin attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham (\u201cUAB\u201d) and studied Art History, she never received an undergraduate degree from UAB or any other university. McCaslin counters by asserting that a degree was not required to be a curator for the BMA because the BMA recently gave a high school student group the title of \u201cBMA Curators.\u201d However, bestowing an honorary title of \u201cCurator\u201d on an unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>group of student volunteers is considerably different than actually hiring them to be curators in charge of initiating and administering the BMA\u2019s public programs. Accordingly, McCaslin does not possess the requisite qualifications that would give the BMA some reason to consider her for the position of Assistant Curator of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Furthermore, we need not make a determination of whether the defendants\u2019 had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for hiring another individual for the position because McCaslin failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on McCaslin\u2019s racial discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">III. Title VII Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The anti-retaliation provision of Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee for opposing an unlawful employment practice or making a charge of discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). The term \u201cemployees,\u201d as used in the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII, includes former employees. <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 346, 117 S.Ct. 843, 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, a plaintiff must prove that (1) she engaged in protected activity under Title VII; (2) she suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the two events. <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2410-16, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Here, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor as to McCaslin\u2019s retaliation claim. The district court noted that McCaslin had failed to make \u201callegations of protected conduct under Title VII, other than her EEOC charge.\u201d DC Opinion at 11. Notwithstanding this clear warning from the district court, McCaslin\u2019s brief on appeal fails to point to any protected conduct at all. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that McCaslin has not abandoned her retaliation claim, and assuming that her 2007 EEOC charge is the protected conduct upon which she relies, her brief fails to point to any adverse employment actions occurring thereafter which could remotely make out a viable retaliation claim. To establish an adverse employment action, \u201can employee must show a <em>serious and material </em>change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment .... as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001). Indeed, it is undisputed that McCaslin has not been an employee of BMA since the 2007 EEOC filing. Moreover, McCaslin has failed to show any tangible adverse effect on her prospective employment with other employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Therefore, we hold that the district court did not err in finding that McCaslin failed to satisfy a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation and awarding summary judgment to the defendants on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-12\">. In granting summary judgment in favor of Andrews, the district court found that Andrews was not a proper defendant. We need not separately address the summary dismissal of Andrews because even when liberally construing McCaslin\u2019s brief, <em>see Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998), McCaslin still fails to raise a specific argument challenging Andrew's dismissal on appeal and, accordingly, has abandoned this issue. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998). Nevertheless, even if Andrew's dismissal was improper, any error in that regard would have been harmless because, as discussed below, McCaslin cannot ultimately show that she faced racial discrimination or retaliation by any defendant. <em>See </em>Fed.RXiv.P. 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\">.
