The Insurers assert that there exist no genuine issues of material fact regarding construction of the unambiguous terms of the primary and secondary insurance policies issued to the Insureds or regarding construction of the equally unambiguous allegations ill the underlying lawsuit, as required by the so-called \u201cEight Corners Rule\u201d under Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-19\">After reviewing the entire record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and the patient and exhaustive application of the law to the issues presented by this case as set forth in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order of October 6, 2009, we are convinced beyond cavil that the court\u2019s grant of summaiy judgment in favor of the Insurers, declaring that they owe neither defense nor indemnity to the Insureds, was providently granted. For essentially the reasons extensively set forth by the district court in its said opinion, its final Judgment of December 1, 2009 is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cut. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
