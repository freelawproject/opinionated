Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In November 2008, Garcia filed a complaint in the District Court against, among others, several officials from New Jersey State Prison, raising claims concerning his medical care and his right of access to the New Jersey state courts. In April 2009, the District Court, acting sua sponte, entered an order that, inter alia, severed the access-to-courts claims from the case, directed the clerk to open a new action for those claims, and dismissed them without prejudice. In doing so, the court concluded that the complaint neither gave fair notice of the grounds on which the access-to-courts claims rested, nor alleged facts demonstrating that Garcia suffered an actual injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Garcia subsequently filed an amended complaint with respect to his access-to-courts claims. On November 2, 2009, the District Court, again acting sua sponte, dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice, holding that Garcia had failed to sufficiently plead the requisite injury. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">A prisoner raising an access-to-courts claim must show that the denial of access caused him to suffer an actual injury. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). An actual injury occurs when the prisoner is prevented from or has lost the opportunity to pursue a \u201cnonfrivolous\u201d and \u201carguable\u201d claim. <em>See Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002). The prisoner must describe any such lost claims in his complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">In this case, Garcia\u2019s amended complaint failed to plead facts demonstrating that Appellees\u2019 alleged conduct caused him to suffer an actual injury. First, although he alleged that Appellees refused to copy certain documents he sought to file in two state cases in which he was challenging prison conditions, the amended complaint did not describe the underlying claims in those cases or otherwise plead facts indicating that those eases had any merit. Second, his allegations that Appellees confiscated, refused to copy, and/or were delinquent in mailing certain documents relating to his first petition for state post-conviction relief do not state a viable access-to-courts claim, for he was represented by counsel in that proceeding, and his amended complaint did not allege that Ap-pellees prevented him from communicating with counsel or otherwise interfered with counsel\u2019s efforts in that case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>although Garcia alleged that Appellees have refused to copy his second post-conviction petition \u2014 a petition that, even in the absence of any alleged denial of court access, might be untimely under New Jersey law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 the claims he apparently seeks to raise in that petition lack merit and/or have already been rejected by the New Jersey Superior Court\u2019s Appellate Division on appeal from the denial of his first post-conviction petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">In light of the above, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Garcia\u2019s amended complaint. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of Garcia\u2019s amended complaint. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-16\">. Although Garcia contends that his counsel in the post-conviction proceeding provided ineffective assistance, the New Jersey Superi- or Court's Appellate Division rejected that argument on appeal. <em>See State v. Garcia, </em>2009 WL 3808269, at *5-6, 2009 N.J.Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2782, at *14-15 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div. Nov. 6, 2009) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-15\">. Pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 3:22-12, a prisoner seeking post-conviction relief generally must file a petition within five years of the judgment in question. Garcia concedes that he did not attempt to file his second post-conviction petition until after this five-year period, but he argues that his case falls within the rule\u2019s exception, which allows an otherwise untimely petition to proceed if the delay was due to the prisoner's \"excusable neglect.\u201d We express no opinion on the merits of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
