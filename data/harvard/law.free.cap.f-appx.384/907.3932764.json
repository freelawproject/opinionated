After review, we vacate and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">In 1999, Wattleton was indicted on four counts of making bomb threats, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e). A jury found Wat-, tleton not guilty by reason of insanity. The district court held a hearing regarding Wattleton\u2019s potential danger to society and ordered Wattleton committed to a mental health facility, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4243. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed both the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s dangerousness determination. <em>See United States v. Wattleton, </em>296 F.3d 1184 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">In 2002, Wattleton filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on direct appeal. The district court denied Wattleton\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and this Court affirmed. <em>Wattle ton v. United States, </em>No. 03-10422, 87 Fed.Appx. 712 (11th Cir. Oct. 27, 2003). Wattleton\u2019s subsequent 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 motion was dismissed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and this Court affirmed. <em>See Wattleton v. Beeler, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 852 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"AlIY\">In 2009, Wattleton filed the instant motion for relief from the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4). Rule 60(b)(4) provides that a court \u201cmay relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding [if] ... the judgment is void.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). Wattleton\u2019s motion argued that the district court\u2019s 2002 order denying his first \u00a7 2255 motion is void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because Wattleton\u2019s civil commitment order cannot be attacked in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. The district court denied Wattleton\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion because Wattleton did not bring the motion within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d as required by Rule 60(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">This Court granted a certificate of ap-pealability on the issue of: \u201cWhether the district court erred when it denied [Wat-tleton\u2019s] motion, filed pursuant to Fed. R. [Civ.] P. 60(b)(4), because it was not filed within a reasonable time, in light of <em>Hertz Corp. v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., </em>16 F.3d 1126, 1130-31 (11th Cir.1994)?\u201d In <em>HeHz, </em>we concluded that a Rule 60(b)(4) motion raising a jurisdictional defect in the judgment is not subject to Rule 60\u2019s reasonable time limitation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>On appeal, the government concedes, and we agree, that the district court erred when it denied Wattletoris Rule 60(b)(4) motion as untimely filed. Wattleton\u2019s motion argued that the judgment on his \u00a7 2255 motion is void due to a jurisdictional defect. Under <em>Hertz, </em>such a motion may be made at any time. Accordingly, we vacate and remand the case to the district court for further consideration of Wattletoris Rule 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Z\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-12\">.
