Lacour, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claims of sex-based employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when she was fired as principal of the Port Gibson High School during the term of her one-year contract and her state-law claim of tortious interference with business or contractual relations. Dr. Lacour also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion and supplemental motion to amend her complaint to add a claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-23\">We have now reviewed the entire record on appeal and have carefully considered the facts and law as presented therein as well as in the briefs of the parties and our independent research. As a result, we are convinced that the district court\u2019s Opinion and Order signed December 28, 2009 granting the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 combined motion for summary judgment was providently granted and that the court\u2019s Opinion and Order signed January 28, 2010 denying Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s motion and supplemental motion to amend her complaint were proper as well. Accordingly, for the reasons patiently set forth in detail by the district court in its said opinions and orders, the judgments of the district court are, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
