If allowed to proceed with his appeal, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a downward departure or variance. The Government counters that Despeaux\u2019s challenge to his sentence is barred by the waiver provision contained in his plea agreement providing, inter alia, that Despeaux waives his right to directly appeal his sentence unless it exceeds the statutory maximum. We pre-termit discussion of the waiver issue, which does not affect our jurisdiction, because Despeaux is not entitled to relief on the merits. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">We are without jurisdiction to consider Despeaux\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure as there is no indication in the record that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>was under the mistaken impression that it could not depart. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). Nevertheless, we have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">A sentence imposed within a properly-calculated guidelines range is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the properly-calculated guidelines range after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Des-peaux has failed to show that the sentence is unreasonable. The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
