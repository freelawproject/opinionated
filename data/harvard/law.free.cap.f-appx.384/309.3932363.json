He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the illegal reentry Guidelines double count a defendant\u2019s criminal record, resulting in a sentencing range that is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also argues that this court should not afford his sentence a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. He contends that the district court failed to take into account that he reentered this country to work and that he was remorseful for his crime. He additionally contends that his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the \u00a7 3553(a) goals of providing adequate deterrence, protecting the public, and providing him with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Barron-Lopez concedes that his challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). We have also rejected the argument that using a prior conviction to increase the offense level and in calculating criminal history is impermissible double counting. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">Barron-Lopez has not rebutted the presumption that the district court sentenced him to a reasonable, properly calculated within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
