He contends that the district court plainly erred by not reducing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1) because the evidence at trial and the facts in the presentence report were insufficient to support a finding that the offenses were committed for profit. Because Perez-Torres did not object to the lack of a \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1) reduction in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Santilano, </em>434 F.3d 794, 795 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">The Government was not required to show, either at trial or at sentencing, that the alien transportation offenses were committed for profit. <em>See United States v. Cuellar-Flores, </em>891 F.2d 92, 93 (5th Cir.1989). Rather, in order to qualify for the \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1) reduction, Perez-Torres bore the burden of showing that the offenses were committed other than for profit. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">The record shows that the aliens made arrangements with unknown individuals to be smuggled into the United States and taken to Houston, Texas, in exchange for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>$1,200 or $1,300. After crossing into the United States, a guide led the aliens to a Valero gas station in Alice, Texas. The aliens were told to wait at the station and that someone would pick them up. Approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, Perez-Torres arrived at the Valero station and told the aliens to get into his vehicle. The aliens expected to pay the smuggling fee following their arrival in Houston. Nothing about these facts or any other evidence presented at trial supports an inference that Pereza-Torres transported the aliens for any reason other than profit. Further, although there was no direct evidence that Perez-Torres was paid or was going to be paid for transporting the aliens to Houston, there was circumstantial evidence that he knowingly participated in an alien smuggling operation in which other members either received or expected to receive money. Thus, a finding that the alien transportation offenses were committed for profit is plausible in light of the record read as a whole and not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, whether Perez-Torres transported the aliens for profit is a factual question that could have been resolved by the district court had Perez-Torres raised the proper objection. <em>See Cuellar-Flores, </em>891 F.2d at 93. Because Perez-Torres failed to object to the presentence report on this basis, he has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred by not reducing his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
