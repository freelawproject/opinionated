Kaveri does not challenge the determinations that he is removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) as an alien who was admitted as a nonimmigrant but remained longer than permitted, or that he is ineligible for a waiver of remova-bility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Our review of the denial of Kaveri\u2019s Section 1255(a) application is limited to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, (a)(2)(D). The Attorney General has the discretion to adjust the status of an alien who was inspected and admitted into the United States to that of a lawful permanent resident \u201cif (1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.\u201d \u00a7 1255(a) (INA \u00a7 245(a)); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(a). In relevant part, the IJ determined that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c), Kaveri was not eligible to receive an immigrant visa because the evidence supported a determination by immigration authorities that Kaveri had entered into his first marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. Kaveri\u2019s arguments that the IJ\u2019s finding failed to properly apply BIA precedent or to properly allocate the burden of proof are unavailing Kaveri does not argue that his second wife\u2019s immediate relative visa petition has been approved or that such a visa would be immediately available if he applied for adjustment. We find no legal error in the determination that Ka-veri was ineligible for adjustment of status. Kaveri\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
