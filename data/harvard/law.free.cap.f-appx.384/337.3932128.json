When his leave expired, Mr. Sterling did not furnish his employer with certification that he was able to resume work. Mr. Sterling\u2019s failure to provide the City with certification of his fitness for duty bars his action claiming entitlement to reinstatement under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614(a). The district court correctly rendered judgment to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Mr. Sterling admitted in his deposition that he received notice advising him of his rights and obligations under COBRA. He deliberately elected not to continue COBRA coverage. No reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Sterling received no communication from the City. The district court correctly rendered judgment that Mr. Sterling\u2019s claim regarding COBRA is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Judgment AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
