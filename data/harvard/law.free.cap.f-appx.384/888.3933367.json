The Board of Immigration Appeals and the immigration judge found Christophe not credible. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Christophe argues that she is eligible for asylum relief, but we disagree. The immigration judge found that Christophe failed to file timely her application for asylum, and we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005). We dismiss Christophe\u2019s petition for review of the denial of her application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Christophe challenges the denial of her application for withholding of removal, but substantial evidence supports the finding that Christophe was not credible. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). There were several inconsistencies between Christophe\u2019s supplemental written statement and her testimony. Christophe alleged in her written statement that, in January 2004, supporters of Lavalas threatened her, but Christophe later testified that the men beat her. Christophe alleged in her written statement that military officers had beaten her mother on October 30, 2004, and had arrested Christophe on May 2, 2005, but Christophe later testified that her mother had been beaten on November 2, 2004, and Christophe had been arrested on May 5, 2005. Christophe also provided an incredible account about how in May and June of 2005 her six-month-old fetus survived two months of beatings \u201cmorning, midday, and night.\u201d Christophe first testified that in 2005 her captors \u201cdidn\u2019t spare any part of [her] body,\u201d but when asked to explain how the baby survived, Christophe testified that her captors inflicted fewer blows on her \u201clower stomach.\u201d Christophe offers no explanation for these and other inconsistencies that would compel a reasonable fact finder to reverse the adverse credibility finding and conclude that she established eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Christophe contends that the immigration judge and the Board failed to consider her corroborative evidence, but we disagree. The immigration judge stated that he had considered the Country Report submitted by the government and a medical certificate and an identification card submitted by Christophe, and the Board affirmed the decision of the immigration judge, in part, on \u201cthe lack of sufficient reliable evidence corroborative of [Chris-tophe\u2019s] claim.\u201d Moreover, none of the corroborative evidence establishes that Christophe is eligible for withholding of removal. The membership card established only that Christophe was a member of the Association Des Democrates De Delmas, and Christophe\u2019s medical report, which stated that she had suffered \u201c[corporal [t]rauma due to a Kidnapping incident,\u201d was inconsistent with Christophe\u2019s statement that she had been \u201carrested\u201d by military officers for her political activities. The Country Report stated that prisons were unsanitary and its occupants suffered from \u201cmalnutrition, poor quality healthcare ... [inadequate food ... and periodically suffered from lack of water,\u201d which was entirely consistent with the finding of the immigration judge that it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that Christophe could have been incarcerated and beaten daily for two months and thereafter deliver a healthy baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">We DISMISS Christophe\u2019s petition for review of the denial of asylum and DENY her petition for review of the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
