After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-30\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)-(2). Rumph\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706, which amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by lowering the base offense levels applicable to most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713. However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Here, Amendment 706 did not lower Rumph\u2019s applicable guidelines range. At his original sentencing, Rumph\u2019s advisory guidelines range initially was calculated as 97 to 121 months pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) based on drug quantity. However, Rumph was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum twenty-year term of imprisonment due to his prior felony drug conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). As such, Rumph\u2019s applicable guidelines range became 240 months, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), and the district court imposed the mandatory 240-month sentence. Accordingly, although Amendment 706 lowered the base offense level for Rumph\u2019s crack cocaine offense, it did not affect Rumph\u2019s applicable guidelines range of 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Rumph argues that the district court had authority to grant his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Rumph\u2019s original 240-month sentence subsequently was reduced to 180 months pursuant to the government\u2019s motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) based on Rumph\u2019s substantial assistance. We have rejected this argument in the context of an analogous substantial assistance motion made pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Williams, </em>this Court concluded that a district court\u2019s granting of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion does not \u201ceffectively waive[ ] the statutory mandatory minimum and thus entitle[] [the defendant] to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339. Likewise, the subsequent granting of a Rule 35(b) substantial assistance motion does not waive the statutory mandatory minimum as to the original sentence and does not make a defendant entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. The district court correctly concluded that Rumph is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"AMko\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-20\">.
