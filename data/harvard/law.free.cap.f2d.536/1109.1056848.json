Citizens Cas. Co., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409. Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1194-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">This appeal from the denial of appellant\u2019s habeas petition presents a question of compliance with the requirement of <em>Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974), that before sentencing a young offender as an adult the sentencing judge must make an explicit finding that there would be no benefit to sentencing under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 et seq. <em>Dorszynski </em>was applied retroactively in this circuit in <em>Hoyt v. United States, </em>502 F.2d 562 (5th Cir. 1974), and so governs the sentencing of this appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-12\">Appellant\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence, Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, was denied in November 1974. He then brought a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, asserting once again that because <em>Dorszynski </em>was not complied with by the sentencing judge his sentence must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-13\">In the circumstances of this case, we determine to follow the course suggested by the dissent in <em>Sappington v. U. S., </em>518 F.2d 28 (8th Cir. 1975), which concluded that a finding of no benefit at the time of denial of the habeas petition was sufficient compliance with <em>Dorszynski. </em>Once the sentencing judge has \u201creconsidered\u201d the alternative sentencing in connection with a \u00a7 2255 petition and has rejected the possibility of benefits under the F.Y.C.A., it is a futile gesture on appeal from denial of the motion to vacate the sentence and return to the same judge to make the same determination. <em>Dorszynski </em>does not stipulate <em>when </em>the explicit finding of no benefit must be made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-15\">\u201cOnce it is made clear that the sentencing judge has considered the option of treatment under the Act and rejected it, however, no appellate review is warranted.\u201d 418 U.S. at 443, 94 S.Ct. at 3053.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-16\">Here when the sentencing judge, also the judge reviewing the \u00a7 2255 petition, has clearly considered the option of F.Y.C.A. sentencing \u2014 indeed has done so not once but twice \u2014 we deem an affirmance to be within the spirit of <em>Dorszynski </em>and a remand an empty formality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
