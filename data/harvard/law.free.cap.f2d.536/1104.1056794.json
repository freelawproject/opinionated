State, </em>400 S.W.2d 559 (Tex.Crim.App.1965). Sellars contends that he was denied due process and equal protection of law when the Governor commuted his sentence to 99 years imprisonment, after his death sentence had been vacated by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Sellars v. Beto, </em>408 U.S. 937, 92 S.Ct. 2865, 33 L.Ed.2d 756 (1972). Petitioner contends that the Governor\u2019s commutation denied him his absolute right under Texas law to be resentenced by a jury, thus violating his constitutional rights to Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-21\">Recently the Supreme Court considered a similar situation where an unconstitutional death sentence vacated and remanded by a state court was commuted to 99 years imprisonment by the Governor of Tennessee. The Supreme Court, in reversing the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>Circuit\u2019s grant of habeas corpus relief, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-5\">Whether or not the sentences imposed upon respondents were subject to commutation by the Governor, and the extent of his authority under the circumstances of this case, are questions of Tennessee law which were resolved in favor of sustaining the action of the governor by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals. It was not the province of a federal habeas court to re-examine these questions, [citation omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\"><em>Rose v. Hodges, </em>423 U.S. 19, 21-22, 96 S.Ct. 175, 177, 46 L.Ed.2d 162, 44 U.S.L.W. 3277 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">The petitioner contends that <em>Rose </em>reversed the Sixth Circuit only because it had attempted to rule that under state law the Governor did not have the power or authority to commute an unconstitutional death sentence. <em>See Murdock v. City of Memphis, </em>87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 590, 22 L.Ed. 429 (1875). He argues that the Supreme Court neither considered nor decided whether, although legal under state law, the Governor\u2019s commutation violated constitutional rights of due process and equal protection because the action arbitrarily deprived the defendant of a state law right to be sentenced by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">Concededly the Sixth Circuit had held only that there were no viable death sentences to commute and therefore the commutation was invalid, the death sentences having been vacated at the time of the Governor\u2019s commutation order. This being a matter for state law determination alone, the federal court was foreclosed from granting habeas corpus relief, which must be based on a determination that the custody violates the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, however, the Supreme Court in <em>Rose </em>did address the constitutional arguments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-10\">Respondents urge, in support of the result reached by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, that their Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments right to jury trial have been infringed by the Tennessee proceedings. We reject these contentions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A09\"><em>Rose v. Hodges, supra, </em>423 U.S. at 22, 96 S.Ct. at 177. Again, in a footnote, the Supreme Court noted that two other panels of the Sixth Circuit had <em>correctly </em>recognized, in cases virtually identical to <em>Rose, </em>that no federal constitutional question was presented by such commutation. 423 U.S. at 21, n.3, 96 S.Ct. 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that \u201cthe purely gratuitous remarks in the <em>Rose </em>opinion that the Constitution \u2018affords no impediment\u2019 to \u2018commutation\u2019 and that \u2018no federal question was presented\u2019 by such actions are obvious <em>dicta </em>\u201d and not controlling in this case fails to recognize the Supreme Court\u2019s rule that \u201c \u2018if the decision below is correct, it must be affirmed, although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 459, 73 S.Ct. 397, 408, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1952), citing <em>Helvering v. Gowran, </em>302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937); <em>see Riley Co. v. Commissioner, </em>311 U.S. 55, 59, 61 S.Ct. 95, 85 L.Ed. 36 (1940). Had a constitutional ground for relief been present, even though the state law ground was invalid, the Supreme Court surely would have sustained the Sixth Circuit\u2019s issuance of the habeas corpus writ. In this view, <em>Rose </em>is controlling authority on the constitutional issues there asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">Sellars forthrightly concedes that the commutation here was sanctioned by Texas law and has been authoritatively upheld by the Texas courts. Tex.Const. Art. 4, \u00a7 11; Vernon\u2019s Tex.Code of Crim.P. Art. 48.01; <em>Stanley v. State, </em>490 S.W.2d 828 (Tex.Crim. App.1972); <em>Whan v. State, </em>485 S.W.2d 275, (Tex.Crim.App.1972); <em>see Antwine </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>486 F.2d 189 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,. </em>414 U.S. 1115, 94 S.Ct. 847, 38 L.Ed.2d 742 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-14\">In a recent ease concerning a similar exercise of the commutation power by the Texas Governor, this Court ruled in the face of a Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional argument that \u201csince the commutation did not raise a claim of constitutional proportion,\u201d it was not a proper sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>ject for federal habeas corpus relief. <em>Curry v. </em>Estelle, 524 F.2d 981, 982 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">In truth, Texas having sanctioned this means of sentencing, petitioner\u2019s premise that sentencing by jury in Texas is an absolute right must fail. Without that premise which is basic to his Fourteenth Amendment argument, petitioner\u2019s claim does not rise to the federal-law level required for habeas corpus relief in a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
