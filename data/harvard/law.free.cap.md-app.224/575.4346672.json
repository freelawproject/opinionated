(\u201cColumbia\u201d), is a natural gas utility that serves customers in Western Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>land. In 2013, it purchased a parcel of land known as the Cassidy Property in Hagerstown, Maryland. Appellees are the Maryland Public Service Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) and the Office of the People\u2019s Counsel (\u201cOPC\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As part of its last request that the Commission increase Columbia\u2019s rates and charges, Columbia sought to recover anticipated remediation costs regarding two of its properties, including the Cassi-dy Property. Following three days of evidentiary hearings, the Chief Public Utility Law Judge (\u201cthe CPULJ\u201d) of the Commission denied appellant\u2019s request because it failed to provide evidence that the existing customers should bear the cost of the Cassidy Property clean up when they received no benefit. Thereafter, appellant appealed to the Commission, which affirmed the CPULJ\u2019s decision and determined that the Cassidy Property was not \u201cused and useful\u201d in providing service to current customers. Appellant sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Washington County, alleging that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously, violated Maryland\u2019s Public Utilities Article, and that its decision constituted an unlawful taking, without just compensation, in violation of both the Maryland and United States Constitutions. The circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision, prompting appellant\u2019s appeal, and the following questions for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">[I.] Was the Commission\u2019s denial of Columbia\u2019s request for recovery of costs to acquire and remediate property in Hagerstown arbitrary and capricious?</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">[II.] Did the Commission\u2019s denial of Columbia\u2019s request for recovery of costs to acquire and remediate property in Hagerstown constitute an error of law in that it violated the Maryland Public Utilities Article?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>[III.] Did the Commission\u2019s denial of Columbia\u2019s request for recovery of costs to acquire and remediate property in Hagerstown constitute an unlawful taking without just compensation, in violation of the Maryland and United States Constitutions?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Appellant is a public service company, which provides its customers natural gas through a pipeline distribution network in Western Maryland. It is subject to an enforcement action by the Maryland Department of Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d) to clean up the site it owns at the former Hagerstown Manufactured Gas Plant (\u201cMGP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Before natural gas became commercially available, Columbia\u2019s predecessors used the Hagerstown MGP site to manufacture gas from 1887 to 1952. On an adjacent property, known as the Cassidy Property, the former Hagerstown MGP operated a coal tar pond before it was sold in the early 1920s. The Cassidy Property was part of a larger parcel owned by the Hagerstown American Light and Heat Company, which began coal gas manufacturing operations on the larger parcel in 1891. The larger parcel consisted of 7.1 acres. The Cassidy Property consisted of a 4.5 acre parcel and was sold to the Cassidy Trucking Company in the 1920s.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Hagerstown American Light and Heat Company continued to operate its manufactured gas on the remaining 2.6 acre parcel until 1949, when it ceased operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In 1968, appellant purchased the 2.6 acre parcel and began its operations as a service center, where appellant\u2019s employees run the Company\u2019s main hub of gas distribution operations and maintenance activity to serve natural gas to customers. In 2013, appellant purchased the remaining 4.5 acres known as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the Cassidy Property. Appellant testified that the current uses of the Hagerstown MGP site included: \u201c(1) use for all service center operations, (2) use for driver training and parking, and (3) storage of the byproducts of the MGP process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">On February 27, 2013, appellant filed an application with the Commission seeking authority to increase the Company\u2019s rates and charges with a proposed effective date of March 29, 2013. Among the many elements of its rate increase request, Appellant estimated that it would take approximately five years for remediation of the Hagerstown MGP site, and that the company would incur new costs ranging from $6 million to under $21 million as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On March 4, 2013, the Commission suspended the proposed effective date of the increased rates for a period of 150 days, which was later expanded to an additional 30 days, and delegated the case to the CPULJ division for review. Eviden-tiary hearings were held at the Commission\u2019s offices in Baltimore from June 18 until June 20, 2013. During that time, written testimony and exhibits were entered into the record, and witnesses were presented and subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On August 9, 2013, the CPULJ Division issued a proposed order, which granted in part and denied in part appellant\u2019s application. Thereafter, appellant filed a notice of appeal to the Commission, challenging the proposed order because it denied appellant the right to recover from its ratepayers costs incurred from the purchase and environmental remediation of the Cassidy Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">On September 23, 2013, the Commission issued its Order No. 85858 and denied appellant\u2019s appeal regarding the Cassidy Property. Appellant filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Washington County on October 23, 2013. Thereafter, the court issued a memorandum and order affirming the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Appellant noted a timely appeal. Additional facts shall be provided, <em>infra, </em>to the extent they prove relevant in addressing the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">This case is governed by Maryland Code (1998 Repl.Vol. 2010), \u00a7 3-203 of the Public Utilities Article [hereinafter \u201cPublic Utilities\u201d], which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Every final decision, order, or regulation of the Commission is prima facie correct and shall be affirmed unless clearly shown to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">(1) unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">(2) outside the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">(3) made on unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">(4) arbitrary or capricious;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">(5) affected by other error of law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">(6) if the subject of review is an order entered in a contested proceeding after a hearing, unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">We review decisions of the Commission as \u201cconsistent with the standard of review applicable to all administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. 1, 15, 733 A.2d 996 (1999). Thus, \u201c[s]o long as a reasoning mind could have reached the same conclusion as the agency, we will not disturb the agency\u2019s decision. Because the Commission is well informed by its own expertise and specialized staff, a court reviewing a factual matter will not substitute its own judgment on review of a fairly debatable matter.\u201d <em>Communications Workers of Am. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>424 Md. 418, 433, 36 A.3d 449 (2012) (citations omitted).

The Commission has long recognized that utilities will, from time to time, incur necessary and proper expenses which are sufficiently extraordinary as to warrant special ratemaking treatment. Such expenses are extraordinary in the sense that the costs are not annually recurring, are not able to be anticipated, and are of substantial magnitude. Typically, rather than include the entirety of such costs in the formulation of test year expenses, the Commission has determined it to be fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>equitable to amortize the extraordinary expense over a period of years. Also, because equity or debt is being utilized during the period of amortization to pay the extraordinary expense, the unamortized portion of the extraordinary expense is included in the calculation of the rate base.c [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] However, as an exception to this general rule, the Commission occasionally will determine that the unamortized portion should not be included in the calculation of the rate base. Such a determination is based upon a finding that the circumstances of the extraordinary expense were of a type that, for reasons of equity, the expense should be shared between the ratepayers and the stockholders. By excluding the unamortized portion of the extraordinary expense from rate base, the Commission shifts from ratepayers to stockholders the carrying charge associated with the unamortize[d] balance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">First, appellant contends that the Commission\u2019s denial of its environmental remediation costs, which includes purchase of the property and cleanup for the Cassidy Property, was arbitrary and capricious. Appellant asserts that Commission orders dating back to 1989 have allowed regulated gas companies in Maryland to recover these costs from customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Appellant refers to six tests, including an exception, which must be applied to a gas company seeking to recover environmental remediation costs from its customers. The six tests appellant outlines are, \u201c[rjemediation [cjosts must be [qjuanti-f\u00edable,\u201d \u201c[rjemediation [cjosts [mjust [njot [bje [ijncurred [biased on [ijmprudence or [mjismanagement,\u201d \u201c[tjhe [ejnvi-ronmental [rjemediation [mjust [bje [ljegally [mjandated,\u201d \u201c[tjhe [ejnvironmental [hjazard [mjust [rjeside on [pjroperty [ujsed and [ujseful to [appellant\u2019s] [cjustomers,\u201d \u201c[mjust [cjur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>rently [b]e a [g]as [c]ompany [s]erving [g]as [customers,\u201d and the exception to the \u201c[u]sed and [ujseful\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In rejecting Appellant\u2019s request, the Commission discussed the same 1989 order and indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">In considering whether the purchase and remediation costs of either or both of the parcels in this case should be included in rate base, the Commission\u2019s holding in <em>In the Matter of the Application of Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (Citizens Gas and Cambridge Gas Divisions) for an Increase in Rates for Natural Gas Service and to Consolidate the Natural Gas Tariffs, </em>Case No. 8157, is instructive. After noting that the record contained no persuasive evidence that the incurrence of the clean-up costs was due to imprudence or mismanagement by the utility, the Commission deemed the environmental remediation costs as operating expenses incurred in the current course of doing business.[ ] In so doing, however, the Commission stated, \u201c[flor ratemaking purposes, the important fact about this site is that it is the location of a currently operating gas distribution facility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In that case, the Commission permitted Chesapeake Utilities to recover the cost of remediation of a property in rate base. It indicated, \u201c[f]or ratemaking purposes, the important fact about this site is that it is the location of a currently operating gas distribution facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2. In the case at bar, the Cassidy Property stored waste, but did not provide services to appellant\u2019s current customers. The site to be remediated must provide service to the Company\u2019s customers in order to be eligible to recover the costs in rate base.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The Commission reviews requests to recover environmental cleanup costs individually, based on the particular facts and circumstances of each case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission applies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>general ratemaking policy as stated above, and, where appropriate, allows extraordinary environmental remediation expenses to be passed on to customers in accordance with Public Utilities \u00a7 4-101(3). But nothing in that general policy entitles appellant, or any other company, to recover costs simply because they have been incurred. Instead, the company must prove that the asset is \u201cused and useful\u201d and that the remediation costs were incurred prudently.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the Commission established an exception to the \u201cused and useful\u201d test must fail. Appellant avers that the \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d standard should apply to the expense of cleaning up the Cassidy Property and the Commission improperly applied the \u201cused and useful\u201d test to the remediation cost. However, appellant fails to consider that regardless of whether the Commission first determines whether the expense is necessary and proper, the ultimate decision depends on whether there is a connection between the property and the service it provides to current customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The Commission discussed the environmental remediation costs and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">[Appellant] attempts to draw this connection by arguing on appeal that storage of environmentally damaging MGP byproducts on the Cassidy Property between the 1920\u2019s and 2013 provides a benefit to current customers. However, in testimony [appellant] admitted that such storage of byproducts did not render the Cassidy property used and useful in the class rate-making sense as it was not in the rate base and Columbia earned no recovery on it.c ] The storage of by-products on the Cassidy Property for the past 90 years does not constitute a benefit to current customers. The argument that the [appellant\u2019s] distribution system would not exist but for the site of which the Cassidy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Property was once a part, is tenuous at best, and is also rejected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">A[t] the hearing in this case, the CPULJ questioned [appellant] Witness Kempic at length about the Cassidy Property and the Company\u2019s environmental remediation of the site. The CPULJ confirmed that the [appellant] purchased the Cassidy Property to remediate it.1- ] Mr. Kempic testified that since its re-purchase the Cassidy Property is being used for a driver training course occasionally.1- ] However, when the CPULJ questioned Mr. Kempic as to how the [appellant] would use the Cassidy Property in the future once remediated, Mr. Kempic admitted that the [appellant] didn\u2019t know how the property might be used, and wouldn\u2019t know until the remediation was complete.1- ] Thus, the CPULJ properly disregarded testimony as to the use of the Cassidy Property for a driver training course; the CPULJ\u2019s finding that the Cassidy Property was purchased purely to lower the remediation cost exposure of that parcel[ ] is fully supported by the record in this case. Repurchase of the Cassidy Property for this reason does not provide the necessary connection between the remediated property and the service today\u2019s Columbia customers will receive from it. Thus the Cassidy Property is not used and useful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We agree. Appellant failed to demonstrate the nexus between the Cassidy Property and the service today\u2019s customers receive from it to be considered used and useful for ratemak-ing purposes. The record provides evidence that the Service Center Property remains used and useful to appellant\u2019s current customers. Therefore, its inclusion in rate base was proper. The CPULJ and Commission\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record and were not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Next, appellant avers that the Commission\u2019s denial of its claim for recovery costs constituted an error of law. Specifically, appellant contends that the Commission awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>environmental remediation cost recovery in other instances, in accordance with the environmental protection directives in the statute, but not in the underlying case. The specific statutes appellant refers to are Public Utilities \u00a7\u00a7 5-303 and 2-113(a)(2). Public Utilities \u00a7 5-303 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">A public service company shall furnish equipment, services, and facilities that are safe, adequate, just, reasonable, economical, and efficient, considering the conservation of natural resources and the quality of the environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The case at bar involved the issue of who would pay for the environmental remediation, the current customers or appellant\u2019s shareholders. The Commission applied its statutory environmental protection directives, however it has never said that it is an automatic cost recovery. Before the Commission can allow the costs of environmental remediation to be passed onto the ratepayers, it must look for evidence that remediation was legally mandated. <em>See </em>Public Utilities \u00a7 4-101(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The Commission allowed recovery of the portion of the remediation expense associated with the Service Center Property, because it determined that the expense was necessary, proper, used and useful in providing service to the public. However, after the Commission determines that an expense is necessary and proper, it determines whether the public service company\u2019s property is used and useful in providing service to the public. <em>See </em>Public Utilities \u00a7 4-101(3). In other cases in which the Commission awarded environmental remediation cost recovery, including cases appellant has cited to, the Commission determined that the property in those cases were used and useful in providing service to the public. Here, the Commission determined that the costs associated with remediation of both the Service Center Property and the Cassidy Property were necessary and proper expenses. However, the Commission concluded that only the Service Center Property was used and useful in providing service to the public. The Commission properly applied its factual findings regarding the Cassidy Property and it did not ignore the statutes in rendering its determination. Thus, we perceive no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Lastly, appellant contends that the Commissioris denial of its claim constituted an unlawful taking without just compensation, in violation of the Maryland and United States Constitutions. Appellant quotes <em>Bluefield Waterworks &amp; Improvement Co. v. P.S.C. of West Virginia, </em>262 U.S. 679, 43 S.Ct. 675, 67 L.Ed. 1176 (1923):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Rates which are not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time it is being used to render the service are unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory, and their enforcement deprives the public utility of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 690, 693, 43 S.Ct. 675. Additionally, appellant quotes <em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">From the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business. These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock. By that standard the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks. That return, moreover, should be sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to maintain its credit and to attract capital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 603, 43 S.Ct. 675 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Appellant avers that based on these cases, denial of recovery of remediation costs would be unconstitutional because the Cassidy Property costs would exceed its net income in upcom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ing years and materially harm the company\u2019s financial condition. Appellant presented testimony that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">If [appellant] is not permitted to recover all costs related to the cleanup of the site, accounting guidance requires that these costs be removed from the regulatory asset and recorded as an expense upon receipt of the Commission order related to this case. The total impact removing these costs from a regulatory asset and recording them to expense approximates $4.7 million dollars. As stated earlier, this is far greater than [appellant\u2019s] total annual net income (for instance, [appellant\u2019s] net income for 2012 was approximately $2.6 million dollars). The impact of deeming the costs related to the clean-up of the Hagerstown MGP site as non-recoverable would be financially devastating to the Company, even threatening the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern if these costs are not recovered[.] If a company cannot sustain itself financially, this raises the possibility that the gas distribution service provided to the customers may be jeopardized. The full costs associated with [appellant\u2019s] environmental remediation at the former MGP site should be recoverable consistent with the Commission\u2019s prior decisions in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The Chief Public Utility Law Judge considered this testimony in rendering its decision and determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">I find claims that these costs will result in a going concern issue for the [appellant] to be speculative at best. The sale of the remediated Cassidy property may help to offset the cost to the stockholders in the long run, and I find that the financial impact over the period of remediation can be weathered by [appellant] without putting the Company at too great a financial risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The Commission agreed with the Judge\u2019s determination. We do not consider this to be a violation of the Maryland or United States Constitutions. Appellant has not provided authority holding that a refusal to permit a utility company to recover remediation costs in rate base constitutes an unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>taking without just compensation. Accordingly, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY IS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\">.
