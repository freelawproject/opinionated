Clark\u2014owner of Penthouse 4A in the 100 Harborview Drive Condominium\u2014and Appellants/Cross-Appellees 100 Harbor-view Drive Condominium Council of Unit Owners (\u201cHarbor-view\u201d or \u201cthe Council\u201d) and property manager Zaleo Realty, Inc. (\u201cZaleo\u201d), this appeal features the Maryland Condominium Act and the extent to which it compels the production of Harborview\u2019s legal and financial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">On January 16, 2013, Dr. Clark filed a three-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, alleging that pursuant to the Maryland Condominium Act (\u201cMCA\u201d), Maryland Code (1974, 2010 Repl. Vol.) Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq. </em>and Article X of the By-laws of 100 Harborview Drive Condominium, he was entitled to examine and copy \u201c(a) detailed billing reports or supporting documentation for [Har-borview]\u2019s legal invoices concerning Dr. Clark, his family, and the Unit; (b) written advice of legal counsel concerning Dr. Clark, his family, and the Unit; and (c) e-mails between [Harborview] and Zaleo concerning the financial well-being of the Condominium.\u201d In Count I, Dr. Clark sought a permanent injunction directing Harborview and Zaleo to produce the documents; in Count II, he requested specific performance on his request to inspect the documents; and in Count III, he demanded damages for failure to provide the requested documents. On March 5, 2013, Harborview and Zaleo filed an answer and a counter-complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that Dr. Clark was not entitled to inspect the detailed billing reports and written advice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Following a two-day bench trial, the circuit court rendered its decisions on October 16, 2013. The court decided, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>other things, to deny Dr. Clark\u2019s request to inspect the written advice of Harborview\u2019s counsel, but entered a permanent injunction enjoining Harborview and Zaleo from denying Dr. Clark\u2019s request to inspect and copy legal invoices and billing records concerning Dr. Clark, his family, and the Unit. The Court also enjoined Harborview and Zaleo from refusing to provide Dr. Clark any future e-mails between Harborview and Zaleo concerning the financial well-being of Harborview, and required that they comply with any future request by Dr. Clark for e-mails concerning the financial well-being of Har-borview.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the circuit court regarding the scope and application of the Maryland Condominium Act, and hold that RP \u00a7 11-116 does not abrogate the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine. We also find no error on the ancillary matter of the court\u2019s exclusion of Harborview\u2019s proffered expert testimony. We are compelled, however, to vacate the court\u2019s order enjoining Harborview and Zaleo from refusing to produce future email correspondence, as it is not based on any showing of a likelihood of future irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Litigation History</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Context bears special significance in this appeal wherein the request for the inspection of financial and attorney-client privileged records is made by an adversary in a series of contentious law suits and administrative actions. In our unreported opinion in an earlier related action between these parties, <em>Clark v. Zalco Realty, Inc., </em>No. 277, Sept. Term 2012, slip op. at 2-3 (filed Apr. 24, 2013), we summarized the facts of Dr. Clark\u2019s acquisition of the property and the underlying conflict as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">In 2009, [Dr. Clark] learned that a penthouse unit (\u201cthe Unit\u201d) of the Harborview Building in downtown Baltimore was to be sold at auction, \u201cas is.\u201d Appellant made a few visits to see [the Unit], the last of which was to a cocktail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>reception on the night before the auction. It was raining heavily, and [Dr. Clark] noticed water dripping from the ceiling into two bowls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">The next morning, [Dr. Clark] met with Gisele Rivera\u2014 the building\u2019s property manager and a Zaleo employee\u2014to discuss the leak he had seen. According to [Dr. Clark\u2019s] deposition testimony, Ms. Rivera told him that the roof was scheduled to be repaired \u201cin the March time frame,\u201d and she showed him \u201cbooks that had construction plans and schedules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">[Dr. Clark] won the auction for the property, and the Council had its property management contractor, Zaleo Realty, prepare a resale certificate as required by [RP] \u00a7 ll-185(c). The document certified that the Council had no knowledge \u201cthat any alteration or improvement to the unit or to the limited common elements assigned to the unit violates any provision of the declaration, by laws, or rules or regulations,\u201d <em>see </em>[RP] \u00a7 ll-135(a)(4)(ix), and no knowledge \u201cof any violation of the health or building codes with respect to the unit,\u201d <em>see </em>[RP] \u00a7 ll-135(a)(4)(x). The certificate further stated that there were no \u201ccapital expenditures approved by [the Council] planned at the time of the conveyance which are not reflected in the current operating budget disclosed\u201d to [Dr. Clark], <em>see </em>[RP] \u00a7 ll-135(a)(4)(iv), (vi).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">In the wake of a large snowstorm in 2010, the water leak in the Unit worsened. A mold expert tested the Unit for spores and recommended that it be vacated. [Dr. Clark] began remediation efforts in the summer, but they proved unsuccessful because water continued to leak in through the building\u2019s roof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On October 20, 2010, Dr. Clark filed suit against Harbor-view and Zaleo alleging that they had engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation and unfair or deceptive trade practices, and seeking $5 million in damages. That complaint was resolved on summary judgment in favor of Harborview and Zaleo on February 23, 2012. This Court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 24, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>During the interval between his purchase of the Unit and the October 20, 2010, complaint, Dr. Clark filed a number of administrative complaints related to his Unit. Following a noise complaint from downstairs neighbors and a January 19, 2010, \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter from Harborview advising Dr. Clark to have his child play in the downstairs recreation area or invest in soundproofing, Dr. Clark filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleging familial status housing discrimination against Harbor-view. That complaint, dated January 28, 2010, was dismissed for lack of probable cause. In February, the complaint was referred to the Maryland Commission on Human Relations, which, after investigation, also made a finding of no probable cause on August 17, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Dr. Clark filed three complaints with the Baltimore City Health Department during the months of May and June 2010, alleging the presence of mold in his Unit and contamination from pigeon droppings. These complaints were ultimately dismissed following evidentiary hearings. On June 15, 2010, Dr. Clark also filed a complaint against Harborview in the Maryland Office of the Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division. The complaint, alleging that Harborview failed to properly maintain the common elements of the building, was later withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On May 8, 2013, Dr. Clark filed another complaint against Harborview in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, along with a Petition for Order of Arbitration and Stay of Action. In his complaint for specific performance, negligence, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty, Dr. Clark alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Harborview failed to retain a reasonable repair and replacement reserve fund and breached its duty to remed-iate damage caused to his Unit from water infiltration and mold contamination. Dr. Clark demanded, and the circuit court ordered, arbitration of that complaint. Harborview appealed, contending that the circuit court erred by not finding that Dr. Clark had waived his right to arbitration because he improperly split his claims (arising from the same facts) by litigating to judgment less than all of his legal theories in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>prior action before bringing the subject suit. In an unreported opinion, <em>Harborview v. Clark, </em>No. 1314, Sept. Term 2013 (filed April 8, 2015), we affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">While Dr. Clark\u2019s first appeal to this Court was pending, and prior to filing the case underlying the second appeal, the events leading to the instant appeal were developing.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The opening act was Dr. Clark\u2019s November 20, 2012, request, sent by letter through counsel, to examine and copy Harborview\u2019s books and records relating to the financial welfare of the Condominium, including \u201call of the Condominium\u2019s legal bills from October 2009 through the present!.]\u201d The letter advised that Dr. Clark had entered into a common interest agreement with James W. Ancel, Sr., the owner of Penthouse 4C at 100 Harborview Drive. Penthouse 4C, LLC, whose sole member is James W. Ancel, Sr., had filed a complaint '(similar to, though entirely separate from this appeal) on April 8, 2011, requesting the production of books and records pursuant to RP \u00a7 11-116. That complaint went to arbitration, and on January 5, 2012, the arbitration panel found, among other things, that RP \u00a7 11-116 \u201cprovides unit owners with a broad right to inspect the books and records of the Condominium!,]\u201d including \u201cany written advice of legal counsel if the requesting unit owner is the subject of that advice.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Clark\u2019s November 20, 2012, letter to Harbor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>view cited the Penthouse 4C, LLC arbitration award as binding precedent, and further instructed that \u201cthe Council may not redact the Condominium\u2019s legal bills unless one of the limited circumstances set forth in \u00a7 11\u2014116(c)(3) of the Maryland Condominium Act apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">On December 5, 2012, Harborview responded, instructing Dr. Clark to contact Zaleo to schedule a time to inspect the requested documents. After scheduling a date to inspect the documents, Dr. Clark sent another letter to Harborview expanding his records inspection request to include \u201cany written advice of legal counsel that relates to or concerns [Dr. Clark], Rebecca Delorme [Dr. Clark\u2019s spouse], or Penthouse 4A.\u201d Harborview responded by letter dated December 18, 2012, stating that legal invoices would be made available for inspection, but that detailed billing reports from legal counsel would not be made available because they were considered privileged and, therefore, were not maintained as regular financial books or records of Harborview. Further, Harborview asserted that in any case, legal documents that constituted a financial book or record would only be produced as they pertained to the requesting unit owner, so the requests for records pertaining to Rebecca Delorme and Penthouse 4A would not be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On December 19, 2012, Rebecca Delorme\u2014acting as Dr. Clark\u2019s agent\u2014inspected and copied documents at Zalco\u2019s office in Silver Spring, Maryland. She was refused access to the detailed billing reports or written advice of counsel. Ms. Delorme did, however, review four boxes of documents, and she received copies of all available legal invoices from 2009 to 2012. Two days later, Dr. Clark notified Harborview by letter that Ms. Delorme had not been given access to all the books and records requested, and renewed his requests for detailed billing reports (including any other supporting documentation for legal invoices) and for \u201clegal opinions or the written advice of legal counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Dr. Clark filed the underlying suit on January 16, 2013, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, specific per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>formance, and damages for breach of contract in the amount of $30,000.00. He argued that the By-laws constituted a contract between him and Harborview, as well as between him and Zaleo as Harborview\u2019s managing agent. He alleged that Harborview and Zaleo breached their contractual obligations by refusing to permit him to inspect the documents at issue, and that unless his request for preliminary injunction was granted, he faced the \u201cfact\u201d that Harborview would move to compel his claims to arbitration under Article XV of the Bylaws, thereby requiring him to \u201cgo through the same time-consuming and costly arbitration process that a separate unit owner [Penthouse 4C] recently did.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Clark also alleged that due to the extensive problems that he encountered in owning the Unit, including that it was uninhabitable because of mold contamination, he needed the requested documents \u201cimmediately to see the impact on how his important investment is being treated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Harborview and Zalco filed a joint answer on March 5, 2013, admitting that they \u201crefused to make the requested documents available to [Dr. Clark] because they constitute privileged attorney-client communications and privileged attorney work product in several adversarial matters including an ongoing lawsuit brought by [Dr. Clark] against the Council and Zaleo.\u201d As an affirmative defense, they claimed that Zaleo was no longer in contractual privity with Harborview and, therefore, Zaleo could not comply with any injunctive order regarding future books or records. That same day, Harborview and Zaleo filed a verified counterclaim seeking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>declaratory judgment as to whether RP \u00a7 11-116 required them to provide Dr. Clark access to written legal advice and detailed billing reports that Harborview received from its attorneys in connection with the representation of Harborview and Zaleo in various investigative matters, claims, and litigation brought by Dr. Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The circuit court held a bench trial on October 8 and 9, 2013. The circuit court summarily granted Dr. Clark\u2019s pretrial motion to exclude Harborview\u2019s expert witness who was expected to testify, based on his review of the relevant documents and his familiarity with RP \u00a7 11-116, that the books and records that Harborview is required to maintain and provide for inspection do not include the detailed billing reports of legal counsel. At trial, the parties presented lay witnesses\u2019 testimony on the issue of the disclosure of detailed billing reports and written advice of counsel. Dr. Clark, for example, testified on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">[Dr. Clark]: I believe that in order for me to assess how my money is being spent and the use of attorneys or I think most would agree, the overuse of attorneys, I have the right to review what they are having you guys do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">[Defense Counsel]: When you say over use of attorneys, what do you mean Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">[Dr. Clark]: I mean there\u2019s been nearly $2 Million the last few years spent on legal bills. That\u2019s insane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">[Defense Counsel]: And do you expect when you sue Har-borview that Harborview will retain Counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">[Dr. Clark]: No, I would expect not to have to sue them in fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Did you know that Harborview retained Counsel to defend the lawsuits that you brought against them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">[Dr. Clark]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: And did you expect that the law firm that was defending Harborview would be paid for its services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">[Dr. Clark]: I would expect that they would be paid, but I want to know what they are being paid to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Dr. Clark continued, characterizing his need to inspect the detailed billings reports provided to Harborview from legal counsel as a need to ensure the \u201cresponsible use of funds,\u201d and denying that the attorney-client privilege was applicable to those billing reports. However, as the circuit court noted later in its opinion, Dr. Clark admitted that the attorney-client privilege is applicable to the written advice of legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Harborview and Zalco offered testimony from Council President John Cochran and Zaleo property managers Richard Brandis and Peter Fabreziani, Jr. Mr. Cochran testified that since April of 2009, the Harborview management files have been kept in locked cabinets: \u201cI mean we have bars and padlocks on all the file cabinets and we have our Detailed Billing Reports that are kept in a fire proof safe in the manager\u2019s office that only the On-site Manager has the key to.\u201d Mr. Cochran testified to the precautions he implemented to avoid inadvertent disclosures of the billing records, stating that \u201cI understood them to be confidential.\u201d Former Zaleo employee and Harborview property manager, Mr. Fabreziani, also testified to his understanding that detailed billing reports submitted to Harborview were confidential in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">At the conclusion of trial, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on Count III for breach of contract, finding that there was no evidence presented to support Dr. Clark\u2019s damages claim. Later, on October 16, 2013, the circuit court issued its Order and Memorandum Opinion on the remaining judgments. Following a thorough examination of the history and purpose of \u00a7 11-116 of the Maryland Condominium Act, and after corresponding analysis of the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrines as applied in Maryland, the circuit court decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Section 11-116 allows [Dr. Clark] to inspect and copy the e-mails requested by him concerning the financial well being of Harborview. The language of Section 11-116 indicates that \u201cbooks and records\u201d under that section relate to financial information, as it makes reference to \u201caccounting practices\u201d and \u201caudits.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Real Prop., \u00a7 11\u2014 116(a)-(b). [Harborview and Zalco] do not dispute this interpretation. Indeed, [President of the Harborview Council of Unit Owners, John] Cochran produced these e-mails to [Dr. Clark]. Cochran uncontrovertedly described his process of sifting through thousands of e-mails and supplying all of those fitting the description of [Dr. Clark\u2019s] request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">[Dr. Clark] is additionally entitled to inspect and copy the detailed billing reports or supporting documentation for Harborview\u2019s legal invoices concerning him, his family, and his unit. Although [Harborview and Zalco] have asserted the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine with respect to this information, they have not demonstrated the applicability of either of these. [Harborview and Zalco\u2019s] blanket assertion is insufficient to overcome the presumption that information contained in detailed billing reports is generally unprotected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">This Court recognizes that, pursuant to Section ll-116(c)(3), [Dr. Clark] is unambiguously granted the right to inspect the written advice of Harborview\u2019s legal counsel if he, his family, and his unit are the subject of that information.... Notwithstanding that statutory language, [Dr. Clark] may only obtain such information if the statute clearly abrogated the common law privilege and doctrine____The language of Section 11-116 displays no express abrogation of the above-described common law privilege and doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">(Internal citations omitted). The court also decided that RP \u00a7 11-116 does not impliedly abrogate the common law attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine because it found that the existence of the privilege and the doctrine did not have the effect of \u201cdepriving the statute\u2019s efficacy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>rendering its provisions nugatory.\u201d The circuit court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">[SJection 11-116 is read as being in harmony with the common law privilege and doctrine: it allows a unit owner who is the subject of the written advice of the condominium\u2019s legal counsel to inspect that information, provided that it is not protected by the common law attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The court granted Dr. Clark\u2019s prayer for injunctive relief and specific performance with respect to detailed billing reports and supporting documentation for legal invoices; however, Dr. Clark\u2019s request for the written advice of legal counsel was denied. In granting the request for a declaratory judgment, the court proclaimed that RP \u00a7 11-116 \u201cdoes not invalidate the common law attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, which safeguard [written advice of legal counsel] from public view.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court declared, therefore, that RP \u00a7 11-116 does not require Harborview to make the written advice of legal counsel regarding Dr. Clark, his family, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>or his unit available for inspection and copying by Dr. Clark, the unit owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Finally, the court noted that as of the date of the trial, it was uncontradicted that Harborview and Zaleo had produced all prior e-mail correspondence regarding the financial well-being of the condominium. Accordingly, the circuit court denied injunctive relief for existing communications. However, the court enjoined Harborview and Zaleo from refusing to produce any future e-mails between them concerning the financial well-being of the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Harborview and Zaleo filed a timely motion to alter or amend and request for hearing as well as a motion to stay the enforcement of the circuit court\u2019s orders. The court denied both motions without a hearing on December 10, 2013. On December 17, 2013, Harborview and Zaleo filed a notice of appeal from the circuit court\u2019s orders of September 20 (excluding expert witness), October 16 (final judgment), and December 10, 2013 (denying reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Appellants present the following issues, which we have slightly rephrased, for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">I. Did the circuit court err by excluding the testimony of Harborview\u2019s expert, Gehrig Cosgray, CPA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">II. Did the circuit court err by concluding that the detailed billing reports of Harborview\u2019s counsel are \u201cbooks and records\u201d subject to inspection by Clark under section 11-116 of the Condominium Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">III. Did the circuit court err in not accepting Harborview\u2019s claims of attorney-client privilege and work product in the detailed billing reports?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">IV. Did the circuit court err by entering injunctive relief against Zaleo because Zalco\u2019s management contract ended on December 31, 2012, and Zaleo returned all of Harborview\u2019s records and materials?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">V. Did the circuit court err by enjoining Harborview to comply with future requests for e-mails between Har-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>borview and Zaleo concerning Harborview\u2019s financial well-being?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">On December 26, 2013, Dr. Clark noted his cross-appeal from the Order of October 16, 2013, and presents the following question for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">Was the circuit court legally correct in holding that \u00a7 11\u2014 116(c)(3)(v) of the [Maryland Condominium Act] does not require Harborview to make written advice of legal counsel for Harborview concerning Dr. Clark, his family, and his Unit available for inspection by Dr. Clark when he is the subject of the written legal advice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We include additional facts in the discussion relevant to the issues there examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Dr. Clark argues that both Article X of the Harbor-view By-laws and RP \u00a7 11-116 allow a unit owner to inspect and copy the detailed billing reports and the written legal advice of counsel without regard for whether any of the material is privileged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, as the circuit court recognized in constraining its analysis primarily to the application of RP \u00a7 11-116, the statutory provision is more specific in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>defining the material to be produced. Indeed, the \u201cRules of Construction\u201d contained in RP \u00a7 11-124 direct as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\"><em>Conflicts in provisions </em>(e) If there is any conflict among the provisions of this title, the declaration, condominium plat, bylaws, or rules adopted pursuant to \u00a7 11-111 of this title, the provisions of each shall control in the succession listed hereinbefore commencing with \u201ctitle\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Likewise, the Court of Appeals has instructed that in regard to the MCA, \u201c[i]f there is any conflict between the provisions of the various documents governing the condominium, the statute controls, then the declaration, plat, bylaws, and rules in that order.\u201d <em>Ridgely Condo.

Dr. Clark also argues that the circuit court erred by not finding that RP \u00a7 11-116 abrogated the common law attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. He maintains that he is entitled, through the MCA, to inspect the written advice of opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The goal of any statutory interpretation analysis is to give effect to the legislative purpose or policy underlying the statute. <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v.

If, after a plain meaning analysis, the purpose of the statute remains ambiguous, we will look for other clues\u2014e.g., longstanding interpretation, the overall legislative scheme, the legislative history, and the general purpose and intent of the statute. <em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>421 Md. 266, 286-88, 26 A.3d 878 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>On its face, RP \u00a7 11-116 clearly establishes that the phrase \u201cbooks and records\u201d necessarily includes documents maintained \u201cin accordance with good accounting practices ... including insurance policies\u201d; \u201cfinancial statements of the condominium\u201d; and \u201cthe minutes of a meeting of the board of directors or other governing body.\u201d The exceptions enumerated in RP \u00a7 ll-116(c)(3) permit the reasonable inference that \u201cbooks and records\u201d maintained by the Council of Unit Owners also includes, among other things, personnel records, records relating to current business transactions, and the written advice of counsel. The latter documents however, are protected by the exception to disclosure, which provides that they may be withheld from inspection by all except \u201cthe person who is the subject of the record or the person\u2019s designee or guardian[.]\u201d RP \u00a7 11\u2014116(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">In its Memorandum Opinion, the circuit court recognized that, \u201cpursuant to Section ll-116(c), [Dr. Clark] is unambiguously granted the right to inspect the written advice of Harborview\u2019s legal counsel if he, his family, and his Unit are the subject of that information.\u201d We agree that the plain language of RP \u00a7 11-116 allows Dr. Clark to request access to the written advice of counsel, as well as the billing records o\u00ed counsel, so long as he and/or his unit are \u201cthe subject of the record.\u201d However, it is also clear that these records would normally be subject to the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, especially where, as here, Dr. Clark and Harborview are adverse parties in ongoing litigation. We arrive then, at the juncture where we must examine whether the exception to the exception to disclosure contained in RP \u00a7 11\u2014116(c)(3) abrogates the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">b. The MCA Does Not Abrogate the Attorney-Client Privilege or the Work Product Doctrine,</p>\n<p id=\"AKp\">i. Modalities of Abrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Harborview and Zaleo contend, and the circuit court found, that RP \u00a7 11\u2014116(c)(3) \u201cdoes not abrogate\u201d the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>mon law attorney-client privilege. As a point of clarification, we understand that the parties do not employ the term \u201cabrogate\u201d as it is traditionally used.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To be sure, none of the parties contend that RP \u00a7 11-116 repeals or extinguishes the entire attorney-client privilege as a part of the general common law in Maryland. Rather, Dr. Clark posits that RP \u00a7 11-116 creates an exception to the application of the attorney-client privilege by mandating disclosure of Harborview\u2019s confidential legal records to him, as a unit owner and subject of the records, without further qualification. Nevertheless, as we shall see, although Maryland courts most frequently use \u201cabrogate\u201d to denote the full removal or replacement of a law or principle, the term is sometimes employed where a limited exception to the common law is created. <em>See e.g., Fagerhus v. Host Marriott Corp., </em>143 Md.App. 525, 535, 795 A.2d 221 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized that where the legislature intends, \u201c[the common law] may be changed by legislative act as Art. 5 of the Declaration of Rights expressly provides[.]\u201d 296 Md. 242, 274, 462 A.2d 506 (1983) (quoting <em>Pope v. State, </em>284 Md. 309, 341-42, 396 A.2d 1054 (1979)), <em>holding modified by Bozman v. Bozman, </em>376 Md. 461, 470, 830 A.2d 450 (2003) (judicially abrogating the interspousal immunity doctrine as \u201ca vestige of the past [and] no longer suitable to our people\u201d and stating that where no legislative barrier to abrogation exists, the Court of Appeals also has the power and authority to abrogate a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>law rule). In the seminal case on abrogation, <em>Lutz v. State, </em>167 Md. 12, 15, 172 A. 354 (1934), the Court of Appeals examined the precedent contained in the Ruling Case Law:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">In 25 R.C.L. 1054, it is said that: \u201cIt has been said that statutes are not presumed to make any alterations in the common law further than is expressly declared, and that a statute, made in the affirmative without any negative expressed or implied, does not take away the common law. The rules of the common law are not to be changed by doubtful implication, nor overturned except by clear and unambiguous language. In order to hold that a statute has abrogated common law rights existing at the date of its enactment, it must clearly appear that they are repugnant to the act, or the part thereof invoked, that their survival would in effect deprive it of its efficacy and render its provisions nugatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">Where, however, a statute and the common law are in conflict, the common law yields to the statute to the extent of the inconsistency, Sutherland on Stat. Const. \u00a7 294; 12 C.J. 186, and a statute which deals with an entire subject-matter is generally construed as abrogating the common law as to that subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">(Emphasis supplied). More recently, the Court of Appeals has reiterated this principle by stating, \u201c[i]t is a generally accepted rule of law that statutes are not presumed to repeal the common law further than is expressly declared.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>353 Md. at 693, 728 A.2d 698 (citation omitted) (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>quotation marks omitted). Additionally, where a statute deals with an entire subject-matter, that statute is often construed as impliedly abrogating the common law as to that subject. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Lutz, </em>167 Md. at 15, 172 A. 354; <em>Watkins v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 349, 353-54, 400 A.2d 464 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Of these two common modalities by which a statute may be held to abrogate the common law\u2014express abrogation and abrogation by adoption of a statutory scheme that deals with an entire subject matter, <em>see Lutz, </em>167 Md. at 15, 172 A. 354\u2014 the latter is easily identifiable and has figured prominently in Maryland case law. In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the 1996 enactment establishing the statutory crime of assault replaced the common law crimes of assault and battery. 353 Md. at 694, 728 A.2d 698. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">To be sure, the language of the 1996 assault statutes contain no specific words of repeal or abrogation, nor is there any conflict between those statutes and the common law. We have determined, however, that the statutes as adopted represent the entire subject matter of the law of assault and battery in Maryland, and as such, abrogate the common law on the subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><em>Id.; see also Watkins, </em>42 Md.App. at 354, 400 A.2d 464 (\u201cThe [escape] statute as adopted represented the entire subject matter of the law of escape in Maryland and thereby abrogated the common law of escape.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In contrast, whether a statute constitutes an express abrogation of the common law engenders a murkier analysis. Typically, \u201cabrogation\u201d is declared in the circumstance where the law, right, or duty previously held is completely extinguished. <em>See Loh, </em>47 Md.App 114, 118, 422 A.2d 16. And, despite the language in <em>Lutz, </em>it is not always necessary that the statute contain words expressing the intention to abrogate the law, right or duty previously held. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 126-27, 422 A.2d 16 (concluding that the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-feasors Act, which did not include express language of abrogation, but provided that \u201c[a] release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor ... does not discharge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>other tort-feasors unless the release so provides,\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.) Article 50 \u00a7 19, operated to abrogate the common law rule that the release of one joint tort-feasor releases all tort-feasors). This is consistent with the principle articulated in Lutz\u2014where the common law rule and the statute are in such direct conflict that they cannot coexist. 167 Md. at 15, 172 A. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In <em>Moaney v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 408, 413, 346 A.2d 466 (1975), this Court observed that although under the common law \u201cit appears that a person accused of grand larceny is entitled to be tried upon an indictment returned by a grand jury,\u201d that principle was abrogated through both legislative enactment and rule change. <em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 346 A.2d 466. The statute in question, as enacted in 1973, and the contemporaneous amendments to the Maryland Rules, provided that a person charged with a felony, other than a felony within the jurisdiction of the district court, and who has not requested a preliminary hearing within ten days after being informed of such hearing, or for whom a preliminary hearing has been held, may be charged by information at the election of the State\u2019s Attorney. <em>Id. </em>We observed that \u201c[wjhether to seek indictment or charge by information is now at the election of the State\u2019s Attorney within the conditions specified,\u201d and that \u201cthe common law right has also been changed by amendment to the Maryland Rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 346 A.2d 466. Although the right to be charged through grand jury indictment was not categorically dissolved, we found that the common law rule regarding persons charged with a felony under limited circumstances was rendered completely without effect. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In <em>Fagerhus v. Host Marriott Corp., </em>we addressed a case involving a limited departure from the common law rather than a full abrogation. 143 Md.App. 525, 535-36, 795 A.2d 221, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 572, 801 A.2d 1032 (2002). When presented with the question of whether Maryland\u2019s recreational use statute (\u201cMRUS\u201d) \u201cabrogate[d] traditional premises liability law under which a property owner must take reasonable care to make his premises safe or to warn of dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>conditions,\u201d we more narrowly determined that \u201cthe language of th[e] subtitle and its legislative history make it clear that the legislature intended to carve out an exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regarding the relevant portion of the recreational use statute, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">Section 5-1103 of the MRUS plainly states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">Except as specifically ... provided in \u00a7 5-1106 ..., an owner of land owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for any recreational or educational purpose, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition ... on the premises to any person who enters on the land for these purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">We need not speculate whether the legislature intended the MRUS to limit traditional premises liability standards, because it codified an intent to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">The purpose of this subtitle is to encourage any owner of land to make land, water, and airspace above the land and water areas available to the public for any recreational and educational purpose <em>by limiting the owner\u2019s liability </em>toward any person who enters on land, water, and airspace above the land and water areas for these purposes. NR \u00a7 5\u20141102(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 795 A.2d 221 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). In the context of a direct textual conflict with the common law rule (owner must take reasonable care versus owner owes no duty of care) and a \u201cpurpose provision\u201d in the statute articulating the legislature\u2019s intent to limit liability, the <em>Fagerhus </em>Court noted that the statute \u201cexplicitly abrogates common law principles of premises liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 795 A.2d 221. In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>however, we lack such explicit guidance from the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Here, it is clear that RP \u00a7 11-116 contains no specific words of repeal or abrogation. Moreover, on its face, the statute does not directly conflict with the common law attorney-client privilege such that the two cannot co-exist. The statute neither invalidates nor supplants the entire subject matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. Under similar circumstances, the Court of Appeals examined the history of both the statute and the common law to determine whether the common law right is \u201crepugnant to the act, or the part thereof invoked, that [its] survival would in effect deprive it of its efficacy and render its provisions nugatory.\u201d <em>Nickens v.

Absent express language abrogating or superseding the common law, the Court looked to the legislative history of the ordinance and conducted an extensive review of the origin and rationale underlying the common law principle. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">Our goal is, as much as possible, to harmonize [the ordinance] with the common law remedy of peaceable self-help (as derived from its antecedent English statutes), for \u201cvarious consistent and related enactments, although made at different times and without reference to one another, nevertheless should be harmonized as much as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 74, 54 A.3d 742 (quoting <em>Pete v.

The 1974 MCA provision maintained a focus on \u201cbooks and records in accordance with good accounting practices.\u201d However, the addition of a mandate that \u201c[e]very record kept by the council ... shall be available for examination[,]\u201d left open the argument that \u201cbooks and records\u201d under the MCA could be construed more broadly than under the Horizontal Property Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In 2004, the General Assembly partially addressed this problem by passing House Bill 879, which \u201calter[ed] the kinds of books and records a homeowners association may withhold from public inspection.\u201d 2004 Md. Laws, ch. 382 (H.B. 879). The bill simultaneously altered the books and records inspection provisions for Cooperative Housing Corporations and Homeowner\u2019s Associations, as well as Condominiums. <em>Id. </em>The Maryland Attorney General submitted written testimony to the House Environmental Matters Committee in support of HB 879, describing the purpose of the legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">Access to the books and records of the governing body of the association is of vital importance to unit and home owners who wish to participate in the democratic process of their associations regardless of the type of common-ownership community they live in.

Among those was the written advice of legal counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Prompted, in part, by the 2006 final report of the Governor\u2019s Task Force on Common Ownership Communities,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the General Assembly enacted the 2009 Home Financial Accountability Act (\u201cHFA\u201d). 2009 Md. Laws, ch. 659 (H.B. 137). The HFA also made identical amendments to several provisions of the Maryland Cooperative Housing Corporation Act and the Maryland Homeowners Association Act in addition to the MCA. All of the revisions authorized the withholding of certain documents from an association member or unit owner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>revisions to RP \u00a7 11-116 (and the other Acts) prohibited a Council of Unit Owners from withholding any books or records from inspection by the person who is the subject of the record. <em>See </em>RP \u00a7 ll-116(c)(3) (reproduced <em>supra). </em>Thus, the protections for sensitive information implemented by the 2004 amendment were left intact with the exception that otherwise withholdable documents should be made available to a unit owner whose person or property is the subject of the document(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Tracing the history of the \u201cbooks and records\u201d inspection provisions applicable to Maryland condominiums and common ownership communities, we cannot conclude that the intent of the legislature was to grant such broad access to documents that the MCA abrogates fundamental common law principles and protections, such as the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. Nor does RP \u00a7 11-116 so clearly dominate the subject-matter to warrant implied abrogation of the common law. Rather, the General Assembly has evinced the intention to provide the information necessary to property owners so that they might assess and protect their investments, while simultaneously recognizing the importance of protecting certain documents from unnecessary disclosure. Clearly, the exception to the exception was intended to permit a unit owner to obtain certain documents, otherwise protected from disclosure, if they concern the unit owner. Indeed, there may be a variety of legal records in Harborview\u2019s files to which a unit owner is entitled, such as a letter from the unit owner\u2019s own counsel, or a letter from another third party (e.g. an advice letter written by the Maryland Attorney General). But nothing in the legislative history suggests that the provision permits a unit owner to trample protections and privileges held and not waived by another, such as a document that contains the legal advice of Harborview\u2019s counsel, or even, a document that contains the personal financial information of another unit owner. The General Assembly is well aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the attorney-client privilege is a fundamental right under Maryland law, and we discern no intent by the General Assembly, express or implied, to abrogate the attorney-client privilege by its various amendments to RP \u00a7 11-116 over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">iii. Attorney-Client Privilege Is Enshrined in Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The common law attorney-client privilege was codified over 42 years ago,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in what is now Maryland Code, (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). The statute provides that \u201c[a] person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d The Court of Appeals has declared that the statute also \u201cprevents the disclosure of a confidential communication made by a client to his attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\u201d <em>Zook v. Pesce, </em>438 Md. 232, 240-41, 91 A.3d 1114 (2014) (quoting <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 414, 718 A.2d 1129 (1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also CR-RSC Tower I, LLC v. RSC Tower I, LLC, </em>202 Md.App. 307, 363, 32 A.3d 456 (2011), <em>aff'd, </em>429 Md. 387, 56 A.3d 170 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Garrett Cnty. v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185 (1982). Additionally, when undertaking a statutory analysis, the law disfavors repeal by implication. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Y]et another cardinal rule of statutory construction is that repeals not expressed will not be found unless demanded by irreconcilability or repug-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>nancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62-63, 453 A.2d 1185. When possible the Maryland courts endeavor to harmonize statutory provisions in a manner that avoids needless conflict between them. <em>See, e.g., Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 306, 992 A.2d 446 (2010) (construing Family Law Article \u00a7 12-103 to be in harmony with sections 7-107, 8-214, and 11-110 to avoid an \u201cillogical result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Here again, absent an express declaration abrogating or carving out an exception to the statutory attorney-client privilege, we decline to imply such abrogation or exception. Rather, realizing that the General Assembly is cognizant of the existence and applicability of the statutory attorney-client privilege, we are compelled to harmonize the two provisions. In so doing, we hold that RP \u00a7 11-116 does not abrogate the common law work product doctrine or common law and statutory attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, we agree with the circuit court that reading RP \u00a7 11-116 in harmony with the common law \u201callows a unit owner who is the subject of the written advice of the condominium\u2019s legal counsel to inspect that information, provided that it is not protected by the common law attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">c. Applying the Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product Doctrine in the Context of an MCA \u201cBooks and Records\u201d Request.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">We now examine two distinct categories of documents\u2014the written advice of legal counsel and detailed billing reports from legal counsel\u2014and discern the extent to which the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine act as brakes on the potentially unfettered disclosures that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>otherwise be sought through RP \u00a7 11-116. We preface our discussion of these documents with a brief overview of the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">In addition to being hallowed common law principles, the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine are also embedded in Maryland law through statute and rule. The attorney-client privilege is \u201cbased upon the public policy that an individual in a free society should be encouraged to consult with his attorney whose function is to counsel and advise him and he should be free from apprehension of compelled disclosures by his legal advisor.\u201d <em>Zook, </em>438 Md. at 241, 91 A.3d 1114 (quoting <em>State v. Pratt, </em>284 Md. 516, 520, 398 A.2d 421 (1979)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the attorney-client privilege is one of \u201cthe oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u201cOnce the attorney-client privilege is invoked, the trial court decides as a matter of law whether the requisite privilege relationship exists, and if it does, \u2018whether or not any such communication is privileged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 574, 914 A.2d 783 (2007) (quoting <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d 1129). Under Maryland law, the party asserting the privilege bears the burden of establishing whether it applies to evidence in the case. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d 1129. \u201cAlthough the court makes a legal determination about the existence of a protective privilege, ... [it] makes a factual determination with respect to satisfaction of the burden.\u201d <em>Catler v. Arent Fox, LLP, </em>212 Md.App. 685, 702-03, 71 A.3d 155 (citation omitted), <em>reconsideration denied </em>(Sept. 3, 2013), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Blumberg v. Fox, </em>435 Md. 502, 79 A.3d 947 (2013). \u201c[T]he burden of substantiating non-discoverability ... cannot be met by conclusory allegations or mere assertions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gallagher Evelius &amp; Jones, LLP v. Joppa Drive-Thru, Inc., </em>195 Md.App. 583, 598, 7 A.3d 160 (2010)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>asserting privilege has met his or her initial burden that \u201cperson may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege,\u201d and this prohibition extends to bar the compelled production of privileged documents. <em>See, e.g., Ashcraft &amp; Gerel v. Shaw, </em>126 Md.App. 325, 350-51, 728 A.2d 798 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Similarly, the work product doctrine \u201cprotects from discovery the work of an attorney done in anticipation of litigation or in readiness for trial.\u201d <em>Catler, </em>212 Md.App. at 702, 71 A.3d 155 (quoting <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 407, 718 A.2d 1129). Maryland Rule 2-402(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">Work Product. Subject to the provisions of sections (f) and (g) of this Rule, a party may obtain discovery of documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party\u2019s representative (including an attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only upon a showing that the materials are discoverable under section (a) of this Rule and that the party seeking discovery has substantial need for the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. In ordering discovery of these materials when the required showing has been made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">(Emphasis added). In <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Formar-Pack, Inc., </em>the Court of Appeals recognized that, like the attorney-client privilege, \u201cthe party claiming the privilege bears the burden \u2018to substantiate its non-discovery assertion by a preponderance of the evidence[.]\u2019 \u201d 351 Md. at 409, 718 A.2d 1129 (quoting <em>Kelch v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>287 Md. 223, 229, 411 A.2d 449 (1980)). Determining \u201cwhether a document or other tangible thing was \u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial\u2019 ... is essentially a question of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>which, if in dispute, is to be determined by the trial judge following an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kelch, </em>287 Md. at 228, 411 A.2d 449).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">There are, however, a few key distinctions between the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. We recognized in <em>Blair v. State </em>that \u201c[although the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine \u2018appear to embrace the same concepts of confidentiality and zealous client advocacy, the work product doctrine is separate and distinct from the attorney-client privilege.\u2019 \u201d 130 Md.App. 571, 605, 747 A.2d 702 (2000) (quoting <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 406, 718 A.2d 1129); <em>see also Pratt v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 442, 446 n. 2, 387 A.2d 779 (1978) (\u201cThe work product doctrine ... is separate from the attorney-client privilege and serves to protect materials from discovery that are not subject to another privilege.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>284 Md. 516, 398 A.2d 421 (1979). Although \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is held by the client[,] ... the protections associated with the work product doctrine belong to the lawyer.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>130 Md.App. at 605, 747 A.2d 702 (citation omitted). Moreover, the attorney-client privilege is narrowly construed, whereas the work product doctrine is broader in scope. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 406, 718 A.2d 1129 (citing <em>Leonen v. Johns-Manville, </em>135 F.R.D. 94, 96 (D.N.J.1990)). Finally, even if the party asserting protection under the work product doctrine is successful in meeting its burden, the party seeking discovery can gain access to the material by demonstrating \u201csubstantial need\u201d and \u201cundue hardship.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-402(d). Central to the case before us is the Court of Appeals\u2019s direction that in examining the application of either privilege or protection, we look to the nexus between the creation of the material and the prospect of litigation. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 410, 718 A.2d 1129 (quoting <em>APL Corp. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>91 F.R.D. 10, 15 (D.Md.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">i. The Written Advice of Legal Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We can envision no more fundamental an example of a confidential communication between an attorney and client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>than written legal advice transmitted from the attorney directly to the client. Indeed, as the circuit court noted in its memorandum opinion, \u201c[b]oth parties hav[e] admitted that the attorney-client privilege is applicable to the written advice of legal counsel.\u201d We acknowledge that the attorney-client privilege is not an absolute bar, as it is subject to waiver, both express and implied. <em>See Fraidin v. Weitzman, </em>93 Md.App. 168, 228, 611 A.2d 1046 (1992) (citing <em>Pratt, </em>284 Md. at 521, 398 A.2d 421). However, Dr. Clark does not argue that Harborview and Zaleo waived the privilege with regard to the written advice of legal counsel; instead, he solely argues that he is entitled to the documents pursuant to RP \u00a7 11-116. Moreover, Dr. Clark\u2019s trial testimony confirms he seeks written legal advice that concerns not only the \u201cprospect of litigation!,]\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 410, 718 A.2d 1129, but the ongoing administrative actions and civil litigation between him and Harborview.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Having already determined, <em>supra, </em>that RP \u00a7 11-116 does not abrogate the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine, we observe that especially where a condominium unit owner seeking the production of the written advice of legal counsel is engaged in ongoing litigation against the condominium\u2019s governing association, \u201cthe pursuit of truth and justice\u201d does not compel the production of otherwise privileged material.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Newman v. State, </em>384 Md. 285, 301, 863 A.2d 321 (2004). Rather, the facts in the matter <em>sub judice </em>weigh in favor of the \u201cpublic interest! ] ... need to promote candor in communications between attorneys and their clients.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 302, 863 A.2d 321. Therefore, we affirm the declaratory judgment of the circuit court and hold that the written advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>of legal counsel, protected by the attorney-client privilege, is \u2022not discoverable under RP \u00a7 11-116 absent waiver.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">ii. The Detailed Billing Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In seeking the disclosure of the detailed billing reports, Dr. Clark asserts his significant interest as a unit owner in the financial transactions and decisions of Harborview. As a unit owner, Dr. Clark owns an undivided percentage interest in the common elements and is correspondingly responsible to pay a percentage of Harborview\u2019s common expenses. RP \u00a7 11-107. Pursuant to the MCA and Harborview\u2019s governing documents, Harborview may levy assessments and impose liens on unit owners for unpaid common expenses. RP \u00a7 11-110. Those common expenses include legal expenses.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Dr. Clark avers that the circuit court was correct in determining that Harborview and Zaleo failed to meet their burden to establish that either the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine are applicable to the detailed billing reports of legal counsel. Dr. Clark contends that rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>attempting to meet the initial burden\u2014by, for example, introducing redacted copies of the deta\u00f1ed b\u00f1ling reports\u2014Har-borview and Zaleo waited to assert the impossibility of satisfying their burden in a post-trial motion. Thus, Dr. Clark argues that Harborview and Zaleo should not now be allowed to re-open the case after having failed to prove its defense in trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Harborview maintains that Dr. Clark\u2019s interest in the disclosure of legal expenses affecting the financial well-being of Harborview, and thereby the unit owners, was satisfied through the production of legal invoices. Regarding the detailed billing reports received from legal counsel, Harborview and Zaleo contend that they met the burden to prove that both the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">During the October 8, 2018, trial, Harborview and Zaleo introduced a sample detailed billing report as an exemplar. This exhibit (unrelated to the matter between these parties) contained billing detail to the tenth of an hour and included, among other things, the name of the attorney who performed the work and a brief description of the nature of the work. Mr. Fabreziani, former property manager employed by Zaleo to manage Harborview, testified that he had received detailed billing reports from counsel for Harborview and that \u201c[i]t would have an accounting of all the details in terms of times, what the attorneys were working on, [and] documents that were prepared.\u201d President of the Harborview Counc\u00fc of Unit Owners, John Cochran, also testified that he received detailed billing reports from counsel for Harborview. He further testified that, in his experience as an attorney, a detailed billing report is \u201ca communication to the client that says to the client what I\u2019ve been doing, what my mental impressions are, what work I\u2019ve been doing[.]\u201d In an effort to avoid inadvertent disclosure or waiver, Harborview did not introduce any specific detailed billing reports into evidence to show that the attorney-client privilege or work product doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>trine applied.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">In <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Development Limited Partnership, </em>we stated: \u201c[attorneys\u2019 bills are generally not protected by the attorney-client privilege; and to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>that portions of a bill might have been privileged, [a party\u2019s] blanket assertion [i]s inadequate.\u201d 100 Md.App. 441, 455, 641 A.2d 977 (1994). Addressing the level of detail contained in an attorney\u2019s billing report, we quoted the Ninth Circuit, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"av-dedup-0\">[T]he identity of the client, the amount of the fee, the identification of payment by case file name, and the general purpose of the work performed are usually not protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege. However, correspondence, bills, ledgers, statements, and time records which also reveal the motive of the client in seeking representation, litigation strategy, or the specific nature of the services provided, such as researching particular areas of the law, fall within the privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 456-57, 641 A.2d 977 (quoting <em>Clarke v. Am. Commerce Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>974 F.2d 127, 129 (9th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In the instant case, the circuit court found that Harborview and Zaleo failed to carry their burden of showing that attorney-client privilege applied to all or portions of the requested detailed billing reports, and stated: \u201c[Harborview and Zalco\u2019s] blanket assertion is insufficient to overcome the presumption that information contained in detailed billing reports is generally unprotected.\u201d (citing <em>Maxima Corp., supra, </em>100 Md.App. at 457, 641 A.2d 977). We affirm the court\u2019s ruling. Indeed, as we have previously stated, \u201ca finding that information in attorneys\u2019 bills is within the attorney-client privilege is the exception and not the general rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457-58, 641 A.2d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Harborview and Zaleo also contend that their detailed billing reports are protected by the broader work product doctrine. The threshold for application of the work product doctrine is that the material must have been prepared \u201cin anticipation of litigation or in readiness for trial.\u201d <em>Catler, 212 </em>Md.App. at 702, 71 A.3d 155 (quoting <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 Md. at 407, 718 A.2d 1129). Based on the timing of the requests and ongoing litigation between the parties, we may infer that this is the case for at least some of the detailed billing reports. However, we have recognized two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>categories of attorney work product: fact and opinion. <em>Blair, </em>130 Md.App. at 607-08, 747 A.2d 702 (citing <em>Hickman v.

Moorish Sci. Temple of Am., Inc., </em>362 Md. 339, 354-55, 765 A.2d 132 (2001) (citing <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty.

Where an appeal concerns the issuance of a permanent injunction, we are guided by the principles of injunctive relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">An injunction is a writ framed according to the circumstances of the case commanding an act which the court regards as essential to justice, or restraining an act which it esteems contrary to equity and good conscience. Thus, injunctive relief is a preventative and protective remedy, <em>aimed at future acts, </em>and is not intended to redress past wrongs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>El Bey, </em>362 Md. at 353-54, 765 A.2d 132 (emphasis in original) (citations and internal quotations marks omitted). Thus, the pertinent question presented when reviewing the grant of a permanent injunction is \u201cwhether [appellee] produced evidence that [appellant\u2019s] conduct caused, or was likely to cause, ... the type of [irreparable] harm necessary to justify the court\u2019s issuance of injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355, 765 A.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In <em>Coster v. Department of Personnel, </em>we relied on American Jurisprudence to require the prospect of irreparable injury before granting an injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">A court of equity reserves its injunctive process for the protection of property or other rights against actual or threatened injuries of a substantial character which cannot be adequately remedied in a court of law. That is to say, the jurisdiction or power to grant injunctive relief should be exercised only when intervention is essential to effectually protect property or other rights, of which equity will take cognizance, against irreparable injuries. The very function of an injunction is to furnish preventive relief against irreparable mischief or injury, and the remedy will not be awarded where it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the injury complained of is not of such character. Suitors may not resort to a court of equity to restrain acts, actual or threatened, merely because they are illegal or transcend constitutional powers, unless it is apparent that irremediable injury will result. The mere assertion that apprehended acts will inflict irreparable injury is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>enough. The complaining party must allege and prove facts from which the court can reasonably infer that such would be the result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">36 Md.App. 523, 525-26, 373 A.2d 1287 (1977) (quoting 42 Am.Jur. 2d <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7\u00a7 48, 49). Importantly, mere allegations or arguments by a party that it will suffer irreparable damage are insufficient bases for injunctive relief; \u201cfacts must be adduced to prove that [the requesting party\u2019s] apprehensions are well-founded.\u201d <em>El Bey, </em>362 Md. at 356, 765 A.2d 132 (citing <em>Smith v. Shiebeck, </em>180 Md. 412, 421, 24 A.2d 795 (1942); <em>Mayor &amp; Council of Salisbury v. Camden Sewer Co., </em>135 Md. 563, 573, 109 A. 333 (1920)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Here, the dispute settlement mechanism under the MCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">If any unit owner fails to comply with this title, ... the unit owner may be sued for damages caused by the failure or for injunctive relief, or both, by the council of unit owners or by any other unit owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">RP \u00a7 ll-113(c). Thus, the MCA contemplates injunctive relief as an appropriate vehicle for enforcing the rights and obligations it creates. Because the failure to comply with a unit owner\u2019s rights under RP \u00a7 11-116 \u201ccannot be readily, adequately, and completely compensated for with money,\u201d <em>see Coster, </em>36 Md.App. at 525-26, 373 A.2d 1287 (quoting 42 Am.Jur. 2d <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 49), injunctive relief may be granted \u201cto effectually protect [the] rights\u201d of the party requesting equitable relief, <em>see id. </em>(quoting 42 Am.Jur. 2d <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 48). Therefore, absent a sufficient showing by Harborview and Zaleo of the applicability of a privilege against disclosure, Dr. Clark is entitled to the production of detailed billing reports as financial documents maintained by Harborview and Zaleo pursuant to RP \u00a7 11-116, and to injunctive relief to enforce that production when it has been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Contrastingly, the circuit court\u2019s order enjoining Harborview and Zaleo to produce any future e-mail correspondence between them concerning Harborview is not supported by any reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. As all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>parties acknowledge, the management contract between Harborview and Zaleo expired on December 31, 2012. A separate management company has since taken over operations at Harborview. The record does not contain any indication that communications between Harborview and Zaleo\u2014regarding the financial well-being of Harborview\u2014will continue in any form. As such, this request is likely moot and inappropriate for an award of permanent injunctive relief. <em>See El Bey, </em>362 Md. at 355, 765 A.2d 132 (citing <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 615, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978)) (\u201cInjunctive relief normally will not be granted unless the petitioner demonstrates that it will sustain substantial and irreparable injury as a result of the alleged wrongful conduct.\u201d). Accordingly, we vacate the order of the circuit court awarding specific performance directing Harborview and Zaleo to produce any future e-mail correspondence and enjoining them from refusing. However, with regard to the remaining orders for specific performance and injunctive relief, we cannot conclude that the circuit court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Exclusion of Harborview\u2019s Expert Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Harborview maintains that its accounting expert was prepared to opine, <em>inter alia, </em>that detailed billing reports of legal counsel are not part of the financial books and records that a condominium association is required to keep in accordance with good accounting practices. The events leading to the court\u2019s decision to exclude this testimony began on March 13, 2013, when the pretrial scheduling order was issued. According to the order, Harborview and Zalco were to designate their expert witnesses by June 11, 2013, and trial was set for October 8, 2013. Harborview maintained that it had not received a copy of the scheduling order and was unaware of the deadline. Several days after Harborview failed to meet the deadline for the identification of expert witnesses, Dr. Clark served interrogatories on June 13, 2013, asking Harbor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>view to identify its expert witnesses. On July 15, 2013, Harborview responded to those interrogatories and identified Mr. Gehrig Cosgray, CPA, as an expert witness. Dr. Clark then moved, on August 7, 2013, to exclude Mr. Cosgray as an expert witness due to Harborview\u2019s failure to comply with the scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">On September 12, 2013, Dr. Clark identified his rebuttal expert witnesses, and on September 26, 2013, Dr. Clark noticed Mr. Cosgray\u2019s deposition. The same day Dr. Clark noticed the deposition, the circuit court summarily granted his motion to exclude Mr. Cosgray as an expert witness. Nevertheless, Dr. Clark deposed Mr. Cosgray on October 1, 2013. At trial, Dr. Clark did not introduce any expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Harborview contends that the circuit court erred by excluding the testimony of its expert witness. Harborview maintains that despite not receiving the scheduling order and thereby, admittedly, missing the deadline for the disclosure of expert witnesses, it substantially complied with the order by notifying Dr. Clark of its expert witness a month after the deadline and almost three months before trial. Moreover, it argues that Dr. Clark was able to identify his own rebuttal expert witnesses on September 12, 2013, and that he deposed Mr. Cosgray prior to trial. Harborview asserts that although the appropriate sanction for a party\u2019s failure to comply with a discovery order is a matter of discretion for the circuit court, <em>Livingstone v. Greater Washington Anesthesiology &amp; Pain Consultants, </em>187 Md.App. 346, 388, 978 A.2d 852 (2009) (citing <em>Maddox v. Stone, </em>174 Md.App. 489, 501, 921 A.2d 912 (2007)), the court\u2019s failure to exercise discretion requires reversal. We do not agree that the court\u2019s decision is so manifestly erroneous as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The circuit court must enter a scheduling order in most civil actions pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-504(a)(l). In <em>Dorsey v. Nold, </em>362 Md. 241, 255-56, 765 A.2d 79 (2001), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">The principal function of a scheduling order is to move the case efficiently through the litigation process by setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>specific dates or time limits for anticipated litigation events to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">Rule 2-504 is not a discovery rule. It is not included in the Title 2, Chapter 400 rules on discovery and, except as provided in \u00a7 (b)(2)(A), is not intended either to enlarge or constrict the scope of discovery. Its function, to the extent it references discovery in \u00a7 (b)(1), is to provide for the setting of time limits on certain discovery events; it is, in that regard, a rule of timing, not of substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In <em>Maddox v. Stone, </em>this Court, in reviewing the above language, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">[Although scheduling orders should not be applied in a manner that is \u201cunyieldingly rigid,\u201d litigants must make good faith and reasonable efforts to substantially comply with the court\u2019s deadlines[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">174 Md.App. at 499, 921 A.2d 912 (citing <em>Naughton v. Bankier, </em>114 Md.App. 641, 653, 691 A.2d 712 (1997)). We have deemed substantial compliance with a scheduling order to be sufficient where the opposing party has not suffered prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Wormwood v. Batching Sys., Inc., </em>124 Md.App. 695, 702-05, 723 A.2d 568 (1999). Still, the overriding tenet persists that, \u201c[t]he decision to admit or exclude \u2018expert\u2019 testimony is within the broad discretion of the trial court and that decision will be sustained on appeal unless it is shown to be manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Kleban v. Eghrari-Sabet, </em>174 Md.App. 60, 61, 920 A.2d 606 (2007) (quoting <em>Wood v. Toyota Motor Corp., </em>134 Md.App. 512, 520 n. 8, 760 A.2d 315 (2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">In the instant case, the order of the circuit court excluding the expert testimony of Mr. Cosgray summarily states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">Upon consideration of the Plaintiffs Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Gehrig Cosgray, CPA (# 37), Defendant\u2019s Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Gehrig Cosgray, CPA (# 37/1) and Plaintiffs Reply in Support of Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Gehrig Cosgray, CPA (# 37/2), it is this 20th day of September 2013, by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOq\">ORDERED that, Plaintiffs Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Gehrig Cosgray, CPA (#37) is GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">There is no accompanying memorandum, and the record reveals that the court did not hold a hearing on the motion. For those reasons, Harborview asserts that it cannot be discerned from the summary exclusion of its expert witness whether the circuit court exercised proper discretion or granted the exclusion based on a predetermined position that exclusion was mandatory. <em>See Gunning v. State, </em>347 Md. 332, 351, 701 A.2d 374 (1997) (\u201c[A] judge\u2019s unyielding adherence to [a] predetermined position amounts to a ... failure to properly exercise discretion.\u201d); <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 108, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987) (\u201cWhen a court must exercise discretion, failure to do so is error, and ordinarily requires reversal.\u201d). However, the record reveals that the court had ample time to consider all parties\u2019 filings and arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Additionally, it appears that Mr. Cosgray\u2019s expert testimony was to be, in large part, his legal opinion on the scope of \u201cbooks and records\u201d under RP \u00a7 11-116. Harborview designated Mr. Cosgray as its expert witness in its July 15, 2013, answers to interrogatories. Those answers, which were attached to Appellee\u2019s motion to exclude, provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">Mr. Cosgray is expected to testify based on his review of the relevant documents and depositions and his familiarity with Section 11-116 of the Maryland Real Property Article that the books and records Harborview is required to maintain and provide for inspection do not include the detailed billing reports prepared by outside counsel for Harborview and are submitted to Harborview for purposes of communicating itemized descriptions of legal work performed for Harborview by its outside counsel.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201cWitnesses (whether lay or expert) generally may not testify to their conclusions on legal issues, because their opinions would not be helpful to the court or the jury.\u201d 6 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, State &amp; Federal </em>\u00a7 701:7, at 864-65 (3d ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In <em>Burch v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, </em>184 Md. 664, 671, 42 A.2d 671 (1945), the Court of Appeals considered the propriety of witness testimony regarding the legal effect of bookkeeping practices. In that case, the appellant brought an action upon a special agency contract to collect renewal commissions on life insurance premiums. <em>Id. </em>at 666-67, 42 A.2d 671. The contract provided for \u201cthe payment of commissions, with respect to business procured by the agent personally, on all premiums and considerations collected by him and paid to the company in cash during the continuance of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The policy in question, however, contained a provision stating that \u201cupon proof that the insured had become totally and permanently disabled before the age of sixty, [the insurer] would waive the payment of certain premiums otherwise payable under this policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, 42 A.2d 671 (internal quotation marks omitted). The sole question presented to the Court of Appeals was whether this waiver of premium payments constituted a discontinuance of payment or should be deemed constructive payment for the purpose of the agency contract and commission payments. <em>Id. </em>The appellant argued that the trial court erred in excluding testimony as to bookkeeping practices and custom and usage among insurance companies regarding premiums waived during disability. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that questions calling for conclusions regarding the legal effect of company bookkeeping practices \u201cwere not designed to elicit any new facts as to that practice, but merely called for an expression of opinion upon a point which ... was for the court to decide\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 42 A.2d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We are presented with a similar circumstance. Just as the construction of an unambiguous contract is a matter of law to be decided by the court, <em>Connors v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>442 Md. 466, 480, 113 A.3d 595 (2015) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>omitted), so too is the construction of a statute such as RP \u00a7 11-116, <em>see Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78 (2004) (citations omitted) (stating that interpreting the Maryland Code is a matter of law). In the matter before us, we cannot conclude that the circuit court either abused or failed to exercise its discretion in excluding the testimony of Harbor-view\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Cross-appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In his cross-appeal, Dr. Clark argues that the circuit court erred in conducting its statutory construction analysis and that it erred in determining that the provisions of RP \u00a7 11\u2014 116 can be read in harmony with the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. We have already addressed these contentions above.

Dr. Clark also presented a copy of the Final Arbitration Award in the matter between Harborview and Penthouse 4C, LLC to the circuit court at the October 8, 2013 trial. The Final Arbitration Award was admitted in to evidence, over objection, and on the understanding that it was a non-binding <em>nisi prius </em>decision. Therein, the arbitrators concluded that the plain language of RP \u00a7 11-116 was sufficient to require Harborview to allow Penthouse 4C, through its agent, to inspect the books and records maintained by Harborview including the written advice of legal counsel. The circuit court memorandum opinion, however, does not specifically address the resolution reached in the arbitration award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\">. The Court of Appeals in <em>Harford Mutual v. Woodfin Equities Corp., </em>344 Md. 399, 414, 687 A.2d 652 (1997), explained that \"when a declaratory judgment action is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, 'the trial court must render a declaratory judgment.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Christ by Christ v.

The attorney-client privilege was codified in Maryland through the 1973 enactment that created the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. 1973 Md. Laws, 1st Sp. Sess., ch. 2 (S.B. 1). The revisor\u2019s note to the session law provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">This section is new language which does not presently appear in the Code, but is a common law principle that has been long established. <em>Morris v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 252, 254, 242 A.2d 559 (1968); <em>Bris Realty v. Phoenix, </em>238 Md. 84, 89-90, 208 A.2d 68 (1965).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">. Harborview and Zaleo also argue that an interpretation of RP \u00a711-116 that requires the production of privileged material or work product to an adverse party in the specific context of litigation involving a condominium creates an absurd result in the face of an attorney\u2019s ethical duties under Rules of Professional Conduct 1.4 and 1.6. However, we need not address this contention for the resolution of this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b80-5\">. We note, that although this interpretation forecloses the discovery of documents between parties who are directly adverse absent waiver, unit owners would remain able to obtain the written advice of counsel in cases in which they are a co-plaintiff or co-defendant with the Council of Unit Owners or in matters against non-unit owners in which the Council undertakes the prosecution of a claim or defense on behalf of all unit owners and affecting the requesting owner or unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\">. The circuit court did not decide, nor was it necessary to decide, whether the written advice of counsel was also protected by the work product doctrine. We note that the work of an attorney done in anticipation of litigation is also protected from discovery via RP \u00a7 11-116 absent waiver or a showing sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Maryland Rule 2\u2014402(d). Under Maryland Rule 2-402, generally, a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action and not otherwise privileged or protected by the work product doctrine. However, subsection (d) of the rule provides for discovery of documents otherwise protected upon a showing that the requestor has a \"substantial need for the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">. As a poignant example of the scale of this expense in recent years, Dr. Clark notes that the Harborview Condominium Budget Narrative for 2013 lists legal expenses in the amount of $890,950.00. Dr. Clark contends this is a significant expense for all of the Harborview unit owners, but Harborview and Zaleo maintain that a sizable portion of the amount was incurred defending against the multiple actions initiated by Dr. Clark and his common interest agreement partner, James Ancel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b83-5\">. Because Harborview and Zalco\u2019s motions to stay the circuit court's October 16, 2013, order before both the circuit court and this Court were denied, the question of what portion, if any, of the detailed billing reports may have been privileged is largely academic. Nevertheless, the parties dispute on appeal whether the actual privileged records could have been produced <em>in camera </em>to the court and opposing counsel. The Court of Appeals has recognized the dilemma presented by allowing opposing counsel to view allegedly attorney-client privileged documents submitted <em>in camera, </em>where it was unclear whether the court had determined that the privilege applied to those documents. <em>See Ehrlich, </em>396 Md. at 574, 914 A.2d 783. A workable solution already exists through the modalities by which the courts of Maryland have employed <em>in camera </em>inspection. \"If the court determines that the defendant has established the need to inspect the material at issue, then 'the court may elect to review the records alone, to conduct the review in the presence of counsel, or to permit review by counsel alone, as officers of the court, subject to such restrictions as the court requires to protect the records' confidentiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fields v. State, </em>432 Md. 650, 667, 69 A.3d 1104 (2013) (quoting <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 87, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992)). We recognize that where \u201can <em>in camera </em>inspection is an intrusion on ... attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, then, clearly, expanded <em>in camera </em>review is a more serious intrusion on those privileges because opposing counsel is being made privy to allegedly privileged information.\u201d <em>Ehrlich, </em>396 Md. at 571, 914 A.2d 783. As the Second Circuit observed in <em>Chase Manhattan Bank v. Turner &amp; Newall, PLC,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">If opposing counsel is allowed access to information arguably protected by the privilege before an adjudication as to whether the privilege applies, a pertinent aspect of confidentiality will be lost, even though communications later deemed to be privileged will be inadmissible at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Moreover, attorneys cannot unlearn what has been disclosed to them in discovery. Some of the economies gained by the practice of pre-adjudication disclosure may thus be offset by later proceedings seeking to unscramble the effects of the disclosure of materials subsequently held to be privileged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">964 F.2d at 165. In cases like the one <em>sub judice, </em>an expanded <em>in camera </em>proceeding, \"one in which counsel for [both parties] participate or permitting the review of the records by counsel in their capacity as officers of the court,\u201d <em>Zaal, </em>326 Md. at 86, 602 A.2d 1247, is often an unsatisfactory resolution. This is, in large part, why the Court of Appeals recognized in <em>Zaal </em>and <em>Fields </em>that <em>in camera </em>review by a judge without the presence of counsel is sometimes warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">.
