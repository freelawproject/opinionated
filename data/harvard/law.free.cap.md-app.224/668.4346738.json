(DOB: 3/29/90), entered a plea of involved to one count of sexual abuse of a five-year-old boy and two counts of second degree sexual offense against the same victim in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, sitting as a juvenile court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The juvenile court committed appellant to the Department of Juvenile Services for placement in a residential treatment center. Approximately ten months later, appellant was released from the treatment center and placed on probation with home electronic monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">In 2009 and 2010, the Maryland General Assembly amended the Maryland sex offender registration act (\u201cMSORA\u201d), requiring, among other things, that certain juveniles convicted of various sex offenses and at significant risk of committing a sexually violent offense or a Tier II or Tier III sexual offense (\u201cat significant risk of re-offending\u201d) to register as sex offenders upon leaving the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. <em>See </em>Md.Code 2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum.Supp. \u00a7 ll-704(a), (c) of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP 2010\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of these statutory changes, the State requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>appellant be placed on the sex offender registry, and the juvenile court conducted a hearing to determine whether appellant was at significant risk of re-offending. The court concluded, based on clear and convincing evidence, that appellant was at significant risk of re-offending and thus ordered him to register as a sex offender pursuant to MSORA.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Appellant now challenges the juvenile court\u2019s order. He presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">1. Did the juvenile court err in ordering appellant to register as a sex offender given the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Doe v. Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services, </em>430 Md. 535 [62 A.3d 123] (2013) <em>(\u201cDoe I </em>\u201d), that retroactive registration is a violation of the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws?</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">2. Was appellant entitled to specific performance of his plea agreement, which did not include a requirement that he register as a sex offender?</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer both questions in the negative and affirm the juvenile court\u2019s order requiring appellant to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">On June 27, 2006, appellant pleaded involved to one count of sexual abuse of a minor and two counts of second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>sexual offense. The State\u2019s proffer revealed that, while appellant babysat five-year-old A.H. and his two older brothers, appellant sodomized A.H. and forced A.H. to perform fellatio on him. Appellant initially denied sexual contact with the victim, but after further questioning admitted that he \u201chad put it in [A.H.\u2019s] mouth about midway down the tongue.\u201d Appellant was fifteen years old when the abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The juvenile court accepted appellant\u2019s plea, and appellant was placed in a residential treatment center for about ten months. Upon release from the treatment center in June 2007, appellant was placed on probation, and for the following three and one-half years the juvenile court monitored appellant\u2019s progress in outpatient sex offender treatment through regular review hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In 2009 and 2010, the Maryland General Assembly amended MSORA. One such amendment allowed, under specific circumstances, the juvenile court to order juvenile offenders who had been adjudicated involved in certain sexual offenses to register as sex offenders when they left the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7\u00a7 ll-704(a), (c). In response to this change, on October 7, 2010, the State requested that the juvenile court order appellant to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Based on the new law and the State\u2019s requests, the juvenile court conducted a hearing on December 15 and 21, 2010, to determine whether appellant should be placed on the sex offender registry. The court\u2019s decision considered only the testimony and reports presented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In rendering its opinion, the juvenile court noted that appellant \u201ccommitted sexual acts with [A.H.] maybe 50 times. 20 times included penetration, and there were also offenses that included fellatio....\u201d In addition, the court stated that, \u201cI think maybe there was one event that involved [A.H.]\u2019s broth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>er,\u201d and \u201cthat there was also another youngster involved by the name of [L.F.].... [T]here was denial as to [L.F.] [ ] for a long time, for 20 months or so, almost two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The juvenile court reviewed the testimony and reports of the three witnesses who testified at the hearing. Dr. Ronald I. Weiner, an expert in adult and juvenile sex offender risk assessments and treatment, provided an independent evaluation of appellant, the findings of which were memorialized in a detailed, thirty-page risk assessment report. Dr. Weiner testified to his findings at the hearing. The court described Dr. Weiner as \u201cneutral,\u201d and thus determined that \u201chis testimony and his report [were to be given] significant weight.\u201d The court also heard testimony from Ta-Keisha Smith, appellant\u2019s case manager, who the court also found to be \u201cvery credible.\u201d Dr. Fred Berlin, appellant\u2019s treating physician for his sex offender treatment, also testified. Because Dr. Berlin was appellant\u2019s treating physician, he was not asked to perform an independent evaluation. Regarding Dr. Berlin\u2019s opinion, the court stated: \u201cI am forced to give his testimony far less weight. I, he came across in the Court\u2019s opinion, as an advocate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Based on the witnesses\u2019 testimony, Dr. Weiner\u2019s report, and \u201cvarious psycho sexual reports\u201d from the years appellant was supervised while in placement and on probation, the juvenile court found that appellant was \u201ca highly sexualized young man.\u201d The court explained that, when appellant first came into the system,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">both Dr. Weiner and Dr. Berlin reported the significant level of abuse and criminal activity that [appellant] was involved in, back for this four plus years. Dr. Weiner described it as egregious and predatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">[T]hey noted that [appellant] had not only this criminal history, but there was, I guess what the Court can fairly describe as a highly, a highly sexualized young man. Not just back when he was 11 to almost 16, but thereafter.... [H]e acknowledged, I guess, maybe 20 sexual partners. I\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>not talking about young children, I\u2019m talking about peers. He acknowledged having sex at least three times with someone who was drunk, masturbating in a public place, fondling the dog\u2019s genitals, phone sex, internet sex with female peers. So that we, and someone who, by his words, by [appellant\u2019s] own words, was perhaps addicted to pornography. So that\u2019s the presentation when [appellant] came into the system. And it was also the presentation, at least by history, that Dr. Weiner and Dr. Berlin were, and are working with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The juvenile court expressed concern that appellant\u2019s behavior over the four and one-half years that he was monitored by the juvenile court raised questions about his honesty. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">[appellant] has demonstrated some challenging behavior throughout the life of this case. Behavior that has involved deception, behavior that has involved avoidance, behavior that has involved downright lying....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">There seems to be a pattern in [appellant\u2019s] behavior throughout the life of this case of denying, avoiding,\u2014 avoiding, denying, lying, polygraph, or some type of confrontation, admission, then denying again, and then admitting again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The juvenile court pointed to numerous examples of appellant\u2019s deceptive behavior. Principal among them was that appellant did not \u201cuntil very recently ... reveal to anybody that he had been having a sexual relationship with a young girl when he was very young. He was maybe eight and the young girl was, I think, 11.\u201d The court found it \u201cstartling and troubling\u201d that \u201csomeone that has been under this intense level of scrutiny in this particular field of psycho social treatment, to not disclose that for that long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">In addition to appellant hiding his sexual relationship at the age of eight, the juvenile court also described numerous instances of appellant lying to his parents and to Dr. Berlin. Appellant lied about his part-time employment, and denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>being aroused by child pornography despite admitting that images of children, including an image of A.H., came to his mind while masturbating. The court stated that \u201cit seems clear that [appellant] has, in the past, had an addictive, an addiction to pornography and then that became an area of deception for him.\u201d That deception became apparent when appellant told Dr. Berlin in 2008 that he was no longer accessing pornography, but later stated that his use of pornography ended in late 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Appellant also denied using illegal drugs until he tested positive in a random urinalysis. Despite the positive drug test, appellant continued to lie about the extent of his drug use, suggesting to his case manager that he had only used on his birthday, when in fact he had used regularly for a period of seven months. The juvenile court found this alarming, given that the drug use occurred \u201c[w]hile on probation, and while under the strictest scrutiny by the Court.\u201d Although the court recognized that there were \u201csome unfortunate lapses in this case,\u201d namely that appellant was not subject to random urine testing for three years of his probation, the court was particularly concerned that appellant took advantage of this lapse to regularly use drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Because of the extent of appellant\u2019s deception, the juvenile court questioned appellant\u2019s seemingly good decisions. In 2008, appellant voluntarily agreed to take depo lupron, a drug that diminishes testosterone levels. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5x\">[i]t seems to be both key to Dr. Weiner and Dr. Berlin that he stay on this medication. It\u2019s also key to the Court that he stay on this medication. The problem with the Court is, the Court is going to lose jurisdiction in a few months, in March.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">And the question is, will he stay on it? ... He went on the drug voluntarily, which I think shows some good judgment on his part. Although, that has some issues around it as to why he did. He told Dr. Weiner\u2014no, Dr. Berlin, that he was concerned as to his penis size. He was concerned as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the medication\u2019s affect on his weight. And he thought that it maybe would look good to the Court if he went on this medication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Thus the court concluded that it had \u201cno way of assuring [ ] that the odds are good that he\u2019s going to stay on [depo lupron].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The juvenile court also pointed to Dr. Weiner\u2019s determination that \u201cas a result of his testing, ... there was evidence that [appellant] did not either acknowledge or understand the notion of his sexual, any sexual deviant pattern on his part, and his sexual acting out, which is concerning.\u201d Dr. Weiner \u201cthought that all of the treatment that [appellant] had[ ] had was appropriate. He thought that the evaluations that he had[ ] were worthy and comprehensive. But at the end of it all [Dr. Weiner] says something to the effect of, I don\u2019t know whether [appellant] really has internalized this.\u201d The court pointed out as evidence of appellant\u2019s failure to internalize therapy that \u201cat some place in this continuum of disclosure, [appellant] talked about grooming another young girl for possible molestation and then backed off of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">These issues, plus appellant\u2019s deceptive behavior, led the court to state that \u201cwhat we have in this case is a very disturbing confluence between what we do know and what we don\u2019t know.\u201d This confluence caused the court to worry about appellant\u2019s future risk of re-offending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">So in terms of what we know and what we do not, Dr. Weiner was quite clear when he was talking about risk, that he saw a major issue in the fact that, as he expressed it, he had no way of assessing or determining what [appellant\u2019s] sexual arousal patterns are because there\u2019s no objective tools. There\u2019s no objective tools that were used to determine this. This is also very troubling because [appellant] has been in therapy for such a long time and the issue has been child molestation. And the issue has been deviant sexual behavior....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">[Appellant] has denied that he, he has denied that he has any sexual, deviant sexual arousal patterns as it revolves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>around children. But he\u2019s denied a lot of things. He denied using drugs when he was using them. He denied alcohol when he, you know, has been drinking\u2014well, not lately, hopefully, since he was 11 or 12. He has denied pornography over time, when he was with Dr. Berlin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The juvenile court agreed with Dr. Weiner\u2019s assessment that appellant presents \u201can unspecified risk,\u201d and that \u201cwhat we don\u2019t know\u201d is \u201cvery important.\u201d Dr. Weiner suggested that it was the healthcare community\u2019s duty to monitor appellant to prevent a relapse, but the court observed that appellant would no longer be monitored after he left the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. According to the court, \u201c[h]e can do whatever he wants when he\u2019s 21. He doesn\u2019t have to live [at] home. He can take medicines or not. He can live at his parentsf home]. He can live somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The juvenile court concluded that placing appellant on the sex offender registry would be the best option for continuing treatment of appellant and ensuring the safety of the community:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">We must maintain leverage in the treatment. We can\u2019t leave it up to him. That is what Dr. Weiner said, he, meaning [appellant], has a lot to overcome in terms of his offenses____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">And Dr. Berlin\u2019s testimony was: \u201cHe said he would continue [treatment], and I believe him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">Putting someone on a sex registry, it is what it is. No one pretends that it\u2019s a direct treatment. It is community safety. It is something that the legislature has seen fit to place into our statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">I don\u2019t rule out the possibility, however, that it may have some therapeutic value. Just the fact that it is in place, may have some type of leverage on [appellant] so that he understands that, [although] not under this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, there is a continuing interest in him and his well being, and in the community\u2019s well being. That, in and of itself, may influence him to continue with his treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The juvenile court also indicated that appellant would have the opportunity to be removed from the registry if he could prove to the court that he was no longer at significant risk of re-offending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">[T]he statute includes an opportunity for someone on the registry to come back before the Court within the five years to modify placement on the registry. If [appellant] is serious about his treatment and he continues in his treatment; and perhaps at some future date, I don\u2019t know what it is, whether it\u2019s six months, or whether it\u2019s two years, or something else entirely, coming off of the depo [lupron]; and he demonstrates pro social activities; and there is perhaps some objective evidence of non-deviant sexual arousal patterns around children; and we have some solid evidence as to what we\u2019re looking at, he has the opportunity to come before the Court within this five year period. I think that is huge leverage in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Thus the juvenile court found \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that [appellant], this young man, is at significant risk [of re-offending] as indicated in the statute,\u201d and, as a result, by Order dated December 27, 2010, placed appellant on the sex offender registry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Appellant timely filed this appeal challenging the juvenile court\u2019s December 27, 2010 Order. Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Maryland Rule 8\u2014131(c) governs the standard of review in juvenile matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">Action tried without a jury. When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Whether the circuit court erred in ordering appellant to register as a sex offender is a question arising under the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the federal and state constitutions. \u201c[W]here an order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, [the appellate court] must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (quoting <em>Garfink v. Cloisters at Charles, Inc., </em>392 Md. 374, 383, 897 A.2d 206 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">I. <em>EX POST FACTO </em>CHALLENGE</p>\n<p id=\"AjG\">(A) <em>Doe I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">In March 2013, the Maryland Court of Appeals decided <em>Doe I. </em>This Court summarized the facts and holding of <em>Doe I </em>in <em>Quispe del Pino v. Maryland Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services, </em>222 Md.App. 44, 112 A.3d 522 (2015):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGy\">The pertinent facts in <em>Doe I </em>are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">In 2006, Doe pled guilty to and was convicted in the Circuit Court for Washington County of a single count of child sexual abuse arising out of an incident involving inappropriate contact with a thirteen-year-old student that occurred during the 1983-84 school year when Doe was a junior high school teacher. Doe was sentenced to ten years incarceration, with all but four and one half years suspended, and three years supervised probation upon his release. Although Doe\u2019s plea agreement did not address registration as a sex offender as one of the conditions of probation, Doe was ordered at sentencing to \u201cregister as a child sex offender.\u201d He was also ordered to pay a $500 fine. Following his sentencing, Doe filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence challenging both the fine and the requirement that he register as a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>sex offender. The Circuit Court agreed with Doe and issued an order striking the fine and the registration requirement. Doe was released from prison in December 2008. On October 1, 2009, Doe\u2019s probation officer directed him to register as a child sex offender. Doe maintained that he did not agree with the requirement, but, against the advice of counsel, he registered as a child sex offender in early October 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">The requirement that Doe register as a sex offender was a result of the 2009 amendment to MSORA retroactively requiring offenders who were convicted on or after October 1, 1995, but committed a sexual offense before that date, to register for the first time. In October 2009, Doe brought a declaratory judgment suit in the circuit court, seeking an order that he was not required to register as a sex offender. Doe argued that a registration requirement would make his plea invalid as involuntary, because he was not informed that he would have to register as a sex offender when he entered into the plea agreement in 2006. The State argued that the requirement did not violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. The trial court agreed with the State and ordered that Doe \u201cshall not be removed from the sex offender registry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">After this Court affirmed the circuit court, the Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>and reversed our decision. In a plurality opinion, the Court of Appeals held that \u201crequiring [Doe] to register as a result of the 2009 and 2010 amendments violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws contained in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d The three-judge plurality explained that \u201cin many contexts,\u201d the Maryland Declaration of Rights offers broader protections than the United States Constitution. The plurality further determined that <em>ex post facto </em>claims under Article 17 should be analyzed by using the \u201cdisadvantage\u201d standard, under which \u201cany law passed after the commission of an offense which ... in relation to that offense, <em>or its consequences, </em>alters the situation of a party to his [or her] disadvantage\u201d violates Article 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Specifically, under the disadvantage standard, \u201cArticle 17 prohibits the retroactive application of laws that have the effect on an offender that is the equivalent of imposing a new criminal sanction or punishment.\u201d The plurality determined that requiring Doe to register had \u201cessentially the same effect\u201d as placing him on probation, that \u201cprobation is a form of a criminal sanction,\u201d and that \u201capplying the statute to [Doe] effectively imposes on him an additional criminal sanction\u201d for a crime committed in the 1980s. The plurality also concluded that the dissemination of Doe\u2019s information pursuant to MSORA was \u201ctantamount to the historical punishment of shaming,\u201d and thus imposed an additional sanction for Doe\u2019s crime. Therefore, according to the plurality, the retroactive application of MSORA to Doe, which had the effect of imposing the additional sanction of probation and shaming, violated the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition contained in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">Judge McDonald (joined by Judge Adkins) concurred with the plurality\u2019s conclusion that the statute violated Article 17, but, in contrast to the plurality, read Article 17 <em>in pari materia </em>with Article I, \u00a7 10 of the United States Constitution. Judge McDonald\u2019s concurrence stated further that \u201cthe cumulative effect of [the] 2009 and 2010 amendments of the State\u2019s sex offender registration law took that law across the line from civil regulation to an element of the punishment of offenders.\u201d Although his concurrence did not expressly state the test that was used, both the language of the concurrence and the two law review articles cited therein lead us to conclude that Judge McDonald analyzed the issue under the \u201cintent-effects test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">The United States Supreme Court explained the \u201cintent-effects\u201d test in <em>Smith v. Doe:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">We must \u201cascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish \u2018civil\u2019 proceedings.\u201d If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>further examine whether the statutory scheme is \u201c \u2018so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State\u2019s] intention\u2019 to deem it \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">Stated another way, the \u201cintent-effects\u201d test requires a reviewing court to engage in a two-part inquiry: \u201cfirst, the court must consider the legislative intent of the statute; second, even if the statute\u2019s stated purpose is non-punitive, the court must assess whether its effect overrides the legislative purpose to render the statute punitive.\u201d Therefore, by declaring that the 2009 and 2010 amendments \u201ctook that law across the line from civil regulation to an element of the punishment of offenders,\u201d Judge McDonald\u2019s concurring opinion found a violation of the State and federal <em>ex post facto </em>clauses under the \u201cintent-effects\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">Judge Harrell, writing separately, concurred in the judgment that Doe was entitled to relief, because his 2006 plea agreement \u201cd[id] not indicate that sex offender registration was a term\u201d of the agreement. Judge Harrell, however, would have denied Doe\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claims under the \u201cintent-effects\u201d test established in <em>Smith v.

Because the <em>Marks </em>Rule directs us to the narrowest ground common to the plurality and the concurrence, Judge McDonald\u2019s interpretation of Article 17 as read <em>in pari mate-ria </em>with the less expansive federal <em>ex post facto </em>clause represents the \u201cposition taken by those Members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds.\u201d <em>See Wilkerson, </em>420 Md. at 594, 24 A.3d 703 (concluding that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence represented the narrowest opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Missouri v.

Thus neither test commanded a majority of the Court. Nevertheless, we decide that the intent-effects test is the proper test to determine whether MSORA violates Article 17 as applied to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The Court of Appeals used the intent-effects test in <em>Young v. State </em>to review a due process challenge to MSORA. 370 Md. 686, 711, 806 A.2d 233 (2002). The Court based its decision to use this test on two Supreme Court cases that employed the intent-effects test to determine whether civil regulations connected to criminal activity could be construed as punishment for double jeopardy and <em>ex post facto </em>purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 711-12 &amp; n. 11, 806 A.2d 233 (referencing <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996) (double jeopardy claim), and <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997) (double jeopardy and <em>ex post facto </em>claims)). Although the plurality opinion in <em>Doe I </em>points to various Maryland cases that have used the disadvantage test in the <em>ex post facto </em>context since the <em>Young </em>decision, <em>Young </em>is the only decision in this jurisdiction prior to <em>Doe I </em>that considered the constitutionality of MSORA specifically. <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 553-55, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion). <em>Young </em>is thus the most relevant precedent available to us in determining which test to use in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">We note, however, that the precedent set in <em>Young </em>extends only to the test to be applied. The <em>Young </em>decision interpreted the 2000 version <em>of </em>MSORA, prior to the enactment of the 2009 and 2010 amendments. <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 690, 806 A.2d 233. As Judge McDonald pointed out in his concurrence in <em>Doe I, </em>the sex offender registration scheme has changed significantly in recent years, and thus an analysis of MSORA under the intent-effects test has changed dramatically. <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 578, 62 A.3d 123 (McDonald, J., concurring). With this point in mind, we turn to the application of MSORA to appellant under <em>Doe I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>(B) Retroactive Application of MSORA to Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">\u201cTo prevail in an <em>ex post facto </em>claim, [appellant] must first show that the law that [he is] challenging applies retroactively to conduct that was completed before the enactment of the law in question____\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Demby, </em>390 Md. 580, 593 n. 10, 890 A.2d 310 (2006) (emphasis omitted). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant entered a plea of involved in June of 2006 to one count of sexual abuse of a minor and two counts of second degree sexual offense. At the time of his plea in 2006, appellant was sixteen years old and, because he was a juvenile, was not required to register as a sex offender in Maryland. <em>See </em>CP 2005 \u00a7 11-704 (lacking a juvenile sex offender registry and not requiring that former juvenile offenders register on the adult sex offender registry upon leaving the jurisdiction of the juvenile court).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In 2009 and 2010, the Maryland General Assembly amended MSORA to require certain juvenile offenders to register as sex offenders once they left the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">(c) <em>Registration by person who was adjudicated delinquent at time of </em>act.\u2014(1) A person who has been adjudicated delinquent for an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a violation of \u00a7 3-303, \u00a7 3-304, \u00a7 3-305, or \u00a7 3-306 of the Criminal Law Article, or \u00a7 3-307(a)(1) or (2) or \u00a7 3-308(b)(l) of the Criminal Law Article involving conduct described in \u00a7 3\u2014301(f)(2) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Criminal Law Article, shall register with the person\u2019s supervising authority if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">(i) the person was a minor who was at least 13 years old at the time the delinquent act was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">(ii) the State\u2019s Attorney or the Department of Juvenile Services requests that the person be required to register;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">(iii) 90 days prior to the time the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over the person terminates under \u00a7 3-8A-07 of the Courts Article, the court, after a hearing, determines under a clear and convincing evidence standard that the person is at significant risk of committing a sexually violent offense or an offense for which registration as a tier II sex offender or tier III sex offender is required; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">(iv) the person is at least 18 years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">The framework of CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) clearly applies to appellant. He was adjudicated delinquent of second degree sexual offense, which is prohibited by Section 3-306 of the Criminal Law Article;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he was over thirteen years old at the time of the offense; the State requested that appellant be required to register as a sex offender; the juvenile court determined by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was at significant risk of re-offending; and appellant was over eighteen years old when his registration began.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The 2010 amendments to MSORA also state that \u201cthis subtitle shall be applied retroactively to include a person who ... is under the custody or supervision of a supervising authority on October 1, 2010.\u201d CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-702.1(a)(l). \u201cSupervising authority\u201d is defined as, among other entities, \u201cthe Secretary of Juvenile Services, if the registrant was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>minor at the time the act was committed for which registration is required.\u201d CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-701(n)(10). On October 1, 2010, appellant was on probation under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Services, as well as under the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. While on probation, appellant was subject to ongoing review hearings before the juvenile court and active home electronic monitoring; he was required to attend various treatment clinics, to submit to frequent and random drug tests, and to meet regularly with his juvenile probation officer. Appellant was therefore clearly \u201cunder the custody or supervision of a supervising authority on October 1, 2010.\u201d CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014702.1(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Because the 2010 amendments apply retroactively, and appellant was subject to the requirements of CP 2010 \u00a7 11-704(c) based on conduct that occurred in 2005, prior to the 2010 amendments, we conclude that appellant has satisfied the first step in an <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. <em>See Demby, </em>390 Md. at 593 n. 10, 890 A.2d 310. We next turn to whether the application of CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) to appellant violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws in light of <em>Doe I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">(C) Intent-Effects Test</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Appellant contends that he is entitled to relief based on the <em>Doe I </em>Court\u2019s conclusion that the retroactive application of MSORA is unlawful. Arguing that Doe and appellant were both subject to \u201cpunishment\u201d under MSORA, appellant contends that nothing distinguishes his case from the <em>Doe I </em>plurality and Judge McDonald\u2019s concurring opinion. Although we note some similarities in the two cases, we conclude that the retroactive application of MSORA as applied to appellant is not \u201cpunishment\u201d under the intent-effects test, and therefore is not a violation of the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws contained in Article 17. We shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">1. Legislative Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">As stated above, to determine whether MSORA violates the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>laws, we apply the intent-effects test. The intent-effects test is a two-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">We must ascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish civil proceedings. If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further examine whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the State\u2019s] intention to deem it civil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\"><em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003) (alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Wjhere a legislative restriction is an incident of the State\u2019s power to protect the health and safety of its citizens, it will be considered as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power, and not a purpose to add to the punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93-94, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Although no statement of purpose is expressly set forth in MSORA, its history and language suggest that it is not intended to be punitive. In <em>Young, </em>the Court of Appeals discussed the legislative purpose of a previous version of MSORA, then set forth in former Article 27, \u00a7 792:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">As enacted, \u00a7 792 contained no express statement of purpose. Although it was placed within Article 27 and recodi-fied in the Criminal Procedure Article, its location within the criminal procedure laws does not necessarily indicate an intent on the part of the General Assembly to <em>punish </em>sex offenders.... Therefore, in examining the purpose of the statute, we look primarily to the plain language. With respect to the determination of legislative intent, we conclude that the plain language and overall design of \u00a7 792 clearly indicate that it was not intended as punishment, but rather was intended as a regulatory requirement aimed at protection of the public. There is no indication in the statutory scheme that the General Assembly intended regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>tration or notification as a device to punish convicted sex offenders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">370 Md. at 712, 806 A.2d 233 (italics in original). When the requirement of registration for certain juvenile sex offenders was added to MSORA by the 2009 amendment, there was nothing in the language of that provision, nor in its legislative history, to indicate a legislative intent different from that which was articulated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Young. See </em>2009 Md. Laws, Chap. 524. We therefore conclude that CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(e) is intended to be civil, rather than penal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">2. Punishment or Non-Punitive Effect</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The intent-effects test next directs us to determine whether the statute\u2019s effect \u201coverrides the legislative purpose to render the statute punitive.\u201d <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 570, 62 A.3d 123 (Harrell, J., concurring) (footnote omitted). Factors derived from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kennedy v. Mendozar-Martinez </em>assist us in analyzing whether an otherwise regulatory statute becomes punitive. 372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963). These factors include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, [2] whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment^ 3] whether it comes into play only on a finding of <em>scienter, </em>[4] whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution and deterrence, [5] whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, [6] whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and [7] whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554 (footnotes omitted). In <em>Doe I, </em>Judge McDonald concluded that \u201cthe cumulative effect of [the] 2009 and 2010 amendments ... took that law across the line from civil regulation to an element of the punishment of offenders.\u201d 430 Md. at 578, 62 A.3d 123 (McDonald, J., concurring). The question before us is whether the cumulative effect of the MSORA amendments regarding juvenile sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>offenders codified in CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) has caused the statute to cross the line drawn in <em>Doe I. </em>We conclude that the statute has not crossed such line.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">(a) Affirmative disability or restraint</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We turn first to whether MSORA involves an affirmative disability or restraint. Appellant argues that many of the registration requirements outlined in <em>Doe I </em>are also applicable to him, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">[R]eport[ing] in person to law enforcement every three months, giv[ing] notice to law enforcement of his address and any changes of address, and notifying] law enforcement before being away from his home for more than seven days. Furthermore, he must disclose to the State a significant amount of information, some of which is highly personal, including: his employment address; information about his conviction; his social security number; his email address and computer log-in names; information about vehicles he often uses, including those not owned by him; his finger prints and palm prints; all \u201cidentifying factors, including a physical description,\u201d and an updated digital image of himself. Additionally, other than to vote, [appellant] is prohibited from entering onto real property that is used as a school or a family child care center ... without first obtaining permission. If [appellant] fails to comply with these requirements, he faces terms of imprisonment, depending on the violation, of up to three or five years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\"><em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 562, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The State counters that, despite these significant requirements, appellant\u2019s situation is distinguishable from <em>Doe I. </em>As the State correctly points out, appellant\u2019s \u201cperiod of registration is much less than that required of Tier III offenders who committed similar offenses after they reached the age of majority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Appellant was adjudicated delinquent by the juvenile court for committing two counts of second degree sexual offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Because of appellant\u2019s adjudication as a delinquent, appellant\u2019s registration term is limited to five years. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 11-707(a)(4)(iv). If appellant had been charged with second degree sexual offense as an adult, however, he would have been categorized as a Tier III offender and thus would have been subject to a lifelong registration requirement. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7\u00a7 11\u2014701(q)(l)(ii), \u2014707(a)(4)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Both Doe and appellant experienced an increase in the length of their respective registration requirements as a result of the 2009 and 2010 MSORA amendments. Doe\u2019s registration requirements, which initially did not exist, automatically increased to lifelong registration. <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 540, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion). Appellant\u2019s registration requirements, which initially did not exist, increased to a five-year period of registration after the juvenile court determined that appellant was at significant risk of re-offending, but also allowed appellant to petition the court to reduce his registration term. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4)(iv). The difference between the length of Doe\u2019s and appellant\u2019s registration terms is stark, and only a former juvenile sex offender has the opportunity to be removed from the sex offender registry prior to the expiration of his registration term.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, because any period of registration imposed on appellant constitutes an affirmative disability, and the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition applies to any increase in punishment or sanction, <em>see Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798), we conclude that the first factor weighs in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">(b) Historical perspective</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Second, we consider whether the regulation has been regarded historically as punishment. As the plurality in <em>Doe I </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>noted, \u201crequiring [Doe] to register has essentially the same effect on his life as placing him on probation. It is well-settled in this State that probation is a form of a criminal sanction.\u201d 430 Md. at 561, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion). In addition, according to the plurality, \u201cthe dissemination of [Doe\u2019s] information ... is tantamount to the historical punishment of shaming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion). Appellant\u2019s status as a Tier III sex offender, a color photo, his current home and employment addresses, his vehicle description and information, his physical features, and information about his offenses are all published on the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services\u2019 website for the public to see. <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., <em>Maryland SOR Search, </em>http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/sorSearch/search. do (last visited Sept. 9, 2015). As appellant points out, \u201c[t]he purpose of keeping [juvenile] records confidential is to further the rehabilitation of young offenders by relieving them of the enduring stigma of their misconduct.\u201d <em>See District of Columbia v. Cooper, </em>483 A.2d 317, 323 (D.C.1984). Publishing information about former juvenile sex offenders on a public website hardly provides confidentiality, and instead creates the \u201cenduring stigma of their misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in light of the plurality opinion in <em>Doe I </em>that the requirement of registration is similar to probation and the dissemination of offender information resembles shaming, the second factor weighs in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">(c) <em>Scienter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Next, we turn to whether the statute \u201ccomes into play only on a finding of <em>scienter.\u201d Mendoza-Martinez, 372 </em>U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. 554. CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014704(c)(1)(iii) requires the juvenile court to determine, by clear and convincing evidence, that the juvenile sex offender \u201cis at significant risk of committing a sexually violent offense or an offense for which registration as a tier II sex offender or tier III sex offender is required\u201d before ordering the offender to register. A determination that the juvenile sex offender is at significant risk of re-offending logically implies that the juvenile court must find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>a significant risk of future criminal intent on the part of the juvenile offender. Such finding of <em>scienter </em>differentiates CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) from the adult registration requirements, which \u201cappl[y] to individuals convicted of any of the enumerated offenses, without regard to the offender\u2019s state of mind.\u201d <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 715, 806 A.2d 233. Because \u201c[t]he existence of a scienter requirement is customarily an important element in distinguishing criminal from civil statutes,\u201d we determine that this factor also weighs in favor of appellant. <em>See Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 362, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">(d) Promotion of traditional aims of punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The fourth factor asks us to consider \u201cwhether [MSORA\u2019s] operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014 retribution and deterrence.\u201d <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. 554. Because MSORA is intended to be only a civil regulation, we cannpt conclude that the statute promotes retribution. <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 93-94, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (\u201c[W]here a legislative restriction is an incident of the State\u2019s power to protect the health and safety of its citizens, it will be considered as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power, and not a purpose to add to the punishment.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Although not retributive, MSORA is intended to deter the commission of future sex crimes. <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 102, 123 S.Ct. 1140; <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 712, 806 A.2d 233. MSORA\u2019s requirements of reporting, notification, and disclosure to law enforcement serve a deterrent function by continually reminding the registrant of the ever-present interest of law enforcement in the registrant\u2019s behavior. <em>See Young, </em>370 Md. at 712, 806 A.2d 233. Moreover, as noted above, the public dissemination of offenders\u2019 information is similar to shaming, and thus acts to deter past offenders from re-offending, and may deter future offenders who are aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the public consequences of sexual offenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 564, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion). A deterrent purpose, however, does not alone render the statute punitive. <em>See Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 102, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (\u201cTo hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions criminal ... would severely undermine the Government\u2019s ability to engage in effective regulation.\u201d (alterations in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 715, 806 A.2d 233 (\u201cEven an obvious deterrent purpose, however, does not make the law punitive, in as much as deterrence can serve both civil and criminal goals.\u201d). We also note that MSORA promotes public safety as much as it operates to deter potential offenders from committing sexual crimes. <em>See Young, </em>370 Md. at 712, 806 A.2d 233. Because MSORA has both civil and deterrent purposes, but certainly is not intended to promote retribution, we conclude that the fourth factor is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">(e) Criminal nature of the behavior</p>\n<p id=\"A1I\">Next, we consider whether the behavior to which MSORA applies is criminal. Although sex offender registration has a clear prerequisite of having committed an enumerated criminal sexual offense, the State suggests that, in the case of juvenile sex offenders, the registration requirement does not result from a criminal conviction, but instead from the juvenile court\u2019s registration order. According to the State, \u201c[i]n contrast to the consequences attendant to criminal convictions, the purposes of the Juvenile Causes Act are not penal and juvenile delinquency proceedings in Maryland are conducted under a separate system of law, civil in nature.\u201d Appellant responds that, although juvenile cases are technically civil, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>criminal, the nature of a juvenile proceeding does not affect the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">We agree with appellant and conclude that the origin of the case <em>sub judice </em>in a juvenile, rather than in criminal court, is \u201ca distinction without a difference.\u201d <em>In re Antonette H., </em>200 Md.App. 341, 344 n. 1, 27 A.3d 616 (2011). \u201c[0]nly a prosecutor can initiate juvenile delinquency proceedings [and the] proceeding is a prosecution in lieu of criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Anthony W., </em>388 Md. 251, 266, 879 A.2d 717 (2005) (citations omitted). In addition, Maryland courts have recognized that juveniles in delinquency proceedings are afforded many of the same constitutional and common law rights as adults in criminal proceedings. <em>See, e.g., In re </em>Thomas. J., 372 Md. 50, 57-59, 811 A.2d 310 (2002). Therefore, we conclude that, regardless of whether the offender is a juvenile or an adult, the behavior to which MSORA applies is criminal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">However, \u201cthis factor alone is not sufficient to render a regulatory statute punitive.\u201d <em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 714, 806 A.2d 233; <em>see also Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. at 362, 117 S.Ct. 2072. The Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">There are many occasions when legislatures attach both criminal and civil sanctions to the same act or omission. The fact that the statute is triggered by a criminal conviction does not undermine the Legislature\u2019s intent to create a sex offender registry to aid in the civil purpose____Thus, although the connection between sex offender registration and past criminal behavior is clear, we accord only limited weight to this factor in light of the equally strong connection between registration and legitimate civil purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\"><em>Young, </em>370 Md. at 714, 806 A.2d 233. Although MSORA applies to past criminal conduct in the case of a juvenile sex offender placed on the registry, the legislative intent to create a civil regulatory scheme is a weighty counterbalance. <em>See id. </em>Balancing the clear connections between criminal conduct and registration with the civil regulatory intent of the legislature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>we conclude that this factor weighs slightly in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">(f) Alternative purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Turning to the sixth factor, it is clear, as noted above, that the 2009 and 2010 amendments to MSORA have a purpose other than punishment. The statute\u2019s goal is remedial in nature and \u201cserves the important nonpunitive goal of alerting law enforcement and the community to the presence of sexual predators who may reoffend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 806 A.2d 283. Although the <em>Young </em>decision discusses the purpose of a previous version of MSORA, and does not specifically address the registration of juvenile sex offenders who reach the age of majority, this general statement of purpose, in our view, is applicable to the entire amended Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The public safety purpose of MSORA is especially apparent in the juvenile context. The registration statute requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing to determine whether juvenile sex offenders are at significant risk of re-offending, and thus only offenders who continue to threaten public safety are ordered to register. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014704(c). Because the legislature clearly intended sex offender registration as a public safety mechanism, the sixth factor weighs in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">(g) Excessive nature of sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Finally, we consider whether the sanction of MSORA is excessive despite its non-punitive purpose. This factor weighs the heaviest in our determination of whether MSORA, as applied to juvenile sex offenders placed on the sex offender registry, crosses the line from a civil regulation to a criminal punishment. <em>See, e.g., Wallace v. State, </em>905 N.E.2d 371, 383 (Ind.2009) (affording the final <em>Mendozar-Martinez </em>factor \u201cconsiderable weight,\u201d and citing cases from three other jurisdictions that found this factor to be the most significant). For reasons set forth below, we hold that the registration requirements are not excessive as applied to juvenile sex offenders who are placed on the registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Juvenile offenders who are adjudicated delinquent of a variety of sexual offenses, including a second degree sexual offense as appellant was here, may be required to register upon leaving the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c). Before any juvenile sex offender is placed on the registry, the State\u2019s Attorney or the Department of Juvenile Services must submit a request to the juvenile court that the subject juvenile be required to register. CP 2010 \u00a7 11-704(c)(l)(ii). In addition, the court must determine, after a hearing at least ninety days prior to termination of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over the juvenile, that \u201cunder a clear and convincing evidence standard!,] the person is at significant risk of committing a sexually violent offense or an offense for which registration as a tier II sex offender or tier III sex offender is required.\u201d CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014704(c)(1)(iii). The court may also order an evaluation of the juvenile to aid in its decision. CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014704(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">If the juvenile court decides that the juvenile sex offender should be placed on the registry, the court may order registration for a period of <em>up to </em>five years. CP 2010 \u00a7 11-707(a)(4)(iv). Thus the court has discretion to determine the actual period of the registration, but not more than five years. The court may also reduce the registration term originally ordered if the registrant requests a reduction, and the court agrees to such request.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In contrast, adult sex offenders are automatically placed on the registry if they have been convicted of an enumerated offense. CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(a). They are provided no hearing or individualized assessment to determine whether they pose a continuing threat to society. Tier I offenders are required to register for fifteen years; Tier II offenders for twenty-five years; and Tier III offenders register for life. CP 2010 \u00a7 11-707(a)(4). Except for a reversal, vacation, set aside, or pardon of the underlying conviction, Tier II and Tier III offenders have no process by which to remove their names from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>registry or to reduce the terms of their registration. CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(b). Tier I offenders shall have their registration term reduced to ten years, but only if, during those ten years, the registrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">(1) is not convicted of any offense for which a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year may be imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">(2) is not convicted of any sex offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">(3) successfully completes, without revocation, any period of supervised release, parole, or probation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">(4) successfully completes an appropriate sex offender treatment program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-707(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">One aspect of MSORA that was important to the holding of a violation of the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws by the Court of Appeals in <em>Doe I </em>and by this Court in <em>Quispe del Pino </em>was the automatic imposition of the registration requirement because of a conviction for a particular sex crime. <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 568, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion); <em>Quispe del Pino, </em>222 Md.App. at 61, 112 A.3d 522. At the conclusion of the plurality opinion in <em>Doe I, </em>Judge Greene wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">Registration was imposed, over twenty years later in 2009, under the sex offender registration statute as a direct consequence of [Doe\u2019s] commission and conviction for his sex crime. The application of the statute has essentially the same effect upon [Doe\u2019s] life as placing him on probation and imposing the punishment of shaming for life, and is, thus, tantamount to imposing an additional sanction for [Doe\u2019s] crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">430 Md. at 568, 62 A.3d 123 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">In <em>Quispe del Pino, </em>this Court made a similar observation concerning the operation of MSORA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-15\">[T]he retroactive application of the 2010 amendment automatically subjects appellant to registration under MSORA for a period of time, fifteen years, during which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>time he otherwise would not have been subject to <em>any </em>of the statute\u2019s requirements, restrictions, or public dissemination of private information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">222 Md.App. at 61, 112 A.3d 522 (italics in original) (bold emphasis added). Thus a statutory scheme, like the one to which appellant is subject, that does not automatically impose a registration requirement, but mandates a court finding, based upon clear and convincing evidence adduced at a hearing, of a significant risk of re-offending, is more consistent with the regulatory purpose of MSORA than with any punitive effect. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In states that have reviewed <em>ex post facto </em>challenges to retroactive sex offender registration schemes, whether the requirement of registration is based on an individualized assessment of the offender and whether the offender has the possibility of reducing his registration term have proved to be important considerations. Courts have held retroactive registration statutes not violative of the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws based, at least in part, upon the requirement of an individualized assessment of an offender to justify placement on the registry and the opportunity for an offender to seek reduction in the term of registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In <em>Doe v. Pataki, </em>the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reviewed the retroactive application of New York State\u2019s sex offender law and determined that the statute did not constitute punishment under an <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. 120 F.3d 1263, 1265 (2d Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1122, 118 S.Ct. 1066, 140 L.Ed.2d 126 (1998). Under New York law, persons subject to registration as a result of a conviction for a sexual offense are evaluated by a panel of experts on behavior and treatment of sex offenders for the offenders\u2019 \u201crisk of recidivism\u201d and \u201cthe degree of harm [that the offender] potentially presents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268. The evaluation occurs only when the offender is released, discharged, or paroled. <em>Id. </em>The sentencing court uses the evaluation to determine an appropriate length of the offender\u2019s registration term, and the amount of information the offender must provide. <em>Id. </em>at 1268-69. The offender may also challenge the expert\u2019s recommendation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>and appear at the registration hearing with counsel. <em>Id. </em>After he or she is placed on the registry, the offender continues to have the ability to petition the court for relief from the registration requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 1282. Due to the relief available to registrants and the individualized assessment each offender is provided prior to being placed on the registry, the Second Circuit concluded that the statute remained a regulatory measure rather than a punitive sanction. <em>Id. </em>at 1281-83; <em>see also Cutshall v. Sundquist, </em>193 F.3d 466, 474, 477 (6th Cir.1999) (finding no <em>ex post facto </em>violation where law enforcement officials have the discretion to disclose registry information only when necessary to protect the public), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1053, 120 S.Ct. 1554, 146 L.Ed.2d 460 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">By contrast, where registration schemes do not provide individualized risk assessments or an opportunity for offenders to be relieved of registration requirements, our sister jurisdictions have held that retroactive registration violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. In <em>Wallace, </em>the Indiana Supreme Court determined that, \u201cif [sex offender] registration and disclosure [of offenders\u2019 information] are not tied to a finding that the safety of the public is threatened, there is an implication that the Act is excessive.\u201d 905 N.E.2d at 383. In addition, the Court stated that \u201cwe think it significant for this excessiveness inquiry that the Act provides no mechanism by which a registered sex offender can petition the court for relief from the obligation of continued registration and disclosure. Offenders cannot shorten their registration or notification period, even on the clearest proof of rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384 (footnote omitted). Based on the excessiveness of retroactive registration when no individual assessment is provided and registrants have no avenue for relief from registration, the Court concluded that Indiana\u2019s registration law was punitive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Maine\u2019s high court came to the same conclusion in <em>State v. Letalien, </em>985 A.2d 4 (Me.2009). In <em>Letalien, </em>a clinical psychologist performed a sex offender risk assessment on the appellee and determined that he presented \u201cthe lowest possible risk of reoffending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. However, because Letalien\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>crime triggered a mandatory registration requirement, he was ordered to register as a sex offender. <em>Id. </em>At the time of his offense, Letalien was required to register for fifteen years, but he could petition for a waiver of the registration requirements after his first five years of registration. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Years later, Maine\u2019s registration law was amended, and as a result, Letal-ien was required to register for the duration of his life without the possibility of a waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 10. These changes caused the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine to conclude that the amended statute violated the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, stating that the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">does not allow for a waiver of its requirements, nor does it condition an offender\u2019s duty to register or verify on an individualized determination of the offender\u2019s risk of re-offending; rather, its requirements are mandatory and attach strictly as a consequence of the conviction of a crime identified by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The highest courts of Ohio, Alaska, and Kentucky all have reached the same conclusion as the Indiana and Maine courts. In <em>State v. Williams, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio decided that, because \u201call the registration requirements apply without regard to the future dangerousness of the sex offender,\u201d retroactive application of sex offender registration requirements violated the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. 129 Ohio St.3d 344, 952 N.E.2d 1108, 1113 (2011). In Alaska, the Supreme Court pointed to the registrant\u2019s inability to petition the trial court for relief from the registration and disclosure obligations under Alaska\u2019s sex offender registration law as an important part of its holding that retroactive registration violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause in the state constitution. <em>Doe v. State, </em>189 P.3d 999, 1017 (Alaska 2008). Finally, the Supreme Court of Kentucky stated that, \u201c[w]hen a restriction is imposed equally upon all offenders, with no consideration given to how dangerous any particular registrant may be to public safety, that restriction begins to look far more like retribution for past offenses than a regulation intended to prevent future ones.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Baker, </em>295 S.W.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>437, 444 (Ky.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>559 U.S. 992, 130 S.Ct. 1738, 176 L.Ed.2d 213 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In Maryland, juveniles adjudicated delinquent of certain sex offenses by the juvenile court are provided the same safeguards that our sister jurisdictions found important to upholding the retroactive registration laws against <em>ex post facto </em>challenges. As stated above, the State\u2019s Attorney or the Department of Juvenile Services must request that the juvenile sex offender be placed on the registry. CP 2010 \u00a7 11-704(c)(l)(ii). Once the request for registration is made, the juvenile court is charged with determining, after a hearing, whether the juvenile sex offender is \u201cat significant risk\u201d of re-offending based on clear and convincing evidence. CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014704(c)(1) (iii). To aid in its assessment, the court can request an individualized evaluation of the offender. CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c)(4). Finally, if the juvenile sex offender is determined to be at significant risk of re-offending and placed on the registry, the juvenile court can decide the term of registration, up to a maximum of five years. CP 2010 \u00a7 11-707(a)(4)(iv). Thereafter, the former juvenile sex offender can petition the juvenile court for a reduction of the registration term. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant was afforded all of the protections set forth in CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c). The juvenile court ordered an independent evaluation of appellant and spent two days taking testimony in order to determine whether appellant was at significant risk of re-offending. Based on the evidence admitted, the court determined, based on clear and convincing evidence, that appellant was at significant risk of re-offending, and ordered him to register for five years. The court even reminded appellant of the opportunity to have his registration requirement reviewed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">If [appellant] is serious about his treatment and he continues in his treatment; and perhaps at some future date, I don\u2019t know what it is, whether it\u2019s six months, or whether it\u2019s two years, or something else entirely, coming off of the depo; and he demonstrates pro social activities; and there is perhaps some objective evidence of non-deviant sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>arousal patterns around children; and we have some solid evidence as to what we\u2019re looking at, he has the opportunity to come before the Court within this five year period. I think that is huge leverage in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Appellant was thus afforded, and reminded of, all the safeguards available to juvenile sex offenders prior to and after placement on the sex offender registry. Those same safeguards lead us to conclude that retroactive application of MSORA to appellant is not excessive given the regulatory purpose of sex offender registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">(D) Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Reviewing the <em>Mendozctr-Martinez </em>factors together, we conclude that, although the requirement of registration imposes an affirmative disability on appellant, has been regarded historically as punishment, carries the element of <em>scienter, </em>and applies to behavior that is criminal in nature, these disadvantages are outweighed by the public safety purpose of MSORA and the process afforded juvenile sex offenders both before and after being ordered to register. MSORA requires an individualized assessment of a juvenile sex offender, under a clear and convincing evidence standard, before placement on the sex offender registry, and the opportunity to seek a reduction in the term of registration. By contrast, MSORA requires all adults convicted of certain sexual offenses to register as sex offenders for a specified term regardless of their continuing threat to society. Therefore, the placement of some juvenile sex offenders on the sex offender register is explicitly tied to the regulatory purpose of sex offender registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">\u201cBecause we ordinarily defer to the legislature\u2019s stated intent, only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>538 U.S. at 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). That \u201cclearest proof\u2019 of a criminal penalty is not present here, and thus retroactive registration for juvenile sex offenders remains a civil remedy. Therefore, retroactive application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>MSORA as applied to juvenile sex offenders under CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014704(c) does not violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws under Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as read <em>in pari materia </em>with the U.S. Constitution. Because MSORA is constitutional as applied to appellant, we decline to grant him the relief he seeks on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">II. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF THE PLEA AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Appellant contends that, even if the retroactive application of CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) to him does not violate the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, he should be entitled to specific performance of his plea agreement, which did not require that he register as a sex offender. Relying on Judge Harrell\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Doe I, </em>appellant points out that he could not have been required to register at the time of his plea, because no such requirement existed in 2006. As a result, appellant argues that no reasonable person \u201ccould possibly have believed that registration would be part of the plea,\u201d and thus specific enforcement of his plea, which did not include registration, is required. Appellant contends that not enforcing the plea \u201cwould create a dangerous precedent allowing the State to add additional terms to a plea agreement at its whim anytime there was no specific mention of those terms made during the plea agreement.\u201d Finally, appellant argues that not enforcing his plea creates a disincentive for others to enter into plea agreements. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">In <em>Doe I, </em>Judge Harrell argued that, under <em>Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568, 7 A.3d 557 (2010), \u201c[djetermining the meaning of a sentencing term in a plea agreement requires strict adherence to the \u2018four corners\u2019 of the plea agreement as established in the Maryland Rule 4-243 plea proceeding and to \u2018due process concerns for fairness and adequacy of procedural safeguards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 576, 62 A.3d 123 (Harrell, J., concurring) (quoting <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 580-81, 7 A.3d 557). The petitioner in <em>Cuffley </em>agreed to a plea deal wherein he pled guilty to robbery in exchange for a sentence within the sentencing guidelines of four to eight years. <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 574, 7 A.3d 557. The trial court accepted Cuffley\u2019s plea and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>agreed to be bound by its terms. <em>Id. </em>At the disposition hearing several months later, however, the trial court sentenced Cuffley to fifteen years\u2019 incarceration, suspending all but six years. <em>Id. </em>Cuffley filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence, arguing that the sentence violated his plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 7 A.3d 557. The Court of Appeals agreed with Cuffley, and concluded that a defendant must reasonably understand the terms of his sentence as they are presented in the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 581-82, 7 A.3d 557. Based on the decision in <em>Cuffley, </em>Judge Harrell stated in <em>Doe I </em>that, \u201c[assuming that a registration term would be included in an agreement at Doe\u2019s 2006 plea hearing, a reasonable person in Doe\u2019s position likely would understand that registering as a sex offender was not a part of the agreement.\u201d <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 576, 62 A.3d 123 (Harrell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Judge Barbera (now Chief Judge) disagreed with Judge Harrell, arguing that <em>\u201cCuffley </em>plainly does not apply to the case before us. <em>Cuffley </em>and the rule emanating from it focus on \u2018the meaning of the <em>sentencing term,\u2019 </em>and \u2018what the defendant reasonably understood to be the <em>sentence.\u2019 \u201d Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 598-99, 62 A.3d 123 (Barbera, J., dissenting) (italics in original) (quoting <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 582, 7 A.3d 557). Because sex offender registration is \u201cimposed mandatorily by operation of law,\u201d Judge Barbera stated that sex offender registration is a collateral consequence of a plea, and not part of the sentence imposed by the trial court. <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 600, 62 A.3d 123 (Barbera, J., dissenting). Judge Barbera concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">[t]he requirement that [Doe] register as a sex offender likewise had no effect on the ultimate range of punishment he faced upon conviction. Because sex offender registration is not punishment, but a collateral consequence of a conviction, it was not required to be included as part of [Doe\u2019s] plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">In <em>Sinclair v. State, </em>this Court held that sex offender registration is a collateral consequence of a conviction. 199 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Md.App. 130, 135, 20 A.3d 192 (2011). In 2006, Sinclair pled guilty to child abuse that was sexual in nature and that had occurred from 1989 through 1994. <em>Id. </em>at 132-33, 20 A.3d 192. He was sentenced to four years of house arrest, with all but one year suspended, and was placed on probation for five years. <em>Id. </em>The probation order did not include a requirement that Sinclair register as a sex offender. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">With the enactment of the 2009 MSORA amendments, however, child sex offenders \u201cconvicted on or after October 1, 1995, of an offense committed before October 1, 1995,\u201d were required to begin registering. CP 2009 \u00a7 ll-702.1(c)(l)(ii). If offenders did not register, they were subject to criminal prosecution. CP 2009 \u00a7 ll-721(b), (c). In response to the amended law and its retroactive application, Sinclair filed a motion, in the criminal case where he was convicted of the sexual offense, requesting a judicial determination that he not be required to register. <em>Sinclair, </em>199 Md.App. at 134, 20 A.3d 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We denied Sinclair\u2019s request. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 20 A.3d 192. Although noting that relief by way of a declaratory judgment may be obtained prior to actual criminal prosecution when the constitutionality of a statute is at issue and violation of the statute carries criminal sanctions, we nonetheless concluded that \u201cMaryland law does not recognize the filing of a declaratory judgment action in a criminal cause, even if the object of the declaratory judgment action is to obtain a ruling concerning a collateral consequence of the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 140, 20 A.3d 192<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In reaching our decision, we stated that \u201c[t]he thrust of Sinclair\u2019s motion is not collaterally to challenge his conviction that has long since been final and unappealable. His statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>construction point is directed to a collateral consequence of the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 20 A.3d 192. Implicit in this conclusion was that sex offender registration was not a part of Sinclair\u2019s original plea and conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 135-36, 20 A.3d 192. Instead, it was collateral to the criminal action. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 20 A.3d 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Maryland Rule 4-242(f) now expressly categorizes sex offender registration as a collateral consequence of a guilty plea. Appellant correctly notes that Rule 4-242(f) requires that the defendant be advised of a plea\u2019s collateral consequences, including sex offender registration, before the court accepts the plea. However, the Rule also states that \u201c[t]he omission of advice concerning the collateral consequences of a plea does not itself mandate that the plea be declared invalid.\u201d Md. Rule 4\u2014242(f). Indeed, the Court of Appeals has determined that only when direct consequences of a plea are not explained to a defendant will the plea be rendered involuntary. <em>Yoswick v. State, </em>347 Md. 228, 239-40, 700 A.2d 251 (1997). In <em>Yoswick, </em>the Court of Appeals held that a guilty plea was not rendered involuntary even though the trial court did not inform the defendant that, \u201cin order to become eligible for parole, he had to first serve fifteen years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 241, 700 A.2d 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Turning to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we recognize that appellant\u2019s plea agreement did not include a registration requirement. Appellant contends that, because his plea did not mention registration, specific performance of that plea mandates that he not be required to register. Because the plea did not need to include sex offender registration, which is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea, appellant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Moreover, specific performance of a plea agreement only entitles appellant to either the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d or a withdrawal of the plea.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 583, 7 A.3d 557. According to appellant, the benefit of the bargain in his plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>agreement means that he is not required to register. The plea agreement\u2019s silence as to the issue of registration, however, did not suggest whether appellant would or would not be subject to a sex offender registration requirement. The juvenile court\u2019s order in 2010 that appellant register as a sex offender therefore did not violate his plea agreement. <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 601, 62 A.3d 123 (Barbera, J., dissenting). Appellant\u2019s registration obligation is, again, simply a collateral consequence of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In sum, \u201c[bjecause sex offender registration is not punishment, but a collateral consequence of a conviction, it was not required to be included as part of [appellant\u2019s] plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600, 62 A.3d 123 (Barbera, J., dissenting). Therefore, the lack of any reference to a requirement for sex offender registration in appellant\u2019s plea agreement cannot serve as a basis for implying a term in the plea agreement that appellant not be required to register as a sex offender. In other words, there is nothing in appellant\u2019s plea agreement for the trial court to specifically enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Finally, we move to appellant\u2019s last two arguments. First, we disagree with appellant that a decision not to \u201cenforce\u201d appellant\u2019s plea as he desires will allow \u201cthe State to add additional terms to a plea agreement at its whim anytime there was no specific mention of those terms made during the plea agreement.\u201d We initially note that the State <em>cannot </em>add additional terms to a plea agreement that are direct consequences of a criminal conviction. <em>See Yoswick, </em>347 Md. at 240, 700 A.2d 251. In the case of collateral consequences, Rule 4-242(f) specifically refers to two collateral consequences\u2014immigration consequences and sex offender registry consequences. These consequences are beyond the power of the State to change, because they are imposed by the federal courts and agencies under federal law or they apply automatically by operation of Maryland law. In addition, in the case of juvenile sex offenders, the collateral consequence of registration is only a requirement after a hearing in which the judge must find by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is at significant risk of re-offending. CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c). The proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>required to meet a clear and convincing evidence standard can hardly be described as allowing the State to add terms \u201cat its whim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Second, we disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that not \u201cenforcing\u201d appellant\u2019s plea deal \u201ccreates a strong disincentive for defendants to plead guilty.\u201d As previously stated, juvenile sex offenders, like appellant, cannot be placed on the sex offender registry unless, after a hearing, the juvenile court finds, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the juvenile offender is at significant risk of committing a sexually violent offense or a Tier II or III offense. CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c). Therefore, the lack of notification that sex offender registration would be possible in appellant\u2019s 2006 plea does not create a disincentive for others to enter plea agreements today.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY, SITTING AS A JUVENILE COURT, DATED DECEMBER 27, 2010 AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">. On October 31, 2006, appellant proceeded by way of a not involved plea based upon an agreed statement of facts, and the juvenile court found him involved on a charge of sexual abuse of a minor as to a different victim. Although the cases were considered together for the purpose of review hearings monitoring Nick H.'s progress, the juvenile court's order that is the subject of this instant appeal relates only to the offenses involved in the June 27, 2006 plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\">.

Appellant\u2019s original questions, as presented in his brief, are:</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">1. Given the highly punitive and restrictive nature of Maryland's newly enacted sex offender registration laws, does their retroactive application violate the federal constitutional ban on <em>ex post facto </em>laws and both clauses of Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights prohibiting <em>ex post facto </em>laws and <em>ex post facto </em>restrictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">2. Given that the plea agreement entered into by Nick H. did not, and indeed could not, contemplate registering as a sex offender, is he entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">Appellant submitted these questions prior to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Doe v. Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services, </em>430 Md. 535, 62 A.3d 123 (2013) <em>(\u201cDoe I\"), </em>and did not submit any additional questions in his supplemental brief responding to the <em>Doe I </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\">. As a result of the 2010 amendments, a separate registry for juvenile sex offenders who were still under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court was also created. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2010 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 11-704.1 of the Criminal Procedure Article. This section does not apply to appellant, however, and will not be considered here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b702-11\">.

Although Judge Harrell concurred in <em>Doe I, </em>his opinion is not included in a <em>Marks </em>analysis, because his reasoning, that Doe's plea agreement precluded any obligation to register, is not part of the common point of agreement between the majority of judges. <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 576-77, 62 A.3d 123 (Harrell, J., concurring); <em>see also A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc. v.

The 2009 amendment first provided for the possibility that juvenile offenders register as sex offenders once they left the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. See CP 2009 \u00a7 ll-704(c). Although the phrasing of the registration requirement for juveniles aging out of the juvenile system changed in 2010, the content did not. <em>Compare </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) <em>with </em>CP 2009 \u00a7 ll-704(c). Because CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c) is the current statement of the law and was the version in effect at the time the State requested that appellant be placed on the sex offender registry, we refer to it here to demonstrate the requirements of the statute as they applied to appellant. See CP 2014 \u00a7 ll-704(c); Effect of amendments, CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b710-13\">. Appellant also entered a plea of involved to one count of sexual abuse of a minor in violation of Section 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article. A violation of Section 3-602 is not listed in CP 2010 \u00a7 11\u2014704(c)(1) as a basis for requiring the registration of a juvenile who violated that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">. A juvenile sex offender who has been required to register as a sex offender under CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-704(c)(l) may file a petition for a reduction in the term of registration, and the juvenile court may reduce such term. See CP 2010 \u00a7 1 l-707(a)(4)(iv). The statute, however, does not specify what standard the juvenile court is to employ in deciding whether to grant or deny a reduction in the term of registration, nor what burden of proof the registrant must satisfy to obtain such reduction. See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">. New research, however, suggests that sex offender statutes may not have the deterrent effect that the legislatures once hoped. <em>See, e.g., </em>Amanda Y.
