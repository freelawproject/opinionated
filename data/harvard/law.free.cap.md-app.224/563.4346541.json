Hogans, Jr., appellant, is a minority shareholder of a Maryland corporation, Hogans Agency, Inc., appellee. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>2014, appellant filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Kent County, seeking a court order compelling appellee to allow appellant to inspect and copy appellee\u2019s books of account. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, which the circuit court granted in an order requiring appellant to sign a confidentiality agreement before reviewing the corporation\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">On appeal, appellant presents three questions, which we have rephrased and condensed into one:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">Did the circuit court err in granting the motion for summary judgment by order requiring appellant to execute a confidentiality agreement before inspecting appellee\u2019s books of account?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">For the reasons stated below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The following facts are undisputed:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant owns 37.5% of stock in appellee, an insurance and real estate brokerage company. Appellant also owns Eshore Realty, LLC, another real estate brokerage company that is a competitor of appel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>lee. On December 19, 2013, appellant sent a letter to appellee requesting inspection of the company records, pursuant to Sections 2-512 and 2-513 of the Corporations and Associations Article. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1975, 2014 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 2-512 to -513 of the Corporations and Associations Article (\u201cCORP\u201d). On January 2, 2014, appellee responded to appellant\u2019s request by providing copies of the company bylaws, minutes of the proceedings of stockholders, an annual statement of affairs for the tax year ending July 31, 2012, and the name, address, and shares of each stockholder. Appellee also agreed to schedule a time for appellant to inspect and copy the books of account, conditioned upon appellant signing a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit appellant from disclosing the information to third parties. Appellant refused to sign the confidentiality agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">On February 5, 2014, appellant filed <em>pro se </em>a Complaint for Stockholder\u2019s Right to Inspect. Appellant\u2019s request for relief included that the court order appellee (1) to allow appellant\u2019s immediate inspection and copying of appellee\u2019s books of account, (2) to allow appellant to use appellee\u2019s photocopier free of charge, (3) to pay for a complete audit of company records, and (4) to pay appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On March 7, 2014, appellee filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, motion for summary judgment, and request for hearing, arguing that it was permitted to require appellant to sign a confidentiality agreement \u201cto prevent [appellant] and his agent from disclosing confidential company information collected during the inspection process to third parties, including for use by [appellant] in his competing real estate brokerage business.\u201d Appellant filed a response to the motion on March 24, 2014, denying that he sought the information to cause harm to appellee, but rather to investigate a theft from the company by one of appellee\u2019s employees in 2013. On April 1, 2014, the circuit court, apparently without a hearing, denied appellee\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>On April 4, 2014, appellee filed a reply and requested that the court grant its motion for summary judgment. Appellant filed another response, and the matter was scheduled for a hearing. On May 30, 2014, appellant appeared <em>pro se </em>and appellee appeared with counsel for a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. At the hearing, appellee informed the court that it did not object to appellant\u2019s right to inspect the books of account, but wanted appellant to first sign the confidentiality agreement. Appellee also objected to bearing the cost of an audit or photocopying as requested by appellant, as well as appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, because appellant was not represented by counsel. Appellant argued that summary judgment would be premature because of the lack of discovery, and that he was not required by law to sign a confidentiality agreement before inspecting appel-lee\u2019s books of account.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">At the close of the hearing, the trial court signed an order granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ordering that (1) appellee permit appellant to inspect company records as authorized by CORP \u00a7\u00a7 2-512 and 2-513, (2) appellant sign a confidentiality agreement prior to inspecting the records, (3) the parties share the cost of copying the documents, (4) appellant\u2019s request for an audit paid for by appellee be denied unless further warranted after the inspection, and (5) appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees be denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 27, 2014, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We review the decision of a circuit court granting summary judgment <em>de novo. Powell v. Breslin, </em>195 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>340, 345, 6 A.3d 360 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>421 Md. 266, 26 A.3d 878 (2011). Maryland Rule 2-501\u00a9 provides that a trial court shall grant a motion for summary judgment \u201cif the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the [moving] party ... is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cMaryland\u2019s summary judgment rule makes clear that a trial court determines issues of law; it makes rulings as a matter of law, resolving no disputed issues of fact. In this regard, the standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment is simply whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Kirson, </em>439 Md. 501, 522, 96 A.3d 714 (2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAs such, ... we review independently the record to determine whether the parties generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Tyler v. City of Coll. Park, </em>415 Md. 475, 498-99, 3 A.3d 421 (2010)). We review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Bednar v. Provident Bank of Md., Inc., </em>402 Md. 532, 542, 937 A.2d 210 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, because (1) it was granted prematurely, before appellant had the chance to conduct discovery; (2) there was no evidence that appellant intended to use the right to inspect for \u201cimproper or unlawful purposes\u201d or \u201cin bad faith\u201d; and (3) the law does not require that a stockholder sign a confidentiality agreement prior to inspection of the corporation\u2019s records. Appellant argues that \u201cpossible competition\u201d between a shareholder and a corporation is not sufficient to deny a stockholder his right of inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Appellee responds that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment, because appellant failed to identify any material facts in dispute. Moreover, appellee argues, it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, because requiring a confidentiality agreement \u201cis an acceptable prophylactic measure that does not infringe on Appellant\u2019s right of inspection or to use the information he discovers to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>his shareholder interests, but protects Appellee from misuse of the information by dissemination to third parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We do not believe that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was premature. Appellant contends that he needed additional time for discovery, but he has not identified, either in the trial court or on appeal, what discovery he needed. Appellant also did not ask the court for additional time to conduct discovery before or at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. Rather, appellant responded to appellee\u2019s request for a hearing \u201cthat such a hearing is unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Appellant also failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact. The only fact that appellant disputes on appeal is whether he intended to use the right to inspect for \u201cimproper or unlawful purposes\u201d or \u201cin bad faith.\u201d This fact is not material to the case. \u201cA material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case. Consequently, a dispute over a non-material fact will not preclude summary judgment.\u201d <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985) (citation omitted). As we shall explain, a trial court may grant a corporation\u2019s request for a stockholder who is a direct competitor of the corporation to sign a confidentiality agreement before inspecting the corporations books of account. Appellant\u2019s actual intent in using the information is irrelevant. Moreover, appellant did not file a legally sufficient affidavit raising a dispute of material facts, because the affidavit filed was based upon appellant\u2019s \u201cknowledge, information and belief.\u201d <em>See Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Caroline Cnty. v. J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. 83, 103, 747 A.2d 600 (2000) (stating that \u201caffidavits that are based on \u2018the best of one\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief,\u2019 or similar attestation, are insufficient to support a motion for summary judgment or an answer in opposition to such motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Finally, we determine whether appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The primary dispute in this case is whether a stockholder may be required to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to allowing inspection of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>corporation\u2019s books of account pursuant to CORP \u00a7\u00a7 2-512 and 2-513. Appellant contends that \u201cpossible competition\u201d between a shareholder and a corporation is not sufficient to deny a stockholder his right of inspection. We disagree and shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">CORP \u00a7 2-512 provides for the inspection of corporate documents by any shareholder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">(a) Any stockholder, holder of a voting trust certificate in a corporation, or his agent, on written request, may inspect and copy during usual business hours any of the following corporate documents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">(1) Bylaws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">(2) Minutes of the proceedings of the stockholders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">(3) Annual statements of affairs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">(4) Voting trust agreements deposited with the corporation at the corporation\u2019s principal office in accordance with \u00a7 2-510(2) of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">(b) Within 7 days after a request for documents made under subsection (a) of this section is presented to an officer or the resident agent of a corporation, the corporation shall have the requested documents available on file at its principal office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">(c) (1) Any stockholder or holder of a voting trust certificate in a corporation other than an open-ended investment company may present to any officer or resident agent of the corporation a written request for a statement showing all stock and securities issued by the corporation during a specified period of not more than 12 months before the date of the request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">(2) Within 20 days after a request is made under this subsection, the corporation shall prepare and have available on file at its principal office a sworn statement of its president or treasurer or one of its vice-presidents or assistant treasurers which states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(i) The number of shares or amounts of each class of stock or other securities issued during the specified period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">(ii) The consideration received per share or unit, which may be aggregated as to all issuances for the same consideration per share or unit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">(iii) The value of any consideration other than money as set in a resolution of the board of directors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">CORP \u00a7 2-513 provides for the inspection of corporate documents by a shareholder who has owned at least five percent of stock for at least six months. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">(a) One or more persons who together are and for at least six months have been stockholders of record or holders of voting trust certificates of at least 5 percent of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">(1) In person or by agent, on written request, inspect and copy during usual business hours the corporation\u2019s books of account and its stock ledger;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">(2) Present to any officer or resident agent of the corporation a written request for a statement of its affairs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">(3) In the case of any corporation which does not maintain the original or a duplicate stock ledger at its principal office, present to any officer or resident agent of the corporation a written request for a list of its stockholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">(b) Within 20 days after a request for information is made under subsection (a) of this section, the corporation shall prepare and have available on file at its principal office:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">(1) In the case of a request for a statement of affairs, a statement verified under oath by its president or treasurer or one of its vice-presidents or assistant treasurers which sets forth in reasonable detail the corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities as of a reasonably current date; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>(2) In the case of a request for a list of stockholders, a list verified under oath by one of its officers or its stock transfer agent or registrar which sets forth the name and address of each stockholder and the number of shares of each class which the stockholder holds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">CORP \u00a7 2-513 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The two leading Maryland cases on a stockholder\u2019s right to inspection are <em>Weinhenmayer v. Bitner, </em>88 Md. 325, 42 A. 245 (1898), and <em>Wight v. Heublein, </em>111 Md. 649, 75 A. 507 (1910). In <em>Weinhenmayer, </em>a shareholder in a Maryland corporation filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against the corporation\u2019s secretary, asserting that he had a right to inspect the accounts of the corporation and that the secretary had refused his request to do so. 88 Md. at 331, 42 A. 245. The Court of Appeals, considering a predecessor statute to CORP \u00a7 2-513, observed that \u201c[t]he right is given to him as a stockholder by statute, and is absolute, and not made to depend upon any circumstances but the ownership of the stock,\u201d even where it was alleged that the stockholder sought the information for use \u201cin the conduct of his own business to the injury and loss of the said corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 42 A. 245. In such case, the Court observed, \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s right would not be forfeited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court, however, set forth a condition on the enforcement of such absolute right: \u201cIt is easy to see that there might be good reasons for refusing an application, for instance, if it were made for some evil, improper, or unlawful purpose. And, if such purpose were alleged and proved, the writ would be denied.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Twelve years later, in <em>Wight, </em>the Court again considered the issue of a stockholder\u2019s rights to inspect, describing the \u201cgeneral rule, that, where a stockholder is given the right by statute to inspect the books of a corporation, the courts will enforce and grant this statutory right, by mandamus, to a stockholder who seeks information for proper and legitimate purposes.\u201d 111 Md. at 657, 75 A. 507. In support of this rule, the Court appeared to broaden the condition imposed on the enforcement of such right by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cIt does not follow that the court will compel the inspection of the books under all circumstances. In issuing the writ of mandamus, the court will exercise a sound discretion and grant the right under proper safeguards to protect the interests of all concerned. The writ should not be granted for speculative purposes or to gratify idle curiosity or to aid a blackmailer, but it may not be denied to the stockholder who seeks the information for legitimate purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 658, 75 A. 507 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Guthrie v. Harkness, </em>199 U.S. 148, 156, 26 S.Ct. 4, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905)).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In his treatise on Maryland corporation law, James J. Hanks, Jr., sought to reconcile the Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Wein-hemnayer </em>and <em>Wight:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">It is difficult to reconcile the <em>Weihenmayer [Weinhenmayer </em>] and <em>Wight </em>cases. The correct law on this subject is that a five-percent, six-month stockholder is entitled to inspect the \u201cbooks of account\u201d of a Maryland corporation for any purpose related to monitoring or protecting his equity investment in the corporation but not for any other purpose, such as competing with the corporation. This rule allows broad access to corporate documents and information, perhaps even in a situation in which the stockholder has an additional purpose not related to his investment. A corporation may take reasonable measures, such as requiring the requesting stockholder to sign a confidentiality agreement, to protect the corporation against disclosure and misuse of confidential documents and information by the stockholder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">James J. Hanks, Jr., <em>Maryland Corporation Law </em>\u00a7 7.18 (2014 supp.) (emphasis added). We agree with this interpretation of Maryland caselaw. The Court of Appeals in the later case of <em>Wight </em>acknowledged the right of the stockholder to inspect the books of account, limited only by the corporation\u2019s right to protect itself. \u201c[T]he court will exercise a sound discretion and grant the right under proper safeguards to <em>protect the interests of all concerned.\u201d </em>111 Md. at 658, 75 A. 507 (cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tions and internal quotations marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that appellant is both a stockholder entitled to inspect appellee\u2019s books of account, as well as the owner of a competing company. In requiring appellant to sign the confidentiality agreement before inspecting appellee\u2019s books and records, the trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">My ruling is based on a reasonable interpretation of the statute. And that is I cannot let a stockholder go into a company just because they own more than 5 percent of the stock and take the confidential records and books to a competing company. Not gonna let it happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s \u201cexercise [of] sound discretion\u201d in requiring that appellant sign a confidentiality agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Wight, </em>111 Md. at 658, 75 A. 507; Hanks, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.18. A corporation may not deny a stockholder the right to inspect the books of account, as provided in CORP \u00a7 2-513. A corporation may, however, require the stockholder to sign a confidentiality agreement where the confidentiality agreement and its terms advance the purpose of \u201cprotecting] the corporation against disclosure and misuse of confidential documents and information by the stockholder.\u201d <em>See </em>Hanks, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.18. Here, the confidentiality agreement advances that purpose, because the requesting stockholder is also the owner of a company that is in competition with the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR KENT COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">. Appellant's questions as originally presented in his brief, are:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">1. Did the trial court\u2019s granting of the Motion for Summary Judgment meet the requirements of Md. Rule 2-501 on the ground of \"that there is no dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">2. In the alternative, did the trial court err in its granting of the Motion for Summary Judgment by requiring that a \"confidentiality agreement\u201d be signed prior to Appellant\u2019s inspection of the books and records?</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">3. Does the granting of the Motion set a dangerous precedent?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-13\">. Neither party has filed an affidavit in the proper form as required by Maryland Rules 2-501 and 1-304. <em>See Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Caroline Cnty. v. J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. 83, 103, 747 A.2d 600 (2000). Therefore, we rely only on those undisputed facts that were properly before the trial judge. <em>Montgomery v. Remsburg, </em>147 Md.App. 564, 576 n. 3, 810 A.2d 14 (2002) (\"[Fjacts conceded or stipulated to be true facts are properly considered in ruling on a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>judgment.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>376 Md. 568, 831 A.2d 18 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">.

Prior to appellant filing the notice of appeal, appellee filed a motion for a protective order, which was granted without a hearing on July 15, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\">. Appellant does not raise an issue regarding the reasonableness of any particular term of the confidentiality agreement that appellee wanted him to sign.
