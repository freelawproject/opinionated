The petition, which was filed almost 20 years after appellant\u2019s conviction for murder and related offenses, was based on evidence that the State\u2019s ballistics expert, Joseph Kopera, who testified at appellant\u2019s 1994 trial, lied about his educational qualifications. The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s petition, finding that he failed to prove that the evidence of Mr. Kopera\u2019s duplicity created a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility\u201d that the result of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">On appeal, appellant presents the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">Did the trial court err when it denied appellant\u2019s Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">On January 31, 1994, Edward Borrero and Terrance Robinson went to visit a man known to them as \u201cMike\u201d at Mike\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>apartment in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once Mr. Borrero and Mr. Robinson arrived at Mike\u2019s apartment, Mike told them that \u201che had a little store that [they] could hit,\u201d and he drew a blueprint of how it would look inside. The store, \u201cAmerican Mailbox,\u201d was in Montgomery County, Maryland, near the District of Columbia line. Mike stated that cash would be stored in the back filing cabinet and could total as much as $80,000. Approximately ten minutes after Mr. Borre-ro and Mr. Robinson arrived at Mike\u2019s apartment, appellant joined them.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The four men, with Mike as their leader, drove a Chevrolet Celebrity to the apartment of Mike\u2019s girlfriend, Angie, to obtain a handgun. Mike went into the apartment building, and he and Angie returned with a 9mm handgun, which he handed to Mr. Borrero. Mike explained to the group that the plan was for Angie to enter the store first, and then, to create a diversion, one of the men would pretend to abduct her.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Mr. Borrero drove a Chrysler New Yorker to American Mailbox, and the others, appellant, Mike, Mr. Robinson, and Angie, rode in the Celebrity. While en route to American Mailbox, however, Angie decided that she did not want to participate in the robbery, so they turned around and dropped Angie off at her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Once at Angie\u2019s apartment, Mike told Mr. Borrero to park the New Yorker and get into the Celebrity with the others so that they could all \u201cdrive by the store.\u201d As the men drove by American Mailbox, Mike pointed out that the store had two exits, one on Eastern Avenue and the other on Georgia Avenue. He suggested that the men use the Eastern Avenue exit during the planned robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Not yet ready to go through with their plan, the men returned to where the New Yorker was parked. The men drove to Peabody Street, where Mike retrieved a .38 revolver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>from a woman named Vanessa Hood. Mr. Robinson was to use that gun in the robbery. At that point, the plan was for Mr. Borrero, who had the 9mm gun, and Mr. Robinson, who had the .38 revolver, to rob the store while appellant and Mike waited close by. The men headed to American Mailbox; Mike and appellant rode in the New Yorker and Mr. Borrero and Mr. Robinson rode in the Celebrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">When they arrived at American Mailbox, Mr. Borrero and Mr. Robinson entered the store, and Mike and appellant parked the New Yorker on a nearby side street. Mr. Borrero approached the counter with a few items for purchase, reached into his pocket as if to obtain money, and pulled out a gun. The owner of the store, Joseph Atkins, reached across the counter, apparently to defend himself, and Mr. Borrero shot him in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Mr. Borrero and Mr. Robinson then searched the back of the store for money, but they could not find any. As they were leaving the store, a neighboring merchant, Randolf Cov-ington, entered the store. Mr. Borrero shot Mr. Covington twice, and he shot Mr. Atkins in the arm before leaving. Mr. Covington died from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Mr. Borrero and Mr. Robinson left the store, entered the Celebrity, and drove it until they located Mike and appellant. They then parked the Celebrity, leaving it near the crime scene, and joined Mike and appellant in the New Yorker. The men returned to Ms. Hood\u2019s apartment on Peabody Street, and Mike gave her both the .38 revolver and the 9mm that Mr. Robinson and Mr. Borrero carried during the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">While all four men were at Ms. Hood\u2019s apartment, her 19-year-old son, Vandell Roseman, arrived. Appellant asked Mr. Roseman to drive him to pick up another vehicle. Mr. Rose-man agreed, and appellant gave Mr. Roseman the keys to the New Yorker. Appellant, sitting in the passenger seat of the New Yorker, directed Mr. Roseman toward American Mailbox. As they neared the store, they saw a lot of law enforcement personnel and crime tape surrounding the area. Appellant told Mr. Roseman to \u201cforget it and just go back home.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>When Mr. Roseman returned home, Mr. Borrero and Mr. Robinson were gone, but Mike was still with Ms. Hood. Appellant and Mike then left in the New Yorker.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">A few days later, Ms. Hood spoke with a friend and realized that there may have been a connection between the guns that Mike gave her on January 31st and a shooting that occurred that day. Ms. Hood decided that she needed \u201cto get rid of\u2019 the guns. She gave them to Mr. Roseman, who threw them in a trash can.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Barbara Rogers testified that, in October 1993, Mike and appellant moved into an apartment she had in the District of Columbia. They had moved out by January 31, 1994, the date of the shooting. That day, however, Mike returned to the apartment to gather some of his belongings that he had left there. Both appellant and Mike were \u201cin and out\u201d of Ms. Rogers\u2019 apartment all day.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Ms. Rogers overheard Mike telling appellant that he had just returned from a \u201csweet spot,\u201d where there was $80,000, no security, and only one girl working. Appellant responded that \u201che was for it,\u201d exclaiming: \u201cLet\u2019s take the motherfucking joint.\u201d The two men then discussed what they would do with the $80,000 they hoped to steal. Shortly thereafter, two young men, Mr. Borrero and Mr. Robinson, came to the apartment. Ms. Rogers did not want the young men in her apartment because \u201c[t]hey should have been in school,\u201d and the four men discussed plans to meet elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">A few days later, appellant and Mike again were at Ms. Rogers\u2019 apartment. Ms. Rogers heard appellant brag that he could not be implicated in the crime because he had not actually entered American Mailbox, his fingerprints had not been left on anything, and no one had seen him there. She also heard appellant lamenting that one man died, but appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t get a damn dime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Appellant testified in his defense and denied any involvement in the shootings. Appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Yvonne Davis, testified that, approximately a week before the shootings, appellant had fired a gun in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Mr. Kopera, an employee of the Maryland State Police Ballistics Laboratory, testified that, in his expert opinion, the gun that was fired at American Mailbox was the same gun that had been fired a week earlier in the District of Columbia. With regard to his qualifications as an expert in firearms and ballistics identification, Mr. Kopera testified that he had been working with the Maryland State Police Ballistics Laboratory in the Crime Lab for more than three years, and before that, he had spent 22 years with the Baltimore City Crime Lab in their ballistics unit. He had testified numerous times in state courts in Maryland, as well as in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and various federal courts. He personally conducted between 1,200 and 1,400 ballistics examinations each year. When asked about the training he had received, Mr. Kopera responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">There are no colleges or universities that offer a degree in the field specifically of ballistics or firearms identification, so all knowledge of the field is done by way of on-the-job training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">I spent a tenure of five years on-the-job training with the FBI and also with the Baltimore City Firearms Laboratory before becoming court-qualified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">Before this training, we must fit the qualifications as far as educational background to get into the field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">The State Police and also the Baltimore City Crime Lab and the FBI require a science-related degree in a field relative\u2014in an area relative to your field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">I [have] a degree in engineering from the University of Maryland here in the State of Maryland and also an engineering degree from the Rochester Institute of Technology in the state of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">I am a graduate of the FBI Academy in the field[ ] of ballistics. I am on the board of directors for the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners, which is the governing agency of firearms experts here in the United States and many countries abroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The court accepted Mr. Kopera as an expert. Defense counsel did not object or ask Mr. Kopera any questions regarding his credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Ultimately, the jury convicted appellant of murder, attempted murder, two counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. The circuit court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment on both the murder and attempted murder convictions, and it imposed concurrent terms of imprisonment for the other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Appellant appealed, and this Court affirmed in an unreported opinion. <em>Robert Anthony McGhie v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 1883, Sept. Term, 1994 (filed Nov. 24, 1995). Appellant also filed a motion for a new trial, a motion for post-conviction relief, and a motion to revise his sentences. Appellant was denied relief on each occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In 2007, almost thirteen years after appellant\u2019s convictions, an attorney in the Office of the Public Defender discovered discrepancies in Mr. Kopera\u2019s testimony over the course of the many years that he served as an expert witness for the State. Further investigation revealed that Mr. Kopera had lied about having a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Maryland and the Rochester Institute of Technology. Mr. Kopera did not hold a degree from either institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Appellant then filed his Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, alleging that, in December 2011, he learned, based on a letter from the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney, that Mr. Kopera perjured himself at appellant\u2019s trial. In addition to a claim relating to the false testimony regarding Mr. Kopera\u2019s credentials, he asserted that the \u201cchain of custody for the ballistics evidence [was] also at issue and/or potentially [compromised] as it [was] speculative as to whether the evidence was returned from Mr. Joseph Kopera without being changed or altered in any fashion.\u201d He alleged that, \u201cwithout the contested ballistics results and perjured testimony of Mr. Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Kopera, a jury could not [have] convict[ed] him of the alleged crimes.\u201d Appellant asserted that this evidence \u201ccreat[ed] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different\u201d and \u201cthis newly discovered information could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">At the hearing on his petition, appellant, through counsel, relied on the exhibits to his petition and made oral argument.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court ultimately rejected the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The court first addressed the State\u2019s claim that appellant had waived his claim because Mr. Kopera\u2019s duplicity could have been discovered in time to move for a new trial. It disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">To hold defense counsel to the requirement of a background check of an expert who had testified in scores of cases is unrealistic. Indeed, the State\u2014which should bear some responsibility for its own expert\u2019s mendacity\u2014was likewise in the dark about the situation. Why should a greater burden devolve upon the defense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The court found, however, that appellant had not proven that the newly discovered evidence that Mr. Kopera lied about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>his qualifications as an expert created a substantial or significant possibility that the jury\u2019s verdict may have been different. In addressing this claim, the court first considered the appropriate analysis to employ, stating: \u201cDoes the court (a) simply excise the false testimony and then, based on the remaining evidence, determine whether the result would have been different, or (b) consider whether the result would have been different if it was revealed during the trial that [Mr.] Kopera\u2019s educational qualifications were exaggerated?\u201d Noting that this Court had employed the former approach in <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 412, 428, 53 A.3d 361 (2012), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>440 Md. 33, 99 A.3d 730 (2014), <em>petition for cert., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2015), a post-conviction case addressing the materiality of Mr. Kopera\u2019s false testimony regarding his credentials, the court stated that \u201cthe proper standard to utilize is the simple excision of the questioned testimony, and determination of whether there would then exist a \u2018substantial or significant\u2019 possibility of a different verdict.\u201d Given this standard, the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">it is patent that the jury would not have been influenced in any way\u2014much less substantially or significantly\u2014by the lack of testimony concerning [Mr.] Kopera\u2019s college education. No undergraduate degree is apparently offered in the field of ballistics. [Mr.] Kopera undoubtedly would have qualified as an expert witness without the false testimony, just as he did in scores of previous trials. His expertise was in no way challenged at [appellant\u2019s] trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Moreover, the court stated that the prosecution referred to [Mr.] Kopera \u201conly in passing\u201d during closing argument, and appellant\u2019s attorney never mentioned him at all. The court stated that [Mr.] Kopera\u2019s testimony, \u201cwhile helpful to the State, was not central to the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The circuit court, nevertheless, addressed the alternative standard and concluded that, even if it assessed the possible outcome if the jury had known of [Mr.] Kopera\u2019s dishonesty, it would not have affected the verdict. The court stated that, aside from the ballistics evidence, there was \u201cample testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ny\u201d directly implicating appellant in the murder. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">[Ms.] Hood testified that [appellant] and his three co-conspirators came to her home the afternoon after the murder, leaving two handguns on her bed. [Appellant] and another had visited earlier in the day to pick up one of the weapons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">During this time, a news bulletin was broadcast on the television which described the murder. Ms. Hood\u2019s son, [Mr.] Roseman, testified that [appellant] had him drive past the scene of the shootings that same afternoon, presumably to see what investigation was taking place, and perhaps to see what had become of the abandoned automobile that transported the conspirators to the murder scene. [Mr.] Roseman later disposed of the two guns, at his mother\u2019s request. [Appellant] told [Mr.] Roseman, after cruising by the murder scene, to \u201cforget it and just go back home.\u201d[ ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">[Mr.] Borrero, who shot the murder victim, testified to [appellant\u2019s] presence during the planning stage of the crime and during the getaway. [Appellant] also partook of the marijuana the participants smoked during the preliminary \u201cride-by\u201d, ostensibly to fortify themselves, before the murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">[Ms.] Rogers heard [appellant] discussing the crime before its consummation, telling a confederate^] \u201cLet\u2019s take the motherfucking joint.\u201d He said he was going to get a nice car with his share of the money, thought to be $80,000.00, that would be the fruit of the intended robbery. After the crime, she heard him lament that a man was dead, and that [appellant] \u201cdidn\u2019t get a damn dime.\u201d He also was apparently heartened by the fact that his fingerprints were nowhere to be found at the crime scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Of special significance, [appellant] took the witness stand and testified at trial. While Ms. Rogers\u2019 motives for testifying were vigorously challenged by the defense on cross-examination and in closing argument, never did [appellant] even attempt to rebut or refute Ms. Rogers\u2019 testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>regarding his incriminating statements, and her testimony stands uncontradicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Accordingly, the court determined that appellant \u201cwas not prejudiced by [Mr.] Kopera\u2019s duplicity, and there was no substantial or significant possibility that the result of the trial would have been favorable to [appellant], whether the testimony was presented to the jury or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in denying his Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence. He asserts that the newly discovered evidence that Mr. Kopera lied about his educational background created a substantial or significant possibility that the result of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The State contends that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence. It asserts that appellant was not entitled to relief because he failed to show any of the following three substantive requirements that must be met to be eligible for relief: (1) that the newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered with due diligence in sufficient time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331; (2) that the evidence was material, not merely impeaching; and (3) that there was a \u201csignificant possibility\u201d that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the newly discovered evidence been known at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Maryland Code (2012 Supp.) \u00a7 8-301 of Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), permits a defendant to file a petition for writ of actual innocence. It provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQH\">\n<em>Newly Discovered Evidence</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahk-dedup-0\">\u00a7 8-301. Petition for writ of actual innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">(a) Grounds.\u2014A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that crime may, at any time, file a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">(2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331 .[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">(g) <em>Burden of proof. </em>A petitioner in a proceeding under this section has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In addressing a circuit court\u2019s decision, after a hearing, to deny a petition for writ of actual innocence, we limit our review to whether the circuit court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Hunt, </em>443 Md. 238, 247-48, 116 A.3d 477 (2015); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 347, 363, 86 A.3d 97 <em>cert. denied, </em>438 Md. 740, 93 A.3d 289 (2014). In that regard, we will not disturb the circuit court\u2019s ruling, unless it is \u201c \u2018well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what the court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 363-64, 86 A.3d 97 (quoting <em>Moreland v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 563, 569, 53 A.3d 449 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Due Diligence</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">We begin our analysis, as did the circuit court, by addressing the requirement that a defendant filing a petition for writ of actual innocence must show that the evidence could not have been discovered in time to file a motion for new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>pursuant to Rule 4-331. This Court recently stated that this requirement is a \u201cthreshold question,\u201d noting that, \u201cuntil there is a finding of newly discovered evidence that could not have been discovered by due diligence, no relief is available, \u2018no matter how compelling the cry of outraged justice may be.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 364, 86 A.3d 97 (quoting <em>Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 604, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998)). <em>See Keyes v. State, </em>215 Md.App. 660, 669, 84 A.3d 141 (2014) (CP \u00a7 8-301(a)(2) defines a due diligence standard by express reference to Rule 4-321). In assessing the \u201cdue diligence\u201d requirement in the context of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 4-331(c), the Court of Appeals has interpreted the term \u201cdue diligence\u201d as requiring that a litigant \u201cact reasonably and in good faith to obtain the evidence, in light of the totality of the circumstances and the facts known to him or her.\u201d <em>Argy-rou, </em>349 Md. at 604-05, 709 A.2d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">As our analysis in this case will show, the standard of review that this Court applies to the trial court\u2019s finding in this regard is critical. In <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 364-66, 86 A.3d 97 this Court addressed the same issue presented here, i.e., whether Mr. Kopera\u2019s false statements regarding his educational background could have been discovered by due diligence in time to move for a new trial. In that case, the circuit court, noting that another lawyer had discovered the misstatements, made a factual finding that appellant had failed to show that the evidence could not have been discovered by due diligence. <em>Id. </em>at 365, 86 A.3d 97. Reviewing that finding pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard, we upheld the court\u2019s ruling, stating that \u201cthe circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellant failed to show that the evidence could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 86 A.3d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The circuit court\u2019s factual finding in this case, however, was completely different. Here, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">There is no evidence that was presented to this court to demonstrate that Kopera was exaggerating his qualifications prior to Petitioner\u2019s trial in 1994. Apparently, no red flags had been raised from Kopera\u2019s testimony in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>cases that would require a competent defense attorney to question Kopera\u2019s pedigree, collegiate record, or the like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">No opportunity to depose an expert in a criminal case is generally afforded to the defendant, unlike in civil cases. To hold defense counsel to the requirement of a background check of an expert who had testified in scores of cases is unrealistic. Indeed, the State\u2014which should bear some responsibility for its own expert\u2019s mendacity\u2014was likewise in the dark about the situation. Why should a greater burden devolve upon the defense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">As in <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 363-64, 86 A.3d 97 our analysis focuses on whether the circuit court\u2019s finding in this regard constituted an abuse of discretion. We cannot so conclude. <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 263-64, 116 A.3d 477 (\u201c[I]t would not be an abuse of discretion for a hearing judge to find that a defense attorney might fail, after nonetheless exercising due diligence before the revelations of 2007, to discover Kop-era\u2019s alleged fraud.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we uphold the circuit court\u2019s finding that appellant has satisfied the requirement that he show that the newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Impact of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">We thus turn to the second requirement, that the evidence created \u201ca substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined.\u201d CP \u00a7 8-301(a)(l). The Court of Appeals, in the context of a motion for new trial, has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APN\">In order for the newly discovered evidence to warrant a new trial, the trial judge must find it to be both material and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>persuasive such that \u201c[t]he newly discovered evidence may well have produced a different result, that is, there was a substantial or significant possibility that the verdict of the trier of fact would have been affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><em>Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 666-67, 821 A.2d 1 (2003) (quoting <em>Yorke v. State, </em>315 Md. 578, 588, 556 A.2d 230 (1989)). In <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>299 Md. 297, 301-02, 473 A.2d 450 (1984), the Court indicated that, in deciding whether to grant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, the court should address first whether evidence is material, and if that is the case, then \u201cthe court inquires into the possible impact the newly discovered evidence would have on the outcome of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 367-71, 86 A.3d 97 this Court began with the analysis whether Mr. Kopera\u2019s false testimony regarding his educational credentials was material. We explained that both this Court and the Court of Appeals have stated that, to be material, evidence must be more than \u201c \u2018merely cumulative or impeaching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 86 A.3d 97. <em>See Argyrou, </em>349 Md. at 601, 709 A.2d 1194; <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 697-98, 884 A.2d 694 (2005). In the 2005 <em>Jackson </em>case, this Court distinguished between newly discovered evidence that was \u201cpivotally important,\u201d such as evidence that a witness lied about the merits of the case, which would be considered coincidentally impeaching, and newly discovered evidence that bore on a witness\u2019 credibility, which would \u201cconstitute collateral impeachment\u201d and \u201cbe \u2018merely impeaching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 697-98, 884 A.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">With that background in mind, in the 2014 <em>Jackson </em>case, we agreed with the circuit court that the evidence that Mr. Kopera lied about his qualifications \u201cwas not material, but merely impeaching.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 369, 86 A.3d 97. We noted that there was \u201cno contention that Mr. Kop-era\u2019s testimony regarding his ballistics analysis was false or incorrect. Rather, the newly discovered evidence alleged in the petition was limited solely to evidence that Mr. Kopera did not attend the University of Maryland or Rochester Institute of Technology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given Mr. Kopera\u2019s extensive experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>in ballistics, we agreed with the State that Mr. Kopera\u2019s claim \u201c \u2018to have college degrees that he did not actually possess has nothing whatsoever to do with the accuracy of his conclusion concerning the distance [Mr.] Bey was from the gun when he was shot,\u2019 and that a bullet fragment found on the first floor was fired from the same gun used in the murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 86 A.3d 97. <em>Accord Kulbicki v. State, </em>207 Md.App. at 447, 53 A.3d 361 (falsity of Mr. Kopera\u2019s testimony was not material because \u201cthere simply [was] no likelihood that the jury\u2019s determination would have been influenced by the fact that Mr. Kopera did not have the academic credentials he claimed,\u201d noting that \u201cballistics is a field for which no college degree is offered, and the expertise for the field is usually based on experience, which Kopera had in copious amounts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Other courts have applied a similar analysis in holding that a new trial is not warranted where an expert testifies falsely about his or her credentials. In <em>State v. Glouser, </em>193 Neb. 190, 226 N.W.2d 328, 331-32 (1975), the Supreme Court of Nebraska addressed whether a new trial was required when, similar to the facts here, the State\u2019s expert falsely testified that he had received a Bachelor\u2019s degree. After stating that newly discovered evidence justifying a new trial must involve something other than the credibility of the witness, the court addressed whether the expert\u2019s lack of academic credentials would have disqualified him as an expert witness. <em>Id. </em>at 197-99, 226 N.W.2d 328. Noting that the chemist had extensive experience in analysis of controlled substances, the court held that his lack of a degree would not have disqualified him as an expert or discredited him to the extent that it probably would have produced a different result at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 226 N.W.2d 328. <em>Accord Howard v. State, </em>945 So.2d 326, 370-71 (Miss.2006) (alleged false testimony by expert did not require a new trial because it related to the expert\u2019s background and competence, not the witness\u2019 conclusion that Howard bit the victim, and therefore, it was not reasonably likely that it affected the judgment of the jury). <em>See also United States v. Price, </em>357 F.Supp.2d 63, 69 (D.D.C.2004) (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>er false testimony of expert regarding credentials where the expert\u2019s testimony focused on other expertise, and therefore, the failure to investigate the credentials did not result in any prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The trial court in this case assessed the evidence pursuant to this reasoning. It determined that \u201cthere is no possibility that the jury would have reached a different conclusion without the educational testimony of [Mr.] Kopera. He would have qualified as an expert based upon his on-the-job-training, and the many instances in which he had previously testified.\u201d We perceive no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s finding that the newly discovered evidence, which was merely impeaching evidence regarding Mr. Kopera\u2019s qualifications, did not merit the granting of a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence because a correct statement of Mr. Kopera\u2019s qualifications would not have changed the result of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 263-64, 116 A.3d 477 however, the Court of Appeals suggested disagreement with this analysis. In <em>dicta, </em>albeit considered <em>dicta, </em>the Court questioned the distinction between \u201cimpeaching\u201d evidence (evidence that a witness lied about the merits of the case) and \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d evidence (false evidence bearing on a witness\u2019 credibility), indicating that such a distinction may be considered \u201coverly rigid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated: \u201cWhen an expert is called to testify, it is conceivable that, based on the cumulative body of evidence presented at a given trial, falsity regarding the expert\u2019s credibility and qualifications might \u2018createf ] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting \u00a7 8-301(a)(l)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 374 n. 16, 86 A.3d 97 we recognized that other courts had held that, \u201cwhere expert testimony is critical, false testimony about the expert\u2019s credentials requires a new trial.\u201d Some courts have specifically rejected the argument that a new trial is not warranted when an expert testifies falsely regarding his or her credentials as long as the expert still would have been qualified as an expert, opting instead to consider whether the jury might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>reached a different conclusion if the expert testimony had not been admitted. <em>See, e.g., State v. Griffith, </em>144 Idaho 356, 161 P.3d 675, 686 (Ct.App.2007); <em>State v. Plude, </em>310 Wis.2d 28, 750 N.W.2d 42, 51-56 (2008) (where expert testimony is critical to the guilty finding, the misrepresentation may have diminished the credibility of the expert to the extent that it may have affected the judgment of the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 373-74, 86 A.3d 97 recognizing the alternative analysis adopted by some courts, we addressed whether, assuming \u201cthat the jury, having knowledge of Mr. Kopera\u2019s false testimony, would have discounted Mr. Kopera\u2019s testimony entirely,\u201d Jackson would prevail on his petition. <em>Id. </em>at 373, 86 A.3d 97. In that regard, we noted that Mr. Kopera\u2019s substantive testimony in that case was limited, and the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, without Mr. Kopera\u2019s testimony, was compelling. <em>Id. </em>at 373-74, 86 A.3d 97. Accordingly, because the expert testimony was not critical, we held that the \u201ccircuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the newly discovered evidence did not \u2018create[ ] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 86 A.3d 97 (quoting CP \u00a7 8-301).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Similarly, in the present case, the circuit court addressed, as an alternative basis to assess the petition, whether there was a substantial possibility that the verdict would have been different if the jury had known of Kopera\u2019s dishonesty and discredited his testimony. The court stated that it \u201ccannot find that the verdict would have been different.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuM\">There was ample testimony directly implicating Petitioner in the murder, aside from ballistics evidence. Vanessa Hood testified that Petitioner and his three co-conspirators came to her home the afternoon after the murder, leaving two handguns on her bed. Petitioner and another had visited earlier in the day to pick up one of the weapons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">During this time, a news bulletin was broadcast on the television which described the murder. Ms. Hood\u2019s son, Vandell Roseman, testified that Petitioner had him drive past the scene of the shootings that same afternoon, pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>sumably to see what investigation was taking place, and perhaps to see what had become of the abandoned automobile that transported the conspirators to the murder scene. Roseman later disposed of the two guns, at his mother\u2019s request. Petitioner told Roseman, after cruising by the murder scene, to \u201cforget it and just go back home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">Edward Borrero, who shot the murder victim, testified to Petitioner\u2019s presence during the planning stage of the crime and during the getaway. Petitioner also partook of the marijuana the participants smoked during the preliminary \u201cride-by,\u201d ostensibly to fortify themselves, before the murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">Barbara Rogers heard Petitioner discussing the crime before its consummation, telling a confederate, \u201cLet\u2019s take the motherfucking joint.\u201d He said he was going to get a nice car with his share of the money, thought to be $80,000.00, that would be the fruit of the intended robbery. After the crime, she heard him lament that a man was dead, and that Petitioner \u201cdidn\u2019t get a damn dime.\u201d He also was apparently heartened by the fact that his fingerprints were nowhere to be found at the crime scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">Of special significance, Petitioner took the witness stand and testified at trial. While Ms. Rogers\u2019 motives for testifying were vigorously challenged by the defense on cross-examination and in closing argument, <em>never </em>did Petitioner even attempt to rebut or refute Ms. Rogers\u2019 testimony regarding his incriminating statements, and her testimony stands uncontradicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">We agree with the circuit court that, although Mr. Kopera\u2019s testimony connecting appellant to the gun used in the shooting was \u201chelpful to the State, [it] was not central to the case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Mr. Kopera\u2019s testimony was not critical to the case, and there was other compelling evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the newly discovered evidence did not create a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">. The record reflects that Mike's full name is Frederick DeSuzar. Apparently, Mike is also known as Nathaniel McLean. Throughout appellant's trial, however, witnesses referred to this man as \"Mike.\u201d We shall do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-9\">. Originally, appellant also based his petition on allegations that another State's witness, Edward Borrero, perjured himself at trial. During the hearing on his Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, however, appellant dismissed any allegation of \"newly discovered evidence\u201d based on Mr. Borrero's allegedly perjured testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">. Those exhibits included: (1) a March 8, 2007, letter from the Maryland State Police advising the State's Attorney for Montgomery County that it had confirmed discrepancies in the credentials of Mr. Kopera regarding his education; and (2) an affidavit from William Conrad, a Forensics Firearms Consultant, which stated that: (a) although Mr. Kopera testified that he was a graduate of the FBI Academy in the field of firearms identification, there was no such course offered by the FBI Academy; and (b) Mr. Kopera\u2019s opinions \"were beyond the capability of a qualified examiner to make, with the evidence that was provided.\u201d At the hearing on appellant's Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, newspaper articles reporting that police investigators had confirmed that Mr. Kopera did not, as he testified, hold degrees from the Rochester Institute of Technology or the University of Maryland were admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b320-12\">. Maryland Rule 4-331(c) provides, in relevant part, that a court may grant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence if the motion is \"filed within one year after the later of (A) the date the court imposed sentence or (B) the date the court received a mandate issued by the final appellate court to consider a direct appeal from the judgment or a belated appeal permitted as post conviction relief,\u201d and the evidence could not have been discovered by due diligence earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\">. Our decision affirming the finding of a lack of due diligence in <em>Jackson </em>and our decision affirming the finding rejecting a claim of a lack of due diligence are not inconsistent. Rather, they illustrate the lens through which this Court reviews a trial court's decision. Opposite conclusions can be reached by trial courts and still be affirmed pursuant to our review for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\">.
