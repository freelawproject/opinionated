Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.), \u00a7 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d), a person convicted of a crime may file a petition for writ of actual innocence \u201cif the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that,\u201d among other things, \u201ccreates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined!.]\u201d C.P. \u00a7 8-301(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Maynard Snead, a prisoner proceeding pro se, petitioned for a writ of actual innocence in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On April 22, 2014, the court dismissed his petition without a hearing. The court relied on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Keyes v. State, </em>215 Md.App. 660, 673, 84 A.3d 141 <em>cert. denied, </em>438 Md. 144, 91 A.3d 614 (2014), which affirmed the dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>of a petition without a hearing where the newly-discovered evidence would merely have impeached the testimony of a witness for the prosecution. Snead appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">While the appeal was pending, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion in <em>State v. Hunt and Hardy, </em>443 Md. 238, 116 A.3d 477 (2015). In that case, the Court of Appeals re-affirmed its decision in <em>Douglas and Curtis v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 31 A.3d 250 (2011), that if a petition for a writ of actual innocence substantially complies with the relevant pleading requirements, a court may not deny the petition without a hearing. In reaching its decision, the Court stated that, even after a hearing on the merits, a petition is not necessarily doomed because it relies on evidence that \u201cmerely impeaches\u201d a witness, as opposed to evidence that directly exculpates a criminal defendant. <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 260, 116 A.3d 477. In so doing, the Court implied that a court should not dismiss a petition because it cites evidence that \u201cmerely impeaches\u201d a witness, but does not directly exculpate the defendant. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Because the circuit court dismissed Snead\u2019s petition on account of his failure to meet a standard that no longer appears to apply, we vacate the order that dismissed his petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">A. <em>Snead\u2019s Convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">On December 22, 1998, a man pointed a semi-automatic handgun into a crowd of people standing at a bus stop on the 2400 block of East Fayette Street in Baltimore City. He feed several shots, hitting three persons. One of the victims, Timothy Thornton, recognized the shooter as someone he had previously seen in the neighborhood. Later, Thornton positively identified Snead from a photo array as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Snead was charged with attempted murder and other offenses related to the incident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He made a number of discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ery requests, including a motion to produce documents and a motion for disclosure of exculpatory oral communications. At trial, Thornton testified that Snead was the person who shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On May 25, 2000, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City convicted Snead of assault in the first degree, openly carrying a handgun, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, possession of a regulated firearm by a person with a disqualifying conviction, and three counts of reckless endangerment. The court sentenced Snead to an aggregate prison term of 35 years. This Court later affirmed his convictions in an unreported opinion. <em>Snead v. State, </em>No. 680, Sept. Term 2000 (filed May 7, 2001). The Court of Appeals denied a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In 2009, Snead petitioned for post-conviction relief. The circuit court denied that petition in 2012, and this Court denied his application for leave to appeal in 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">B. <em>Snead\u2019s Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">On April 1, 2014, Snead filed a petition for writ of actual innocence, proceeding pro se in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Snead claimed that he did not commit the crimes for which he was convicted and that there was newly-discovered evidence that created a substantial or significant possibility that the result of his trial would have been different had the evidence been discovered before his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Snead attached a set of documents as exhibits to his petition. All but one of the documents are database entries<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>made by Detective Raymond Hunter of the Baltimore City Police Department. The reports document Detective Hunter\u2019s investigation of the December 1998 shooting and, in particular, his conversations with the victim, Thornton, between February and October 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">According to Detective Hunter\u2019s reports, Thornton advised the detective on February 22, 1999, that the person who shot him \u201changs at the corner of Collington and Jefferson streets\u201d and wears \u201can army fatigue jacket.\u201d One report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">On 25 Feb 1999 @ 1930 hrs, this detective spoke with the victim Timothy Thornton. Same advised this detective that he saw the person who shot him at the corner of Collington and Jefferson Street wearing a black sweat suit. Same also provided this detective with the street name O.G. for the suspect....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Another report states that the detective received additional information from Thornton on February 27, 1999. According to Thornton, one Leroy Milton, a person who was present at the shooting but not one of the victims, told Thornton that the shooter had been arrested outside of a bar on the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">In his petition, Snead alleged that these reports came into his possession when they were accidentally included during discovery in connection with a separate prosecution \u201clong after this case was adjudicated.\u201d Snead alleged that he was incarcerated in February 1999, when the witnesses claimed to have seen the shooter, and thus he could not have been at either of the locations cited in the detective\u2019s notes. According to Snead, therefore, this evidence showed that Thornton and Milton identified someone other than Snead as the shooter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Snead further alleged that, at his trial, Detective Hunter had testified that Thornton never informed him that he had spotted the person who shot him. Snead also alleged that, according to the detective, Thornton did not provide a description of the shooter\u2019s appearance. Snead argued that the detective\u2019s undisclosed reports were \u201cexculpatory to the extent that they show [Snead] could not have been the shooter and/or that perjury was committed to gain th[e] conviction[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">C. <em>Dismissal of Snead\u2019s Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The State did not file a response to Snead\u2019s petition. On April 16, 2014, the circuit court issued an order stating that Snead\u2019s petition failed to describe newly-discovered evidence. The court concluded that \u201cthe newly discovered evidence alleged by the Petitioner has no \u2018direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review,\u2019 <em>Keyes v. State, 215 </em>Md.App. 660, 673 [84 A.3d 141] (2014), citing <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 698, 884 A.2d 694 (2005).\u201d Consequently, the court dismissed Snead\u2019s petition, without a hearing, pursuant to C.P. \u00a7 8-301(e)(2), for failure to assert grounds upon which the petition could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">On April 22, 2014, Snead noted a timely appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\n<em>Question Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Snead\u2019s appeal presents a single question: Did the circuit court err in dismissing the petition for writ of actual innocence without a hearing?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>In concluding that the evidence described in Snead\u2019s petition did not meet the standard for \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d the court relied on a line of cases that the Court of Appeals has since limited. In light of the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Hunt and Hardy, </em>443 Md. 238, 116 A.3d 477 (2015), we vacate the circuit court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">A. <em>Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In criminal cases in a Maryland circuit court, a defendant may move for a new trial within ten days after a verdict. Md. Rule 4-331(a). After that ten-day period has passed, a court may \u201cgrant a new trial or other appropriate relief on the ground of newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by due diligence\u201d within ten days after the verdict. Md. Rule 4-331(c). Generally, a person must move for a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence within one year after the court\u2019s imposition of sentence or after the date the court receives a mandate issued by the final appellate court to consider a direct appeal from the judgment, whichever is later. Md. Rule 4-331(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">A petition for writ of actual innocence is a collateral, civil proceeding through which a criminal defendant may, at any time, challenge his or her conviction, sentence, or imprisonment. <em>State v. Seward, </em>220 Md.App. 1, 16-17, 102 A.3d 798 (2014), <em>cert. granted, </em>441 Md. 666, 109 A.3d 665 (2015). The authorizing statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">Claims of newly discovered evidence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">(a) A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>crime may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">(2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">C.P. \u00a7 8-301(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">An actual innocence petition must: \u201c(1) be in writing; (2) state in detail the grounds on which the petition is based; (3) describe the newly discovered evidence; (4) contain or be accompanied by a request for hearing if a hearing is sought; and (5) distinguish the newly discovered evidence claimed in the petition\u201d from evidence claimed in any prior petition for actual innocence. C.P. \u00a7 8-301(b). For petitions filed on or after October 1, 2011, Rule 4-332 sets forth a number of additional substantive requirements. <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 248-49, 116 A.3d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u201cThe court may dismiss a petition without a hearing if the court finds that the petition fails to assert grounds on which relief may be granted.\u201d C.P. \u00a7 8\u2014301(e)(2); <em>see </em>Md. Rule 4-332(i)(l)(A) (providing that \u201cthe court may dismiss the petition if it finds as a matter of law that the petition fails to comply substantially with the requirements of [Rule 4\u2014322(d) ] or otherwise fails to assert grounds on which relief may be granted\u201d). If, however, the petition satisfies the requirements of section 8-301(b) and a hearing was requested, the court must hold a hearing. C.P. \u00a7 8\u2014301(e)(1). At a hearing on the merits, the petitioner bears the ultimate burden of proof. C.P. \u00a7 8-301(g). If the petitioner meets that burden, \u201cthe court may set aside the verdict, resentence, grant a new trial, or correct the sentence, as the court considers appropriate.\u201d C.P. \u00a7 8\u2014301(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">In <em>Douglas and Curtis v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 165, 31 A.3d 250 (2011), the Court of Appeals recognized that the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>a petition for writ of actual innocence is an appealable final judgment. In that consolidated case, the Court reviewed two petitions for writs of actual innocence that circuit courts had dismissed without a hearing. Construing the standard for dismissal expressed in section 8\u2014301(e)(2), the Court explained that the statute requires only \u201cthat a petition \u2018assert\u2019 grounds for relief; it does not require the petitioner to satisfy the burden of proving those grounds in the papers submitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 31 A.3d 250. In assessing whether a petition satisfies the pleading requirement, the circuit court must \u201cdetermine whether the allegations could afford a petitioner relief, if those allegations would be proven at a hearing,\u201d after viewing \u201cthe facts in the light most favorable to the petitioner and accepting all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 31 A.3d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Because the two petitioners in that case were both pro se inmates, the Court stated that a court should liberally construe their petitions. <em>See id. </em>at 182-83, 31 A.3d 250 (citing <em>State v. Matthews, </em>415 Md. 286, 298, 999 A.2d 1050 (2010)). Applying that standard to Douglas\u2019s petition, the Court held that Douglas adequately \u201calleged grounds that, if proven, could entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 185, 31 A.3d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Douglas had made assertions, supported by a newspaper article published many years after his trial, that a ballistics expert had falsified his credentials at his trial and hundreds of other trials. \u201c[V]iewing the inferences in the light most favorable to Douglas,\u201d the Court held that \u201cit could be that [this] evidence could not have been discovered within time to move for a new trial under Rule 4-331.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 31 A.3d 250. Furthermore, the Court held that the \u201callegations assert a basis that the newly discovered evidence \u2018creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result [of Douglas\u2019s trial] may have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting C.P. \u00a7 8-301(a)(l)). Accordingly, even though \u201cit [did] not follow automatically that he [could] prove his claim\u201d on the merits, the Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Douglas was entitled to a hearing on his petition. <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 186, 31 A.3d 250.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Douglas </em>did not explicitly announce a standard of appellate review of decisions rejecting petitions for writs of actual innocence, but subsequent cases have established that the standard depends on whether the court denied the petition after a hearing on the merits or dismissed the petition without a hearing because of the insufficiency of the pleadings. If the circuit court denies the petition after a hearing, the appellate court reviews that decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ward v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 146, 156, 108 A.3d 507 (2015); <em>Yonga v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 45, 56, 108 A.3d 448 <em>cert. granted, </em>442 Md. 515, 113 A.3d 624 (2015); <em>Seward, </em>220 Md.App. at 25, 102 A.3d 798; <em>Jackson v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 347, 363, 86 A.3d 97 <em>cert. denied, </em>438 Md. 740, 93 A.3d 289 (2014). On the other hand, if the circuit court dismisses the petition without a hearing based on the legal sufficiency of the pleadings, we review the decision de novo. <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 256, 116 A.3d 477; <em>Hawes v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 105, 133, 85 A.3d 291 (2014); <em>Keyes, </em>215 Md.App. at 669-70, 84 A.3d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">B. <em>Distinction Between \u201cImpeaching\u201d and \u201cMerely Impeaching\u201d Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In dismissing Snead\u2019s petition without a hearing, the circuit court relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Keyes </em>to conclude that the evidence described in his pleadings \u201cha[d] no \u2018direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review.\u2019\u201d <em>Keyes, </em>215 Md.App. at 673, 84 A.3d 141 (quoting <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 698, 884 A.2d 694 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 Md. 501, 889 A.2d 418 (2006)). On appeal, the State, too, relies almost entirely upon <em>Keyes, </em>arguing that Snead\u2019s evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>dence would have merely impeached other testimony, but could not have created a substantial or significant possibility of a different result. In light of <em>Hunt, </em>however, a petition is not necessarily doomed, even on a hearing on the merits, solely because it depends on evidence that \u201cmerely\u201d impeaches a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 259, 116 A.3d 477. It follows that a circuit court should not dismiss a petition on that ground, as long as the pleading substantially complies in all other respects with the requirements for a petition for a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The distinction between evidence that is \u201cimpeaching\u201d and evidence that is \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d arose in the context of appellate review of a circuit court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny a motion for a new trial after a hearing under Rule 4-331. In <em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 688, 884 A.2d 694, the petitioner moved for a new trial on the ground that, one day after his conviction for child sexual abuse, the victim told a family member that her parents had pressured her into testifying. At a hearing on the merits of that motion, however, the victim herself denied making any such statement to the family member. <em>Id. </em>at 692-93, 884 A.2d 694. Under those circumstances, we reasoned that because the alleged statement could serve only as collateral impeachment evidence of the victim\u2019s testimony, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the family member\u2019s statement was insufficiently material to warrant a new trial. <em>See id. at </em>695-99, 884 A.2d 694. Writing for the Court, Judge Moylan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">The distinction between \u201cimpeaching\u201d and \u201cmerely impeaching,\u201d albeit nuanced, is pivotally important. Newly discovered evidence that a State\u2019s witness had a number of convictions for crimes involving truth and veracity or had lied on a number of occasions about other matters might have a bearing on that witness\u2019s testimonial credibility, but would not have a direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review. Such evidence would constitute collateral impeachment and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence was that the State\u2019s witness had been mistaken, or even deliberately false, about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>inconsequential details that did to [sic] go to the core question of guilt or innocence, such evidence would offer peripheral contradiction and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence, on the other hand, was that the State\u2019s witness had actually testified falsely on the core merits of the case under review, that evidence, albeit coincidentally impeaching, would be directly exculpatory evidence on the merits and could not, therefore, be dismissed as \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 697-98, 884 A.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Later, in <em>Keyes, </em>this Court imported this distinction into a case concerning the propriety of a decision to dismiss a petition for writ of actual innocence without a hearing. Years after his trial and direct appeal, Keyes came into the possession of police reports that the State had failed to disclose before his trial, but had included in discovery materials sent to another inmate. <em>Keyes, </em>215 Md.App. at 664-65, 84 A.3d 141. Keyes petitioned for a writ of actual innocence, contending that the information would have allowed him to impeach an important witness because of his prior bad acts as \u201ca \u2018big time\u2019 drug dealer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, 84 A.3d 141. After quoting at length the foregoing passage from <em>Jackson, </em>the Court reasoned that the evidence described in Keyes\u2019s petition was \u201cmerely\u201d impeachment evidence and did not amount to grounds for relief under the actual innocence statute. <em>Id. </em>at 672-73, 84 A.3d 141. Reasoning that the evidence did not have \u201c \u2018a direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 673, 84 A.3d 141 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 698, 884 A.2d 694)), this Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition, without a hearing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Since <em>Keyes, </em>this Court has employed this distinction in two cases in which a circuit court denied an actual innocence petition on the merits. <em>See Ward, </em>221 Md.App. at 156-57, 168-69, 108 A.3d 507 (vacating denial of actual innocence petition and reasoning that newly-discovered scientific studies that criticized use of comparative bullet lead analysis were directly exculpatory and could not be disregarded as \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d); <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 367-69, 86 A.3d 97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>(holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying petition for writ of actual innocence after hearing, and reasoning that evidence that ballistics expert had falsified his qualifications was \u201cnot material, but merely impeaching\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Most recently, in <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 257-64, 116 A.3d 477 the Court of Appeals expressed skepticism about the conceptual distinction used by this Court. According to the petitioners in that case, newly-discovered evidence showed that the State\u2019s ballistics expert gave perjured testimony about his credentials. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 116 A.3d 477.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After holding that these allegations could entitle the petitioners to relief, the Court went on to explain that the petitioners were \u201cnot doomed necessarily because the newly discovered evidence ... may be only \u2018impeaching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 116 A.3d 477. Instead, the Court concluded that evidence of \u201cfalsity regarding the expert\u2019s credibility or qualifications might \u2018ereate[] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u2019 [C.P.] \u00a7 8-301(a)(l).\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 264, 116 A.3d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">By way of well-considered dicta, the Court then recounted this Court\u2019s development and application of the distinction between \u201cimpeaching\u201d and \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 259-60, 116 A.3d 477 (describing <em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 697-98, 884 A.2d 694, and <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. 347, 86 A.3d 97).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While declining to comment upon the reasoning of those cases, the Court noted \u201cthat a hearing judge might conclude reasonably that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s distinction between \u2018impeaching\u2019 and \u2018merely impeaching,\u2019 in the context of \u00a7 8-301 petitions for writs of actual innocence, is overly rigid.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 263-64, 116 A.3d 477. The Court added: \u201cThe assumed distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>between \u2018impeaching\u2019 and \u2018merely impeaching\u2019 evidence was in existence at the time we decided <em>Douglas, </em>yet we still concluded that, as Douglas satisfied \u00a7 8-301\u2019s pleading standard, a hearing judge could conclude that Douglas could have been entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264 n. 26, 116 A.3d 477. In other words, even though it is arguable that the evidence in <em>Douglas </em>was no more than \u201cmerely impeaching,\u201d the Court was not deterred from reversing the decision to dismiss his petition without a hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019s comments in <em>Hunt </em>are in tension with this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Keyes. </em>In <em>Keyes, </em>215 Md.App. at 672-73, 84 A.3d 141 we concluded that the petitioner\u2019s pleadings were legally insufficient and that it was permissible to dismiss the petition without a hearing, because the allegations would have merely impeached the credibility of a prosecution witness. In <em>Hunt, </em>by contrast, the Court of Appeals stated that a petition is \u201cnot doomed necessarily\u201d even on the merits simply \u201cbecause the newly discovered evidence ... may be only \u2018impeaching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 258-59, 116 A.3d 477. To the contrary, as long as a court could reasonably conclude that the newly-discovered evidence, if believed, could create a substantial or significant possibility of a different result, the court may not dismiss a petition based on the \u201coverly rigid\u201d classification of the type of evidence described. <em>See id. </em>at 264, 116 A.3d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Returning to the instant case, we hold that, in light of the intervening decision in <em>Hunt, </em>the circuit court was legally incorrect in concluding that Snead\u2019s petition failed to describe newly-discovered evidence within the meaning of C.P. \u00a7 8-301. The allegations in Snead\u2019s petition, if believed, could show that a detective testified falsely at Snead\u2019s trial regarding identifications made by the victim. <em>See Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 259, 116 A.3d 477; <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 186, 31 A.3d 250. Moreover, the evidence, if believed, could tend to exculpate Snead by showing that the victim had identified someone other than Snead as the shooter. <em>See Hawes, </em>216 Md.App. at 135-36, 85 A.3d 291 (holding that undisclosed police report, documenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>interview in which eyewitness indicated that she was unable to identify shooter, could create a substantial or significant possibility of different result if believed).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Snead and accepting all reasonable inferences that are to be drawn from the petition, we conclude that Snead has claimed \u201ca basis that the newly discovered evidence \u2018creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result [of Snead\u2019s trial] may have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 186, 31 A.3d 250 (quoting C.P. \u00a7 8-301(a)(1)). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Because the circuit court decided the case solely on the ground that the evidence described in the petition was inadequate under <em>Keyes, </em>we express no opinion on the legal sufficiency of the other aspects of Snead\u2019s petition, including whether Snead adequately alleged that he could not have discovered the newly-discovered evidence in time to move for a new trial under Rule 4-331. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4\u2014322(d)(6); <em>Hawes, </em>216 Md.App. at 136, 85 A.3d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\">. The circuit court's docket states that Snead is also known by the name \"Sneed.\u201d Some filings in this case use the name \"Sneed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\">. The record of Snead\u2019s post-conviction proceeding is not before this Court. Snead\u2019s petition for writ of actual innocence states that one issue in the post-conviction proceeding was whether the State had fulfilled its disclosure obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-12\">. Snead describes the database as \"Lotus Notes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">. The Slate\u2019s brief construes the petition as alleging that Snead was incarcerated at the time of the December 1998 shooting. In fact, Snead alleges that he was incarcerated in February 1999, at the times when witnesses reported that they identified the person who had shot them three months earlier. Snead did not allege that he had an alibi for the shooting, but that witnesses made an exculpatory identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b127-10\">. The petition's final exhibit was a hand-drawn diagram of the 2400 block of Fayette Street, marking the location of shell casings and of one victim. According to the petition, the location of the shell casings demonstrates that they could not have come from the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\">. As stated in Snead's brief, the question presented is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">Due to the Appellant\u2019s blindness and the fact that trial counsel testified she had never seen any \"Lotus Notes\u201d prior to or during trial, and regarding the fact that this \u201cLotus Note\u201d contained impeachment and possibly exculpatory evidence, would this allow it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>be deemed \"newly discovered evidence\" through the trial counsel\u2019s and Appellant\u2019s having never before reviewed this note prior to or during trial, and the blind Appellant never having it brought to his attention until recently was not able to present it at any previous review?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">. The Court reached a different conclusion with respect to Curtis, the other petitioner in that consolidated case. Curtis based his petition on an affidavit in which his grandmother contradicted the testimony of a police witness. <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 186-87, 31 A.3d 250. The Court reasoned that the grandmother\u2019s statement was not \"newly discovered\u201d evidence because that information was known to Curtis after his trial. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 31 A.3d 250.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">. The same high-ranking ballistics expert, Joseph Kopera, allegedly gave false testimony about his credentials in four of the trials mentioned here. <em>Hunt, </em>443 Md. at 242, 116 A.3d 477 (Hunt\u2019s petition); <em>id. </em>at 245, 116 A.3d 477 (Hardy\u2019s petition); <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 167, 31 A.3d 250; <em>Jackson, </em>216 Md.App. at 356-57, 86 A.3d 97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">.

The decision in <em>Hunt </em>makes it unnecessary to analyze whether the evidence described by Snead was, in fact, \"impeaching\u201d or \"merely impeaching,\u201d as this Court has used those terms in cases such as <em>Keyes. Keyes, </em>however, may have been distinguishable even without the Court's recent clarification. The evidence described by Snead was much more directly related to the merits of his case than the evidence described by Keyes. Unlike Keyes, Snead did not only seek to attack the credibility of the detective and the victim; he also sought to show that the detective had testified falsely and that the victim actually had identified a different person as the shooter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
