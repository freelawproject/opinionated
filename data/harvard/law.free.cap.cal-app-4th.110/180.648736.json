Vinson claimed, and the jury found, that Johnson violated Vinson\u2019s right to privacy by announcing at a March 17, 1999 managerial meeting, in the presence of numerous other employees with no interest in the matter, that Vinson would be reprimanded and directing her to write her own letter of reprimand, and by then distributing to a much larger number of additional employees the minutes of the meeting, in which this disciplinary action was reported in bold print. There was substantial evidence that these disclosures violated explicit departmental policy concerning the confidentiality of such personnel matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Vinson\u2019s fourth cause of action alleged that as the result of this invasion of her privacy interests, \u201cshe was subject to embarrassment, shame, became an object of ridicule, and suffered extreme emotional distress and upset.\u201d Based on the evidence, the jury awarded Vinson $10,000 for the harm to her interest in privacy resulting from each of the two invasions and for the mental distress which they caused. Defendants\u2019 pretrial motion for judgment on the pleadings, based on the contention that workers\u2019 compensation provides the exclusive remedy for this claim, was denied in the law and motion department and this ruling was reaffirmed by the trial judge after the verdict had been returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201cLabor Code section 3600, subdivision (a), [fn. omitted] provides that, subject to certain particular exceptions and conditions, workers.\u2019 compensation liability \u2018in lieu of any__otiher liability whatsoever\u2019 will exist ...\u2018against, an employer for any injury-sustained' by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u2019 ... [T]he basis for the exclusivity rule in workers'\u2019\"compensation law is the \u2018presumed \u201ccompensation bargain,\u201d pursuant to which the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability. The employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but, in exchange, gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.\u2019 <em>(Shoemaker </em>[v. <em>Myers </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1 at p. 16 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054]].) [f] [The Supreme Court] recognized in <em>Shoemaker </em>and elsewhere, however, that certain types of injurious employer misconduct remain outside this bargain. There are some instances in which, although the injury arose in the course of employment, the employer engaging in that conduct \u2018 \u201cstepped out of [its] proper role[]\u201d \u2019 or engaged in conduct of \u2018 \u201cquestionable relationship to the employment.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fermino v.

While section 3600 enumerates a list of \u201cconditions of compensation\u201d that must concur, the first step normally entails simply determining whether the plaintiff is seeking to recover for \u201cindustrial personal injury or death\u201d <em>(Shoemaker v. Myers </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 16 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054] <em>(Shoemaker)), </em>i.e., for personal injury or death sustained in and arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>out of the course and scope of employment. (Ibid.; <em>Vacanti, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 812-814; <em>Livitsanos v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 752-753 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195] <em>(Livitsanos).)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If the plaintiff\u2019s claim comes within the conditions of compensation\u2014i.e., if it is a claim for personal injury or death arising out of the course and scope of employment\u2014one reaches the second step in the exclusivity analysis, which is to determine whether the acts or motives giving rise to the injury constitute \u201c \u2018a risk reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain.\u2019 <em>(Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16.)\u201d <em>(Vacanti, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 819-820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The sole decision cited by the trial court in denying defendants\u2019 motion here was <em>Davaris v. Cubaleski </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1583 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 330], in which the Court of Appeal agreed with an earlier Court of Appeal decision in <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Balma </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 899 [192 Cal.Rptr. 286] <em>(Howland) </em>that a cause of action for defamation arising out of the course of employment is not barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. As pointed out by the court in <em>Davaris. .v. Cubaleski, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Livitsanos </em>had expressly declined to decide this issue, but had observed that \u201c \u2018[a] number of courts have apparently determined that the gravamen of an action for libel or slander jsjdamage to \u201creputation,\u201d a \u201cproprietary\u201d as distinct from a physical or mental injury, and therefore have concluded that defamation does not lie within the purview of the workers\u2019 compensation law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Davaris, supra, </em>at p. 1590; quoting <em>Livitsanos, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 757, fn. 9.)  In <em>Shoemaker, </em>which was decided before <em>Livitsanos, </em>the Supreme Court itself had cited <em>Howland </em>to indicate that workers\u2019 compensation is not the exclusive remedy for workplace defamation, in support of the broader proposition that the exclusive remedy provisions apply only in cases of industrial personal injury or death. <em>(Shoemaker, supra, 52 </em>Cal.3d at p. 16.) More recently, in <em>Vacanti, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that \u201ccourts have exempted defamation claims from exclusivity because an injury to reputation does not depend on a personal injury.\u201d <em>(Vacanti, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 814, citing <em>Howland, supra, </em>at p. 904.) Thus, while the Supreme Court has not yet explicitly passed on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>question, its opinions to date and the decisions of the Courts of Appeal all indicate that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not preclude a civil action for defamation against one\u2019s employer\u2014but for a reason that does not extend to claims for the invasion of privacy. A claim for defamation does not satisfy the conditions of compensation because it is not considered to be based on a personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">In contrast, \u201c[t]he gist of the cause of action in a privacy case is not injury to the character or reputation, but a direct wrong of a personal character resulting in injury to the feelings without regard to any effect which the publication may have on the property, business, pecuniary interest, or the standing of the individual in the community. [Citations.] The right of privacy concerns one\u2019s own peace of mind, while the right of freedom from defamation concerns primarily one\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>(Fairfield </em>v. <em>American Photocopy Equipment Co. </em>(1955) 138 Cal.App.2d 82, 86 [291 P.2d 194].)  The decision in <em>Howland </em>was based on this distinction and on the premise that the \u201c \u2018key to whether the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act precludes a common law right of action lies in the nature of the injury for which plaintiff makes claim, not the nature of defendant\u2019s act which plaintiff alleges to have been responsible for the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Howland, </em>supra, 143 Cal.App.3d at p. 904.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   The elements of emotional distress damages arising from a breach of privacy are \u201canxiety, embarrassment, humiliation, shame, depression, feelings of powerlessness, anguish, etc.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1463, 1485 [232 Cal.Rptr. 668]), precisely the harm that Vinson claimed and on which the jury was instructed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, unlike the damage to one\u2019s reputation caused by defamation, the nature of the harm from the breach of the right to privacy does constitute a personal injury, bringing such a claim within the conditions of compensation and satisfying the first step of the exclusivity analysis. <em>(Livitsanos, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 753-754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">While an invasion of privacy claim may not be analogous to a defamation claim for this purpose, Vinson\u2019s claim may nonetheless avoid the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act under the second step of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>analysis. As pointed out above, \u201cthe exclusive remedy provisions are not applicable under certain circumstances, sometimes variously identified as \u2018conduct where the employer or insurer stepped out of their proper roles\u2019 [citations], or \u2018conduct of an employer having a \u201cquestionable relationship to the employment\u201d [citations], but which may be essentially defined as not stemming from a risk reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain.\u201d <em>(Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16.) In <em>Vacanti, </em>the Supreme Court most recently observed that the courts have long \u201cstruggled to define the contours of this exception to workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity.\u201d <em>(Vacanti, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 820.) \u201cWhen determining whether the exception applies to a cause of action, courts first determine whether the alleged acts that give rise to that cause of action are \u2018of the kind that [are] within the compensation bargain.\u2019 [Citation.] In making this determination, courts may consider only those acts that relate to an element of the cause of action. Where those acts are \u2018a normal part of the employment relationship\u2019 [citation] ..., the cause of action is subject to exclusivity. Otherwise it is not.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u201cIn addition to the acts themselves, the motive element of a cause of action may insulate that cause of action from the purview of the exclusive remedy provisions. This exception to exclusivity, however, is quite limited. \u2018[A]ny inquiry into an employer\u2019s motivation is undertaken not to determine whether the employer intentionally or knowingly injured the employee, but rather to ascertain whether the employer\u2019s conduct violated public policy and therefore fell outside the compensation bargain.\u2019 [Citation.] In other words, the motive element of a cause of action excepts that cause of action from exclusivity <em>only if </em>it violates a fundamental public policy of this state. [Citation.] Thus, we have refused to bar both statutory and tort claims where their motive element violates such a policy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Vacanti, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 823, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In <em>Cole, </em>the Supreme Court held that an employer\u2019s intentional misconduct\u2014there, alleged harassment by a superior\u2014is not necessarily outside the employment bargain, so that ordinarily workers\u2019 compensation is the exclusive remedy for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The acts of misconduct alleged there \u201creflect matters which can be expected to occur with substantial frequency in the working environment. Some harassment by superiors when there is a clash of personality or values is not uncommon. Disciplinary hearings and demotions and friction in negotiations as to grievances are also an inherent part of the employment setting ....\u201d <em>(Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 161.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In <em>Livitsanos, </em>however, the Supreme Court remanded a cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, and a claim for defamation, for further consideration of whether the employer\u2019s misconduct alleged there\u2014\u201ca campaign of outrageous and harassing conduct, which included falsely claiming that plaintiff embezzled money\u201d from his employer, and economic coercion\u2014exceeded the normal risks of the employment relationship. <em>(Livitsanos, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 756.) Similarly, in <em>Fermino, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for false imprisonment against her employer for detaining her while investigating an alleged theft was maintainable because such conduct was deemed to \u201cviolate the employee\u2019s reasonable expectations and transgress the limits of the compensation bargain.\u201d <em>(Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 723, fn. 7.) The Supreme Court there recognized \u201cthe right of an employer to reasonably detain an employee suspected of theft, and indeed to discharge an employee\u2014consistent with the employee\u2019s contractual or other employment rights\u2014if he or she refuses to cooperate with a reasonable investigation. But the question whether' [employer\u2019s] actions were reasonable, justifiable, or privileged goes to the factual question <em>whether </em>its actions constituted false imprisonment.... Once it is determined, however, that a false imprisonment has indeed taken place, then such action cannot be said to be a normal aspect of the employment relationship, however legitimate its initial justification, any more than an assault on an employee can be brought within the scope of the exclusivity rule by claiming it was motivated by the need for employee discipline.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 723, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In our view, it is a close question whether the invasion of Vinson\u2019s privacy that was alleged and proven here may be considered \u201ca normal part of the employment relationship.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On one hand, reprimands undoubtedly are \u201ctypical employer actions \u2018such as demotions, promotions, criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances\u2019 [and] do not, by themselves exempt a cause of action from exclusivity.\u201d <em>(Vacanti, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 821, citing <em>Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 160.) This remains true even if in imposing discipline tempers flare and the employer engages in conduct rising to the level of intentional infliction of emotional distress. (E.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Cole, supra, </em>at p. 160.) And it is certainly predictable that knowledge, or at least rumors, that an employee has been disciplined will circulate among fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Yet, while reprimands and their aftermath may in most circumstances be a normal part of the employment relationship, that is not to say that the intentional dissemination of this information to other employees who have no reason to know of it may not in extreme circumstances exceed the known and inherent risks of the workplace. Defendant\u2019s conduct here is subject to the same analysis undertaken in <em>Fermino. </em>There, the court pointed out that \u201ca \u2018reasonable\u2019 false imprisonment is oxymoronic. False imprisonment is, by definition, an unreasonable and indeed criminal confinement. [Citation.] ... When an employer forcibly and criminally deprives an employee of her liberty, even as a means to otherwise legitimate ends, it steps outside its \u2018proper role\u2019 ....\u201d <em>(Fermino, supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 721-722.)  So too here, the invasion of Vinson\u2019s constitutional right of privacy by definition necessarily involved conduct that went beyond \u201cbroadly based and widely accepted community norms\u201d of acceptable employer conduct. As the trial court instructed the jury, Vinson was entitled to recover only if she had \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy as to the interests invaded\u201d and defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cconstitute^] an egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury found that defendants\u2019 conduct crossed this high threshold, and defendants have not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support this finding.  While defendants\u2019 conduct was not criminal, as was the false imprisonment alleged in <em>Fermino, </em>the conduct violated a right conferred by the California Constitution and thus was contrary to a fundamental public policy. The violation of such a clearly articulated public policy reinforces the basis for holding defendants\u2019 conduct to exceed what may be considered normal employer behavior within the compensation bargain. <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1097-1101 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680] <em>(Gantt), </em>overruled on another ground in <em>Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 80, fn. 6 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046]; <em>Vacanti, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 823.) \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Gantt, </em>we [the Supreme Court] reaffirmed Shoemaker[, <em>supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 1] and extended its holding to a case involving a common law wrongful discharge cause of action. We concluded that \u2018the ... \u201ccompensation bargain\u201d cannot encompass conduct, such as sexual or racial discrimination, \u201cobnoxious to the interests of the state and contrary to public policy and sound morality.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Moorpark v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1143, 1155 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 959 P.2d 752].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">This analysis leads to the conclusion that the trial court correctly held that Vinson\u2019s claim for the invasion of her constitutional right to privacy was not precluded by the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We acknowledge some discomfort with this conclusion. A disciplined employee may allege the invasion of his or her privacy almost as easily as one may allege the intentional infliction of emotional distress. While an employee establishing such a claim is entitled under our view to pursue the cause of action in superior court, if the claim is rejected it follows that the matter should never have been in superior court in the first place. It is hardly desirable to have the jurisdictional determination dependent on the outcome of the case on its merits. Where the employee does not prevail at trial, the employer will nonetheless have lost the benefit of the \u201ccompensation bargain\u201d because the employer already will have been put to the burden of defending a claim that should have been before the WCAB. Ultimately, this consequence may be attributable to the difficulty, if not the inherent impossibility, of adopting a bright-line test to distinguish between a normal and abnormal \u201cpart of the employment relationship.\u201d As the preceding discussion makes clear, our Supreme Court has steadfastly rejected any such bright-line approach. (E.g., <em>Vacanti, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 819-820, 823; <em>Fermino, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 708; <em>Livitsanos, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 754; <em>Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1100; <em>Shoemaker, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 16; <em>Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In this case defendants never disputed the sufficiency of the conduct that Vinson alleged and the jury found to constitute a violation of the constitutional right of privacy. There is no basis to assume that every time a coemployee learns of discipline imposed on another employee, there will be a violation of the constitutional right of privacy. By critically evaluating the sufficiency of complaints asserting such a violation, trial courts should be able to reject at the pleading stage most complaints that attempt to circumvent the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme by frivolously alleging an invasion of this right. However, the merit of Vinson\u2019s claim has been established, and she is entitled to recover for the invasion of her constitutionally protected right.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">IV.

Code, \u00a7 3600), and the employer\u2019s conduct neither contravenes fundamental public policy <em>(Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>[(1980)] 27 Cal.3d 167 [164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330]) nor exceeds the risks inherent in the employment relationship <em>(Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 148), an employee\u2019s emotional distress injuries are subsumed under the exclusive remedy provisions of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d <em>(Livitsanos, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 754.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\"> We emphasize that defendants do not dispute that the intentional disclosure of Vinson\u2019s reprimand to coemployees with no need to know is sufficient to constitute a violation of the constitutional right to privacy, nor do they challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to establish these facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\"> The jury was instructed in accordance with BAJI No. 7.25.1 as follows: \u201cThe plaintiff Bonita Vinson also seeks to recover damages based upon a claim of a violation of plaintiff\u2019s California Constitutional right to privacy. [ft] The essential elements of such claim are: [ft] 1. The defendant engaged in conduct which invaded plaintiff\u2019s privacy interests; [ft] 2. Plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of privacy as to the interests invaded; [ft] 3. The invasion of privacy was serious; [ft] 4. Such serious invasion of privacy caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm, [ft] A reasonable expectation of privacy is an objective entitlement founded upon broadly based and widely accepted community norms. Such determination must be relative to the customs of the time and place, the occupation of the plaintiff, and the habits of his or her neighbors or fellow citizens, and the extent to which the plaintiff voluntarily consented or participated in activities impacting privacy interests, [ft] An invasion of a privacy interest must be serious, that is, the invasion must constitute an egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> In <em>Luck v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1, 26-29 [267 Cal.Rptr. 618], the Court of Appeal held that an employee\u2019s termination for refusal to submit to urinalysis as an exercise of the employee\u2019s constitutional right to privacy did not support a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy because exercise of the constitutional right did not inure to the benefit of the public. \u201cThe right to privacy is, by its very name, a private right, not a public one.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28.) Since the parties could have lawfully agreed that the employee would submit to urinalysis without violating any public interest, \u201cthere was no violation of <em>public </em>policy\u201d in terminating the employee for the refusal to so agree. <em>(Ibid.) </em>By extension, <em>Luck </em>may stand for the proposition that defendants properly could have terminated Vinson for refusing to agree to the dissemination of the disciplinary action against her, but the case does not suggest that defendants were free to disregard Vinson\u2019s privacy rights without her consent, or that such unilateral action was part of the normal employment relationship.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
