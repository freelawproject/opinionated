S.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1522-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-6\">This appeal raises a question of the first impression about the obligation of the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA). The specific issue is whether CIGA is required to pay the claim of an insured of an insolvent insurer when the claim is based upon a judgment the insured obtained against the insurer prior to insolvency for breach of the contractual duty to defend. The judgment reflects the amount the insured paid for legal representation to defend himself after the insurer declined his tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-7\">CIGA contended, and the trial court agreed, that it had no obligation to pay based upon subdivision (h) of Insurance Code section 1063.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That provision provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 [for which CIGA is liable] shall not include any loss adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses, attorney fees and expenses, court costs, interest, and bond premiums, incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator [for the insolvent insurer].\u201d In a nutshell, CIGA\u2019s position and that of our dissenting colleague is that because the insured\u2019s judgment is to compensate him for attorney fees he incurred before the insurer became insolvent, the judgment and therefore the claim presented to CIGA is the functional equivalent of a claim for loss adjustment expenses for which CIGA is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-8\">We reject CIGA\u2019s analysis. The insured\u2019s judgment against the insurer is not a loss adjustment expense. In the insurance industry, the phrase \u201closs adjustment expenses\u201d generally means the expense incurred by the insurer to investigate and settle a claim. Simply stated, an insured does not incur loss adjustment expenses because the insured does not initiate or control the loss adjustment process. The insured\u2019s reasonable expectation is that the insurer will engage in that process. That, in fact, is one of the reasons insurance is obtained. Consequently, when, as here, an insured is faced with a refusal to defend by its insurer and thereafter first retains counsel to defend and later obtains a judgment against the insurer to compensate for damages caused by breach of the contractual duty to defend\u2014damages that can include compensation for monies spent on attorney fees\u2014the insured\u2019s judgment against the insurer cannot reasonably be categorized as one for \u201closs adjustment expenses.\u201d Instead, it reflects compensation awarded to the insured by a court based upon the insurer\u2019s failure to provide a key benefit owed to him under the insurance policy: legal representation. Because we conclude the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1695\">*1695</page-number>in section 1063.2, subdivision (h) does not apply, CIGA is obligated to pay the insured\u2019s claim since, as conceded by CIGA, the insured\u2019s judgment otherwise falls within the statutory definition of a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d We therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-6\">Arch Woodliff owned an apartment building. In 1994, he purchased a commercial property liability insurance policy from LMI Insurance Company (LMI).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-7\">The policy was in effect in 1995 when two actions were brought against Woodliff for violation of the federal Fair Housing Act. The actions alleged discrimination \u201con the basis of familial status.\u201d The actions sought a declaration that Woodliff\u2019s actions were in violation of law, an award of compensatory and punitive damages to the discriminated families, and injunctive relief against further discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-8\">Woodliff tendered defense of the action to LMI. He relied upon the provision that LMI would insure him against all claims made based upon his operation and management of the apartment building. LMI declined to defend. Although the reasons for LMI\u2019s decision are not found in this record, CIGA conceded at oral argument on this appeal that LMI improperly denied a defense to Woodliff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-9\">Woodliff retained counsel to defend against the federal actions. The actions were settled when Woodliff agreed to build a children\u2019s playground in the apartment complex. The settlement did not require Woodliff to pay any money to the plaintiffs. Woodliff incurred attorney fees in defending against these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-10\">In 1997, Woodliff sued LMI, alleging three causes of action. The first was for breach of contract. Woodliff alleged the two federal actions raised claims within the policy\u2019s coverage so that LMI\u2019s refusal to defend was a breach of contract. The second was for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. He alleged LMI \u201crefused without good cause to provide coverage and a defense to [him] despite the existence of facts indicating potential coverage.\u201d The third, for negligent infliction of emotional distress, alleged Woodliff suffered foreseeable emotional distress because of LMI\u2019s failure to defend. For the cause of action for breach of contract, Woodliff sought reimbursement for the attorney fees and costs he had expended to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1696\">*1696</page-number>against the federal lawsuits. For the causes of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and negligent infliction of emotional distress, Woodliff sought damages \u201caccording to proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-4\">In 1999, a court trial was conducted on Woodliff\u2019s action against LMI. Woodliff prevailed in part. The court\u2019s judgment provides: \u201cNo breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Hence, no \u2018Brandt fees\u2019 and no damages. No proof of emotional distress damages. Inadequate proof and no evidence of any such damages over and above what would have been incurred had defendant [LMI] provided a defense under a reservation of rights. <em>Plaintiff Archie Woodliff is entitled to judgment against [LMI] for breach of contract.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The court awarded Woodliff $47,386 plus interest, representing the attorney fees and costs Woodliff had incurred as a result of LMI\u2019s failure to defend him in the federal actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1524-5\">In 2000, LMI declared insolvency prior to paying Woodliff\u2019s judgment. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Woodliff tendered payment of his judgment against LMI to CIGA. CIGA denied any obligation to pay the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-6\">Woodliff sued CIGA for declaratory relief. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment based upon stipulated facts. Both motions raised the same legal issue: Did Woodliff\u2019s claim fall within the statutory exclusion found in section 1063.2, subdivision (h)?</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-7\">Insofar as is relevant to this appeal, the trial court ruled in favor of CIGA as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1524-8\">\u201cThe sole issue in dispute is the interpretation of Ins. Code 1063.2(h). As a statutory entity, CIGA\u2019s duties are expressly defined by the Insurance Code. The Insurance Code defines \u2018covered claims\u2019 and specifically excludes certain obligations for which the insolvent insurer would otherwise be liable. Ins. Code 1063.2(h) excludes loss adjustment expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees. In 1981, the statutory language was amended, deleting the words \u2018adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1697\">*1697</page-number>expense and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the insolvent insurer\u2019 and inserting the language \u2018any loss adjustment expense, court costs, interest and bond premiums incurred.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1525-5\">\u201cCovered claims are not co-extensive with an insolvent insurer\u2019s obligations under its policies. [Citation.] For example, CIGA\u2019s duty to defend is more limited than an insurer\u2019s duty. [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1525-6\">\u201cHD ... fit]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1525-7\">\u201c[T]he fees are expressly excluded by the statutory exception set forth in Ins. Code 1063.2(h). Plaintiff argues that because he and not LMI incurred the attorneys\u2019 fees, the claim does not fall within the exception set forth in the Ins. Code 1063.2(h). However, the above statutory amendment makes it clear that attorneys\u2019 fees are excluded regardless of who incurs them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1525-8\">\u201cm... no</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1525-9\">\u201cAs Defendant has established that attorneys\u2019 fees are excluded from coverage pursuant to Ins. Code 1063.2(h), Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1525-10\">This appeal by Woodliff follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-12\">A. Woodliff\u2019s Claim Is a \u201cCovered Claim\u201d Within the Meaning of Statutory Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-13\">The Courts of Appeal have summarized the history of CIGA and its general principles as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1525-14\">\u201cCIGA was created in 1969 as a compulsory association of state-regulated insurance companies. ([Citation]; \u00a7\u00a7 1063.14; 1063, subd. (a).) Its purpose is \u2018to provide insurance against loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies.\u2019 [Citation.] CIGA assesses its members when another member becomes insolvent, thereby establishing a fund from which insureds whose insurers become insolvent can obtain financial and legal assistance. [Citation.] Member insurers then recoup assessments paid to CIGA by means of a surcharge on premiums to their policy holders. (\u00a7 1063.14, subd. (a).) In this way the insolvency of one insurer does not impact a small segment of insurance consumers, but is spread throughout the insurance consuming public, which in effect subsidizes CIGA\u2019s continued operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1698\">*1698</page-number>\u201cWhile CIGA\u2019s general purpose is to pay the obligations of an insolvent insurer, it is not itself an insurer and \u2018does not \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018CIGA is <em>not </em>in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of insurance.... CIGA issues no policies, collects no premiums, makes no profits, and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.\u2019 [Citation.] Rather it is authorized by statute to pay only \u2018covered claims\u2019 of an insolvent insurer, those determined by the Legislature to be in keeping with the goal of providing protection for the insured public. (\u00a7 1063.2, subd. (a).)\u201d <em>(R. J. Reynolds Co. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 595, 599-600 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 405].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1526-4\">\u201c \u2018Since \u201ccovered claims\u201d are not coextensive with an insolvent insurer\u2019s obligations under its policies, CIGA cannot and does not \u201c \u2018stand in the shoes\u2019 of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.\u201d [Citation.] Indeed, CIGA is \u201cexpressly forbidden\u201d to do so except where the claim at issue is a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d [Citation.] It necessarily follows that CIGA\u2019s first duty is to determine whether a claim placed before it is a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548, 557 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 295].)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1526-5\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1) contains the general definition of a covered claim. It provides, in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 means the obligations of an insolvent insurer, including [those] (i) imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See also <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1626 [283 Cal.Rptr. 104] [\u201cCIGA\u2019s statutory duties can best be defined by examining the contractual duties which were imposed upon the now insolvent insurer either by law or ... policy provisions\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-6\">On this appeal, CIGA concedes \u201cthere is no dispute that the LMI ludgment initially qualifies as a \u2018covered claim\u2019 as that term is defined in Insurance Code section 1063.1(c)(1).\u201d That concession is well taken given our decision in <em>Aloha Pacific, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 297 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 148],</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-7\">There, in regard to the requirement that a \u201ccovered claim\u201d be \u201cimposed by law,\u201d we held: \u201c \u2018A judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 577), and the phrase \u2018imposed by law\u2019 squarely denominates a judgment.... [][] ... [B]y excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1699\">*1699</page-number>from the primary definition of covered claims a default or stipulated judgment against the insolvent insurer, [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] the Legislature necessarily determined that a judgment obtained in an adversary setting would constitute an obligation imposed by law.\u201d <em>(Aloha Pacific, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-5\">In regard to the requirement that a \u201ccovered claim\u201d be \u201cwithin the coverage of the insurance policy of the insolvent insurer,\u201d we concluded the latter phrase \u201cto mean within the risks of loss protected against by an insurance policy. Thus the reading of the pertinent portion of subdivision (c)(1) would be: the obligations of an insolvent insurer within the risks of loss protected against by an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer.\u201d <em>(Aloha Pacific, Inc. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, 79 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 311, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-6\">Particularly relevant to this appeal is the principle that \u201c[standard comprehensive or commercial general liability policies ... provide that the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in any action brought against the insured seeking damages for any covered claim. It has been stated that, so far as the insured is concerned, the duty to defend may be as important as the duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>(Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 45 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766], fn. omitted.) That is, \u201c[a]n insured buys liability insurance in large part to secure a defense against <em>all </em>claims potentially within policy coverage, even frivolous claims unjustly brought.\u201d <em>(Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1076, 1086 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792].) Consequently, an insurer\u2019s failure to defend a claim can constitute a breach of contract for which the insurer can be liable for the insured\u2019s attorney fees, litigation expenses, settlement costs, and the judgment entered against the insured. (See, e.g., <em>Isaacson v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775, 791-792 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297], and <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 508, 528 [88 Cal.Rptr. 246].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-7\">The policy LMI issued to Woodliff provided LMI had \u201cthe right and duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking [specified] damages.\u201d Consequently, one of the risks from which Woodliff sought protection by purchasing the LMI policy was the need to mount a legal defense to claim(s) potentially within the policy\u2019s coverage. That exactly is the risk that materialized. As the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1700\">*1700</page-number>decided in 1999 in rendering judgment in Woodliff\u2019s favor on his breach of contract action against LMI based on a claim of a failure to defend, claims potentially covered by LMI\u2019s policy were made but LMI failed to defend, forcing Woodliff to retain counsel at his own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-4\">The dispositive issue is whether, as CIGA contends, the LMI judgment is excluded from being a statutory claim by virtue of section 1063.2, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   Interpretation of a statute is a question of law. We are not bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation. We examine the issue de novo. <em>(Regents of University of California v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 509, 531 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 257, 976 P.2d 808].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-6\">Because subdivision (h), like all statutory provisions, must be read in context, we first set forth the language of subdivision (a) of section 1063.2. (See, e.g., <em>DeYoung v. City of San Diego </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 11, 18 [194 Cal.Rptr. 722].) Subdivision (a) provides CIGA \u201cshall pay and discharge covered claims and in connection therewith pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions.\u201d Subdivision (h), in turn, limits the obligation to pay loss adjustment expenses. Subdivision (h) provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 shall not include any loss adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses, attorney fees and expenses, court costs, interest, and bond premiums, <em>incurred prior to the appointment of a </em>liquidator.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-7\">CIGA argued, and the trial court agreed, that Woodliff\u2019s judgment was the functional equivalent of a claim for attorney fees incurred as a loss adjustment expense prior to LMI\u2019s liquidation and therefore was not a covered claim within the meaning of section 1063.2, subdivision (h). This is also the position taken by our dissenting colleague. We respectfully disagree with this position because we believe it is based upon an incorrect interpretation of the phrase \u201closs adjustment expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-8\">As the dissent notes, \u201cthe term \u2018loss adjustment expense\u2019 is generally understood to refer to attorney fees and expenses incurred by the carrier in either defending or settling claims against the insured.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>p. 1709.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1701\">*1701</page-number>All of the references we have found support this conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For instance, in <em>Planet Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mead Reinsurance Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 789 F.2d 668, an excess insurer filed a declaratory relief action to construe the meaning of various policy provisions. One provision at issue was a clause that excluded \u201closs adjustment expenses\u201d from \u201cUltimate Net Loss.\u201d  In construing this provision, the court noted: \u201cThe term, \u2018adjustment of losses,\u2019 means the process of ascertaining the value or amount of a loss or negotiating a compromise or settlement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672, citing 6 Appleman (1972) <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 3971.) Consequently, loss adjustment expenses are generally defined as the costs <em>incurred by the insurer </em>in defending and/or settling the claim. The expenses can include payment to attorneys, investigators, experts, outside adjusters, and court reporters. (See <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Quackenbush </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 72-73 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 381]; see also <em>Glossary of Insurance and Risk Management Terms </em>(8th ed. 2001) p. 116 [defining \u201closs adjustment expense\u201d as: \u201cThe cost of investigating and adjusting losses\u201d]; <em>20th Century Ins. Co. v. Garamendi </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 216, 250 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 807, 878 P.2d 566] [administrative regulation promulgated to implement Prop. 103 that refers to \u201callocated loss adjustment expenses\u201d means \u201cthe costs associated with the adjustment of specific claims\u201d]; <em>Beneficial etc. Ins. Co. v. Kurt Hitke &amp; Co. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 517, 520 [297 P.2d 428] [contract between insurer and insurance agency defined \u201closs adjustment expense\u201d as the insurer\u2019s \u201c \u2018allocated\u2019 overhead cost ... in the adjustment of each claim\u201d]; and 14 Holmes\u2019 Appleman on Insurance 2d (1999) Glossary of Reinsurance Terminology, ch. 102, p. 63 [defining \u201closs adjustment expense\u201d as \u201c[t]he expense incurred by the ceding insurer in the defense and settlement of claims under its policies but not the insurer\u2019s overhead expenses\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-5\">The bone of contention is whether the term \u201closs adjustment expenses\u201d in section 1063.2, subdivision (h) also refers to expenses incurred by the insured after the insurer improperly refuses to defend. Neither CIGA nor the dissent offers any authority to support the position that it does. We will conclude the phrase \u201closs adjustment expenses\u201d does not embrace the factual matrix presented on the appeal. At the outset, we note a significant fact: the insured (Woodliff) obtained a judgment against the insurer for breach of contract for failing to defend and was awarded damages to compensate him for the loss caused by the failure to defend. Because the claim Woodliff presented to CIGA is predicated upon a final judgment he obtained against the insurer, this case does not present the question of whether CIGA would be required to pay if an insured simply tendered a bill from an attorney the insured had retained.  Our holding is therefore limited to the situation presented here: a claim made to CIGA after there has been a judicial adjudication the insurer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1702\">*1702</page-number>breached its contractual duty to defend and an award of compensatory damages based upon that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-4\">We first examine the language of section 1063.2.  Subdivision (a) of the statute provides if a claim presented by the insured to CIGA falls within the statutory definition of a covered claim so that CIGA is required to defend, CIGA is required to \u201cpay for or furnish loss adjustment services\u201d ancillary to that defense. However, subdivision (h) then limits CIGA\u2019s obligation to pay for loss adjustment expenses to those incurred after CIGA has become involved. Loss adjustment expenses incurred <em>before </em>a liquidator has been appointed for the now-defunct insurer are specifically excluded from the scope of a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d In other words, CIGA has no obligation for loss adjustment expenses, including attorney fees, incurred to defend the insured <em>before </em>the insurer became insolvent and a liquidator was appointed. As explained below, subdivision (h) simply represents a legislative rejection of a proposal to render CIGA liable for loss adjustment expenses incurred by the insurer before insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-6\">When viewed in this context, section 1063.2, subdivision (h) does not support CIGA\u2019s argument. Woodliff\u2019s claim presented to CIGA was not a claim from a creditor of LMI (e.g., a law firm, outside adjuster, investigator) who had incurred expenses to help defend Woodliff prior to LMI\u2019s insolvency. Instead, the claim was a judgment entered against LMI following a trial in which the court had found LMI had breached its contract with Woodliff by failing to defend him.  The mere fact the judgment amount is based upon the attorney fees Woodliff incurred in defending after LMI declined his tender and before LMI became insolvent and a liquidator was appointed does not transform Woodliff\u2019s claim into a demand for payment of loss adjustment expenses. The key point is that the judgment compensates Woodliff for a benefit under the LMI policy denied to him by LMI: a defense against a covered claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-7\">To a certain extent, CIGA attempts to avoid the force of this conclusion by relying upon some legislative history to subdivisions (a) and (h) of section 1063.2. This approach is not persuasive.  For one thing, in determining the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting a statute, we first look to the words of the statute itself and give those words their usual and ordinary meaning. We only consult legislative materials when the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one reasonable construction. <em>(Granberry </em>v. <em>Islay Investments </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 738, 744 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 650, 889 P.2d 970].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-8\">The language of section 1063.2, subdivision (h) is clear: CIGA is not required to pay loss adjustment expenses incurred prior to the insurer\u2019s insolvency. This furthers the policy behind CIGA of creating an institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1703\">*1703</page-number>that can fulfill the function of providing relief to the insureds of an insolvent insurer because it exempts from CIGA\u2019s obligation any requirement to pay third party vendors such as attorneys, investigators, etc., who had rendered services prior to the insurer\u2019s insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-5\">In any event, the material relied upon by CIGA does not support a contrary conclusion. CIGA first notes a bill was introduced in 1970: (1) to amend subdivision (a) of section 1063.2 to require CIGA to pay \u201closs adjustment services [and] any reasonable necessary defense expenses remaining unpaid on the date of the [insurer\u2019s] insolvency\u201d; and (2) to add subdivision (h) which would read: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 shall include adjustment expense and attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the insolvent insurer prior to the appointment of a liquidator.\u201d CIGA then notes the Legislature rejected these amendments and, instead, amended section 1063.2, subdivision (a) to provide, as it presently reads, CIGA \u201cshall pay and discharge covered claims and in connection therewith pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions.\u201d The earlier language requiring CIGA to also pay \u201creasonable and necessary defense expenses remaining unpaid on the date of the insolvency\u201d had been deleted. Subdivision (h) to section 1063.2 had been amended to include the word \u201cnot\u201d so it then read: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 shall <em>not </em>include adjustment expense and attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the insolvent insurer prior to the appointment of a liquidator.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-6\">This legislative decision to reject the proposal CIGA pay preliquidation loss adjustment expenses does not support CIGA\u2019s present position that it has no obligation to Woodliff\u2019s judgment against LMI. The Legislature simply determined to limit CIGA\u2019s financial responsibility by deleting any responsibility for costs incurred by the insurer prior to insolvency. This distinction has a sound policy basis. As the Michigan Supreme Court explained in rejecting the claims of attorneys for services rendered prior to the insolvency of three insurers as being outside the scope of Michigan\u2019s version of CIGA:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe act is designed to protect from potentially catastrophic loss persons who have a right to rely on the existence of an insurance policy\u2014the insureds and persons with claims against the insureds. Persons in such categories are relatively helpless with regard to the insolvency of an insurer. They are not likely to be in a position to evaluate the financial stability of the insurance company and they have no control over the time at which their claims arise. Other creditors of the insurance companies, such as attorneys, have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1704\">*1704</page-number>ongoing relationship with the company and can presumably judge its financial position. Further, they are in a position to protect themselves from the serious consequences of an insurance company\u2019s insolvency by negotiating appropriate provisions in their contracts regarding the frequency of billing and payment.\u201d <em>(Metry, Metry, Sanom &amp; Ashare v. Mich., etc., supra, </em>267 N.W.2d at p. 697.) The Ohio Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in <em>Ohio Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Simpson </em>(1981) 1 Ohio App.3d 112 [1 Ohio B. 418, 439 N.E.2d 1257]. There the question was whether the Ohio Insurance Guaranty Association was liable to an attorney for services he had provided to an insurance company before its insolvency. The court concluded the claim was not a covered claim within the meaning of the statutory scheme because the purpose of the law was \u201cto protect policyholders and persons who had claims against the policyholders, not general creditors of insolvent insurance companies. [The attorney\u2019s claim] does not arise out of any insurance policy; instead, it arises out of his contract with [the insurer] for legal services.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>439 N.E.2d at p. 1259.)  We therefore conclude that nothing in our state Legislature\u2019s decision to exempt CIGA from liability for preinsolvency expenses suggests it sought to exempt from CIGA\u2019s liability a claim based upon a judgment an insured recovered from the insurer for failing to defend. It merely sought to deny access to CIGA\u2019s financial resources to third party creditors of an insolvent insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-5\">CIGA next points to a 1981 amendment of subdivision (h) of section 1063.2. The amendment had two aspects. First, the language \u201cincurred by the insolvent insurer\u201d was deleted. Second, the definition of loss adjustment expenses was expanded. (Stats. 1981, ch. 1154, \u00a7 2, p. 4614.) As so amended, the provision now reads (as set forth earlier in this opinion): \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 shall not include any loss adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses, attorney fees and expenses, court costs, interest, and bond premiums, incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-6\">From this CIGA argues: \u201c[T]he Legislature clearly expressed an intent to exclude from CIGA\u2019s obligations any pre-liquidation attorneys\u2019 fees and costs regardless of who incurred them (the insolvent insurer, the insured, or anyone else.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-7\">For one thing, nothing in the legislative history of this amendment supports such a conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As counsel for amici curiae noted at oral argument, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1705\">*1705</page-number>is a more pragmatic explanation for the amendment: the elimination of a redundancy since, as explained earlier at pages 1700-1701, loss adjustment expenses are generally interpreted to mean expenses incurred by the insurer, not the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-5\">In any event, the analytical flaw with CIGA\u2019s argument is that it continues to equate a judgment obtained by an insured against the insurer for refusal to defend with \u201cpreliquidation attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d As explained earlier, the two are not the same. In other words, this is not the situation in which the insured has presented CIGA with a bill for services rendered prior to insolvency by a third party (e.g., an attorney) in regard to a claim under the insurer\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, this is a situation in which the insurer failed to defend when it should have, the insured incurred attorney fees, and the insured recovered a judgment for the damages caused by the contractual failure to defend. Woodliff\u2019s claim to CIGA is one made by a policyholder for policy benefits due but not paid by the now insolvent insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-6\">The dissent\u2019s response to our analysis is that a literal reading of section 1062.3, subdivision (h) requires rejection of Woodliff\u2019s argument. Literally applied the dissent\u2019s conclusion is understandable. However, realistically such a conclusion is not acceptable.  A cardinal rule of statutory construction is that a literal meaning of a statute may be disregarded to avoid an absurd result. (See <em>California School Employees Assn. v. Governing Board </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 333, 340 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 878 P.2d 1321]; <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1082, 1098 [282 Cal.Rptr. 841, 811 P.2d 1025]; <em>County of Sacramento v. Hickman </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 841, 849, fn. 6 [59 Cal.Rptr. 609, 428 P.2d 593].) We believe it would be absurd to deny Woodliff recovery from CIGA for a benefit of his policy simply because his claim represents the amount spent on legal representation. For instance, if Woodliff either had to pay money to settle the two federal actions or if he had chosen not to retain counsel but instead defended himself in propria persona and a judgment was rendered against him, he could have also recovered either of those sums as damages in a breach of contract action against LMI. A request to CIGA to pay a claim based upon a judgment for either of those amounts would not have fallen within the exclusionary ambit of subdivision (h)\u2019s bar on recovery of \u201closs adjustment expenses.\u201d The fact Woodliff incurred no damages other than attorney fees and related costs should not result in CIGA being able to deny what it otherwise concedes is a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d It would constitute an absurd result to exempt CIGA from liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1706\">*1706</page-number>merely because the damages recovered were the exact amount spent on legal representation. This result would be nonsensical because it would penalize the insured for having retained counsel and, in effect, would require him to forgo legal representation (an undisputed benefit of his policy with LMI) and leave himself at the mercy of the third-party claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-4\">Requiring CIGA to pay Woodliff\u2019s claim is consistent with CIGA\u2019s objective to protect against a \u201c \u2018loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Biggs </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d 641, 644.) As set forth above, a significant portion of an insured\u2019 s reasonable expectation of coverage is that the insurer will pay to provide a defense against suits within the policy\u2019s coverage. Because CIGA is intended to protect insureds, the risk of that loss (failure to defend) should not be shifted, as CIGA essentially urges, to the insured when prior to insolvency the insured has obtained a judgment based upon the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cSuch a result runs entirely counter to the whole purpose and philosophy behind CIGA which is to <em>protect </em>insureds, not place upon them unusual risks they would not have faced if their insurer has not become insolvent.\u201d <em>(California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1627-1628, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">Our conclusion is fortified by applying a venerable principle of statutory construction. \u201cUnder the familiar rule of construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute, other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wildlife Alive </em>v. <em>Chickering </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 195 [132 Cal.Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537].) As CIGA points out, a two-step approach is taken to decide whether CIGA is liable on a claim. The first step is to determine whether the proffered claim is a \u201ccovered claim\u201d as defined by section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1). As noted earlier, CIGA properly concedes Woodliff\u2019s claim meets that statutory definition. The next step is to determine whether there is any statutory exception to exempt CIGA from liability. We have already rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1707\">*1707</page-number>CIGA\u2019s argument that the exception in subdivision (h) of section 1063.2 applies to this case. However, pertinent to this analysis is another statutory exception: subdivision (g) of section 1063.2. It states a covered claim \u201cshall not include any judgments against or obligations or liabilities of the insolvent insurer ... resulting from alleged or proven torts.\u201d  We believe that by explicitly excluding a tort judgment from the definition of a covered claim, the Legislature implicitly included judgments against the insurer grounded on other theories of law such as breach of contract for failure to defend.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1535-5\"><em>Carver </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1539 [266 Cal.Rptr. 718] is instructive on this point. There, the insurer issued a workers\u2019 compensation policy. An employee of the insured was injured at work. He first filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim and later filed, relying upon Labor Code section 5814,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a petition for a penalty based on the insurer\u2019s failure to make timely payments as required by law. The insurer thereafter became insolvent. In subsequent proceedings, it was conceded CIGA was required to pay the claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits; however, the parties disputed whether CIGA was also liable for the penalty award the workers\u2019 compensation judge had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-6\">CIGA relied upon the provision, now found in subdivision (g) of section 1063.2 that a \u201ccovered claim\u201d does \u201cnot include any judgments against or obligations or liabilities of the insolvent insurer ... resulting from alleged or proven torts.\u201d The Court of Appeal rejected this argument. It held: \u201cWe do not find the fixed percentage assessed by Labor Code section 5814 to be analogous to tort damages in the civil field. We conclude that it is more in the nature of a built-in statutory method of ensuring the timely return to work of injured workers by providing an economic incentive to employers to make the payments due for prompt necessary treatment under the Labor Code. CIGA, as a creature of statute, is bound to pay all covered claims in the absence of a statutory exclusion. No tort liability was imposed on the insolvent workers\u2019 compensation carrier in the instant case, since the Board does not adjudicate tort claims. The amount at issue herein is clearly a workers\u2019 compensation benefit, not tort damages, and is not excluded section 1063.2.\u201d <em>(Carver </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d 1539, 1548, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1708\">*1708</page-number>By a parity of reasoning, Woodliff\u2019s judgment against LMI is likewise a covered claim not within any statutory exclusion. The judgment was based solely on breach of contract; the trial court, in fact, rejected the tort claim. <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judgment compensates Woodliff for a benefit due under the policy: costs of defense. No statutory provision exempts CIGA for liability for this claim. CIGA is therefore liable for the claim as a matter of law, rendering the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to CIGA error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">B.

The trial court is directed to grant Woodliff\u2019s summary judgment motion after determining the disposition of the $6,188.17 (plus interest) that was to be held in trust to satisfy an outstanding claim from Woodliff\u2019s prior counsel.

If that claim was barred by the statute of limitations, Woodliff was to return the $6,188.17 to LMI.

None of it directly addresses the intent behind deleting the phrase \u201cincurred by the insolvent insurer\u201d from subdivision (h). Instead, the legislative history simply indicates that given that CIGA\u2019s purpose is to pay covered claims presented by policyholders and third party claimants and that CIGA has limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1705\">*1705</page-number>financial resources, all pre-insolvency loss adjustment expenses should be treated as general creditor claims to be paid through the liquidation process rather than from CIGA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1533-8\"> As explained earlier, we need not and do not decide whether CIGA would be required to pay if Woodliff simply presented a bill for attorney services rendered to him.

CIGA argues that a ruling in Woodliff\u2019s favor will \u201cessentially create[] a loophole that will lead to abuse, and thus a waste of CIGA\u2019s limited funds .... CIGA [will be] required to pay the expressly excluded preinsolvency fees to the general creditor, as long as it does so indirectly through the insured. An attorney with such a claim will easily avoid application of the statute by simply bringing the claim in the name of his/her client, the insured. If the insured does not consent, one can readily envision a scenario where an attorney with an unpaid balance coerces the insured to institute a claim against CIGA, under the threat of an action for collection against the insured. Such an interpretation elevates form (i.e. the name in which the claim is brought) over substance (i.e. the type of expense CIGA can or cannot pay), thereby fostering abuse, collusion, coercion, and fraud.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1535-7\"> Pursuant to Government Code section 68081, we requested and received supplemental letter briefs on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1535-8\"> Insofar as is relevant, Labor Code section 5814 provides: \u201cWhen payment of compensation has been unreasonably delayed or refused, either prior to or subsequent to the issuance of an award, the full amount of the order, decision, or award shall be increased by 10 percent....

I briefly summarize the pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-11\">Appellant, Arch Woodliff (Woodliff), seeks to collect from the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) the monetary value of a judgment he obtained against his insurance carrier, LMI Insurance Company (LMI). In 1995, LMI refused a tender of defense by Woodliff on a claim admittedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1709\">*1709</page-number>covered by a policy of insurance issued by LMI to Woodliff. As a result, Woodliff personally incurred attorney fees and costs to defend the claim. Woodliff sued LMI and in 1999 obtained the judgment for breach of contract in the amount of $47,386 plus interest, which represents the attorney fees and costs incurred by Woodliff as a result of LMI\u2019s failure to defend. In 2000, before satisfying the judgment, LMI declared insolvency and a liquidator was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">Woodliff tendered his judgment to CIGA which denied the tender. It contended that the attorney fees and costs reflected in the judgment were incurred prior to insolvency of LMI and were thus not \u201ccovered claims\u201d as defined within Insurance Code section 1063.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Woodliff filed suit against CIGA seeking declaratory relief that the judgment did qualify as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within section 1063.2. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and the trial court agreed with CIGA and issued a ruling explaining its decision as set out in the majority opinion. I agree with the ruling by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">As pertinent, section 1063.2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1537-7\">\u201c(a) The association shall pay and discharge covered claims and in connection therewith pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions.... H] ... [][]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1537-8\">\u201c(h) \u2018Covered claims\u2019 shall not include any loss adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses, attorney fees and expenses, court costs, interest, and bond premiums, incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1537-9\">The majority opinion focuses solely on the phrase \u201closs adjustment expense\u201d from this section. Citing authorities interpreting the term,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the majority concludes that the phrase \u201closs adjustment expense\u201d can only mean attorney fees and costs incurred by a carrier that accepts its duty to defend, not attorney fees and costs incurred by the insured when the carrier refuses to defend. Based on this interpretation, the majority concludes that section 1063.2 does not apply to this claim. This is a much too narrow reading of section 1063.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-10\">First, I have no doubt that the term \u201closs adjustment expense\u201d is generally understood to refer to attorney fees and expenses incurred by the carrier in either defending or settling claims against the insured. But I do not agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1710\">*1710</page-number>the conclusion that the phrase can refer only to attorney fees and costs when they are incurred by the carrier. Here, the insured incurred the \u201closs adjustment expense\u201d LMI would have incurred had it not refused tender of the defense. Except for the authorities cited for the general proposition of what that phrase references, the majority cites no authority to support the distinction drawn between expenses incurred by the carrier and expenses incurred by the insured when the carrier refuses a tender of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-4\">Based on its interpretation of the phrase \u201closs adjustment expense,\u201d the majority concludes that section 1063.2 has no application to this case. But it is section 1063.2, subdivision (a), which appellant cites and relies on for the proposition that CIGA has a duty to pay the judgment. I agree with appellant that section 1063.2 is the authority that controls the outcome of this case. I must admit I am at a loss to understand why the majority concludes that section 1063.2 has no application to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-5\">The obligations of CIGA are limited to those legislatively mandated under sections 1063.1and 1063.2. <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548, 556-557 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 295].) \u201cCIGA is authorized only to \u2018pay and discharge covered claims.\u2019 (Ins.

It is only <em>\u2018in connection therewith\u2019 </em>that CIGA is to \u2018pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants <em>when required </em>by policy provisions ....\u2019 (Ibid., italics added.)\u201d <em>(Saylin v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 256, 262 [224 Cal.Rptr. 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-6\">CIGA admits that the underlying claim made by Woodliff, upon which he demanded a defense from LMI, was a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the provisions of the LMI policy and within the meaning of section 1063.1. The majority recognizes this concession and recognizes that the claim meets the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d within section 1063.1. But it is section 1063.2 that delineates the duties CIGA must provide when a claim falls within section 1063.1. <em>(Saylin v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 262.) The duties include payment of \u201closs adjustment expenses\u201d in connection with \u201ccovered claims,\u201d but excludes from the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d \u201closs adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses ... <em>incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1063.2, subd. (h), italics added.) The judgment here was rendered prior to the date the liquidator was appointed and reflects attorney fees and costs incurred prior to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-7\">The majority discusses legislative history in connection with its opinion. To me, section 1063.2 is unambiguous and does not require resort to the rules of legislative interpretation. But assuming for sake of argument that the majority is correct that the reference to \u201closs adjustment expenses\u201d in section 1063.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1711\">*1711</page-number>subdivision (h) should be interpreted to mean expenses incurred only by the carrier, the majority ignores the remaining language of subdivision (h). After the phrase \u201closs adjustment expenses, including adjustment fees and expenses,\u201d subdivision (h) lists \u201cattorney fees and expenses [and] court costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-5\">\u201cWe begin with the fundamental rule that a court \u2018should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.] In determining such intent \u2018[t]he court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.\u2019 [Citation.] We are required to give effect to statutes \u2018according to the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018If possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018When used in a statute [words] must be construed in context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.\u2019 [Citations.] Moreover, the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Moyer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230-231 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-6\">Reviewing the language of sections 1063.1and 1063.2 together, and in the context of the overall CIGA legislation, the only reasonable conclusion I can draw is that the judgment, reflecting attorney fees, expenses and costs incurred for defense of a covered claim, but prior to liquidation, does not qualify as a covered claim. I would affirm the summary judgment in favor of CIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 4, 2003, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 12, 2003.
