(Gov. Code, \u00a7 31450 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   The retirement boards in these counties are required to determine whether items of remuneration paid to employees qualify as \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460 and \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d pursuant to section 31461, and therefore must be included as part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation\u201d (\u00a7 31462 or \u00a7 31462.1) for purposes of calculating the amount of a pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">Prior to 1997, many, if not all, of the 20 retirement boards operating under CERL calculated employees\u2019 pension benefits according to the holding in <em>Guelfi v. Marin County Employees\u2019 Retirement Assn. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>297 [193 Cal.Rptr. 343] <em>(Guelfi). </em>The <em>Guelfi </em>court held that an item of \u201ccompensation\u201d under CERL must be received by all employees in the applicable grade or class of position for it to be a mandatory part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d and \u201cfinal compensation\u201d on which an employee\u2019s pension is based. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 303-307.)  Fourteen years later, our Supreme Court, in <em>Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. v. Board of Retirement </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 483 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 304, 940 P.2d 891] <em>(Ventura), </em>overruled <em>Guelfi\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d holding that \u201citems of \u2018compensation\u2019 paid in cash, even if not earned by all employees in the same grade or class, must be included in the \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 and \u2018final compensation\u2019 on which an employee\u2019s pension is based.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>at p. 487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The <em>Ventura </em>court declined to consider whether its decision should have retroactive application, which now is one of the questions before us. After numerous counties and retirement boards refused to apply the <em>Ventura </em>holding retroactively, Randall E. Francis, a retired county employee, filed a petition for writ of mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) on behalf of himself and other members of his class against the Board of Retirement of the Stanislaus County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association, with the County of Stanislaus as real party in interest, alleging that <em>Ventura </em>must be applied retroactively; that arrears contributions or interest collected cannot, among other things, be from members not benefiting from retroactive relief; and that cash-outs of unused leave upon separation from service, employer\u2019s payments for insurance premiums, and employer\u2019s payments to the retirement fund must be included in the calculations of \u201cfinal compensation\u201d for retirement benefits under CERL. Numerous similar petitions were filed across the state; the cases were coordinated pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 404 et seq. and California Rules of Court, rule 1500 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The trial court ruled that the <em>Ventura </em>decision should be applied retroactively; that the retirement boards did have discretion to collect arrears and that their discretion included the ability to collect arrears beyond the three-year statute of limitations period (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (d)); and that CERL did not mandate that various items of remuneration that did not involve cash payments to employees had to be included in the calculations of \u201cfinal compensation\u201d for retirement benefits. Three counties<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (collectively, counties) appeal from those portions of the judgments applying <em>Ventura </em>retroactively and giving the retirement boards discretion to collect arrears. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Two boards of retirement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (collectively, retirement boards) appeal from those portions of the judgments regarding retroactivity. Numerous individual plan members suing on behalf of themselves and others and associations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (collectively, plan members) appeal from those portions of the judgments regarding collections of arrears and the exclusion of items of remuneration from the calculation of retirement benefits under CERL. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s rulings were correct, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Counties maintain employee retirement plans under CERL. (\u00a7 31450 et seq.) CERL requires retirement boards to determine whether the remuneration paid in cash qualifies as \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460 and \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d pursuant to section 31461, and therefore must be included as part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation\u201d (\u00a7 31462 or 31462.1) for purposes of calculating the amount of a pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Prior to 1997, many, if not all, of the 20 retirement boards interpreted \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d under CERL in accordance with the holding in <em>Guelfi, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d 297. The <em>Guelfi </em>court held that payments received for overtime, uniform allowance, and educational incentive pay did not satisfy the requirements for \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 307.) It determined that an item of \u201ccompensation\u201d must be received by all employees in the applicable grade or class of position for it to be a mandatory part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d and \u201cfinal compensation\u201d on which an employee\u2019s pension is based. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 303-307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Fourteen years after the Court of Appeal had decided <em>Guelfi, </em>the California Supreme Court, in <em>Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 483, considered the meaning of \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d under CERL. It overruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Guelfi\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d by holding that \u201citems of \u2018compensation\u2019 paid in cash, even if not earned by all employees in the same grade or class, must be included in the \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 and \u2018final compensation\u2019 on which an employee\u2019s pension is based.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>at p. 487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Retirement boards began to include a variety of cash payments in their computations for \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d that they had not included earlier, but they restricted these modified calculations to \u201ccompensation\u201d earned on or after October 1, 1997, the date the Supreme Court declined to rehear <em>Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 483. <em>(Ventura </em>was filed on August 14, 1997.) They did not odify their calculations to include a variety of cash payments in \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d if plan members had earned the \u201ccompensation\u201d prior to October 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Plan members throughout the state who did not have their \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d modified to comply with <em>Ventura, </em>because their \u201cfinal compensation\u201d was based on compensation earned prior to October 1, 1997, filed writs of mandate. They contended that certain cash premiums should not have been excluded from their \u201cfinal compensation\u201d and that the holding of <em>Ventura </em>should apply retroactively. The actions by plan members were coordinated under Code of Civil Procedure section 404 et seq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on December 21, 1998. The court recommended that the coordinated proceedings be assigned to the San Francisco County Superior Court because the City and County of San Francisco did not operate under CERL. It also ordered \u201cthat the reviewing court having appellate jurisdiction [of the coordinated actions] is the Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On January 19, 1999, the Honorable Stuart R. Poliak, sitting in San Francisco, was assigned as coordination trial judge. Liaison counsel were designated to represent counties, retirement boards, and plan members. Most of the coordinated cases also were converted to class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">At the coordinated trial,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court first considered whether CERL mandates inclusion of certain employment benefits in the calculation of retirement benefits. Plan members requested that the following items be included: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>cash-outs by employees of unused leave upon separation from service, insurance-related payments made by the employer, and employer payments of mandatory employee retirement contributions that are paid by the employer directly to the retirement plan. The court concluded that none of these was required to be included in the formula for calculating pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The superior court next considered the question of retroactivity, determining that the general rule of applying judicial decisions retroactively <em>(Newman v. Emerson Radio Corp. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 973, 978-979 [258 Cal.Rptr. 592, 772 P.2d 1059] <em>(Newman)) </em>should govern here. The superior court explained: \u201cA decision that is disapproved or overruled is considered to have misstated the law, and consequently never was the law. <em>(Id. </em>at [p.] 979.) This general rule applies equally to pension cases. Where retirement allowances are calculated improperly based on a good faith misapplication of the law, retroactive recalculations must be made for retirees whose claims are filed within the three-year statute of limitations. <em>(County of Marin [Assn. of] Firefighters v. Marin County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1638 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 736] <em>[(Marin </em>Firefighters)]); <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 508 [86 Cal.Rptr. 569]; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 698 [263 P.2d 833] <em>[(Terry)]; Abbott v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 204 [3 Cal.Rptr. 127] <em>(Abbott II).) </em>There is no reason why the same rule should not be applied here, where pensions were miscalculated based on a prior erroneous judicial construction of the law.\u201d In the footnote, the trial court noted that the law may be different in federal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The trial court also determined that considerations of fairness and public policy did not justify denial of the retroactive application of <em>Ventura. </em>The court stated that retirement boards may have established reasonable reliance on the former interpretation of the statute, but they did not establish \u201ca hardship emanating from such reliance sufficient to invoke a fairness exception.\u201d The court also concluded that the retroactive application of <em>Ventura </em>did not unconstitutionally impair contractual obligations. It explained that the retroactive application of <em>Ventura </em>did not reduce or eliminate any contractual rights of retired plan members and \u201c[retirement boards] have not identified any contractual rights of their own that will be adversely affected by retroactive application of that decision.\u201d Finally, the court ruled that retirement boards have the discretion to collect arrears; full arrears contributions are authorized, but not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The trial court entered final judgments, denying those portions of plan members\u2019 petitions for writs of mandate requesting to have additional items of remuneration calculated as part of CERL pension benefits. It issued peremptory writs of mandate commanding retirement boards \u201cto recalculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the final compensation of members whose final compensation measurement period occurred in whole or in part prior to the effective date upon which it implemented the <em>Ventura </em>decision in the same manner [they are] calculating \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 and \u2018final compensation\u2019 after that date ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Following Judge Poliak\u2019s decision, several other retirement systems settled. Three counties are challenging (see fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>those portions of the judgments that applied <em>Ventura </em>retroactively and that gave retirement boards discretion to collect arrears. Two retirement boards are challenging (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>those portions of the orders applying <em>Ventura </em>retroactively. Numerous plan members appeal (see fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>from those portions of the judgments regarding the collection of arrears and the denial of their requests to have certain items included in the calculation of their pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The appeals were consolidated before us for resolution. On March 14, 2002, we granted the parties\u2019 stipulated motion to maintain liaison counsel and for a coordinated briefing schedule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition to receiving briefs from liaison counsel for counties, retirement boards, and plan members, we received briefs from the County of Los Angeles (L.A. County) and the plan members of the Los Angeles County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association (LACERA members) and an amicus curiae brief from the Board of Retirement of the Orange County Employees\u2019 Retirement System (OCERS).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In this opinion, we address three questions regarding the implementation of the <em>Ventura </em>decision: (1) Should we limit the application of the <em>Ventura </em>holding to calculations of \u201ccompensation\u201d after October 1, 1997, the effective date of the decision? (2) If we hold that <em>Ventura </em>applies retroactively, do the retirement boards have discretion to collect arrears and is that discretion limited? (3) Should items of remuneration that do not involve cash payments to the employee prior to his or her retirement be included in the pension calculation? Prior to our examination of each of these issues, we set forth the relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">I. Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The counties involved in these consolidated appeals maintain employee retirement plans under CERL, which mandates that the funds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>pensions contain both employer and employee contributions and that the level of funding be based on actuarial valuations. (\u00a7 31450 et seq.) Under CERL, an employee\u2019s pension \u201cis a combination of a retirement annuity based on the employee\u2019s accumulated contributions supplemented by a pension established with county contributions sufficient to equal a specified fraction of the employee\u2019s \u2018final compensation.\u2019 (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 31664, 31676.1.)\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 490.) The proper administration of a CERL pension system includes a determination of what payments in addition to base pay must be included when determining an employee\u2019s \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">When determining what payments are to be included, we use the definitions provided in CERL and resolve any ambiguity or uncertainty in favor of the pensioner, mindful that such construction must be consistent with the clear language and purpose of the statute. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Section 31460 defines \u201ccompensation\u201d as \u201cthe remuneration paid in cash out of county or district funds, plus any amount deducted from a member\u2019s wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan ..., but does not include the monetary value of board, lodging, fuel, laundry, or other advantages furnished to a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Under section 31461, \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d by a member of the plan \u201cmeans the average compensation as determined by the board, for the period under consideration upon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period, and at the same rate of pay. The computation for any absence shall be based on the compensation of the position held by [the member] at the beginning of the absence. Compensation, as defined in Section 31460, that has been deferred shall be deemed \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 when earned, rather than when paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Section 31462.1 defines \u201cfinal compensation\u201d as \u201cthe average annual compensation eamable by a member during any year elected by a member at or before the time he files an application for retirement, or, if he fails to elect, during the year immediately preceding his retirement.\u201d Section 31462 is substantially the same as section 31462.1, and differs only in that it sets the relevant time period as \u201cduring any three years elected by a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">These definitions were first construed and applied by the Court of Appeal in <em>Guelfi, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d 297. In <em>Guelfi, </em>two retired peace officers claimed that their final compensation should have been calculated to include their overtime, educational incentive pay, and uniform allowance. <em>(Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>pp. 299-300.) The <em>Guelfi </em>court concluded that educational incentive pay and overtime fit the definition of \u201ccompensation,\u201d but these items were not a mandatory part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d and therefore not part of the \u201cfinal compensation\u201d on which a pension is calculated, because not all employees in the same grade or class of position qualified for this pay. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 303-307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Subsequently, the Supreme Court, in <em>Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 483, considered these same definitions in CERL when a county deputy sheriffs\u2019 association and three retirees challenged the county retirement board\u2019s determination of \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d This determination excluded the county\u2019s contributions to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan, overtime pay, cash payments of bilingual premium pay, a uniform maintenance allowance, educational incentive pay, additional compensation for scheduled meal periods for designated employees, pay in lieu of annual leave accrual, holiday pay, a motorcycle bonus, a longevity incentive, and a field training officer bonus. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 488-489.) The court pointed out that sections 31460 and 31461 were ambiguous. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 493.) The court stated that the method of construction is first to determine what falls into the broad definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460, and then determine whether it falls within the narrower category of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d as defined in section 31461 \u201cand thus form[s] the basis for the calculation of \u2018final compensation\u2019 on which the pension is based pursuant to section 31462 or 31462.1.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>at pp. 493-494.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The <em>Ventura </em>court explained that, under section 31460, \u201ccompensation\u201d is remuneration not excluded by that section. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 494.) The court concluded that the Legislature did not consider county contributions to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan as \u201ccompensation\u201d as defined in section 31460. <em>(Ventura, </em>at p. 495.) In addition, section 31460 excludes the monetary value of an advantage provided in kind. However, the <em>Ventura </em>court held, when the advantages are paid in cash, and not in kind, they are not excluded. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 497.) The court therefore agreed with the <em>Guelfi </em>court that a longevity bonus and cashed-out accmed vacation were remuneration under section 31460. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>at p. 497.) Further, bilingual premium pay, pay for acting as a field training officer and for motorcycle duty, and educational incentive pay also qualify as \u201ccompensation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 497-499.) This analysis of \u201ccompensation\u201d did not differ significantly from the one employed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Guelfi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The <em>Ventura </em>court, however, concluded that the Court of Appeal in <em>Guelfi </em>erred in its construction of the statute\u2019 term \u201ccompensation eamable.\u201d It pointed out that the holding in <em>Guelfi </em>was not prior precedent of the Supreme Court; the issue was therefore one of first impression for it. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>16 Cal.4th at pp. 505-506.) The court examined the predecessor statutes to sections 31460 and 31461 and the use of the terms \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d in the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law (PERL) (\u00a7 20000 et seq.). <em>(Ventura, </em>at pp. 495-497, 501-505.) The court concluded that, in the context of CERL and PERL, \u201c \u2018compensation earnable\u2019 is the average pay of the individual retiring employee computed on the basis of the number of hours worked by other employees in the same class and pay rate\u2014that is the average monthly pay, excluding overtime, received by the retiring employee for the average number of days worked in a month by the other employees in the same job classification at the same base pay level.\u201d <em>(Ventura, </em>at p. 504.) The <em>Ventura </em>court concluded that, with the exception of overtime, all of the premiums that it had determined were remuneration must be included as \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d and therefore included in the calculation of the employee\u2019s pension. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 504-505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Ventura </em>refused to decide whether its decision applied retroactively to any other county. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507.) As to the county before it, the court concluded: \u201cThere may be unanticipated costs to Ventura County if the pensions of the individual plaintiffs and the employees the association represents must be recalculated and adjusted upward. If so, to comply with the financial provisions of CERL (\u00a7 31580 et seq.) and accommodate future increases, the county may have to make a supplemental appropriation and adjust the future annual appropriation for its contribution to the pension fund to cover the increase in future retiree pensions that results from inclusion of additional items of \u2018compensation\u2019 in \u2018compensation eamable.\u2019 Past experience should enable the county to anticipate the number of employees who will receive premium pay, however, and adjustments of this nature are contemplated by CERL. (See \u00a7\u00a7 31453, 31454.) Nothing in this record suggests that the burden on the county fisc justifies either perpetuation of an erroneous constmction of the applicable statutes or denying these plaintiffs the benefit of our decision.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>at p. 507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">II. Retroactivity</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">A. <em>The General Rule of Retroactivity and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Retirement boards and counties contend that they had diligently calculated pension benefits under CERL as set forth by the Court of Appeal in <em>Guelfi, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d 297. Once the Supreme Court articulated its interpretation of CERL, they attempted to implement the holding in <em>Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 483 for all current employees and for all retirees whose final compensation periods began on or after October 1, 1997 (the date the Supreme Court denied rehearing on <em>Ventura). </em>Plan members, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>contend that <em>Ventura\u2019s </em>holding should also be applied to those retirees whose final compensation periods fell in whole or in part prior to October 1, 1997. They contend that they are entitled to corrected calculations of their pension benefits, if not barred by the statute of limitations. (See <em>Marin Firefighters, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th 1638; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 508; <em>Terry, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 698; <em>Abbott II, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.2d 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Retirement boards claim that \u201cthe language of the <em>[Ventura] </em>decision shows that the [Supreme] Court both expected and intended that the effects of the decision would be almost entirely prospective even in Ventura County\u2014the one county that was a party in the case.\u201d However, contrary to retirement boards\u2019 assertions, the Supreme Court expressly declined to address the issue of retroactivity when it stated: \u201cNo other county is before us in this matter, however, and we need not decide whether this decision applies retroactively to any other county.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507.) Accordingly, we need to consider the application of the rule of retroactivity and judicial decisions to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">It is well settled that the general rule in California is that \u201ca decision of a court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision is retrospective in its operation and that the effect is not that the former decision was bad law but that it never was the law.\u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles v. Faus </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 672, 680-681 [312 P.2d 680] <em>(Faus), </em>abrogated on another issue by Evid. Code, \u00a7 822.) Counties attempt to circumscribe this rule to criminal and tort cases, but this general rule of retroactivity has been applied <em>without regard </em>to the area of law at issue (see <em>Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 995, fn. 3 (dis. opn. of Broussard, J.)). \u201c ' \u201cIndeed, a legal system based on precedent has a built-in presumption of retroactivity.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(McManigal </em>v. <em>City of Seal Beach </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 975, 981 [212 Cal.Rptr. 733] <em>(McManigal).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Our Supreme Court has \u201crecognized exceptions to [the general rule of retroactivity] when considerations of fairness and public policy preclude full retroactivity. [Citation.] For example, where a constitutional provision or statute has received a given construction by a court of last resort, and contracts have been made or property rights acquired in accordance with the prior decision, neither will the contracts be invalidated nor will vested rights be impaired by applying the new rule retroactively.\u201d <em>(Peterson v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 147, 151-152 [181 Cal.Rptr. 784, 642 P.2d 1305] <em>(Peterson), </em>citing <em>Faus, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at p. 681; see also <em>Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Companies </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 305 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58] <em>(Moradi-Shalal).) </em>Fairness and public policy may also require an exception when \u201cretroactive application of a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>would raise substantial concerns about the effects of the new rule on the general administration of justice, or would unfairly undermine the reasonable reliance of parties on the previously existing state of the law. In other words, courts have looked to the \u2018hardships\u2019 imposed on parties by full retroactivity, permitting an exception only when the circumstances of a case draw it apart from the usual run of cases.\u201d <em>(Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 983.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Counties, citing <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Commrs. </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 427, 430 [116 P.2d 37], claim that the trial court erroneously shifted the burden of proof regarding the retroactive application of <em>Ventura </em>to them. The <em>Dillon </em>court states that, when the board denies the plaintiff\u2019s right to a pension, the plaintiff may bring a mandamus action to establish as a matter of law that he or she is entitled to the status of a pensioner. <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>at p. 430.) That is clearly not the issue here. No one denies that plan members are entitled to a pension. Rather, the question is whether the decision in <em>Ventura </em>has retroactive effect. Since counties and retirement boards are arguing that an <em>exception </em>to the general rule of retroactivity applies to them, they have the burden of proof. (See, e.g., <em>Estate of Propst </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 448, 465 [268 Cal.Rptr. 114, 788 P.2d 628] <em>(Propst) </em>[prior to deciding whether judicial decision should be applied retroactively to each person, \u201cthe cause must be remanded to afford respondent an opportunity to present .. .proof\u2019 of hardship or detrimental reliance].)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s ruling that neither fairness nor public policy warranted an exception to the retroactivity rule under the abuse of discretion standard. A trial court, \u201cacting as a court of equity, has discretion to fix a more realistic starting date for the payment of retroactive benefits to class members.\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 142 [172 Cal.Rptr. 206, 624 P.2d 256].) To the extent that counties and retirement boards contend the court erred in its application of the law, we apply the de novo standard of review (see, e.g., <em>Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672]). Those findings of fact that support the trial court\u2019s ruling, we review for substantial evidence. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Common Council </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 684, 689 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Preliminarily, we must first consider what is meant by a retroactive application. Counties and retirement boards contend that a prospective application of <em>Ventura </em>would permit them not to modify either the future retirement benefits or the back payments to all plan members who had all or part of their \u201cfinal compensation\u201d calculated prior to October 1, 1997. OCERS, in its amicus curiae, brief, maintains that, even if <em>Ventura </em>is limited to a prospective application, retirement boards must recalculate the future retirement benefits for plan members who had all or part of their \u201cfinal compensation\u201d calculated prior to October 1, 1997. OCERS asserts that under California law a governmental entity has a mandatory duty to make certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>payments; those payments are deemed \u201cdue to the recipient as of the date he first became entitled to them.\u201d <em>(Green v. Obledo, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 141, 172 Cal.Rptr. 206, 624 P.2d 256.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the Supreme Court in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>addressed the issue of retroactivity and the payment of welfare benefits, it only considered the back payments that would be paid to welfare recipients as subject to any exception to retroactivity, not the benefit payments to be made in the future. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 141-143.) Further, it explained that when a governmental entity unlawfully withholds pension benefits from its retirees, \u201ceach such payment becomes a debt due to the employee as of the date he was entitled to receive it. It is settled that in such cases each deficient payment constitutes a separate violation triggering the running of a new period of limitations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 141.) OCERS therefore argues that requiring counties and retirement boards to cease \u201cperpetuation of an erroneous construction of the applicable statutes\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507) is a prospective application of the decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We are not aware of any California case that has addressed the specific issue of retroactivity and pensions. In the federal context, however, courts have considered the question of pensions and retroactivity when invalidating pension systems based on gender-segregated mortality tables as in violation of title VII. of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)). (See, e.g., <em>Los Angeles Dept. of Water &amp; Power v. Manhart </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 702 [55 L.Ed.2d 657, 98 S.Ct. 1370] <em>(Manhart); Florida v. Long </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 223, 237 [101 L.Ed.2d 206, 108 S.Ct. 2354] <em>(Long); </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1073, 1092 [77 L.Ed.2d 1236, 103 S.Ct. 3492] <em>(Norris); Retired Public Employees\u2019 Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>State of Cal. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 799 F.2d 511, 515; <em>Probe v. State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 780 F.2d 776 <em>(Probe).) </em>These federal courts have defined retroactivity in the manner advocated by counties and retirement boards (but see our discussion of the relevance of federal cases in pt. II.E.). They have concluded that, because these future annuity payments were funded by past contributions, any court judgment affecting these payments \u201cis fundamentally retroactive in nature.\u201d <em>(Probe, supra, </em>780 F.2d at p. 782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Since we are holding that the <em>Ventura </em>decision should be applied retroactively, we need not settle the question whether future benefits to people who retired before October 1, 1997, is a retroactive or prospective application of <em>Ventura. </em>In arriving at our holding, we review the following arguments by retirement boards and counties. Retroactive application is inappropriate because: (1) judicial decisions can have no retroactive effect when none of the parties was involved in the <em>Ventura </em>decision or had a lawsuit pending at the time; (2) it would unfairly and unconstitutionally impair vested contract rights; (3) it would be unfair as the parties detrimentally relied on the holding in <em>Guelfi </em>and it would not promote public policy concerns; and (4) it would contravene federal case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">B. <em>Considerations of Retroactive Effect and Nonparties to Ventura</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Retirement boards contend that the trial court erred in its retroactive application of the holding in <em>Ventura </em>to plan members, counties and retirement boards in this coordinated action because none of them was a party to the lawsuit or had similar lawsuits pending when <em>Ventura </em>became final. Moreover, <em>Ventura </em>was not a class action. They assert that the Supreme Court mandated retroactive application of its decision only to the parties before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In support of their argument, retirement boards cite <em>Bartman </em>v. <em>Estate of Bartman </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 780 [148 Cal.Rptr. 207], and <em>Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 973. They claim that judicial retroactivity \u201c \u2018governs events occurring prior to the date of decision, <em>when such events are at issue in timely filed actions\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bartman, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d at pp. 785-786.) By quoting this language in <em>Bartman, </em>they imply that the <em>Bartman </em>court held that judicial decisions <em>only </em>have retroactive effect on those parties who have a pending lawsuit on the same issue. However, a complete reading of the <em>Bartman </em>opinion does not support the conclusion urged by retirement boards. The <em>Bartman </em>court was concerned with the effect of a retroactive application of a judicial decision on cases not yet pending when the statute of limitations would make such claims untimely. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 786.) Thus, it did not hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>an action had to be pending for a judicial decision to have retroactive effect but that \u201c \u2018[t]he normal \u201cretroactivity\u201d of most civil decisions has never been thought to supersede the operation of the statute of limitations so as to revive old claims which were not pursued because of a previously prevailing contrary rule of law, or to reincarnate dead causes which had fallen to the sword of the statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Retirement boards\u2019 citation to <em>Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 973, is equally unsound. They argue that the Supreme Court in <em>Newman </em>determined that its holding in <em>Foley v. Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373], was retroactive but, according to retirement boards, \u201conly to \u2018all cases not yet final on January 30, 1989, the date that decision became final.\u2019 \u201d Thus, they claim that the <em>Foley </em>decision had retroactive effect only on those cases pending at the time it became final. The <em>Newman </em>court, however, did not so limit the <em>Foley </em>holding; rather it was merely pointing out that <em>Foley </em>\u201cis fully retroactive, applying to all cases not yet final as of January 30, 1989, the date our decision in <em>Foley </em>became final.\u201d <em>(Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 976.) By inserting the word \u201conly\u201d prior to the quoted language from <em>Newman, </em>retirement boards imply that the court was in some manner limiting its retroactive application of <em>Foley. </em>Clearly, it was not. Moreover, retirement boards omitted the language at the beginning of the sentence stating that the decision \u201cis fully retroactive.\u201d <em>(Newman, </em>at p. 976.) Since <em>Foley </em>involved tort claims, the <em>Newman </em>court obviously did not have to be concerned about lawsuits filed after <em>Foley </em>became final; the prospective application of <em>Foley </em>would govern these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Accordingly, retirement boards\u2019 attempt to create a new rule that retroactivity does not apply to them simply because none of the parties in this coordinated action had filed a pleading on this issue at the time the <em>Ventura </em>decision became final is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">C. <em>Considerations of Fairness Based on Vested Contract Interests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Both counties and retirement boards contend that retroactivity should not apply because pensions are contract rights. Counties maintain that retroactive application of <em>Ventura </em>would unconstitutionally impair contract expectations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Kern v. City of Long Beach </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 848, 853 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>[179 P.2d 799] <em>(Kern) </em>[pension rights involve \u201cobligations which are protected by the contract clause of the Constitution\u201d].)

These vested rights are defined by the benefits and law in place when an employee is rendering services, not by changes that occur after retirement. <em>(Betts </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 859, 866 [148 Cal.Rptr. 158, 582 P.2d 614].)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">It is true that \u201cCalifornia is firmly committed to the proposition that [public employees\u2019 retirement rights] are contractual; that they are \u2018vested\u2019 in the sense that the lawmakers\u2019 power to alter them after they have been earned is quite limited.\u201d <em>(Lyon v.

Indeed, the trial court specifically found that retirement boards and counties relied on the law as stated in <em>Guelfi. </em>\u201c \u2018The parties are presumed to have had existing law in mind when they executed their agreement....\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Existing law\u2019 includes decisions of the appellate courts interpreting statutes.

Board of Administration </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 114 [192 Cal.Rptr. 762, 665 P.2d 534] <em>(Allen) </em>\u201ccements the point\u201d that retroactive relief is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In <em>Allen, </em>retired legislators or their surviving spouses maintained that they were entitled to the benefit of legislation passed after their retirement even though the legislation stated that the increased salaries could not be used as a basis for calculating retirement benefits for any legislators who retired prior to the amendment. <em>(Allen, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at pp. 117-118.) The retirees argued that the subsequent legislation impaired their contractual right to a pension based on a percentage of current comparative salaries. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court held that there was no unconstitutional impairment because this was an unforeseen change in the law and the legislators could not have had a realistic expectation of such increases when they were legislators. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 124-125.) Further, the court reasoned, \u201ca fiscal consideration provides additional support for rejection of [retirees\u2019] claim.... [][] It thus becomes apparent that payment to [retirees] of inflated retirement allowances ... not only would give to them a bonanza far outstripping any reasonable expectation for cost-of-living increases ... but also would afford them pensions dwarfing their relatively modest contributions to the [retirement system].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Similarly here, counties argue, plan members are seeking to alter their pension contracts and obtain a windfall by claiming an entitlement to an increased pension based upon a change in the law after they retired. Counties maintain that it does not matter that <em>Allen </em>considered a statutory change while the situation here involves a judicial change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The question in <em>Allen, </em>as well as in <em>United Firefighters of Los Angeles City v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1095 [259 Cal.Rptr. 65], which counties cite in a footnote, was whether the plan members\u2019 vested pension rights could be modified. Modifications of vested pension rights, to avoid violating the contract clause, \u201cmust be reasonable, must bear a material relation to the theory and successful operation of a pension system, and, when resulting in disadvantage to employees, must be accompanied by comparable new advantages.\u201d <em>(Allen, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 120.) Here, there was no modification of plan members\u2019 vested pension rights; there was a correction to an erroneous construction of the statute after the plan members retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Although counties vigorously argue to the contrary, there was no change in the law and therefore there was no change to a plan member\u2019s vested right. Rather, counties agreed to implement a pension plan under CERL. During the relevant time period, the statutes remained the same, but our Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>in 1997 concluded that retirement boards had implemented \u201can erroneous construction of the applicable statutes ...\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507.) Retirement boards and counties had not relied on the ruling of a court of last resort, but on the construction of a statute by a Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the narrow exception to the general rule of retroactivity based on the making of contracts in reliance of the interpretation of a statute \u201c \u2018 \u201cby a court of last resort\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 982) does not apply.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Since \u201c[i]t is the general rule that a decision of a court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision is retrospective in its operation and that the effect is not that the former decision was bad law but that it never was the law\u201d <em>(Faus, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at pp. 680-681 ), the effect of the <em>Ventura </em>decision was that <em>Guelfi </em>never was the law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Retirement allowances calculated prior to October 1, 1997 were based on \u201can erroneous construction of the applicable statutes\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507) and were not incorrect because of a subsequent change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In their reply brief, counties rely extensively on <em>CAHP, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d 352, but that appellate opinion does not contradict the foregoing rule. Rather, <em>CAHP </em>addresses a different situation. In <em>CAHP, </em>the highway patrol officers and the state had entered into a written memorandum of understanding (MOU), which stated that only \u201cordered overtime\u201d was to be compensated. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 356-362.) At the time the MOU was negotiated, a Court of Appeal had defined the period during lunch as not \u201cordered overtime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 362-363, citing <em>Fowler v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 964, 970 [185 Cal.Rptr. 292].) Subsequently, after the execution of the MOU, our Supreme Court held \u201cthat rules and regulations of the City of Madera mandated that overtime be paid to police officers for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>mealtimes because of numerous restrictions on the officers\u2019 freedom during these times.\u201d <em>(CAHP, supra, </em>at p. 357, citing <em>Madera Police Officers Assn. v.

The reviewing court noted that the officers derived whatever rights they had from the MOU, and their right to overtime \u201cmust be located in the MOU.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 358, 361.) The MOU unambiguously denied them compensation for anything other than \u201cordered overtime\u201d and, at the time of the contract, the parties did not intend or interpret the lunch period as \u201cordered overtime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 358-362.) The <em>CAHP </em>court held that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Madera </em>decision had no bearing on the interpretation of the MOU and therefore no effect on the officers\u2019 claim that they were owed compensation for their work during lunchtime. <em>(CAHP, </em>at p. 361.) It also noted that nothing in the Supreme Court decision (in <em>Madera) </em>indicated that the earlier Court of Appeal decision (in <em>Fowler) </em>had interpreted any statute unlawfully or against public policy. <em>(CAHP, </em>at p. 364.) Accordingly, the <em>CAHP </em>court concluded: \u201c ' \u201cA subsequent decision of a higher court, in a different case, giving a different exposition to a point of law from the one declared and known, when a settlement between parties takes place, cannot have a retrospective effect and overturn such settlement.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 364-365.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The <em>CAHP </em>court was concerned with the interpretation of a term in a contract, while we are concerned with the construction of a statute. In discerning the intent of the parties, the <em>CAHP </em>court looked to the prevailing definition or interpretation of \u201cordered overtime\u201d at the time the parties executed the agreement. <em>(CAHP, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 364 [\u201c \u2018The parties are presumed to have had existing law in mind when they executed their agreement\u2019 \u201d].) In contrast, here our Supreme Court did expressly overrule the earlier Court of Appeal decision and held that the earlier ruling was an <em>unlawful construction of the statute-, </em>thus, <em>CAHP </em>is unhelpful regarding the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Rather than being concerned with the interpretation of a term in a contract, we are concerned about the effect of miscalculating a pension because of an incorrect construction of a statute.  When retirement allowances have been improperly calculated, courts have held that the pensions should be recalculated and the affected plan participants should receive retroactive relief, assuming the relief is timely. (See, e.g., <em>Marin Firefighters, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th 1638; <em>Terry, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 698; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 508; <em>Abbott II, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.2d 204.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Retirement boards do not have the discretion to exclude items from the calculation that they have determined meet the statutory definition of \u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d <em>(Marin Firefighters, supra, </em>at p. 1646, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 736.) In <em>Marin Firefighters, </em>the Board of Retirement of the County of Marin adopted the opinion of its attorney that holiday pay was mandatorily includable as \u201cfinal compensation\u201d in determining pensions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1644.) After correcting the mistake only for prospective retirees, the firefighters association sued. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Court of Appeal held that the corrected calculation had to be applied retroactively. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Similarly, our Supreme Court ordered that a mistake in the calculation of a pension be corrected retroactively in <em>Terry, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 698. In <em>Terry, </em>a retired mounted patrolman asserted that he was entitled to a percentage of the actual compensation then being paid to his position\u2019s rank (a fluctuating pension), but he had been paid a percentage of the amount he had actually earned during the relevant time period immediately prior to his retirement (a fixed pension). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 699.) The court noted that it did not matter that four years after the patrolman retired an amendment to the statute created a right to a fixed pension. \u201cThe pension payments are in effect deferred compensation to which the pensioner becomes entitled upon the fulfillment of the terms of the contract which may not be changed to his detriment by subsequent amendment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 703.) Accordingly, he was entitled to have his pension calculated pursuant to the operative statute at the time of his retirement. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In <em>Dunham v. City of Berkeley, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 508, the court interpreted and applied the same fluctuating pension provision addressed in <em>Terry. </em>The court considered whether retired police officers should receive an increased pension based on salary increases associated with a different ranking classification and a new career incentive program that were created after they retired. <em>(Dunham, supra, </em>at p. 511.) The Court of Appeal agreed with the lower court\u2019s ruling that the new system added salary groupings within each rank rather than creating new ranks <em>(id. </em>at p. 513); to deny the plaintiffs these increases would \u201cdefeat the purpose of the fluctuating pensions system in maintaining parity between retired and active employees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 516.) The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment that ordered the city to pay past accrued and unpaid benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 517.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Finally, in <em>Abbott II, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.2d 204, the court considered, among other things, whether the salary calculated for pensions should include \u201clongevity\u201d or \u201cmerit pay.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 211-213.) The court concluded: \u201cWe think that longevity and merit pay constitute a part of the \u2018salary attached to the rank or position\u2019 formerly held by the retired or deceased members and that it was error for the court to disregard them in its computation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>pensions to be paid and the judgments awarded.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 213-214.) The court determined that the pensions had been calculated incorrectly and that the plaintiffs were entitled to \u201cpensions and past due pension payments reflecting longevity and merit pay.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Counties contend that none of the foregoing cases applies because in each of them the retirement board misapplied an existing law that was part of a plan member\u2019s pension contract. In contrast, here, they argue that retirement boards did not misapply an existing law; rather, <em>Ventura </em>changed the law. They argue that a mistaken application of existing law is significantly different from a judicial change in the law, and they quote the following from an old Supreme Court case: \u201c \u2018Every man is to be charged at his peril with a knowledge of the law. There is no other principle which is safe and practicable in the common intercourse of mankind; and to permit a subsequent judicial decision in any one given case on a point of law to open or annul everything that has been done in other cases of the like kind for years before under a different understanding of the law, would lead to the most mischievous consequences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kenyon v. Welty </em>(1862) 20 Cal. 637, 642.) They contend that plan members did not have any vested rights to the benefits claimed, and to undo these agreements regarding benefits because of a change in law would result in havoc, especially since these contributions were calculated on the basis of the benefits as defined by <em>Guelfi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As discussed <em>ante, </em>no change in the law occurred; CERL was not amended during the relevant time period. When quoting the particular section from <em>Kenyon v. Welty, supra, </em>20 Cal. at page 642, counties fail to divulge that the court was considering whether to undo a contract that had been made according to a judicial law as articulated by the Supreme Court, because the contract was now invalid under a subsequent Supreme Court decision. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 641.) Another passage, not cited by the counties, clarifies that the court\u2019s decision not to disturb the contract was on the grounds that the contract had been made on an earlier, overruled, <em>Supreme Court </em>decision: \u201cTo establish the doctrine that all contracts made under a condition of the law, <em>as expounded by the Supreme Court of the State, </em>can be set aside if the Court subsequently changes its opinions or corrects its error, would be attended with very serious evils.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 642, italics added.) As already stressed, that is not the situation here. The Supreme Court had not addressed the definition of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d under CERL until its <em>Ventura </em>decision and, therefore, once the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Ventura, </em>the effect was that <em>Guelfi </em>never was the law. (See, e.g., <em>Faus, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at pp. 680-681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Judicial decisions do not establish a new rule of law for purposes of exclusion from the rule of retroactivity when the court \u201c \u2018gave effect to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>statutory rule that the courts had theretofore misconstrued [citation] or had not definitively addressed [citation] ....\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McManigal, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 981.) Thus, \u201cprior misconstruction of a statute by the courts does not prevent the retroactive application of the Supreme Court\u2019s authoritative interpretation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 982.) At the time plan members accepted employment, they received a vested right to a pension as mandated by CERL and intended by the Legislature. \u201c \u2018[T]he right to a pension becomes a vested one upon acceptance of employment by an applicant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kern, supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d at p. 852.) Thus, the <em>Ventura </em>court concluded that the particular plaintiffs before it should not be denied the benefit of their decision simply because Ventura County had implemented \u201can erroneous construction of the applicable statutes.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Further, an additional reason exists for rejecting counties\u2019 and retirement boards\u2019 arguments regarding violation of vested contract rights. The <em>Ventura </em>decision affected the determination of what items were to be included in \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d and this is <em>not </em>subject to a contract right. As already stressed, counties and plan members entered into employment contracts, which included a right to a pension to be calculated as mandated by CERL. They did not bargain for the amount of \u201cfinal compensation\u201d or the amount of contributions and earnings that are necessary to fund the retirement allowances required by that formula.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Retirement boards may have set the contribution rates too low because of their miscalculation of \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d but the parties did not negotiate contribution rates or final compensation. L.A. County separately argues that its plan members were repeatedly told by LACERA Board how their retirement benefits would be calculated, the interpretation of terms such as \u201ccompensation eamable,\u201d and their retirement benefits, which were calculated in accordance with <em>Guelfi. </em>However, plan members could not bargain regarding their contribution rates or their \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d  Once a retirement board sets contribution rates based upon the recommendation of its actuary, those rates are binding on the county. (See \u00a7\u00a7 31584-31586; see also <em>City of Oakland v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 29, 49 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 151] <em>(City of Oakland) </em>[\u201ccontribution rates are set by law\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Essential to counties\u2019 position, and repeatedly asserted by them in their briefs and at oral argument, is that plan members received pensions calculated in accordance with the law then in effect and they cite <em>Guelfi. </em>However, as stressed throughout this opinion, the law in effect at the time the plan members received their pensions was CERL, and plan members agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>have their \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d and \u201cfinal compensation\u201d calculated pursuant to CERL. The calculations made for plan members may have complied with the holding in <em>Guelfi, </em>but they were calculated incorrectly under CERL. <em>Guelfi </em>misstated the law; it did not establish any law. (See, e.g., <em>Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 979.) Thus, the contract right is the entitlement to the pension; statutes set the contributions and \u201cfinal compensation\u201d of plan members.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Accordingly, the law is well settled: Unless one of the exceptions to the retroactivity rule applies, any error in the calculation of a pension results in the retiree\u2019s receiving a pension based on the corrected mistake and any sums of money due on past payments. We next consider the fairness exception based on detrimental reliance and public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">D. <em>Considerations of Fairness Based on Detrimental Reliance and Public Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Retirement boards and counties contend that the fairness exception based on detrimental reliance and public policy requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s ruling that <em>Ventura </em>applies retroactively. Plan members respond that this is not a situation where the \u201chardships\u201d of the case \u201cdraw it apart from the usual run of cases\u201d <em>(Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 983) and of the basic rule of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">California courts \u201chave long recognized the potential for allowing narrow exceptions to the general rule of retroactivity when considerations of fairness and public policy are so compelling in a particular case that, on balance, they outweigh the considerations that underlie the basic rule.\u201d <em>(Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 983; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Rae-Venter Law Group </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 345, 372-373 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 58 P.3d 367] [reliance on prior construction of fee-shifting statute had only prospective application where party reasonably relied on earlier interpretation in weighing the potential costs of unsuccessfully appealing commissioner\u2019s award].) \u201cConsiderations of fairness would measure the reliance on the old standards by the parties or others similarly affected, as well as \u2018the ability of litigants to foresee the coming change in the law ....\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Peterson, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 153.) \u201cPublic policy considerations include the purpose to be served by the new rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of retroactive application.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">T. <em>Detrimental reliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The trial court stated that retirement boards established that the contributions into the retirement systems collected from the employees and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>counties were calculated in reliance on <em>Guelfi. </em>The pension plans are funded on an actuarial basis and therefore determinations of contribution rates relate to determinations of those items included in a calculation of the \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d and \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The trial court also found that retirement boards and counties established that they could not foresee the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Ventura. </em>Plan members dispute this finding and assert that the practice set forth in <em>Guelfi </em>was not that widespread. Thus, for example, the declaration of the chief executive officer for the San Mateo County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association indicated that San Mateo County, prior to the <em>Ventura </em>decision, included in its pension calculations items of pay not automatically provided in a uniform amount to all employees in the same grade or class of positions, such as night shift differential pay, helicopter observer pay, desk duty pay, and investigative work pay. In addition, LACERA members argue that as early as 1993 counties and retirement boards knew that liaison counsel were litigating the validity of <em>Guelfi. </em>They also point out that employees successfully sued the City of Hayward and the State Public Employees Retirement System to include certain fringe benefits in the salary base from which their retirement pension allowances were computed <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>City of Hayward </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 926 [179 Cal.Rptr. 287]), and that the decision has been applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The record, however, supports the trial court\u2019s finding that counties and retirement boards reasonably relied on <em>Guelfi. </em>No other Court of Appeal decision contradicted its holding and the Supreme Court had not granted review of <em>Guelfi. </em>The critical question therefore is whether their reliance on <em>Guelfi </em>resulted in substantial detriment or hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Retirement boards and counties must establish that they have \u201cforgone substantial benefits\u201d in reliance <em>(Propst, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 464) on the rule set forth in <em>Guelfi. </em>(See also <em>Sierra Club v. San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 489, 509 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 981 P.2d 543] [must establish \u201csubstantial detrimental reliance\u201d for exception to retroactivity rule].) In <em>Propst, </em>our Supreme Court reversed a judicially developed rule that had prohibited the unilateral severance of a joint tenancy in personal property. <em>(Propst, </em>at pp. 461-462.) The court noted that this rule had been unforeseeable to counsel, since the Supreme Court had earlier applied the former rule (e.g., <em>In re Kessler </em>(1932) 217 Cal. 32 [17 P.2d 117]) and had not indicated that it was planning to overturn it. <em>(Propst, </em>at pp. 463-464.) The court, however, doubted that many lay persons had detrimentally relied on the former rule, but it noted \u201cthere may be instances of persons who have incurred legal obligations or forgone substantial benefits in reasonable reliance\u201d on the prior rule against unilateral severance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 464.) It therefore remanded to permit individuals to establish detrimental reliance. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 464-465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>A review of those California cases that have refused to apply a judicial rule retroactively on the grounds of hardship indicates that this exception is generally imposed when retroactivity jeopardizes a legal right. To preserve people\u2019s legal claims, our Supreme Court has sometimes refused to apply a decision overruling its own earlier opinion to cases already filed. (E.g., <em>Camper v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 679 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 101, 836 P.2d 888]; <em>Moradi-Shalal, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 287.)  In particular, \u201c[retroactive application of an unforeseeable procedural change is disfavored when such application would deprive a litigant of \u2018any remedy whatsoever.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Woods v. Young </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 315, 330 [279 Cal.Rptr. 613, 807 P.2d 455] [interpretation of notice provision and effect on statute of limitations applied prospectively because retroactive application would bar plaintiffs\u2019 actions regardless of merits]; see also <em>Camper, supra, </em>at p. 689; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Rae-Venter Law Group, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 372-373.) Our Supreme Court in <em>Moradi-Shalal </em>limited the retroactive application of its decision that reconsidered and overruled its prior holding that an insured or third party claimant had a private cause of action against insurers who engage in unfair claims settlement practices. <em>(Moradi-Shalal, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 294, 305.) The court cautioned that it was not \u201cimplying any broad exception to the general rule of retrospectivity,\u201d but in \u201cthe interest of fairness to the substantial number of plaintiffs who have already initiated their suits in reliance\u201d on its previous opinion, it refused to apply the new decision to those claims filed before its overruling decision became final. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 305.) In contrast, here the retroactive application of <em>Ventura </em>would not result in the loss of any legal claims by counties or retirement boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Our Supreme Court has also considered financial and administrative issues when assessing a claim of hardship. In <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the class plaintiffs were entitled to welfare benefits, but it remanded for the trial court to consider, upon the proper motion, the appropriate date for payment of retroactive welfare benefits. <em>(Green v. Obledo, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at p. 143.) The following factors were to be considered by the trial court when making its equity determination: \u201c[A]n action by an entire class to recover past welfare benefits withheld pursuant to an invalid regulation or statute might impose, in some circumstances, a disproportionate clerical and financial burden on the governmental entity if such benefits were ordered paid for the entire period of limitations. This could occur, for example, if the regulation or statute had been in force for a number of years at the time of the judgment, if the class were particularly large, or if the potential individual recovery of each class member were small.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 142; see also <em>Smith v. Rae-Venter Law Group, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 373 [retroactive application would affect all pending appeals from commissioner\u2019s decisions that relied on different definition of successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>litigant under fee-shifting statute],) Here, there was no showing that the class was particularly large or that the individual recovery for each class member was small, but see our discussion below (pt. II.D.1.a.) for any alleged fiscal impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In the contract context, Division Four of this court considered whether a judicial decision that a contracting party\u2019s right to refuse consent to an assignment must be exercised in accordance with standards of commercial reasonableness and good faith should be applied retroactively. <em>(Kreisher v. Mobil Oil Corp. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 389 [243 Cal.Rptr. 662] <em>(Kreisher).) </em>At the time the franchisor refused consent, the contract between the franchisee and franchisor gave the franchisor the express right to refuse its consent to a proposed transfer of plaintiff\u2019s franchise and the Supreme Court had not yet issued its ruling that the franchisor could not withhold its consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 395.) As a result of the refusal (and prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the refusal could not be arbitrary or unreasonable), plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the franchisor and the jury awarded the plaintiff both compensatory and punitive damages. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 394.) The <em>Kreisher </em>court concluded that our Supreme Court\u2019s ruling should not have retroactive application in this situation, and it explained: \u201cAs regards the fairness factor, we perceive no satisfying basis for making plaintiff the windfall beneficiary of a change he did not foresee or help bring about. Conversely, it is patently unfair to penalize Mobil for its nonconformity with standards which took effect only after it conscientiously determined the state of the law and relied upon it in reasonable good faith.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Similarly, here, counties and retirement boards contend that the retroactive application of Ventura, while it would not deprive anyone of any legal rights, would be unfair because it would have a negative economic impact on the system, would result in a windfall for retirees who expected their pensions to be based on the rule in <em>Guelfi, </em>and would be unfair to current and future taxpayers who would have to pay for the added liabilities. We review each of these complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">a. <em>Adverse fiscal impact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Retirement boards and counties assert the trial court found that if <em>Ventura </em>were applied retroactively, five counties would incur a total of over $500 million in unfunded liabilities. (Orange County would incur $211 million; L.A. County would incur $190 million; Ventura County, which is not a party to these appeals, would incur $30 to $40 million; and Stanislaus County would incur $35 million. The fifth county, Kern, is not a party to these consolidated appeals and the record does not disclose the actual amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>unfunded liability it would incur.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, underfunding, in itself, does not establish hardship. The <em>Ventura </em>court noted that there \u201cmay be unanticipated costs to [the county] if the pensions of the individual [plan members] and the employees the association represents must be recalculated and adjusted upward. If so, to comply with the financial provisions of CERL (\u00a7 31580 et seq.) and accommodate future increases, the county may have to make a supplemental appropriation and adjust the future annual appropriation for its contribution to the pension fund to cover the increase in future retiree pensions that results from inclusion of additional items of \u2018compensation\u2019 in \u2018compensation eamable.\u2019 Past experience should enable the county to anticipate the number of employees who will receive premium pay, however, and adjustments of this nature are contemplated by CERL. (See \u00a7\u00a7 31453, 31454.)\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The trial court pointed out that there was no evidence that the underfunding would in any way jeopardize the financial integrity of any retirement system. It found: \u201cTo the contrary, the evidence shows that the retirement systems in these five counties have substantial surpluses available and the unexpected liability created by application of <em>Ventura </em>to past retirees will not substantially impact their financial stability.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, financial difficulties resulting from a judicial decision are not the type of hardship that typically has prevented retroactive application. (See, e.g., <em>McBrearty v. City of Brawley </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1448-1449 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 862], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. v. City of La Habra </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 809, 816-817 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 369, 23 P.3d 601].) In <em>McBrearty, </em>the court refused to limit the application of a California Supreme Court decision validating provisions of Proposition 62, which required voter approval of a tax. The <em>McBrearty </em>court applied the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Court\u2019s holding retroactively and invalidated a city utility tax imposed without voter approval despite concluding that the city had reasonably and justifiably relied on a prior Court of Appeal decision finding the proposition unconstitutional and despite acknowledging that retroactive application may impact the city\u2019s financial condition. (McBrearty, at p. 1449.) The court explained; \u201cIn this situation, the existence of prospective financial difficulties resulting from the implementation of the voter approval requirement does not constitute a legally cognizable hardship. [Citation.] Because the City has not established that conditioning <em>the future </em>collectibility of the utility tax on voter approval will create substantial inequitable results or cause undue financial hardship apart from those the challenged tax was intended to alleviate, we find that this does not establish a basis on which to conclude that [the Supreme Court case] is inapplicable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Similarly, here, the possibility of future financial difficulties was anticipated by the Legislature when it enacted CERL.  Where underfunding occurs because a retirement board mistakenly miscalculates pension benefits, the board is authorized to collect both arrears contributions and interest for the period in question. <em>(Barrett v. Stanislaus County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1593 [234 Cal.Rptr. 900] <em>(Barrett).) </em>As the trial court here found, underfunding can occur for a number of reasons and \u201c[a]ctuarial methodology is designed to address and consider unforeseen events on a regular basis so as to ensure the financial integrity of the retirement system.\u201d  Indeed, CERL itself <em>requires </em>that each actuary for the retirement system conduct a formal actuarial valuation \u201cwithin one year after the date on which any system ... becomes effective, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed three years.\u201d (\u00a7 31453; see also \u00a7 31454.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The actuary is therefore required to conduct a new valuation of the retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>system at least every three years and determine the extent to which prior assumptions must be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Retirement boards maintain that unforeseen events that must be considered do not include allowing for changes in the law that will result in changes for \u201cthousands of retirees as well as active members.\u201d As discussed <em>ante, </em>there was no change in CERL; rather, calculations for pensions had been computed incorrectly because of an improper interpretation of the statute. There is no reason why this unforeseen event falls outside the statutes governing adjustments for underfunding.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">A county actuary, and retirement boards\u2019 designated expert, Ira Summer, admitted that there are \u201cunanticipated ... blips either one way or another,\u201d but maintained that \u201cthe blips up and the blips down should cancel each other out over the long term for all people in [the retirement] system.\u201d Because blips occur, actuaries are equipped to address them. One approach is to actuarially smooth the blips by amortizing changes in contribution rates over a varying number of years. Another approach is to change the interest assumption rates, asset valuation methods, or mortality tables used by the retirement system. Some counties, such as Orange and Alameda Counties, have addressed the blips by issuing pension obligation bonds to pay off their unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities to the retirement systems. Finally, another method is to hold excess investment earnings of the retirement system as a reserve against future \u201cdeficiencies in interest earnings in other years, losses on investments, and other contingencies.\u201d (\u00a7 31592.) There is no reason why underfunding because of a misapplication of the law cannot be addressed by the \u201cactuarial methodology\u201d employed by the pension administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Since we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding no hardship based on fiscal impact on the system, we now consider hardship based on \u201csubstantial inequitable results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">b. <em>Inequitable results</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Counties and retirement boards contend that the retroactive application of the <em>Ventura </em>decision will result in some plan members receiving a windfall, which is unfair to other taxpayers and innocent parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">As to the claim that retroactive application of the <em>Ventura </em>decision will result in a windfall to retirees who never, according to counties and retirement boards, expected their pensions to be calculated in the manner set forth in <em>Ventura, </em>we disagree. Plan members contracted to receive a pension as required by CERL and therefore they are entitled to the amounts <em>properly </em>calculated under these statutes. While it may be true that retirement boards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>may not be able to collect the full amount owed by all former employees, we agree with the trial court that \u201cthe counties have made absolutely no showing that the deficiency will be significant or will have any lasting impact on the finances of the county.\u201d In addition, counties and retirement boards are not going to be penalized; rather, as already discussed, CERL provides for flexibility and adjustments (see \u00a7\u00a7 31453, 31454).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Counties and retirement boards complain that the retroactive collection of contributions shifts the responsibility for liabilities onto a future generation of taxpayers in violation of the public policy favoring \u201cintergenerational equity\u201d; they cite <em>Board of Administration </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1139-1140 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 207] (Wilson) as setting forth this policy. They claim that county retirement systems operating under CERL calculate contributions and earnings to prefund the cost of members\u2019 pensions by the members\u2019 anticipated retirement dates. The purpose of the prefunding, according to counties and retirement boards, is to ensure benefit security for the employees and to ensure that the costs of providing them are borne by the taxpayers who are receiving the benefit of the public employees\u2019 services rather than being shifted to future generations of taxpayers. Counties maintain that retroactively imposing on today\u2019s taxpayers a newly created legal liability for service rendered to past generations of taxpayers violates this alleged policy of \u201cintergenerational equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Counties\u2019 and retirement boards\u2019 reliance upon <em>Wilson, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 1109, is misplaced. First, counties and retirement boards maintain that <em>Wilson </em>holds that a fundamental policy underlying actuary defined pension systems is \u201cintergenerational equity,\u201d but all references to this term (or variations of it) in the opinion were quotes from declarations by expert actuaries. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1139-1142.) The court never stated that there was a policy of \u201cintergenerational equity.\u201d Second, the <em>Wilson </em>court was concerned with whether legislation delaying the employer\u2019s payment of required contributions impaired the vested contractual rights of members to an actuarially sound pension system. The case said nothing about the proper methods for imposing retroactive relief and therefore it has little relevance to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Counties and retirement boards also rely on statements by actuary Ira Summer. Summer stated that payment of missed contributions alone would be insufficient to restore these systems to where they would have been had the contributions been collected on a timely basis because they will not be equal to lost earnings. Since they will receive the contributions later than expected, retirement boards will not have the opportunity to invest these funds. Summer explained that when contributions are invested over the working lifetime of a plan member, between 65 and 80 percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>payments made to that member come from investment return. Consequently, counties and retirement boards claim, county contributions by current and future taxpayers will increase unless interest is added to compensate for the lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Further, counties assert, even if interest were collected on the arrears contributions, the systems still would not be fully restored to where they would have been. Although the contributions can be increased and collected with back interest, the opportunity to earn additional funds on the increased contributions has been irretrievably lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">As to this latter argument, any lost opportunities are offset entirely by the retirement boards\u2019 ability to earn excessive investment income from monies they should have paid out in pension benefits had CERL been applied properly. Indeed, in <em>City of Oakland, </em>the city complained that the retroactive reclassification of certain employees would cause unexpected liabilities. <em>(City of Oakland, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 29.) The court explained: \u201c[Reclassifications generally result in increased liability on the part of the employer, who presumably had the use of money that should have been funding the correct retirement benefits all along. While the reclassification decision here will apparently result in an unanticipated financial liability on the City\u2019s part, the City has had the use of money it should have been expending towards the retirement system, and we see nothing in the applicable legislation which cuts off the City\u2019s liability therefor.\u201d <em>(Id </em>at pp. 54-55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Further, retirement boards and counties have received a significant windfall because the three-year statute of limitations (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (a)) will relieve them of the obligation to pay a significant portion of the benefits owed under the statute to some of the retirees. Permitting them to increase their windfall by applying the <em>Ventura </em>decision on only a prospective basis would be unfair to those people who retired prior to October 1, 1997, since they also had a vested interest in having their pensions calculated as mandated by CERL.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Finally, retirement boards and counties assert that retroactive application will place an unfair hardship on innocent plan members. The trial court authorized the retirement boards to collect arrears contributions and interest from the counties and the parties bringing this lawsuit. If the retirement boards implemented a full retroactive recalculation of compensation eamable, they could collect arrearages on past contributions from these retirees\u2019 first day of employment. (See \u00a7\u00a7 31622, 31639.3.) Even for those retirees who had premium pay items in their final compensation period, the statute of limitations permits payment to them for only the three years prior to the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of their lawsuit (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (a)). They would, however, still owe contributions plus interest from their first date of employment. The retirees whose pensions will not increase will also owe back contributions if they received premium cash pay while working but not during the time period of their final average salary.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In addition, retirement boards assert, those plan members who are still active employees will have to pay arrears contributions if the new definition of compensation eamable is retroactively recalculated. They argue, however, that they will receive no additional benefit because the retirement systems already changed the method of calculating compensation eamable for compensation earned after October 1, 1997, to comply with the <em>Ventura </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">This situation, retirement boards and counties maintain, is the same as the one in <em>Kreisher, </em>where the court concluded that it was \u201cpatently unfair to penalize Mobil for its nonconformity with standards which took effect only after it conscientiously determined the state of the law and relied upon it in reasonable good faith.\u201d <em>(Kreisher, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 404.) <em>Kreisher, </em>however, is inapplicable. There, Mobil would have owed the plaintiff both compensatory and punitive damages because it had relied on a contract provision that it could withhold its consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner to a proposed transfer of the plaintiff\u2019s franchise. Thus, the costs to Mobil in compensatory and punitive damages were known and significant. Here, retirement boards provide little more than speculation as to how the collection of arrearages may be detrimental to innocent people. Further, they do not even attempt to set forth the number of affected people or the actual cost to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that counties and retirement boards have not met their burdens of proving that they will suffer a substantial hardship as a result of applying the <em>Ventura </em>decision retroactively. The trial court considered the evidence before it and found that the costs associated with correcting the mistake in calculation would not so dramatically affect the counties or the economy as to require an exception to our general mle of retroactivity, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">2. <em>Public policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">As set forth earlier, considerations of public policy \u201cinclude the purpose to be served by the new mle, and the effect on the administration of justice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>retroactive application.\u201d <em>(Peterson, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 153.) Counties assert that applying <em>Ventura </em>retroactively will result in more litigation. They claim: \u201c[A]ny decision to apply <em>Ventura </em>retroactively threatens to add tens of thousands of retirees to the administrative and judicial system\u2014each with his or her own unique burden of proof. Moreover, this quagmire only will be thickened by the inevitable fact that the Counties will not have complete records to assist many of these retirees in meeting their burden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We agree with plan members that the assertion that there will be more litigation is speculative. Further, and more significantly, courts concerned with the administration of justice have focused on the effect of the ruling on pending cases. (See, e.g., <em>Propst, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 463, fn. 4 [reviewing court concluded there was no indication of any substantial number of pending cases involving issue of unilateral severance of joint tenancy in personal property and therefore \u201cno effect on the administration of justice that might lead us to withhold retroactive application of our present decision\u201d]; <em>Woods v. Young, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 330-331; <em>Moradi-Shalal, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 305; <em>Newman, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 992 258 Cal.Rptr. 592, 772 P.2d 1059, fn. omitted [\u201cwe do not believe that the number of retrials required by our decision today will seriously disrupt the administration of justice\u201d].) Thus, for example, because it was concerned about the \u201cadministration of justice,\u201d our Supreme Court in <em>Li v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 804 limited the retroactive application of its comparative negligence holding and applied this new rule only to cases where the trial had not yet begun. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 829.) If it had applied the <em>Li </em>holding retroactively to all cases, trial courts would have been compelled to retry essentially <em>all </em>the cases that had reached judgment but were not yet final at the time of the decision. This is because juries in these cases would not have been instructed to determine the respective negligence of the parties at trial. In contrast, the retroactive application of <em>Ventura </em>will not negatively impact the administration of justice by requiring courts to retry pending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The administrative burden on L.A. County will be particularly acute, it maintains, because, as of 1997, there were 41,873 retired members of LACERA. Other than asserting that this will generate \u201csome administrative burden\u201d and that \u201cmany\u201d of the retired members are \u201cpotential future litigants,\u201d L.A. County provides no evidence that this will pose a serious burden. Indeed, it is unclear how difficult it is to determine whether any of these individuals are entitled to increased benefits and, if so, how many. Accordingly, L.A. County has failed to meet its burden of establishing the administration of justice exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>We therefore conclude that counties and retirement boards have failed to establish that retroactive application of <em>Ventura </em>will cause a flood of litigation. Retroactive application of the <em>Ventura </em>decision \u201creflects a policy in favor of paying employees what they earned. That is not inherently unfair. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of Oakland, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">E. <em>Federal Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Counties and retirement boards contend that retroactivity is inappropriate in the pension context and cite a number of federal cases. (E.g., <em>Manhart, supra, </em>435 U.S. 702; <em>Long, supra, </em>487 U.S. at p. 237 [\u201cWe will not adopt the premise that the appropriateness of a retroactive award turns on a particular pension fund\u2019s current financial status, so that financially successful pension funds pay but financially insecure pension funds do not. To do so imposes a penalty for prudent <em>management\u201d];Norris, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 1092; <em>Retired Public Employees\u2019 Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>State of Cal., supra, </em>799 F.2d at pp. 514-515; <em>Probe, supra, </em>780 F.2d 776.)  Federal decisions, however, have limited relevance to whether our Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which interprets a California statute, should have retroactive application. As the United States Supreme Court has explained: \u201cThe determination whether a constitutional decision of this Court is retroactive\u2014that is, whether the decision applies to conduct or events that occurred before the date of the decision\u2014is a matter of federal law. When questions of state law are at issue, state courts generally have the authority to determine the retroactivity of their own decisions.\u201d <em>(American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 167, 177 [110 L.Ed.2d 148, 110 S.Ct. 2323].) No federally protected right is involved in this proceeding and the proper interpretation of CERL is purely a question of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">However, counties and retirement boards contend that many California courts have looked to federal law on the question of retroactivity, as articulated in <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 97, 106-107 [30 L.Ed.2d 296, 92 S.Ct. 349] <em>(Chevron). </em>(See, e.g., <em>Kreisher, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 399, fn. 4; <em>Casas </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 131, 140 [228 Cal.Rptr. 33, 720 P.2d 921], overruled on another issue in <em>In re Marriage of Mansell </em>(1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 219, 226 [265 Cal.Rptr. 227]; <em>Citicorp North American, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1423 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 509].) In <em>Chevron, </em>the United States Supreme Court identified three relevant factors in determining whether to apply an overruling case retroactively: \u201cFirst, the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied [citation], or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed <em>(Chevron, supra, </em>at p. 106.)\u201d The second factor considers whether in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the \u201c \u2018history ... purpose and effect\u2019 \u201d of the rule in question its operation will be furthered or retarded by retrospective application. The third factor weighs \u201cthe inequity imposed by retroactive application\u201d and whether it would produce \u201c \u2018substantial inequitable results,...\u201cinjustice or hardship\u201d....\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Chevron, supra, </em>at pp. 106-107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Some courts may have been guided by <em>Chevron </em>on the issue of retroactivity, but the federal cases upon which counties and retirement boards rely are a special category of cases that have considered retroactivity for federal pension cases <em>and </em>the implementation of Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)). Thus, these cases are not simply concerned with retroactivity in the pension context, <em>but the unique circumstances of changes in pension plans as a result of the court\u2019s interpretation of the implementation of Title VII. </em>In <em>Manhart, supra, </em>435 U.S. 702, the United States Supreme Court considered whether requiring female employees to make larger contributions than male employees to the pension fund violated Title VII. It determined that it did, but it gave its holding only prospective application. <em>(Manhart </em>at pp. 718-723.) The court noted that 50 million Americans participate in retirement plans other than Social Security and that \u201c[d]rastic changes in the legal rules governing pension and insurance funds, like other unforeseen events, can have this effect. Consequently, the rules that apply to these funds should not be applied retroactively unless the legislature has plainly commanded that result... The [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)] itself has recognized that the administrators of retirement plans must be given time to adjust gradually to Title VII\u2019s demands. Courts have also shown sensitivity to the special dangers of retroactive Title VII awards in this field.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 721-722, fn. omitted.) The court explained: \u201cThere can be no doubt that the prohibition against sex-differentiated employee contributions represents a marked departure from past practice. Although Title VII was enacted in 1964, this is apparently the first litigation challenging contribution differences based on valid actuarial tables. Retroactive liability could be devastating for a pension fund. The harm would fall in large part on innocent third parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 722-723, fn. omitted.) The court stated that the harms would fall on innocent third parties because, if the contributions were recovered from the pension fund, administrators of the fund would be forced to meet unchanged obligations with diminished assets. Further, if the reserve was inadequate, \u201ceither the expectations of all retired employees will be disappointed or current employees will be forced pay not only for their own future security but also for the unanticipated reduction in the contributions of past employees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 723.) All of the federal cases cited by counties and retirement boards involved Title VII pension cases and followed the ruling in <em>Manhart. (Long, supra, </em>487 U.S. 223, 237; <em>Norris, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 1092; <em>Retired Public Employees\u2019 Ass\u2019n. v. State of Cal., supra, </em>799 F.2d at p. 515; <em>Probe, supra, </em>780 F.2d 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The <em>Manhart </em>case and its progeny are not especially helpful to counties and retirement boards. The <em>Manhart </em>court was confronted with the \u201c[d]rastic changes in the legal rules governing pension and insurance funds\u201d as a result of Title VII and the \u201cdevastating\u201d effect retroactive application would have. (Manhart, <em>supra, </em>435 U.S. at pp. 721-722.) The impact was obvious; the court\u2019s ruling affected the contributions and benefits for <em>all </em>women. No such drastic result is implicated here. As already noted, counties and retirement boards have failed to establish \u201chardship\u201d and, without such evidence, it is unclear that very many people will be affected. Not only does the <em>Ventura </em>decision impact only those particular employees that received a cash payment not ordinarily given to the class of employees of their rank, but the record does not establish that the resulting increase for these particular employees would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In addition, another clear difference between the federal cases and the ones before us is that the United States Supreme Court stated that the EEOC contemplated the gradual implementation of Title VII by administrators of pension plans <em>(Manhart, supra, </em>435 U.S. at pp. 721-722) and therefore the holding in <em>Manhart </em>comported with Title VII objectives. That is not the case here. Indeed, as the <em>Ventura </em>court detailed, the intent of the Legislature, as revealed by the statutory history of CERL and the definitions of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d and \u201cfinal compensation\u201d in PERL, was to always include advantages paid in cash (excluding overtime) in the calculations of \u201cfinal compensation\u201d for pensions. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Finally, the federal cases did not consider mistakes in calculations based on an erroneous interpretation of a statute, which is the situation before us. Rather, the federal cases were concerned with correct calculations based on actuarial tables that unlawfully distinguished between men and women.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">It is also unclear whether the exception to the retroactive application of judicial decisions set forth in the federal cases cited by counties and retirement boards remains valid after <em>Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 86 [125 L.Ed.2d 74, 113 S.Ct. 2510]. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Harper </em>stated that it had previously held in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 803 [103 L.Ed.2d 891, 109 S.Ct. 1500] that \u201ca State violates the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity when it taxes retirement benefits paid by the Federal Government but exempts from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions.\u201d <em>(Harper, supra, </em>at p. 89.) The <em>Harper </em>court noted that the Supreme Court of Virginia twice refused to apply the <em>Davis </em>holding retroactively, relying on the retroactivity analysis in <em>Chevron, supra, </em>404 U.S. 97. <em>(Harper, supra, </em>at pp. 89-90.) Although the Supreme Court did not specifically address the question of retroactivity in pension cases, it noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cthe fundamental rule of \u2018retrospective operation\u2019 that has governed \u2018[judicial decisions ... for near a thousand years\u2019 \u201d and, in the civil context, the exception to the rule set forth in <em>Chevron </em>when the court was announcing \u201c \u2018a new principle of law\u2019 \u201d and limiting its application would avoid \u201c \u2018 \u201cinjustice or hardship\u201d \u2019 without unduly undermining the \u2018purpose and effect\u2019 of the new rule.\u201d <em>(Harper, supra, </em>at pp. 94-95.) The <em>Harper </em>court pointed out that it had already held that judicial decisions would always apply retroactively in the criminal context <em>(Griffith v. Kentucky </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 314 [93 L.Ed.2d 649, 107 S.Ct. 708]), and that it was now making clear that such a rule applied in the civil context. <em>(Harper, supra, </em>at pp. 95-96.) \u201cWhen this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule. This rule extends Griffith's ban against \u2018selective application of new rules.\u2019 [Citations.] Mindful of the \u2018basic norms of constitutional adjudication\u2019 that animated our view of retroactivity in the criminal context [citation], we now prohibit the erection of selective temporal barriers to the application of federal law in noncriminal cases. In both civil and criminal cases, we can scarcely permit \u2018the substantive law [to] shift and spring\u2019 according to \u2018the particular equities of [individual parties\u2019] claims\u2019 of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule. [Citation.] Our approach to retroactivity heeds the admonition that \u2018[t]he Court has no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Harper, supra, </em>at p. 97; see also <em>Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 749, 752 [131 L.Ed.2d 820, 115 S.Ct. 1745] [court retroactively applied a prior decision that the state\u2019s tolling statute was unconstitutional, even though it resulted in dismissal of a lawsuit; court pointed out that <em>Harper </em>overruled <em>Chevron </em>\u201cinsofar as the case (selectively) permitted the prospective-only application of a new rule of law\u201d]; <em>Ryder v. United States </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 177, 184-185 [132 L.Ed.2d 136, 115 S.Ct. 2031].)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We therefore conclude that, even presuming that the narrow exception for retroactivity created by the United States Supreme Court cases in the pension and Title VII context remains good authority, this exception has limited applicability to California law. Moreover, the equities in those federal situations differ significantly from those here. We therefore hold that the retroactive application of the <em>Ventura </em>decision is proper. Consequently, we need not address plan members\u2019 argument that applying the <em>Ventura </em>decision only prospectively would deny them equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>III. Arrears Contributions</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The trial court ruled that retirement boards had the discretion to collect arrears contributions. It stated that this discretion did \u201cnot mean that the retirement boards ... must collect arrears beyond the three-year limitations period.\u201d The court cautioned: \u201cThis decision is within the sound discretion of the retirement boards and presumably each board will exercise its discretion in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of its members. However, it is emphatically not the case, as [retirement boards\u2019] argument at times seems to suggest, that a decision requiring the retirement boards to recalculate pension benefits correctly, in compliance with <em>Ventura, </em>compels the [retirement boards] to seek arrearage contributions beyond the three-year limitations period, or from retirees who receive no benefit from the retroactive application of <em>Ventura, </em>or at all. Arrears contributions may be authorized, but they are not mandatory, and the present record hardly demonstrates that they are necessary in any of the counties involved in this litigation.\u201d The court in a footnote explained that it retained \u201cjurisdiction to resolve any disputes that may arise with respect to the right to collect arrearages or to offset arrearages against other amounts payable to plan members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Retirement boards claim the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct, while counties contend that the court erred in refusing to rule that arrears contributions are mandatory. Plan members argue that the court erred in giving retirement boards discretion to recover arrears contributions or interest from members not benefiting from retroactive relief. They also maintain that the court should have ruled that any claims for excessive arrears contributions are barred by each retirement board\u2019s failure to pursue that relief within the three-year limitations period (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 338, subd. (d)). Both counties and plan members assert that the court did not properly apply the holdings in <em>Barrett, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d 1593 and <em>Marin Firefighters, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th 1638. We review these claims of legal error under the de novo standard of review. (See, e.g., <em>Burden v. Snowden, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In <em>Barrett, </em>the court ruled that CERL required certain work program supervisors to be reclassified from miscellaneous members to safety members, retroactive to their initial dates of employment as work program supervisors. <em>(Barrett, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1597-1599, 1609.) This reclassification entitled affected employees to earlier-retirement eligibility and greater pension benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1597, fn. 1.) The plaintiffs maintained that equitable considerations barred the defendants from demanding arrears contributions, but the Court of Appeal disagreed. The court concluded that the defendant retirement board had the authority under CERL to collect both arrears contributions and interest for the period in question. The court noted that the \u201cretirement system [is] based on contributions by both employer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>employee. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 31453, 31453.5, 31558-31567, 31581.)\u201d <em>(Barrett, supra, </em>at p. 1609.) Thus, the burden of arrears contributions falls upon the plaintiffs and the defendant county. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court explained that the plaintiffs will merely have to \u201cpay their quid pro quo. They will receive the higher pension benefits retroactively but are required, as are all other safety members, to pay retirement contributions commensurate with the formula contributions paid by all other safety members during the entire course of their employment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1608, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In <em>Marin Firefighters, </em>the Court of Appeal held that the inclusion of holiday pay into final compensation had to be applied retroactively. <em>(Marin Firefighters, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 1648.) The court stated that <em>Barrett </em>established that the retirement board \u201chas the power to seek both arrears contributions and interest.\u201d <em>(Marin Firefighters, </em>at p. 1650, fn. omitted.) The <em>Marin Firefighters </em>court then considered whether the statute of limitations limited this power, an issue not addressed by <em>Barrett, </em>and concluded that it did not. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">There is nothing in <em>Barrett </em>or <em>Marin Firefighters </em>to support counties\u2019 argument that the court erred in refusing to require retirement boards to collect arrears contributions. Indeed, in <em>Barrett, </em>the reviewing court concluded that the trial court erred when it ordered the defendant retirement board to pay all arrears contributions and applicable interest on behalf of the newly classified safety members. <em>(Barrett, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1613-1614.) It stated that the court could not attempt to compel the retirement board \u201cto exercise its discretion in a particular manner.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, contrary to counties\u2019 assertions, the <em>Barrett </em>court did not mandate that retirement boards must collect arrears contributions, but clearly held that they had the discretion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Counties also argue that it would be unfair to them if retirement boards forego collecting arrears contributions and interest because, among other things, it would saddle counties with additional costs and treat pre-Ventura employees more favorably than active employees. These equitable arguments must fail. We cannot assess the equities of the situation because retirement boards have yet to take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Plan members\u2019 equitable arguments must similarly fail. Plan members explain why the equities in this situation differ from those in <em>Barrett </em>and in <em>Marin Firefighters. </em>We do not disagree that there are significant differences between these cases and the ones before us, but\u2014since retirement boards have not exercised their discretion as to how they are going to fund the shortfall resulting from their mistaken interpretation of CERL\u2014it is premature for us to consider any equitable arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In addition, plan members insist that CERL does not permit retirement boards to recoup arrears contributions and interest beyond that necessary to finance that portion of retroactive benefits intended to be funded by the member, but they cite no authority for this proposition. Further, they claim that retirement boards do not have the authority to collect excessive arrears contributions, since they are barred by each retirement board\u2019s failure to pursue that relief within the three-year limitations period (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (d) ). Plan members contend that the \u201cmost accurate and equitable way to finance the member-funded portion of the enhanced benefits resulting from granting retroactive relief would be to reduce the retroactive recovery (both for arrears pension adjustments and future pension adjustments) accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Without addressing the details of plan members\u2019 argument, we reject it. They are urging us to order retirement boards to act in a specific manner, and to usurp the boards\u2019 authority. \u201cWhen a statute imposes upon an administrative body discretion to act under certain circumstances, mandate will not lie to compel the exercise of such discretion in a particular manner. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Barrett, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at p. 1613.) Moreover, it is unclear that any of the issues raised by plan members will need to be addressed. Retirement boards may decide to use excess earnings of the pension system, as OCERS did, or to implement other corrective measures such as designating the shortfall as unfunded liability that the county can amortize over 30 years under sections 31453, 31453.5, 31453.6, and 31454. Thus, until each retirement board exercises its discretion to correct for its miscalculations under CERL, we cannot determine whether it has abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">LACERA members contend that LACERA Board did not collect arrears contributions for its post <em>-Ventura </em>retirees and it therefore exercised its discretion not to collect any arrears contributions. They claim that retirement boards cannot treat <em>pre-Ventura </em>retirees disparately as that would constitute an arbitrary, and therefore unlawful, determination. This argument, too, must fail. Without knowing if LACERA Board is going to collect arrears contributions from pr <em>e-Ventura </em>retirees and, if it does, its reasons for doing so, we cannot assess its actions. Simply because LACERA Board funded the increased benefits to the <em>post-Ventura </em>retirees without collecting arrears contributions does not establish that it has the funds to avoid collecting arrears contributions for the <em>pre-Ventura </em>retirees. Since LACERA Board has not yet acted, we cannot determine whether it has acted arbitrarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">We note that, although retirement boards have discretion to manage their retirement systems, this discretion is not unfettered. Article XVI, section 17, of the California Constitution states in relevant part: \u201c[T]he retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have plenary authority and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the system, subject to all of the following: [f] (a) The retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have the sole and exclusive fiduciary responsibility over the assets of the public pension or retirement system. The retirement board shall also have sole and exclusive responsibility to administer the system in a manner that will assure prompt delivery of benefits and related services to the participants and their beneficiaries. The assets of a public pension or retirement system are trust funds and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the pension or retirement system and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system. [&lt;\u00a1[] (b) The members of the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall discharge their duties with respect to the system solely in the interest of, and for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to, participants and their beneficiaries, minimizing employer contributions thereto, and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system. A retirement board\u2019s duty to its participants and their beneficiaries shall take precedence over any other duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The trial court retained jurisdiction to address any issues that may arise regarding the collection of contributions of arrearages. Rather than trying to anticipate problems that may not even occur, we believe the trial court\u2019s approach was sound and correct. Accordingly, we affirm its ruling on the collection of contributions of arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">IV. Items of Remuneration to be Included in Calculations of \u201cFinal Compensation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Plan members contend that the trial court erred when it ruled that cash-outs by employees of unused leave upon separation from service (termination pay), insurance-related payments made by the employer, and payments of mandatory employee retirement contributions (pick-ups) that are paid by the employer directly to the retirement plan are not included in the calculations of \u201cfinal compensation\u201d for retirement benefits.  Since this is a question of statutory construction, we review the court\u2019s ruling under the de novo standard of review.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Burden v. Snowden, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 562, 7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u201c[Ojur first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. ... The words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med., Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) \u201c \u2018Rules of statutory construction require courts to construe a statute to promote its purpose, render it reasonable, and avoid absurd consequences.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ford </em>v. <em>Gouin </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 339, 348 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 834 P.2d 724].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">With regard to pension legislation, pension provisions shall be liberally construed and we resolve all ambiguities in favor of the pensioner. <em>(Barrett, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at p. 1603.) \u201cHowever, this rule of liberal construction is applied for the purpose of effectuating obvious legislative intent and should not blindly be followed so as to eradicate the clear language and purpose of the statute and allow eligibility for those for whom it was obviously not intended.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">To be included in the calculation of pension benefits, the court must first determine what items of remuneration fall into the broad definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460, and then determine whether they fall within the narrower category of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d as defined in section 31461 \u201cand thus form the basis for the calculation of \u2018final compensation\u2019 on which the pension is based pursuant to section 31462 or 31462.1.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 493-494.) As noted earlier, section 31461 defines \u201c[compensation eamable\u201d as \u201cthe average compensation as determined by the board, for the period under consideration upon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period, and at the same rate of pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">A. <em>Termination Pay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Plan members contend that termination pay should be included in the final calculation of their benefits. By termination pay, they are referring to the one-time cash payments made to plan members upon retirement for accmed but unused compensatory time, sick leave time, and vacation or holiday time. Plan members contend that there is no significant difference between annual in-service cash payments, which <em>Ventura </em>held to be included in pension computations, and termination payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The <em>Ventura </em>court considered the question of annual leave and concluded: \u201cWhen annual leave is taken as time off, the employee simply continues to receive regular salary or wages without the necessity of performing services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Receipt of that pay is part of the employee\u2019s \u2018remuneration\u2019 for past services and is \u2018compensation.\u2019 When an employee elects to receive cash in lieu of accrued vacation and the wages or salary the employee would receive during the vacation period, the cash, like the vacation pay the employee would otherwise receive, is part of the employee\u2019s \u2018remuneration\u2019 for past services. The same analysis applies to the county\u2019s \u2018longevity incentive\u2019 since that item simply grants additional vacation hours to be accrued or cashed out to those employees with five years or more service who are covered by the resolution. Payment to longtime employees, whether in salary for vacation days on which no work is performed or in additional cash, is equivalent to increased pay that often accompanies seniority. It, too, is \u2018remuneration\u2019 and \u2018compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 497-498, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Interpreting <em>Ventura, </em>the trial court ruled that termination pay is not \u201ccompensation\u201d or \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d when the employee cannot or does not elect to receive cash in lieu of the accrued time off prior to retirement. Further, \u201c[s]ection 31462.1 defines \u2018final compensation\u2019 as \u2018the average annual compensation earnable by a member during any year elected by a member at or before the time he files an application for retirement, or, if he fails to elect, during the year <em>immediately preceding </em>his retirement.\u2019 (Italics added; see also \u00a7 31462.)\u201d The court explained: \u201cThe phrase \u2018any year elected by a member\u2019 can refer only to a year of employment, as the default provision upon a failure to elect makes explicit. The plain language of Section 31462.1 thus makes clear that the final compensation period extends up to, but does not include retirement. The one time cash-out of accrued leave becomes payable \u2018upon separation\u2019 from services. (\u00a7 19839.) Separation and retirement occur when employment has terminated, and not during the period of employment itself. For this reason, termination pay need not be included in final compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Plan members contend that prior to their retirement they earn the ability to take the time off without loss of pay and the right to cash out unused paid leave benefits at retirement. These benefits are vested fundamental rights earned by plan members for services rendered, and protected from forfeiture. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 227.3.) Employees, according to plan members, cannot be forced to use their leave benefits prior to retirement. They contend that since the \u201cbenefits not used before retirement are automatically cashed out at separation, it logically follows that the decision to \u2018cash out\u2019 was made before retirement by virtue of the election not to use the benefits during that time frame.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">This argument is, however, unpersuasive.  Whether sick leave or vacation time is included in the calculations for benefits does not bear on plan members\u2019 vested rights to this time, nor does it in anyway compel them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>cash-out prior to retirement. Rather, if they do not or cannot cash out their time prior to retiring, they have received an \u201cin-kind\u201d benefit, not to be calculated as part of their \u201cfinal compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Plan members contend that it does not make sense to have a gap between the measurement of \u201cfinal compensation\u201d and retirement. However, the language of the statute is that \u201cfinal compensation\u201d is \u201cthe average annual compensation eamable by a member during any year elected by a member at or before the time he files an application for retirement, or, if he fails to elect, during the year <em>immediately preceding </em>his retirement.\u201d (\u00a7 31462.1, italics added.) This language is not ambiguous; it plainly excludes retirement and we will not rewrite the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Plan members also cite the following language of section 31461: \u201cCompensation, as defined in Section 31460, that has been deferred shall be deemed \u2018compensation eamable\u2019 when earned, rather than when paid.\u201d According to this language, plan members assert, termination payments became \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d when the right to this compensation was earned, not when it was paid. Thus, their right to termination payments vested prior to their retirement from service. We, however, agree with the following comments of the trial court: \u201cOn its face, the sentence appears to apply to payments made to a deferred compensation plan. Moreover, as termination pay is not required to be included in compensation as defined in section 31460, the sentence in section 31461 has no further application to the issue.\u201d As already made clear by the <em>Ventura </em>court, only cash payments are compensation. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 497.) The reason for expressing by statute that amounts deducted from an employee\u2019s wages for participating in a deferred compensation plan are \u201ccompensation\u201d when earned was \u201c[to] make it clear that the deferred funds, which clearly would have been \u2018compensation\u2019 if paid in the normal course, do not lose that status for pension purposes even though they had not been received by the employee at the time the pension was calculated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 495.) However, as the trial court explained: \u201cWhere an employee cannot or does not elect to receive cash in lieu of the accrued time off prior to retirement, the benefit remains one of time rather than cash.\u201d The right to a termination pay cash-out arises only upon retirement (\u00a7 19839),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> that is <em>separated </em>from service; the right does not arise prior to retirement or during service.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Not including termination pay in the calculation of pension benefits finds further support under PERL. As recognized in <em>Ventura, </em>the language used to define \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d under CERL and PERL was originally essentially the same, and only later was CERL\u2019s definition amended to exclude in-kind advantages while PERL was not so amended. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 497.) \u201c \u2018[W]hen words used in a statute have acquired a settled meaning through judicial interpretation, the words should be given the same meaning when used in another statute dealing with an analogous subject matter; this is particularly trae, where ... both statutes were enacted for the welfare of employees and are in harmony with each other.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 496, fn. 16, quoting <em>Kuntz </em>v. <em>Kern County Employees\u2019 Retirement Assn. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 414, 422 [134 Cal.Rptr. 501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">When PERL\u2019s \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d statutes were essentially the same as those in CERL, termination pay was excluded from calculating retirement benefits. <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>(Santa Monica Police Officers Assn. v. Board of Administration </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 96, 100 [137 Cal.Rptr. 771].) The court in <em>Santa Monica Police </em>reasoned that lump sums for termination pay were like overtime pay in that they both were accrued when the employee works more than expected, and the Legislature expressly excluded overtime pay from the compensation to be included in computing a pension. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, \u201cviewing the State Retirement System as an entity,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe Legislature intended to exclude lump-sum payments for unused sick leave and vacation time from pension computations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 101, fn. omitted; see also <em>Hudson v. Board of Administration </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1323 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 737] [including termination pay would permit \u201cspiking\u201d of pension benefits].)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Termination payments have never been included in the definition of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d under PERL, and plan members have presented no compelling reason as to why this construction under PERL should not apply to \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d under CERL.  Accordingly, we hold that termination pay that is received upon retirement is not required under CERL to be included in the calculation of pension benefits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>B. <em>Employer\u2019s Payment of Insurance-related Premiums</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Plan members assert that an employer\u2019s (1) cash payments into members\u2019 flexible benefit plans that were used to pay insurance premiums for the member (and/or cash payments to purchase benefits for the members) and (2) cash payments to insurers to satisfy the member\u2019s obligation to pay premiums for insurance provided to the member should be included in the calculations of their pension benefits. They claim that neither the statute nor <em>Ventura </em>imposes a requirement that the cash payment must be made directly to the employee in order to qualify as \u201ccompensation\u201d under CERL. They maintain that insurance premiums paid by employers are paid in cash to third parties and are, therefore, remuneration paid in cash, not in-kind advantages.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Section 31460 defines \u201ccompensation\u201d as \u201cthe remuneration paid in cash out of county or district funds, plus any amount deducted from a member\u2019s wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan..., but does not include the monetary value of board, lodging, fuel, laundry, or other advantages furnished to a member.\u201d Plan members contend that this statute does not specify that the cash payment has to be made to the employee, but merely requires that the remuneration paid by the county be in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The <em>Ventura </em>court has already noted that section 31461 is ambiguous in some respects, but the court made it clear that \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460 must be cash payments, not in-kind advantages. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 493.) It held that section 31460 includes any remuneration paid in cash and any amount deducted from the employee\u2019s wages for a deferred compensation plan. <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>at p. 494.) Contributions not deducted from an employee\u2019s wages do not constitute \u201ccompensation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 494-495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The language of the <em>Ventura </em>opinion indicates that it was focusing on <em>what the employee was receiving </em>to determine whether the remuneration was being paid in cash or was an in-kind advantage. The <em>Ventura </em>court explained that, prior to 1951, section 31460 allowed in-kind advantages to be \u201ccompensation\u201d if they \u201cwere provided to an employee in payment or partial payment for the employee\u2019s services.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 495.) In 1951, the statute was amended to provide \u201cthat the monetary value of those items and other advantages was not to be included in \u2018compensation\u2019 for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>purpose.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court explained: \u201cCERL differs from the PERL legislation under consideration in that it excludes, rather than includes, the monetary value of an advantage provided in kind. It does not follow, however, that when the advantage <em>is one received by the employee in cash, </em>the section 31460 exclusion for the \u2018monetary value\u2019 of the advantage is applicable. Under the distinction the statute makes for in-kind advantages, even though a noncash \u2018advantage\u2019 may be \u2018remuneration\u2019 for the employee\u2019s services, the Legislature has relieved CERL counties of the obligation to assign a cash value to in-kind advantages provided to employees and of including that amount in \u2018compensation\u2019 for pension purposes. The Legislature has recognized that some <em>employees receive remuneration other than wages or salary </em>but has concluded that if those \u2018advantages\u2019 are not paid in cash, their value need not be included in \u2018compensation\u2019 for purposes of computing a pension. It has not done so for cash payments made in lieu of providing the same advantages in kind.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 497, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Thus, although the exact question before us was not directly addressed by <em>Ventura, </em>the language of the opinion indicates that it considered the statute to limit the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d to cash remuneration <em>provided to the </em>employee for his or her services. Here, the employee is receiving an insurance premium, not a cash payment. Thus, it is an in-kind benefit, which is not \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460. <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Plan members contend that counties pay cash to a third party and therefore, unlike the in-kind advantages excluded as \u201ccompensation\u201d in <em>Ventura, </em>a precise monetary value can be ascertained. However, we do not agree that whether a precise monetary value can be determined is critical to the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d under CERL. Rather, the <em>Ventura </em>court was simply noting that the Legislature had \u201crelieved CERL counties of the obligation to assign a cash value to in-kind advantages provided to employees ....\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 497.) It did not suggest that in-kind advantages qualified as \u201ccompensation\u201d if a cash value could easily be assigned. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, we agree with the trial court that all in-kind benefits require, at some point, \u201ca cash payment or transfer of funds to either a third party or a separate county department. A rule that differentiated between in-kind benefits based on the ease of determining their monetary value would be unworkable and contrary to the bright line drawn by <em>Ventura, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>which must be understood to be between those benefits paid in cash to the employee and those that are not.\u201d Indeed, a definite sum could be expended for board or lodging, but section 31460 expressly disallows such sums to be considered as \u201ccompensation\u201d if the money is not paid directly to the employee. We see no reason why the payment of insurance premiums should be any different. The employee receives insurance coverage, not cash, and therefore it is not \u201ccompensation\u201d under CERL.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Further, in making its ruling, the trial court properly relied on CERL statutes and legislative history relating to the treatment of flexible benefits to conclude that payments to third parties for insurance benefits are not required to be included in pension calculations. On June 15, 1990, the Legislature enacted section 31460.1, which read: \u201c \u2018Compensation\u2019 shall not include employer payments, including cash payments, made to, or on behalf of, their employees who have elected to participate in a flexible benefits program, where those payments reflect amounts that exceeds [so in chaptered copy] their employees\u2019 salaries.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 142, \u00a7 1, p. 1191.) The Legislature, however, on May 11, 1992, repealed this statute by Senate Bill No. 193 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.). (Stats. 1992, ch. 45, \u00a7 1, p. 158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Senate Bill No. 193 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) provided in part: \u201cSec. 3. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that: [f] ... [f] (3) Section 31460.1 has been erroneously construed as implicitly requiring counties maintaining retirement systems under the 1937 act to include in \u2018compensation\u2019 those flexible benefits payments until the board of supervisors elect pursuant to that section to exclude those flexible benefits payments from \u2018compensation.\u2019 [][] (4) That interpretation was not intended by the Legislature when it enacted that section. Had that been the intent of the Legislature when it enacted Assembly Bill [No.] 3146, it would have been a substantial departure from the long-standing practice of the Legislature of not intruding into the county decisionmaking process regarding compensation determinations with respect to those county retirement systems (see Sections 31460 and following, Government Code), [f] ... [f] (8) Any reversal or termination, on or after the effective date of this act, of county actions taken on the basis of misconstruction of the intent and meaning of Section 31460.1 of the Government Code would merely restrict county employees to those gains reasonably to be expected from their county retirement contracts and withhold unforeseen and windfall advantages which bear no relation to the fundamental theory and objective of the county retirement systems maintained pursuant to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 and would, therefore, not constitute an unconstitutional impairment of the county retirement contract [citation].\u201d (Stats. 1992, ch. 45, \u00a7 3, pp. 158-159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Plan members contend that Senate Bill No. 193 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) did not change the language of the definitions in section 31460and 31461; it simply repealed section 31460.1. However, contrary to plan members\u2019 assertions, the Legislature expressed its intent that it <em>never </em>considered inclusion of flexible benefits to be mandatory under CERL.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Plan members also argue that subsequent legislative interpretations have very little or no effect upon the construction of laws promulgated by a different Legislature. (See, e.g., <em>Honey Springs Homeowners Assn. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1122, 1137 [203 Cal.Rptr. 886] <em>(Honey Springs); Peralta Community College Dist. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 40, 52 [276 Cal.Rptr. 114, 801 P.2d 357] [\u201cThe declaration of a later Legislature is of little weight in determining the relevant intent of the Legislature that enacted the law. [Citations.] This is especially true when, as here, such declared intent is without objective support in either the language or history of the legislation and (until recently) is contrary as well to the practice of the affected agency\u201d (fn. omitted)]; see also <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1254, 1259 [233 Cal.Rptr. 877].) However, \u201c \u2018[although a legislative expression of the intent of an earlier act is not binding upon the courts in their construction of the prior act, that expression may properly be considered together with other factors in arriving at the true legislative intent existing when the prior act was passed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Honey Springs, supra, </em>at p. 1137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We agree that \u201c \u2018[t]he Legislature has no authority to interpret a statute. That is a judicial task. [However], [t]he Legislature may define the meaning of statutory language by a present legislative enactment which, subject to constitutional restraints, it may deem retroactive. But it has no legislative authority simply to say what it <em>did </em>mean. Courts do take cognizance of such declarations where they are consistent with the original intent. \u201c[A] subsequent expression of the Legislature as to the intent of the prior statute, although not binding on the court, may properly be used in determining the effect of a prior act. [Citations.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Honey Springs, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 1137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u201c \u2018Our task is to discern the intent of the statute from its applicable language and context.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Honey Springs, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 1137.) Although the Legislature\u2019s comment regarding why it repealed section 31460.1 is not binding upon us, it still aids in our understanding of the legislative intent. Thus, \u201c \u2018[w]e assume the Legislature amends a statute for a purpose, but that purpose need not necessarily be to change the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>[Citation.] Our consideration of the surrounding circumstances can indicate that the Legislature made material changes in statutory language in an effort only to clarify a statute\u2019s true meaning.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018One such circumstance is when the Legislature promptly reacts to the emergence of a novel question of statutory interpretation: \u201c \u2018An amendment which in effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act, where the amendment was adopted soon after the controversy arose concerning the proper interpretation of the statute ....\u2019\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hudson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1322.) Because Senate Bill No. 193 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.), which clarified the Legislature\u2019s intention regarding former section 31460.1 (an amendment to CERL), was set forth just two years after enacting this statute, it \u201cmust be accepted as the legislative declaration\u201d <em>(Hudson, supra, </em>at p. 1322) of the meaning of section 31460.1 and its interpretation of the requirements under CERL.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We conclude that the Legislature has expressed its intent not to include employer payments into flexible benefit plans and payments of insurance carrier premiums as \u201ccompensation\u201d under CERL, which is consistent with the language of CERL, in harmony with the statutory framework of CERL as a whole, and consistent with the interpretation of CERL as set forth in <em>Ventura </em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, we conclude the trial court properly found that CERL did not require these payments to be included in the calculation of retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">C. <em>Employer Pick-ups of Employee\u2019s Retirement Contributions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Under sections 31581.1, 31630, or 31639.85, county employers may make employee contributions to the retirement system, and plan members contend the trial court erred in refusing to include these contributions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>calculation of \u201ccompensation eamable\u201d for pension benefits. The specific pick-ups at issue are those where the employer pays portions of the member contribution directly to the retirement fund, and nothing is deducted from the member\u2019s salary. It is undisputed that contributions deducted from a member\u2019s salary are included in the calculation of retirement benefits under CERL.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Section 31460 defines \u201ccompensation\u201d as \u201cthe remuneration paid in cash ...plus any amount deducted from a member\u2019s wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan ....\u201d The <em>Ventura </em>court held that under section 31460 any sum deducted from a member\u2019s wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan was \u201ccompensation\u201d under the statute, but that \u201ccannot be said of a county contribution to an employee\u2019s deferred compensation plan.\u201d <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 494.) We agree with the trial court that this reasoning applies to retirement benefit pick-ups. When pickups are not deducted from the employee\u2019s salary, they are not \u201ccompensation\u201d under section 31460.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We also agree with the trial court that plan members\u2019 attempt to characterize these pick-ups as essentially salary substitutes and therefore compensation must fail. Employer contributions to deferred compensation plans are not considered salary substitutes, and there is no more compelling reason to consider employer pick-ups as salary substitutes. As the trial court explained, \u201cthere is no language in the statute or reason in principle why the pick-up of retirement plan contributions should be treated differently.\u201d In addition, pick-ups not deducted from a member\u2019s salary are excluded under PERL. (\u00a7 20636, subd. (g)(4)(E); see also <em>Oden </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 194, 209 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 388] [\u201cEmployer-paid member contributions were authorized to reduce employees\u2019 income tax liability; they were not meant to increase retirement awards\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Furthermore, since the pick-ups do not involve any deduction in the employee\u2019s salary and the <em>employee does not receive any cash payment, </em>an employer paid pick-up is not \u201ccompensation\u201d under CERL. (See pt.

Obledo, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 126, is distinguishable because the <em>Green </em>court was concerned with the retroactive application of a vested right that was unlawfully denied. Here, they argue, plan members have no vested right to a change in the law. We discuss the issue of an alleged change in the law and vested rights in part II.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> This difference is more than academic. If retroactive application only pertains to the computation of past benefits (and future benefits must be imposed under a prospective application), retroactivity, here, would have minimal fiscal impact.  Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), provides a three-year statute of limitations on actions for liability created by statute and therefore benefits would only have to be recalculated for the three years preceding the filing of their lawsuit for those retirees who earned cash premiums. Thus, any argument that an exception to the retroactivity rule should apply on the grounds of fairness and detrimental reliance (see pt. II.D.) would be significantly weakened.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Further, although not addressed by any party, we are not compelled to choose simply between a retroactive or prospective application of the <em>Ventura </em>decision, but have the discretion to give the decision <em>limited </em>retroactive, application. (See, e.g., <em>Li v. Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804, 829 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226] [considerations of administration of justice required limited retroactive application of its holding]; see also <em>Green v. Obledo, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 142.) Since we are concluding that none of the exceptions to the retroactivity rule apply here, we need not consider the option of limited retroactivity. Because of our holding, we also do not need to consider the equal protection issues involved with calculating the benefits for those who retired prior to October 1, 1997, on the basis of an incorrect construction of CERL, while awarding benefits to those who retire after October 1, 1997, on the basis of a correct interpretation of CERL.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> This argument of impairment of contract seems somewhat disingenuous in light of retirement boards\u2019 and counties\u2019 decisions to apply the <em>Ventura </em>decision to all compensation earned after October 1, 1997. There is no evidence or reason to assume that these employees, who will now contribute and receive benefits as mandated under the proper construction of CERL, had any different expectations regarding their pensions than those who retired prior to October 1, 1997. Employees retiring after October 1, 1997, but hired prior to that date, will therefore suffer the precise \u201cimpairment\u201d of contract that counties and retirement boards claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>should bar any retroactive application of the <em>Ventura </em>decision to those employees retiring prior to October 1, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> This does not settle the question of contracts made in reliance on the <em>Guelfi </em>holding under the detrimental reliance and public policy exception to retroactivity (see pt. II.D.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> Counties argue that <em>Ventura </em>represented a change of law, because the Supreme Court denied review of <em>Guelfi. </em>They quote the following language from a Court of Appeal opinion and cite a number of cases quoting this language: \u201c[W]hen the precise question of law has been decided by a District Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court has denied a hearing, such decision will be followed as settling the law ...\u201d <em>(Housing Authority v. Peters </em>(1953) 120 Cal.App.2d 615, 616 [261 P.2d 561].) However, they omit critical language at the end of the sentence: \u201cin the absence of a later decision of the Supreme Court overruling or modifying the prior case.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, there was a Supreme Court decision overruling the prior Court of Appeal opinion. The Supreme Court has expressly stated that, although its denial of review has significance, that is not the same as having ruled on the issue: \u201cAlthough this court\u2019s denial of a hearing is not to be regarded as expressing approval of the propositions of law set forth in an opinion of the District Court of Appeal or as having the same authoritative effect as an earlier decision of this court [citations], it does not follow that such a denial is without significance as to our views [citations].\u201d <em>(DiGenova v.

They claim that a person \u201cwho has already retired cannot be a \u2018future retiree\u2019 nor can he [or she] be an employee who \u2018will receive\u2019 premium pay.\u201d However, the entire passage suggests that the court was referring to the unanticipated costs resulting from granting retroactive relief to the parties before it as well as accommodating future increases. It appears in the context of the entire passage that, when referring to \u201cfuture retiree pensions,\u201d the court was referring to future pensions of retirees and not to future retirees. As to the language referring to \u201cemployees who will receive premium pay,\u201d the court appears to be referring to future retirees, since it was concerned with future adjustments. Accordingly, this language does not indicate that the court had concluded that the readjustment was to be prospective; indeed, the court expressly declined to reach the question of the retroactive application of its holding to other plan members in other counties <em>(Ventura, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 507).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> L.A.

However, when the employer makes the payment to the insurance company, the employee never receives any payment or income to be directly transferred. Indeed, if the employee did receive the money, the employee would have to pay tax.
