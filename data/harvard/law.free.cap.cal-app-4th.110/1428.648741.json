J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">NJD, Ltd., plaintiff, appeals from a judgment in favor of the defendants, the City of San Dimas (the city) and its city council. On appeal, plaintiff contends Judge Judith Ashmann-Gerst erroneously denied an in limine motion in connection with a facial regulatory takings challenge to amendments to the city\u2019s municipal code which restricted construction in a hillside area. Plaintiff further argues that Judge David P. Yaffe incorrectly denied its mandate petition alleging violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 21000 et seq.). In the published portion of this opinion, we will discuss the issue resolved by Judge Ashmann-Gerst\u2014the evidence she could consider in resolving plaintiff\u2019s facial takings challenge to the constitutionality of the city\u2019s hillside zoning restrictions. We find no prejudicial error or abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-8\">Plaintiff owns approximately 200 acres of land in the city\u2019s northern foothills. The foothills area consists of nearly 3,000 acres of land, more than 900 of which are undeveloped and privately owned. The foothills are a sparsely populated area of steep terrain. The fire risk in the area is high. Roughly one-half the foothills area is occupied by the Angeles National Forest, parkland, an equestrian center, and a golf course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">On July 22, 1997, the city instituted a moratorium on development in the northern foothills area. The moratorium was in effect through July 22, 1999. During that time, a consultant under contract with the city studied development of the area and produced a report. An environmental impact report was subsequently prepared. Following public hearings, the city council approved a general plan amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The city council also adopted the Northern Foothills Specific Plan, which was included in the San Dimas Municipal Code as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>Chapter 18.542.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The city\u2019s actions are referred to collectively as \u201cAmendment 99-1.\u201d It is undisputed plaintiff purchased its foothills property while the moratorium was in effect and the development study was ongoing, but before the development restrictions were enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Plaintiff filed a mandate petition alleging California Environmental Quality Act violations. Judge Yaffe denied the petition. The matter was later tried on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint alleging inverse condemnation, due process and equal protection violations, and seeking declaratory relief. Judge Ashmann-Gerst found plaintiff had not established the elements of its claims. As noted above, plaintiff appeals from the judgment denying its writ petition and finding against it on its first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7q\">A. Inverse Condemnation</p>\n<p id=\"Aud\">1. General principles of takings jurisprudence</p>\n<p id=\"A5C\">a. The two constitutional provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">The federal and state Constitutions guarantee real property owners \u201cjust compensation\u201d when their land is \u201ctaken for public use....\u201d (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19.) The federal takings clause is made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Palazzolo </em>v. <em>Rhode Island </em>(2001) 533 U.S. 606, 617 [150 L.Ed.2d 592, 121 S.Ct. 2448]; <em>Kavanau </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 761, 773 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 941 P.2d 851].) California\u2019s takings clause is somewhat broader in its application than its federal counterpart. Article I, section 19 of the California Constitution provides in part, \u201cPrivate property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation, ascertained by a jury unless waived, has first been paid to, or into court for, the owner.\u201d Unlike the Fifth Amendment federal takings clause which provides \u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation,\u201d article I, section 19 of the California Constitution provides coverage for \u201cdamage[] for public use ....\u201d As a result, article I, section 19 of the California Constitution protects what the California Supreme Court has characterized as \u201c \u2018a somewhat broader range of property values\u2019 \u201d than does the corresponding federal constitutional provision. <em>(San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 643, 664 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 269, 41 P.3d 87]; <em>Hensler v. City of Glendale </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1, 9, fn. 4 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 244, 876 P.2d 1043].) Aside from that difference, the California Supreme Court has construed the state and federal clauses congruently. <em>(San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 664; see <em>Santa Monica Beach, Ltd. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 952, 957, 962-975 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 968 P.2d 993].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">b. The two types of takings\u2014categorical and regulatory</p>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">i. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">The United States Supreme Court has identified two types of takings liability; categorical and regulatory takings. In <em>Brown v. Legal Foundation of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number><em>Wash. </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 216, 233 [123 S.Ct. 1406, 1417-1418, 155 L.Ed.2d 376], the United States Supreme Court synthesized its prior decisions concerning the two types of takings: \u201c \u2018Our jurisprudence involving condemnations and physical takings is as old as the Republic and, for the most part, involves the straightforward application of <em>per se </em>rules. Our regulatory takings jurisprudence, in contrast, is of more recent vintage and is characterized by \u201cessentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,\u201d <em>Penn Central [Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York </em>(1978)] 438 U.S. 104, 124 [57 L.Ed.2d 631, 98 S.Ct. 2646] [] designed to allow \u201ccareful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Palazzolo </em>[v. <em>Rhode Island, supra,] </em>533 U.S. [at p.] 636 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).\u2019 \u201d (See also <em>San Remo Hotel </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">As to the first type, categorical takings, which are subject to per se rules, in <em>Brown, </em>citing its decision last year in <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency </em>(2002) 535 U.S. 302, 321-323 [152 L.Ed.2d 517, 122 S.Ct. 1465], the United States Supreme Court held: \u201c \u2018When the government physically takes possession of an interest in property for some public purpose, it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner, [citation], regardless of whether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire parcel or merely a part thereof. Thus, compensation is mandated when a leasehold is taken and the government occupies the property for its own purposes, even though that use is temporary. [Citations.] Similarly, when the government appropriates part of a rooftop in order to provide cable TV access for apartment tenants [citation]; or when its planes use private airspace to approach a government airport [citation], it is required to pay for that share no matter how small.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 233-234 [123 S.Ct. at p. 1418]; see <em>Loewenstein v. City of Lafayette </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 718, 728 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 79].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">In <em>Brown, </em>again citing to its analysis in <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, </em>the United States Supreme Court contrasted the categorical duty to compensate, which is subject to the straightforward application of per se rules, with regulatory takings as follows: \u201c \u2018But a government regulation that merely prohibits landlords from evicting tenants unwilling to pay a higher rent, [citation]; that bans certain private uses of a portion of an owner\u2019s property, [citations]; or that forbids the private use of certain airspace, [citation], does not constitute a categorical taking.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Legal Foundation of Wash., supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 234 [123 S.Ct. at p. 1418], citing <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra, </em>535 U.S. at pp. 321-323.) The United States Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>characterized the differences between the categorical and regulatory takings as follows: \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe first category of cases requires courts to apply a clear rule; the second necessarily entails complex factual assessments of the purposes and economic effects of government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>actions.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., supra, </em>538 U.S. 216 at p. 234 [123 S.Ct. at p. 1418], citing <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra, </em>535 U.S. at pp. 321-323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">In <em>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, supra, </em>533 U.S. at pages 617-618, the United States Supreme Court identified two regulatory taking situations. The first is where a regulation denies a landowner all economically viable use of the property. The second compensable regulatory taking scenario occurs when a regulation places limitations on land use that fall short of a complete deprivation of all economically beneficial use of the property. In <em>Palazzolo, </em>the United States Supreme Court held: \u201c[W]e have given some, but not too specific, guidance to courts confronted with deciding whether a particular government action goes too far and effects a regulatory taking. First, we have observed, with certain qualifications ... that a regulation which \u2018denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land\u2019 will require compensation under the Takings Clause. <em>Lucas [v. South Carolina Coastal Council </em>(1992)] 505 U.S. [1003,] 1015 [120 L.Ed.2d 798, 112 S.Ct. 2886] []; see also <em>id., </em>at 1035 (Kennedy, J., concurring); <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon </em>[(1980)] 447 U.S. 255, 261 [65 L.Ed.2d 106, 100 S.Ct. 2138] []. Where a regulation places limitations on land that fall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complex of factors including the regulation\u2019s economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. <em>Penn Central [Transp. Co. v. City of New York,] supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 124[], These inquiries are informed by the purpose of the Takings Clause, which is to prevent the government from \u2018forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u2019 <em>Armstrong v. United States </em>[(1960)] 364 U.S. 40, 49 [4 L.Ed.2d 1554, 80 S.Ct. 1563].\u201d <em>(Palazzolo </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, supra, </em>533 U.S. at pp. 617-618; accord, <em>San Remo Hotel </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The California Supreme Court has described the applicable test for a compensable regulatory taking in a similar vein in <em>Hensler v. City of Glendale, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at page 10, a case involving an ordinance restricting hillside construction, as follows: \u201c \u2018But where the government merely regulates the use of property, compensation is required only if considerations such as the purpose of the regulation or the extent to which it deprives the owner of the economic use of the property suggest that the regulation has unfairly singled out the property owner to bear a burden that should be borne by the public as a whole.\u2019 <em>(Yee </em>v. <em>City of Escondido </em>(1992) 503 U.S. 519 [118 L.Ed.2d 153, 112 S.Ct. 1522].) An individualized assessment of the impact of the regulation on a particular parcel of property and its relation to a legitimate state interest is necessary in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>whether a regulatory restriction on property use constitutes a compensable taking. (See, e.g., <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Tigard, Ore. </em>(1994) [512] U.S. [374, 386-391].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">ii. The two caveats to the United States Supreme Court analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">We use the United States Supreme Court categorical\u2014regulatory taking dichotomy with prudence in two respects. First, the categorical duty to compensate arises when, for example, government seizes private property. <em>(Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., supra, </em>123 S.Ct. at p. 1418; <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra, </em>535 U.S. at p. 322.) But in <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, supra, </em>505 U.S. at page 1015, the United States Supreme Court used the term \u201ccategorical treatment\u201d to describe a regulation that denied an owner \u201call economically beneficial or productive use of land.\u201d Also, in <em>Lucas, </em>the majority noted that the \u201ccategorical rule\u201d applied to a \u201ctotal regulatory taking[].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1026.) Plaintiff argues that a regulatory taking occurred and relies in large part on <em>Lucas </em>in support of its admissibility of evidence contentions. Our analysis assumes a regulatory taking claim has been posited and does so utilizing the dichotomy identified in <em>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, supra, </em>533 U.S. at page 617, which treats <em>Lucas </em>as a regulatory as distinguished from a categorical takings case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">Second, we recognize that there is some decisional inconsistency in the first type of regulatory taking identified in <em>Palazzolo. </em>According to <em>Palazzolo, </em>the first type of regulatory taking occurs when an enactment \u201c \u2018denies <em>all </em>economically beneficial or productive use of the land ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, supra, </em>533 U.S. at p. 617, italics added; see <em>ante, </em>at p. 1435.) In <em>Palazzolo, </em>as authority for this type of regulatory taking, the majority relied in part on and cited to Justice Lewis Powell\u2019s opinion in <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pages 260-261, a facial takings case, where the Supreme Court articulated as the test for a taking in a zoning case the following: \u201cThe application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, see <em>Nectow v. Cambridge </em>[(1928)] 277 U.S. 183, 188 [72 L.Ed. 842, 48 S.Ct. 447] [], or <em>denies an owner economically viable use of his land, </em>see <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, [supra,] </em>438 U.S. [at p. 138, fn. 36].\u201d (Italics added.) In <em>Palazzolo, </em>the majority also relied on its prior decision in <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pages 1015-1016. In <em>Lucas, </em>Justice Antonin Scalia referred in a single paragraph to a regulatory takings claim as \u201cwhere regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land\u201d and later, citing <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra, </em>447 U.S. at page 261, as when an enactment \u201c <em>\u2018denies an owner economically viable use of his land.\u2019 \u201d (Lucas v. South </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number><em>Carolina Coastal Council, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 1015-1016.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) Quite obviously, in <em>Agins, </em>Justice Powell did not state that the loss of \u201call\u201d \u201ceconomically viable use of [the] land\u201d was a prerequisite to a regulatory takings claim. <em>(Agins </em>v. <em>City of Tiburon, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 261.) But in <em>Lucas, </em>the other relevant decision cited in <em>Palazzolo, </em>in one sentence, Justice Scalia used the modifier \u201call\u201d to refer to the required economic deprivation. But in another sentence in the same paragraph, Justice Scalia did not use the modifier \u201call.\u201d <em>(Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 1015-1016, italics deleted.) We will apply the modifier \u201call\u201d to the requisite economic deprivation because it is used in <em>Palazzolo, </em>which represents a determination by the United States Supreme Court to bring greater definitional certitude to its takings jurisprudence. Finally, in this case the presence or absence of the modifier \u201call\u201d is immaterial to the outcome given the circumstances of plaintiff\u2019s regulatory facial takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">c. The two relevant types of challenges to a zoning statute\u2014facial and as applied</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">A landowner may allege a taking based on an inverse condemnation cause of action on either a facial or an as-applied basis. The clearest description of a facial takings challenge by the United States Supreme Court is in <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, </em>452 U.S. at pages 295-296: \u201cBecause appellees\u2019 taking claim arose in the context of a facial challenge, it presented no concrete controversy concerning either application of the [Surface Mining Control and Reclamation] Act to particular surface mining operations or its effect on specific parcels of land. Thus, the only issue properly before the District Court and, in turn, this Court, is whether the \u2018mere enactment\u2019 of the Surface Mining Act constitutes a taking. [Citation.] The test to be applied in considering this facial challenge is fairly straightforward. A statute regulating the uses that can be made of property effects a taking if it \u2018denies an owner economically viable use of his land ....\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (See <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>DeBenedictis, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 495.) The \u201cmere enactment\u201d test was described in <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number><em>supra, </em>535 U.S. at page 318 like this, \u201c[B]ecause petitioners brought only a facial challenge, the narrow inquiry before the Court of Appeals was whether the mere enactment of the regulations constituted a taking.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has observed that a litigant pursuing a facial challenge in a takings case faces an \u201c \u2018uphill battle.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency </em>(1997) 520 U.S. 725, 736, fn. 10 [137 L.Ed.2d 980, 117 S.Ct. 1659]; <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>DeBenedictis, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 495.) The Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[I]t is difficult to demonstrate that \u201c \u2018mere enactment\u201d \u2019 of a piece of legislation \u2018deprived [the owner] of economically viable use of [his] property.\u2019 <em>Hodel </em>v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., [supra,] </em>452 U.S. at p. 264, 297 [].\u201d <em>(Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra, </em>520 U.S. at p. 736, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">The California Supreme Court has more succinctly differentiated between facial and as-applied challenges as follows: \u201cGenerally, \u2018[a] facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.\u2019 <em>(Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1084 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145] [].) On the other hand, \u2018[a]n as applied challenge may seek ... relief from a specific application of a facially valid statute or ordinance to an individual or class of individuals who are under allegedly impermissible present restraint or disability as a result of the manner or circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied ....\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Santa Monica Beach, Ltd. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 961.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">2. Plaintiff\u2019s precise contention</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">The first cause of action in the first amended complaint is entitled, \u201cINVERSE CONDEMNATION-FACIAL TAKING.\u201d The first cause of action in the amended complaint alleges: a regulatory taking occurs when a regulation fails to substantially advance a legitimate public purpose or denies a property owner economically viable use of land; Amendment 99-1 failed to advance a legitimate public purpose; the express purpose of Amendment 99-1 was to prevent development; a provision of Amendment 99-1 required property owners to provide access for horse trails without adequate compensation; and the actions of the city amounted to an inequitable precondemnation activity. The first amended complaint alleges that the following provisions of Amendment 99-1 rendered development \u201ceconomically un feasible\u201d: the \u201cmaximum densities\u201d allowable under Amendment 99-1 reduced the number of permissible units that could be developed to \u201can uneconomic level\u201d; the development standards were such that even that \u201cuneconomic level\u201d could not be attained; the lot size standards rendered \u201cdevelopment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>economically unfeasible\u201d; the clustering of units on less than one acre lots and the construction of .sufficiently wide roadways to meet fire department standards prevented the servicing of \u201chomes with sewers and [spreading] the costs of roads and other proper municipal services over sufficient units to create an economic development\u201d; the requirement that homes be one story in height increased the need for grading; the grading requirements and other standards assured that the homes would be of low square footage thereby rendering development of marketable residences uneconomic; there was no variance procedure to escape application of the standards because they are part of the city\u2019s general and specific plan; and there is no economically viable agricultural or other use. Plaintiff alleges that Amendment 99-1 thereby denied it \u201call economically viable use of the[] property,\u201d which constituted a de facto taking without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">Prior to the trial before Judge Ashmann-Gerst, defendants filed an in limine motion which sought the following, \u201c[Defendants ... hereby move ... for an order in limine excluding any and all evidence, reference to evidence, testimony or argument other than Amendment 99-1 itself, relevant evidence in the administrative record of that legislation, and judicially noticeable facts regarding the physical condition of the properties ... in support of plaintiff!\u2018s] claim contained within its First Cause of Action for Facial Taking that Amendment 99-1 deprives it of economically viable use of its property.\u201d Judge Ashmann-Gerst granted the in limine motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that Judge Ashmann-Gerst erroneously granted the in limine motion. Plaintiff argues that economic impact evidence is an essential component of a facial challenge in a takings case. Plaintiff\u2019s principal authority consists of two quotations in the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pages 1018 and 1016, footnote 6. The first quotation relied upon by plaintiff from <em>Lucas </em>is as follows, \u201c[Regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its use\u2014typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state\u2014carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious harm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1018.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">Additionally, plaintiff relies upon a footnote in <em>Lucas, </em>which is a response by the majority to analysis appearing in a footnote in the dissenting opinion of Justice Harry Blackmun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response to Justice Blackmun\u2019s analysis, the majority argued in its own footnote, the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>italicized portions upon which plaintiff relies: \u201cWe will not attempt to respond to all of Justice Blackmun\u2019s mistaken citation of case precedent. Characteristic of its nature is his assertion that the cases we discuss here stand merely for the proposition \u2018that proof that a regulation does <em>not </em>deny an owner economic use of his property is sufficient to defeat a facial takings challenge\u2019 and not for the point that <em>\u2018denial </em>of such use is sufficient to establish a takings claim regardless of any other consideration.\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 2911, n. 11. [f] The cases say, repeatedly and unmistakably, that \u201c \u2018[t]he test to be applied in considering [a] facial [takings] challenge is fairly straightforward. A <em>statute regulating the uses that can be made of property effects a taking if it \u2018denies an owner economically viable use of his land.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>Keystone [Bituminous Coal Assn. v. </em>DeBenedictis[, <em>supra,] </em>480 U.S. 470,] 495 [94 L.Ed.2d 472, 107 S.Ct. 1232], quoting <em>Hodel </em>[v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., [supra, </em>452 U.S. at pp.] 295-296 [] (quoting <em>Agins </em>[v. <em>City of Tiburon, supra,] </em>447 U.S. at 261 [] (emphasis added), [f] Justice Blackmun describes that rule (which we do not invent but merely apply today) as \u2018alter[ing] the long-settled rules of review\u2019 by foisting on the State \u2018the burden of showing [its] regulation is not a taking.\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 2909. This is of course wrong. Lucas had to do more than simply file a lawsuit to establish his constitutional entitlement; <em>he had to show that the Beachfront Management Act denied him economically beneficial use of his land. </em>Our analysis presumes the unconstitutionality of state land-use regulation only in file sense that <em>any </em>rule with exceptions presumes the invalidity of a law that violates it\u2014for example, the rule generally prohibiting content-based restrictions on speech. See, e.g., <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. N.Y. Members of State Crime Victims Bd., </em>502 U.S. 105, 115 [116 L.Ed.2d 476, 112 S.Ct. 501] [] (1991) (\u2018A statute is presumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>imposes a financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech\u2019). Justice Blackmun\u2019s real quarrel is with the substantive standard of liability we apply in this case, a long-established standard we see no need to repudiate.\u201d <em>(Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 1016, fn. 6, orig. italics.) Based on the foregoing dictum, a portion of it arising in the context of an inter-court debate in footnotes in <em>Lucas, </em>plaintiff argues that as part of its facial challenge to Amendment 99-1 it had a duty and the corresponding right to present evidence as to the lack of any economically viable use of its hillside property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">On appeal, plaintiff argues it should have been permitted to present evidence that as a consequence of the adoption of Amendment 99-1, its hillside property lost \u201call economic viability under private ownership.\u201d Plaintiff asserts the reasons its hillside property had lost all economic viability because of the adoption of Amendment 99-1 were as follows; the diminution in the number of residential units that could be built; a reduction in the potential revenue that would be derived from the sale of single family homes; an increase in the land development expenditures expressed on a cost per unit basis; the permitted densities of either 20 or 5 dwelling units resulted in insufficient cash flow to compensate the developer for investment and risks associated with development; and the permitted densities of either 20 or 5 dwelling units failed to provide for an adequate \u201creturn on the initial land investment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">3. The takings issue posited by plaintiff and the standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">It is crucial to identify the two components of the precise challenge before us. Plaintiff is making a <em>facial </em>challenge to Amendment 99-1. As such, the legal issue plaintiff presents is what the United States Supreme Court characterized as \u201cwhether the \u2018mere enactment\u2019 \u201d of Amendment 99-1 constitutes a taking, i.e., denies the \u201c \u2018owner economically viable use\u2019 \u201d of the hillside property. <em>(Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 495; <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, </em>452 U.S. at pp., 295-296.) Plaintiff is further contending that a regulatory rather than a categorical taking has occurred. The regulatory taking is of the first type identified in <em>Palazzolo; </em>Amendment 99-1 has deprived plaintiff of \u201call economically beneficial or productive use\u201d of its hillside property. <em>(Palazzolo </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, supra, </em>533 U.S. at p. 617.) Therefore, the issue before Judge Ashmann-Gerst was whether the facial challenge warranted the presentation of the aforementioned evidence to prove that Amendment 99-1 deprived plaintiff of all \u201c \u2018economically beneficial or productive use\u2019 \u201d of its hillside property. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In assessing plaintiff\u2019s evidentiary admissibility contentions on appeal, we apply the deferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>(Dart Industries, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1059, 1078 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 142, 52 P.3d 79]; <em>People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 203 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">4. Judge Ashmann-Gerst did not abuse her discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to present the proffered evidence in support of its facial challenge to Amendment 99-1</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">We agree with defendants that Amendment 99-1 provided economically beneficial uses as well as discretionary procedures to mitigate any unfairness in its application. Among other things, Amendment 99-1 permits: single-family residences; equestrian uses; and commercial communications facilities (San Dimas Mun. Code,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u00a7 18.542.120); public utility facilities (Mun. Code, \u00a7 18.542.140),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the construction of one residential structure on every 5 to 80 acres depending on the status of the natural slope of the hillside (Mun. Code, \u00a7 18.542.110);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the construction of at least one dwelling unit on each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>existing lot regardless of the density limitations established under the slope analysis (Mun. Code, \u00a7 18.542.110(D)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Further, the variance procedures set forth in the city\u2019s municipal code were available to ameliorate any harshness imposed by the hillside property development limitations. Municipal Code section 18.204.010 states: \u201cWhen practical difficulties, unnecessary hardships, or results inconsistent with the general intent and purpose of this title occur by reason of the strict interpretation of any of its provisions, any property owner may initiate proceedings for consideration of a variance from the provisions of this title, [f] A variance will not be granted to permit a land use expressly prohibited in the zone in which the property is located.\u201d No doubt, as plaintiff argues, the variance procedure cannot be utilized to modify requirements imposed by the city\u2019s general plan. (See <em>deBottari v. City Council </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1211-1212 [217 Cal.Rptr. 790]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 65860, subd. (a) [\u201c[C]ity zoning ordinances shall be consistent with the general plan of the ... city ...\u201d].) But because Amendment 99-1 is part of the city\u2019s Municipal Code, the variance provisions of chapter 18.204 set forth above allow for amelioration of any of its unduly harsh provisions. Moreover, Amendment 99-1 allows for some very limited discretion in connection with: grading (Mun. Code, \u00a7 18.542.230(D);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> setbacks (Mun. Code, \u00a7 18.542.260);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> lot and site design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>(Mun. Code, \u00a7 18.542.270);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> adjustment of driveways and roadways (Mun. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 18.542.280, 18.542.290);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> placement of utilities (Mun. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>\u00a7 18.542.320);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the like. Additionally, Amendment 99-1 vests the city\u2019s planning director with authority to make minor modifications to the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>plan.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Hence, defendants argue that, <em>on its face, </em>Amendment 99-1 does not constitute a regulatory taking depriving plaintiff of all economically viable use of its hillside property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">In response to defendants\u2019 foregoing analysis, the only controlling authority cited by plaintiff is <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, supra, </em>505 U.S. at page 1016, footnote 6, discussed above. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1440-1441.) Initially, it should be noted that the language relied upon by plaintiff does not discuss the issue of admissibility of evidence in a facial challenge to regulatory taking. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that its decisions are not controlling authority for propositions not considered by it in the case. <em>(Landgraf v. USI Film Products </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 244, 265 [128 L.Ed.2d 229, 114 S.Ct. 1483] [\u201c[T]he \u2018maxim not to be disregarded that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used\u2019 \u201d]; <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>City of St. Paul, Minn. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 377, 386-387, fn. 5 [120 L.Ed.2d 305, 112 S.Ct. 2538] [it is \u201ccontrary to all traditions of our jurisprudence to consider the law on this point conclusively resolved by broad language in cases where the issue was not presented or even envisioned\u201d]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 669, 680 [97 L.Ed.2d 550, 107 S.Ct. 3054] [\u201cno holding can be broader than the facts before the court\u201d].) The issue before us was not before the United States Supreme Court in Lucas\u2014hence, it is not the controlling authority plaintiff claims it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">Most importantly though, <em>Lucas </em>is materially factually different from the present case. In <em>Lucas, </em>the regulation at issue prohibited the building of any inhabitable structure on the property. Justice Scalia described the factual and legal issue in <em>Lucas </em>as follows: \u201cIn 1986, petitioner David H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>Lucas paid $975,000 for two residential lots on the Isle of Palms in Charleston County, South Carolina, on which he intended to build single-family homes. In 1988, however, the South Carolina Legislature enacted the Beachfront Management Act ... which had the direct effect of barring petitioner from erecting any permanent habitable structures on his two parcels. [] A state trial court found that this prohibition rendered Lucas\u2019s parcels \u2018valueless.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lucas v. South Carolina, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 1006-1007.) Later, Justice Scalia described the effect of the land use regulation at issue: \u201c[U]nder the [Beachfront Management] Act construction of occupiable improvements was flatly prohibited [on Mr. Lucas\u2019s property]. The [Beachfront Management] Act provided no exceptions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1008-1009.) The South Carolina Beachfront Management Act, which on its face accomplished a regulatory taking, is materially different from San Dimas\u2019s Amendment 99-1 with its exceptions and the availability of the safeguard of the variance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">Further, Judge Ashmann-Gerst, without abusing her discretion, could find the evidence plaintiff proffered irrelevant to a facial challenge.  In <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, supra, </em>480 U.S. at page 494, Justice John Paul Stevens explained the precise nature of a takings challenge, a facial as distinguished from an as-applied claim, is critical to assessing takings litigation. Justice Stevens wrote: \u201cThe posture of the case is critical because we have recognized an important distinction between a claim that the mere enactment of a statute constitutes a taking and a claim that the particular impact of government action on a specific piece of property requires the payment of just compensation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As already noted, in both <em>Hodel </em>and <em>Keystone, </em>the United States Supreme Court explained that: there is no set formula for assessing a regulatory taking; in the regulatory taking context, \u201c \u2018These \u201cad hoc, factual inquiries\u201d must be conducted\u2019 \u201d by a court; in a facial challenge in the regulatory takings context, the issue is whether the \u201cmere enactment\u201d of the statute is at issue; and a facial challenge presents no \u201c \u2018concrete controversy\u2019 \u201d as to the application of the statute to the property at issue. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 494-495; <em>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 295-296.) The \u201cmere enactment\u201d language that defines the nature of a facial challenge also appears in <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra, </em>535 U.S. at page 318. All of plaintiff\u2019s proffered evidence related to the application of Amendment 99-1 to the profitable development of its hillside property. Thus, without abusing her discretion, Judge Ashmann-Gerst could conclude that plaintiff\u2019s proffered evidence was irrelevant to its facial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">Three other points are pertinent to plaintiff\u2019s takings claim. First, we are not holding that no evidence may be received in a facial regulatory takings case. In this case, Judge Ashmann-Gerst had an extensive array of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>before her concerning Amendment 99-1 including the administrative record. There was no issue as to the extent of Amendment 99-1 and its exceptions. There was no dispute as to plaintiff\u2019s standing to bring suit. By contrast for example, in <em>Lucas, </em>the plaintiff had a duty to demonstrate his parcel was subject to the South Carolina\u2019s Beachfront Management Act. Certainly, a party has a right to present relevant evidence. But the amount and type of admissible evidence depends on the type of takings challenge; be it categorical or regulatory, facial or as-applied. Of course on appeal, these matters are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Second, plaintiff does not assert the second type of regulatory taking described in <em>Palazzolo </em>has occurred; viz. when the regulatory action has not eliminated all economically beneficial uses but a taking depends on a \u201ccomplex of factors\u201d including the economic effect, the extent of interference with the owner\u2019s reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. <em>(Palazzolo </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, supra, </em>533 U.S. at pp. 617-618, citing <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. City of New York, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 124; see <em>Kavanau v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 775.) We need not resolve whether a facial claim can be pursued in the context of this second type of regulatory takings case. Given our discussion, we need not address the other contentions posited by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Third, plaintiff contends the only way to make development economically feasible would be to substantially increase allowable density; moreover, because both the general and specific plans set forth maximum density, a legislative amendment of the general plan and adoption of a new specific plan would be required. Therefore, plaintiff reasons, the availability of variance procedures applicable to the specific plan but not to the general plan (Mun. Code, \u00a7 18.204.010 et seq.) is immaterial. As discussed above, whether there is no economically viable use of plaintiff\u2019s property absent a change in the allowable density is a question that exceeds the reach of a facial challenge to Amendment 99-1. It presents a concrete controversy as to the application of the zoning restrictions to plaintiff\u2019s particular property. Plaintiff\u2019s argument with respect to the restrictions set forth in the general plan does not render its facial challenge viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">B.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>IV. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">The judgment is affirmed.

The steep slopes are exposed to the south, southwest, and southeast, and are highly visible through the City of San Dimas and beyond. Of the 33 undeveloped properties within the Northern Foothills area, only two had average slopes less than 30 percent. Even at low, rural densities, significant grading would be required for residences and access roads. Grading at a 2:1 densities or even 1.5:1 slope ratio will result in extended benches before a daylight line can be reached. [1] In the past, the adopted objectives for hillside residential areas spoke to preservation of the natural landscape, while providing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>rural residential development. The problem is that a policy of preserving the natural landscape could not be literally applied to the Northern Foothills area because any development within the rugged Northern Foothills would result in loss of the natural landscape and habitat. In addition, policies that are appropriate to other hillside areas within San Dimas cannot adequately address the unique needs and challenges of the Northern Foothills planning area. Thus, the General Plan should provide for a specific and separate policy direction for the Northern Foothills. [H The guiding principle for managing environmental values and future development within the Northern Foothills area is to protect the area\u2019s natural environmental and existing resources, and to ensure that the design/layout of future hillside developments (1) preserve sensitive resources in place, (2) adapt to the natural hillside topography and maximizes view opportunities to, as well as from the development. Overall, the strategy emphasizes fitting projects into their hillside setting rather than altering the hillside to fit the project. Thus, although individual property rights within the Northern Foothills Area must be recognized, the priority between development and natural resource values should be given to protecting the resource.\u201d The Land Use Standards were amended to set forth development feasibility zones and maximum allowable densities. Maximum allowable densities were set forth depending upon location within or outside a development feasibility zone and actual slope, followed by a statement that, \u201cAchievement of the maximum development intensity cited above is not guaranteed; the actual yield of any development is to be determined based upon: [\u2018\u00a1D\u2014site-specific physical characteristics; Q]\u2014the need for mitigation or avoidance of impacts to biological habitats; [f]\u2014the environmental sensitivity of proposed site design, grading, and type of construction; [f]\u2014available on-site and off-site access; and [f]\u2014the ability of the proposed project to avoid impacts on other properties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1307-8\"> The Northern Foothills Specific Plan, San Dimas Municipal Code Chapter 18.542, established \u201cthe type, location, intensity and character of development to take place\u201d in the area. The statement of its purpose and intent is as follows: \u201cA. Responsible development of the Northern Foothills of the City can be ensured through the adoption of a development control mechanism that reflects thorough and comprehensive land use planning. The most suitable development control mechanism is the specific plan, which when adopted, serves both a planning function and a regulatory function, [f] B. The purpose of Specific Plan No. 25 is to provide for managing environmental values and future development within the northern foothills area in order to protect the area\u2019s natural environment and existing resources and to ensure that the design of future hillside developments preserves sensitive resources in place, adapts to the natural hillside topography and maximizes view opportunities to, as well as from, the developments. Overall, the strategy emphasizes fitting projects into their hillside setting rather than altering the hillside to fit the project. Thus, although individual property rights within the Northern Foothills Area must be recognized, the priority between development and natural resource values should be given to protecting the natural resource, [f] C. Specific Plan No. 25 establishes the type, location, intensity and character of development to take place. It functions as a general blueprint of future development, focusing on the physical characteristics of the site and integration of the same with surrounding uses.\u201d The Specific Plan sets forth maximum allowable single-family dwelling unit densities consistent with the General Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1312-6\"> The complete paragraph is as follows: \u201cThe second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land.

Site design shall utilize varying setbacks, structure heights, innovative building techniques, and retaining walls to blend structures into the terrain, [ft] D. Lot and site design shall consider building separation to maintain a rural character and to facilitate privacy between residential structures, [ft] E. Site design shall allow for different lot shapes and sizes, as well as the provision of split development pads, with the prime determinant being the natural terrain, [ft] F. Houses shall not be excessively tall so as to dominate their surroundings. Structures shall be a maximum of one story in height, but may be constructed on split, flat pads contained within a limited envelope parallel to the finished grade, rather than \u2018jutting out\u2019 over natural slopes, [ft] G. Flag lots shall be allowed in areas where it is demonstrated that the end result is the preservation of natural topography by minimizing grading, [ft] H. Structures shall be sited in a manner that will fit into the hillside\u2019s contour and relate to the form of the terrain; retain outward views while maintaining the natural character of the hillside; preserve vistas of natural hillside areas and ridgelines from public places and streets; preserve existing views; and, allow new dwellings access to views similar to those enjoyed from existing dwellings ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1319-7\"> Municipal Code section 18.542.280 provides, \u201cIn addition to the standards established by Chapter 18.156 [vehicle parking and storage], the following standards will apply: [ft] A. General. Driveways and drives shall be designed to a grade and alignment that will provide the maximum of safety and convenience for vehicular, emergency and pedestrian use and in a manner which will not interfere with drainage or public use of the street areas. Driveways shall be located and designed to minimize disturbance to natural terrain, [ft] B. A minimum of two off-street parking spaces within a fully enclosed garage shall be provided for each dwelling unit. In addition, four off-street parking spaces for guests shall be provided for each dwelling unit. Off-street guest parking may be reduced where it is found that sufficient on-street parking is available or excessive grading would be necessary to create the off-street guest parking, [ft] C. Driveways shall have a minimum width of sixteen feet, unless modified to preserve natural terrain pursuant to the plan disposition procedure, [ft] D. The occasional use of common driveways serving two or more residences can drastically reduce the potential monotonous repetition of driveways as well as reduce grading and the on-site costs of development. Driveways which serve more than one lot, as well as diagonal driveways running along contour lines, are encouraged as a means of reducing unnecessary grading, paving and site disturbance. These arrangements shall be encouraged ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-8\">Pursuant to Municipal Code section 18.542.290, governing access and circulation, \u201cPlans delineating access to the subject site and area[]wide circulation shall be required and shall be in compliance with the following standards: [ft] A.

Roadways within Specific Plan No. 25 shall provide for minimum safe passage of two cars along a paved road section, except in limited circumstances and as approved by the planning director and city engineer, [ft] 2. Street widths shall conform to the following minimum street sections. On-street parking shall be prohibited unless deemed safe or unless parking turn-outs are provided, [ft] 3. Streets shall follow the natural contours of the hillside to minimize cut and fill.... [ft] 4. Streets may be split into two, parallel one-way streets, thereby effectively functioning as a two-way street with a median, in steeper areas to minimize grading and blend with the terrain.... [ft] 5. Cul-de-sacs or loop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>roads are encouraged where necessary to fit the terrain. [|] 6. On-street parking and sidewalks may be eliminated, subject to city approval, to reduce required grading. HQ B. Roadway Curve and Grade Standards. Roadway grades and curves should accommodate safety and emergency vehicles. HQ 1. Existing roadway grade standards shall be applied to all proposed subdivisions and parcel maps. However, the planning director and city engineer may grant exceptions to existing roadway standards for grades and curves where, in their judgment, existing or future access cannot reasonably meet such standards. These exceptions are to be limited to providing access to a single-family dwelling on an existing lot of record along roadways which will ultimately serve a maximum of four dwellings, based on the maximum allowable density in the General Plan, and where not providing such an exception would effectively preclude access to an existing lot of record. HQ 2. Where the planning director and city engineer grant an exception to roadway grade standards, owners whose land is served by such a roadway will be required to provide adequate assurance that the roadway will be kept properly maintained at all times. In addition, such landowners will be required to record a deed restriction which prohibits further subdivision of the property without meeting roadway grade standards and provides an acknowledgment of this special circumstance. Such owners will also be required to indemnify the city or any other service provider against any liability regarding emergency or nonemergency vehicle access. HQ C. Circulation Standards. Roadway improvements to provide access to parcels shall not adversely affect other properties through extensive grading, flood control facilities, or any other type of construction and/or requisite support infrastructure. HO D. Reductions in Minimum Roadway Standards. In conjunction with the review of a development proposal, consideration may be given to reducing certain specified roadway standards pursuant to the following: HQ 1. Within the upper elevations of the northern foothills area, a further reduction in required roadway width may be permitted for private roadways which will ultimately serve a maximum of four dwellings, based on the maximum allowable density permitted by the General Plan, and where not providing such a reduction would effectively preclude access to an existing lot of record. For such roadways, roadway standards may permit a curb-to-curb width which does not allow for passage of two vehicles (minimum sixteen feet, measured edge-to-edge) for a distance of up to one hundred fifty feet in any one segment. HQ a. Where such a reduction in roadway width is permitted, owners whose land is served by such a roadway shall be required to provide adequate assurance that the roadway will be kept properly maintained at all times. In addition, such landowners will be required to record a deed restriction which prohibits further subdivision of the property without meeting roadway width requirements, and provides an acknowledgment of this special circumstance. Such owners will also be required to indemnify the city or any other service provider against any liability regarding emergency or nonemergency vehicle access. HQ 2. An exception to current city roadway requirements for street paving may be permitted along private roadways which will ultimately serve a maximum of four dwellings, based on the maximum density allowable in the General Plan. Such limited use roadways should be permitted to be hard packed (e.g., decomposed granite) as approved by the planning director and city engineer, provided that adequate maintenance is guaranteed to ensure that the roadway will be regularly graded and kept clear of ruts and debris. HO a. Where such an unpaved roadway is permitted, owners whose land is served by such a roadway shall be required to provide adequate assurance that the roadway will be kept properly maintained at all times. In addition, such landowners will be required to record a deed restriction which prohibits further subdivision of the property without providing required paving, and provides an acknowledgment of this special circumstance. Such owners will also be required to indemnify the city or any other service provider against any liability regarding emergency or nonemergency vehicle access.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1320-5\"> Placement of overhead utilities is governed by Municipal Code section 18.542.320, which provides, \u201cOverhead utilities may be permitted and shall comply with the following standards. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>[]\u25a1 A.
