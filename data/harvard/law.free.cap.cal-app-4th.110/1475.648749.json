(49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13501(1)(A).) Although there are several exemptions from this jurisdiction (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13502, 13503, 13504, 13505), and although there is a specific statutory exemption for the transportation by motor carrier of agricultural or horticultural commodities, including poultry (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13506(a)(6)(B); <em>Gold Kist, Inc. v. United States </em>(N.D. Ga. 1971) 339 F.Supp. 1249, affd. <em>sub nom.

(PLT) to arrange transportation to California for a load of frozen poultry. PLT agreed, and Harrison Poultry issued a bill of lading in which PLT was identified as the \u201ccarrier.\u201d PLT arranged for Sky Transportation, Inc. to pick up the poultry, which it did (the bill of lading was signed by a driver employed by Sky and driving a truck registered to Sky). When it reached California on December 2, the truck negligently collided with a motorcycle driven by Juan Manuel Serna, killing Serna. Serna\u2019s widow and children (collectively Serna) sued Sky and the truck driver (but not PLT) for wrongful death damages and settled that action for about $1 million <em>(Serna I). </em>Serna then filed this action <em>(Serna II) </em>against PLT, claiming PLT is vicariously liable for Sky\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> PLT answered, alleging as an affirmative defense that it was acting as a broker, not a carrier.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">At PLT\u2019s request, the trial court tried PLT\u2019s affirmative defense first and without a jury. At the conclusion of Serna\u2019s evidence, PLT moved for nonsuit and the motion was granted, the trial court finding (as Serna claimed) that PLT was acting as a carrier, not as a broker, and finding on undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>evidence (as PLT claimed) that Sky was an independent contractor, but then concluding as a matter of law that PLT was not vicariously liable for Sky\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">The court reasoned thus: The truck involved in this accident was (by stipulation) a commercial motor vehicle within the meaning of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 31101; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 13102(12); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.5 (2003)) and ordinarily would have been subject to the Surface Transportation Board\u2019s registration and permit requirements (49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13101-16106). But because this truck was transporting frozen poultry, it was exempt from the Act\u2019s registration and permit requirements (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13506(a)(6)(B); <em>Gold Kist, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>339 F.Supp. 1249) and, therefore, not (at the time of the accident) \u201c \u2018carrying on an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a franchise granted by public authority\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of <em>Eli v. Murphy </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 598, 599, fn.* [248 P.2d 756], and <em>Gamboa v. Conti Trucking, Inc. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 663, 666, fn. 3 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 564], Hence, said the trial court, PLT is not liable for the negligence of Sky, an independent contractor. <em>(Millsap v.

Serna appeals, and PLT has filed a protective cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">The essence of Serna\u2019s primary claim is that \u201cexempt\u201d and \u201cunregulated\u201d are not synonymous, that the frozen poultry exemption does not leave PLT unregulated by a statutory scheme enacted for the protection of the public, and that PLT was at the time of the accident carrying on an activity (1) which could be lawfully conducted only under a public franchise or authority and (2) which involved an unreasonable risk of harm to others. It follows, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>according to Serna, that PLT is vicariously liable for the torts of Sky, its independent contractor. We agree, and therefore do not reach Serna\u2019s other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\"><em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">The seminal California case is <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Oakland Scavenger Co. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 594 [110 P.2d 1044]. In <em>Taylor, </em>a garbage truck struck a high school student on the school\u2019s premises. The student sued the truck\u2019s driver, the truck\u2019s owner, the school district, and Oakland Scavenger Company, a garbage collector working under a contract with the City of Oakland. On Oakland Scavenger\u2019s appeal following a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, Oakland Scavenger claimed it was not liable for the driver\u2019s negligence because the truck\u2019s owner was an independent contractor over whom Oakland Scavenger exercised little supervision or control. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 603.) The Supreme Court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-7\">\u201cAn employer is generally liable for negligent acts of an employee performed within the scope of employment, but if an independent contractor rather than master and servant relationship exists, the independent contractor usually is alone liable for his negligent acts. <em>If, however, an individual or corporation undertakes to carry on an activity involving possible danger to the public under a license or franchise granted by public authority subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed by the public authority, these liabilities may not be evaded by delegating performance to an independent contractor. The original contractor remains subject to liability for harm caused by the negligence of the independent contractor employed to do the work. \u201d (Taylor v. Oakland Scavenger Co., supra, 17 </em>Cal.2d at p. 604, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">\n<em>Gaskill v. Calaveras Cement Co.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">In <em>Gaskill </em>v. <em>Calaveras Cement Co. </em>(1951) 102 Cal.App.2d 120 [226 P.2d 633], the Court of Appeal refused to apply the rule announced in <em>Taylor </em>to a defendant who was not operating under a franchise. According to <em>Gaskill, </em>the <em>Taylor </em>rule \u201cis principally applicable to public service corporations, which, as such, are permitted by their <em>franchises </em>to use instrumentalities which are <em>peculiarly dangerous unless carefully operated, </em>and ... the rule ... does not apply to the carrying on of activities which involve no special danger and which can be lawfully carried on by private persons without liability for the misconduct of the contractors to whom they are entrusted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>\n<em>Eli v. Murphy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">The rule articulated in <em>Taylor </em>was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <em>Eli v. Murphy, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 598.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Eli, </em>the plaintiffs were injured when their car was struck by a tractor and semitrailer driven and owned by the Murphys and used to transport freight under a contract between the Murphys and C.M.T., a highway common carrier licensed by the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 598.) On C.M.T.\u2019s appeal following a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the Supreme Court agreed with the plaintiffs that \u201cunder both the common law and certain regulations of the [PUC], C.M.T., as a highway common carrier, could not delegate its duties to an independent contractor so as to escape liability for their negligent performance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 599.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">\u201cThe common law principle upon which plaintiffs rely has been enunciated in section 428 of the Restatement of Torts,[] and has frequently been applied to impose liability upon franchised common carriers who have engaged independent contractors to transport goods over the public highways. [Citations.] We have concluded that it is applicable here, [f] C.M.T., operating as a highway common carrier, is engaged in a \u2018business attended with very considerable risk\u2019 [citations], and the Legislature has subjected it and similar carriers to the full regulatory power of the [PUC] to protect the safety of the general public. [Citations.] <em>The effectiveness of safety regulations is necessarily impaired if a carrier conducts its business by engaging independent contractors over whom it exercises no control. If by the same device it could escape liability for the negligent conduct of its contractors, not only would the incentive for careful supervision of its business be reduced, but members of the public who are injured would be deprived of the financial responsibility of those who had been granted the privilege of conducting their business over the public highways. Accordingly, both to protect the public from financially irresponsible contractors, and to strengthen safety regulations, it is necessary to treat the carrier\u2019s duties as nondelegable. </em>[Citations. ] [][]...</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">\u201cThe Legislature has ... classified highway common carriers such as C.M.T. apart from others, and by so doing has indicated special concern with the safety of their operations. ... [][] ... [y In view of the more extensive and regular operations of highway common carriers as compared with others, the Legislature could reasonably conclude that the safety of their operations is of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>special importance and legislate accordingly. Highway common carriers may not, therefore, insulate themselves from liability for negligence occurring in the conduct of their business by engaging independent contractors to transport freight for them.\u201d <em>(Eli v. Murphy, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d at pp. 599-601, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">\n<em>Snyder v. Southern Cal. Edison Co.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">In <em>Snyder v. Southern Cal. Edison Co. </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 793 [285 P.2d 912], the Supreme Court quoted at length <em>from Eli v. Murphy, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 598, then expanded the nondelegable duty rule this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-7\">\u201cThe rule of nondelegable duty has been applied to the maintenance of premises by a landlord through an independent contractor with respect to his tenants or their employees [citations]; to the owner of an amusement concession operated by an independent contractor when a patron was injured [citations]; [and] to the owner of property who, through an independent contractor, so repaired part of the premises as to cause damage to the one occupying the floor below [citation]. <em>Where an activity involving possible danger to the public is carried on under public franchise or authorityf, ] the one engaging in the activity may not delegate to an independent contractor the duties or liabilities imposed on him by the public authority </em>[citations] and generally speaking there are many situations in which the person cannot absolve himself from liability by delegating his duties to an independent contractor. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Snyder v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at pp. 798-799, italics and underscoring added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number><em>Klein </em>v. <em>Leatherman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">In <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Leatherman </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 792 [76 Cal.Rptr. 190], where the subhauler\u2019s permit had been revoked and he was operating without the required public liability insurance, the Court of Appeal noted that <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Edison Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at page 799, spoke in terms of an activity carried on under a public \u201cfranchise or authority.\u201d <em>(Klein v. Leatherman, supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d at p. 795, italics added.) The Court of Appeal then held that, in \u201cconsonance with the trend of such decisions, the facts and public policy involved in this case require us to hold that the duties of care of [the defendant Leatherman, as a] common carrier [operating with a permit] and as a contract carrier [citation] were nondelegable; and that he is chargeable with the negligence of [his subhauler] and its driver.... At the time of [the plaintiffs] injury ..., [the subhauler] had forfeited its legal permission to operate on the highways. Therefore, its performance can only be legalized by inferring [the subhauler] was an agent of Leatherman, operating under his permit. [Citations.] A highway contract carrier engaging another as a subhauler thus is under a practical compulsion to verify that the subhauler possesses an unrevoked permit and the required insurance coverage. This is in the public interest, as well as his own.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 796.) A petition for review was denied by the Supreme Court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\"><em>Millsap </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">The plaintiff in <em>Millsap v. Federal Express Corp., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d 425, was injured when her car was struck by a car driven by Christopher Pence. At the time of the accident, Pence worked for NCE as an independent contractor and was delivering a package that had been flown to California by Federal Express. Millsap sued Pence, NCE, and Federal Express \u201con the theory that Pence was an employee of NCE acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident, and that [Federal Express] had contracted with NCE for the work done by Pence.... \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 428.) NCE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>and Federal Express prevailed on motions for summary judgment, and NCR\u2019s judgment was affirmed on appeal. After holding that Pence was in fact NCE\u2019s independent contractor, the Court of Appeal explained the rules this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-4\">\u201cIt has been held that the general rule of nonliability of an employer of an independent contractor for the contractor\u2019s negligence \u2018is subject to exceptions of such magnitude as to leave only a small area in which the general rule operates.\u2019 [Citations.] [][] ... [f] [Millsap contends] liability resulting from Pence\u2019s delivery of packages is nondelegable because the operation is regulated by a public agency. The basis for this argument is found in section 428 of the Restatement Second of Torts: \u2018An individual or a corporation carrying on an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a franchise granted by public authority and which involves an unreasonable risk of harm to others, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to such others by the negligence of a contractor employed to do work in carrying on the activity.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-5\">\u201cThis rule ordinarily applies where a public service corporation attempts to delegate its duty to an independent contractor. [Citation.] <em>The rule has, however, also been held to apply if an employer is subject to regulations enacted for the protection of the public. </em>\u2018An employer is generally liable for negligent acts of an employee performed within the scope of employment, but if an independent contractor rather than master and servant relationship exists, the independent contractor usually is alone liable for his negligent acts. If, however, an individual or corporation undertakes to carry on an activity involving possible danger to the public <em>under a license or franchise granted by public authority subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed by the public authority, </em>these liabilities may not be evaded by delegating performance to an independent contractor. The original contractor remains subject to liability for harm caused by the negligence of the independent contractor employed to do the work.\u2019 [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-6\">\u201cIn <em>Eli v. Murphy[, supra,] </em>39 Cal.2d 598, 248 P.2d 756 ..., for example, the activity at issue was the operation of a tractor and semitrailer; an activity which (1) is attended with very considerable risk [citation], and (2) is highly regulated in order to protect the public safety. [Citation.] The court in that case found that the effectiveness of those regulations would be impaired if the carrier could circumvent them by having the regulated operations conducted by an independent contractor. It followed that \u2018Highway common carriers may not, therefore, insulate themselves from liability for negligence occurring in the conduct of their business by engaging independent contractors to transport freight for them.\u2019 [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-7\">\u201cMillsap introduced evidence that [Federal Express] carried a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission and, accordingly, was required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>that agency to carry liability insurance. [Citation.] From this she argues that [Federal Express] must be held responsible for any negligence attributable to NCE. [Federal Express], however, is not a party to this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-5\">\u201cThe pivotal issue is <em>whether NCE\u2019s operations were \u2018subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed, by the public authority\u2019 such that NCE must be held responsible for the negligence of an independent contractor to whom it delegated those duties. </em>The relevant statutes, and the record, indicate that it should not be held so responsible. Thus, 49 United States Code section 10526, provides: (a) The Interstate Commerce Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter over\u2014 ... [f] (8)(B) transportation of property (including baggage) by motor vehicle as part of a continuous movement which, prior or subsequent to such part of the continuous movement, has been or will be transported by an air carrier....\u2019 ... That NCE was <em>not regulated </em>makes inapplicable the rule stated in section 428 of the Restatement Second of Torts and in <em>Eli </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>and related cases.\u201d <em>(Millsap </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 433-435, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">\n<em>Gamboa v. Conti Trucking, Inc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">In <em>Gamboa </em>v. <em>Conti Trucking, Inc., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 663, a wrongful death action, Roberto Gamboa was killed when his bicycle was struck by a tractor-trailer owned by Alberg Trucking and driven by Demele, its employee. At the time of the accident, Alberg Trucking (an independent contractor) was subhauling freight for Conti Trucking. Both Alberg and Conti were licensed by the PUC as highway carriers, and Conti had verified that Alberg had the appropriate amount of liability insurance. The trial court granted Conti Trucking\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeal reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-8\">\u201cConti Trucking contends that to the extent of any nondelegable duty imposed by <em>Eli v. Murphy, </em>Conti Trucking\u2019s vicarious liability was extinguished pursuant to <em>Klein v. Leatherman .... </em>[f] ... [][] ... Conti Trucking contends that if the primary carrier meets its obligation to ensure that the independent contractor carrier is licensed to haul freight on California highways and has the required amount of liability insurance, it has satisfied its nondelegable duty under <em>Eli </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>and any vicarious liability is extinguished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-9\">\u201c... <em>The holding of Klein v. Leatherman ... is an expansion of the nondelegable duty doctrine. </em>The Court of Appeal recognized that one truck on the highway tends to be like any other and \u2018[i]t is difficult to discern wherein classification of the operation on the highway as a privilege under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>franchise, or as a right under a permit, changes the degree of protection required.\u2019 [Citation.] <em>Klein v. Leatherman appears to be the first and only reported opinion in California applying the rule of section 428 of the Restatement of Torts to a nonfranchised highway contract carrier.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-4\"><em>\u201c... [Klein v. </em>Leatherman] states that the \u2018... <em>monetary liability </em>under the nondelegable duty <em>may </em>be eliminated, or diminished, pro tanto.\u2019 [Citation.] This, of course, would follow since any amount a plaintiff may recover from a vicariously liable highway common carrier would be reduced by any payment made by or on behalf of the primary tortfeasor and eliminated completely if the insurance coverage is sufficient to cover the damages sustained. Any amount paid by one joint tortfeasor operates to reduce pro tanto the amount of damages that a plaintiff may recover against other joint tortfeasors. [Citations.] However, the nondelegable duty of care would not be affected.\u201d <em>(Gamboa </em>v. <em>Conti Trucking, Inc., supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th at pp. 666-668, italics and boldface added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">Hence, the rule is that a carrier who undertakes an activity (1) which can be lawfully carried on only under a public franchise or authority and (2) which involves possible danger to the public is liable to a third person for harm caused by the negligence of the carrier\u2019s independent contractor. <em>(Taylor v.

Edison Co., supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at pp. 798-799.) Were the rule otherwise, a carrier could escape liability for the negligence of its independent contractors, thus reducing the incentive for careful supervision and depriving those who are injured of the financial responsibility of those to whom the privilege was granted. For these reasons, the carrier\u2019s duties are nondelegable, and it is only when the carrier is \u201cnot regulated\u201d at all that the rule is otherwise. <em>(Eli v.

(49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.5 <em>[\u201cExempt motor carrier </em>means a person engaged in transportation exempt from economic regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ... under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13506. \u2018Exempt motor carriers\u2019 are subject to the [Federal Motor Carrier] safety regulations\u201d]; <em>Century Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra, </em>133 F.3d at p. 600; <em>Royal Indem. Co. v. Jacobsen, supra, </em>863 F.Supp. at pp. 1541-1542.) Since PLT was bound by the Board\u2019s safety and financial regulations (49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 390.5, 390.19, 390.21, 390.29-390.35, 391.1-396.1 et seq.), the trial court was mistaken when it held that PLT was \u201cnot regulated\u201d and that the facts of this case are the same as those before the court in <em>Millsap </em>v. <em>Federal Express Corp., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\"><em>Millsap </em>does not mention the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s safety regulations, and the opinion cites the applicable federal exemption (49 U.S.C \u00a7 10526(a)(8)(B)) only to show that the California PUC, in response to NCE\u2019s inquiry about the PUC\u2019s insurance requirements, concluded that NCE was covered by \u201c \u2018the air freight motor carrier exemption and, therefore, [was] not required to have authority either from the [PUC] or the Interstate Commerce Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Millsap v. Federal Express Corp., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at pp. 434-435.) From that fact (and without any consideration of the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s safety regulations), <em>Millsap </em>concluded that \u201cNCE was not regulated\u201d and not subject to the nondelegable duty rules. Hence, <em>Millsap </em>holds only that a wholly unregulated carrier (rather than an \u201cexempt carrier\u201d) is not vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 435; and see <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1182, 1195 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 969 P.2d 613] [\u201cIt is axiomatic that language in a judicial opinion is to be understood in accordance with the facts and the issues before the court. An opinion is not authority for propositions not considered.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">It follows that, contrary to PLT\u2019s assertion, Serna has shown that PLT was carrying on an activity which involved an unreasonable risk of harm to others, a fact that is not and could not be disputed <em>(Klein v. Leatherman, supra, </em>270 Cal.App.2d at p. 795), and which could lawfully be carried on only under a public franchise or authority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> PLT\u2019s discussion about the narrow meaning of \u201cfranchise\u201d ignores the fact that the rule has been extended to cover more than is implied by that narrow term <em>(Snyder v.

The Court of Appeal disputed the Supreme Court\u2019s distinction, suggesting there was no difference between a permit and a franchise, and that the Legislature had expressed the same concerns about all highway carriers, not just common carriers\u2014but nevertheless followed <em>Eli </em>and held that the carrier in <em>Gilbert </em>had \u201csuccessfully insulated itself through the medium of an independent contractor\u201d because both the carrier and the subhauler operated pursuant to permits, not franchises. <em>(Gilbert v.

The Supreme Court disagreed, explaining that \u201ca nondelegable duty operates, not as a substitute for liability based on negligence, but to assure that when a negligently caused harm occurs, the injured party will be compensated by the person whose activity caused the harm and who may therefore properly be held liable for the negligence of his agent, whether his agent was an employee or an independent contractor. To the extent that recognition of nondelegable duties tends to insure that there will be a financially responsible defendant available to compensate for the negligent harms caused by that defendant\u2019s activity, it ameliorates the need for strict liability to secure compensation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 446.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1361-7\"> The Sky truck was a tractor and semitrailer weighing more than 10,001 pounds, and thus was a \u201ccommercial motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.5 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1362-10\"> We summarily reject PLT\u2019s alternative contention that it was acting as a \u201cbroker,\u201d not a carrier.
