During trial, appellant and his codefendant stipulated that they had prior felony convictions for the purpose of establishing their convicted felon status as an element of the felon-in-possession charges. At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the jury was informed of the stipulation.  In the published portion of the opinion, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>court\u2019s failure to give a limiting instruction, sua sponte, concerning the stipulation violated his due process rights. In the unpublished portions of the opinion, we reject appellant\u2019s claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by his counsel\u2019s failure to move to sever his trial from that of his codefendant and that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to dismiss one of his prior felony convictions. We will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTS <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">A. <em>Failure to Give a Limiting Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">Appellant contends the trial court\u2019s failure to give, sua sponte, a proper limiting instruction concerning the stipulation that both he and his codefendant had prior felony convictions violated his due process rights under the federal and state Constitutions. Appellant argues that the court should have given a limiting instruction to ensure that the jury did not consider his prior felony convictions as showing that he had a propensity to commit crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Appellant acknowledges that he requested no such instruction, and that \u201cin general, the trial court is under no duty to instruct <em>sua sponte </em>on the limited admissibility of evidence of past criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(People v. Collie </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 43, 64 [177 Cal.Rptr. 458, 634 P.2d 534]; see also <em>People v. Valentine </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 170, 182, fn. 7 [228 Cal.Rptr. 25, 720 P.2d 913] [\u201cwhere the fact of a prior conviction is admitted solely to establish ex-felon status as an element of violation of section 12021, the trial court, <em>at defendant\u2019s </em>request, should give an instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the prior to that single purpose\u201d (italics added)]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 355.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) Although there can be an exception to this rule for \u201can occasional extraordinary case in which unprotested evidence of past offenses is a dominant part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>of the evidence against the accused, and is both highly prejudicial and minimally relevant to any legitimate purpose,\u201d <em>(People v. Collie, supra, </em>at p. 64), this is not such a case. The evidence of appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions did not dominate the People\u2019s case and was substantially relevant to prove the charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Padilla </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 891, 950 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 906 P.2d 388], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 823, fn. 1 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Appellant contends that the statement in <em>Valentine </em>is dictum, and if presented squarely with the issue of whether the trial court had a sua sponte duty to give limiting instruction in this case, our Supreme Court would find such a duty. Specifically, appellant contends the rule stated in <em>Collie </em>does not apply where, as here, the fact of the prior conviction is established by stipulation rather than by testimony or other means because a stipulation is not \u201cevidence\u201d and a jury is more likely to misuse the fact of the conviction if it is proved by stipulation rather than by other means. We disagree. A stipulation, at least as used in this context, is certainly evidence of the fact it seeks to prove\u2014appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction. Evidence Code section 140 defines \u201cevidence\u201d as \u201ctestimony, writings, material objects, or other things presented to the senses that are offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.\u201d The stipulation at issue here, which was a thing \u201cpresented to the senses,\u201d was offered to prove the existence of a fact, i.e., that appellant had suffered a prior felony conviction. Accordingly, the stipulation was evidence because it was a means to prove appellant\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">This conclusion is not altered by the cases appellant cites, <em>Harris v. Spinali Auto Sales, Inc. </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 447 [49 Cal.Rptr. 610] and <em>People v. Bonin </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 808 [254 Cal.Rptr. 298, 765 P.2d 460], In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Spinali Auto Sales, Inc., </em>the court cited the treatise Corpus Juris Secundum as stating, \u201c \u2018A stipulation, although it is not itself evidence, is the equivalent of, and may be relied on as, proof, ...\u2019 \u201d <em>(Harris, </em>at pp. 452-453.) The court, however, was not considering whether the stipulation at issue in that case was \u201cevidence\u201d within the meaning of Evidence Code section 140, or within the rule regarding the trial court\u2019s duty to give limiting instructions as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Collie. </em>In citing this treatise, the court recognized that a stipulation is proof; in this case it was used to prove the fact of appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction. Moreover, cases the court cited in <em>Harris </em>have stated that a stipulation is evidence. <em>(Harris, supra, </em>at p. 453; see <em>LeVanseler v. LeVanseler </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 611, 613 [24 Cal.Rptr. 206] [a stipulation regarding what an individual would testify to if called as a witness \u201cwas evidence in the case, to be considered and weighed by the court, along with all of the other evidence\u201d]; <em>Rubattino v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 288, 296 [150 P.2d 538], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Colonial Ins. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number><em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 79, 85 [172 P.2d 884] [court was \u201cin accord\u201d with the respondent\u2019s contentions that a stipulation of facts \u201cmay be relied upon as evidence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Neither does <em>People v. Bonin </em>aid appellant.  In <em>Bonin, </em>our Supreme Court stated that where an offer to stipulate to certain facts is made, the facts covered by the proposed stipulation are removed from dispute; accordingly, testimony elicited to prove such facts is irrelevant and inadmissible. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin, supra, 47 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 848-849.) The court did not consider whether the stipulation was itself \u201cevidence\u201d within the meaning of either Evidence Code section 140 or the rule regarding the trial court\u2019s duty to give limiting instructions as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Collie, </em>and therefore has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">We do not believe, as appellant contends, that a jury is more likely to misuse the fact of appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction if it is proved by stipulation rather than by testimony. As a result of the stipulation, the prosecutor could not produce other evidence of the number and nature of appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions, thereby protecting appellant from undue prejudice that might arise from such evidence. <em>(People v. Valentine, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 181-183.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We fail to see how a sanitized stipulation can create greater prejudice to a defendant than if the prosecution was able to present evidence, in the form of testimony or documents, of the number and nature of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions\u2014a situation where there is no sua sponte duty to give a limiting instruction. In either situation, whether to seek a limiting instruction is a tactical decision properly left to defense counsel, since defense counsel might conclude that the risk of a limiting instruction (unnecessarily highlighting a defendant\u2019s status as a felon) outweighed the questionable benefits such an instruction would provide. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 394 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1] [defense counsel not incompetent for failing to request a limiting instruction on cross-admissible evidence where a \u201creasonable attorney may have tactically concluded that the risk of a limiting instruction ... outweighed the questionable benefits such instruction would provide\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 920, 942 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 897 P.2d 574], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 89 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 49, 50 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">We also reject appellant\u2019s contention that the jury instructions given in this case created a risk of confusing the jury as to the proper use of the stipulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>because the jury was instructed to accept the fact of conviction as proven. The court in <em>Collie </em>recognized that \u201c[ejvidence of past offenses may not improperly affect the jury\u2019s deliberations if ... the evidence is obviously used to effect one or more of the many legitimate purposes for which it can be introduced.\u201d <em>(People v. Collie, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 64.)  Where a stipulation is entered into for the purpose of proving a prior felony conviction, the fact of that conviction is \u201cobviously used\u201d to effect a legitimate purpose\u2014in this case, to prove an element of the offenses of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">It is apparent from the jury instructions given here that the obvious use of the stipulation was only to prove an element of the crimes charged. The only direct reference to the stipulation to appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction is in the instructions given with respect to the crimes of being a felon in possession of a firearm and a felon in possession of ammunition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These instructions show that the stipulation was \u201cobviously used\u201d only to prove an element of the offense charged, and was so obviously not used to prove a propensity to commit crimes, that an instruction on limited admissibility was not essential to the jury\u2019s understanding of the case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haylock </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 146, 150 [169 Cal.Rptr. 658].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The jury was never instructed, as appellant suggests, that it could consider the stipulation in arriving at verdicts on all counts. Instead, the jury was instructed to apply the <em>law, </em>as stated in the jury instructions, to <em>the. facts', </em>the instructions never stated that the stipulation had any purpose other than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>prove an element of the felon-in-possession counts. While the jury was also instructed that it may consider the fact that a witness was convicted of a felony <em>only </em>for the purpose of determining the believability of that witness, the logical conclusion from this instruction, when coupled with the instructions on the elements of the felon-in-possession counts, is that the fact of appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions could only be used to determine his credibility and to prove his status as a felon for purposes of establishing an element of the possession of a firearm and ammunition counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Appellant has not met his burden of showing that the federal or state Constitution requires, as a matter of due process of law, that the trial court had a sua sponte duty to give a limiting instruction in this case. The cases appellant relies on, <em>Spencer v. Texas </em>(1967) 385 U.S. 554 [17 L.Ed.2d 606, 87 S.Ct. 648], <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 200 [95 L.Ed.2d 176, 107 S.Ct. 1702], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ratcliff </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1401 [273 Cal.Rptr. 253] do not compel such a conclusion. In <em>Spencer, </em>the United States Supreme Court noted the function of limiting instructions relating to evidence of prior convictions in a habitual offender prosecution as protecting the \u201cdefendants\u2019 interests.\u201d <em>(Spencer v. Texas, supra, </em>at p. 561.) That decision, however, does not establish as a matter of federal constitutional law an entitlement to a sua sponte instruction whenever evidence of a prior conviction is presented, either by stipulation or other evidence. While in <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>the court summarized its holding in <em>Spencer </em>as \u201cevidence of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions could be introduced for the purpose of sentence enhancement, so long as the jury was instructed it could not be used for purposes of determining guilt,\u201d this statement was dictum. <em>(Richardson v. Marsh, supra, </em>at p. 207.) Finally, in <em>People v. Ratcliff, </em>the Court of Appeal was not presented with the issue of whether a trial court is required to give a limiting instruction sua sponte. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ratcliff, supra, </em>at p. 1407.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">In sum, we conclude the trial court did not err in failing to give a limiting instruction, sua sponte, with respect to the stipulation to appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">B\u201e C <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Dibiaso, Acting P.
