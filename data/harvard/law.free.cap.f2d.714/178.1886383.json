The Expediting Act, whose purpose is \u201cto ensure speedy disposition of suits in equity brought by the United States under the Anti-Trust Act,\u201d <em>United States v. California Cooperative Canneries, </em>279 U.S. 553, 558, 49 S.Ct. 423, 424, 73 L.Ed. 838 (1929), originally vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Supreme Court over all appeals in government-instituted antitrust litigation. Following criticism that direct review of all such cases was unduly burdening the Court\u2019s docket, Congress amended the Act in 1974 to vest immediate appellate jurisdiction in the courts of appeals with the proviso that a district court may certify for direct Supreme Court review appeals in cases \u201cof general public importance.\u201d The question these motions present is whether, under the amended Act, the Supreme Court assumes exclusive jurisdiction over the entire case when it accepts appeals certified for direct review. We conclude that it does and that all appeals from the district court in this case should have been taken directly to the Supreme Court. We therefore dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">This case has its origin in a recent suit brought by the United States against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (\u201cAT &amp; T\u201d), in which the government had alleged AT <em>&amp; </em>T violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and had sought as relief divestiture of AT &amp; T subsidiaries. Trial commenced on January 15, 1981. After the close of the government\u2019s case, the government and AT &amp; T announced a proposed settlement based on modification of an earlier consent decree. The district court subsequently approved the settlement, modifying the final judgment in the earlier decree (\u201cthe MFJ\u201d), <em>United States v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>552 F.Supp. 131 (D.D.C.1982), and pursuant to the MFJ, gave AT &amp; T eighteen months\u2014 until February 24,1984 \u2014 to complete a massive reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-20\">After entering the MFJ, the court authorized 108 states, state regulatory commissions, and private parties, many of whom had filed briefs in the proceeding, to intervene for purposes of appealing the MFJ and participating in subsequent reorganization proceedings. The court, however, denied as untimely Telephone Equipment Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tion\u2019s (\u201cTEC\u201d) motion to intervene; TEC had not responded to the court\u2019s invitation to interested parties \u201cto indicate whether they request participation as intervenors,\u201d Memorandum Order, <em>United States v. AT &amp; T, </em>No. 74-1689, at 5 &amp; n. 14 (D.D.C. May 25, 1983), and had not otherwise sought to intervene between January 8, 1982, when the MFJ was proposed, and August 24, when the court formally approved the MFJ. Nineteen intervenors appealed the entry of the MFJ to this court. Of these, one appealed on the substantive ground TEC sought to raise: the authority of the court to restrict the collateral use of the consent decree by private parties. TEC also noted an appeal, callenging the court\u2019s denial of intervention and raising this substantive challenge to the MFJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">On November 10, pursuant to motions filed by several intervenors and after concluding that direct Supreme Court review was \u201cof general public importance in the administration of justice,\u201d the district court certified the nineteen appeals to the Supreme Court. Memorandum Order, <em>United States v. AT &amp; T, supra </em>(Nov. 10,1983); <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 29(b) (1976). At the same time, the court rejected TEC\u2019s petition for certification of the appeal from denial of intervention. TEC did not appeal this order. However, when the intervenor who had appealed on the substantive ground TEC sought to raise voluntarily dismissed its appeal, TEC petitioned the Supreme Court for leave to intervene and argue the private use issue in two of the certified appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">After the district court certified the intervenors\u2019 appeals and those appeals were docketed in the Supreme Court, we ordered the appeals in this court, including TEC\u2019s, held in abeyance pending Supreme Court action. On March 1, 1983, the Supreme Court, without expressly ruling on TEC\u2019s motion, summarily affirmed the district court judgment. <em>Maryland v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1240, 75 L.Ed.2d 472 (1983). Following the Court\u2019s summary affirmance, we granted AT &amp; T\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss the intervenors\u2019 appeals. Soon thereafter, TEC filed the motion now before us seeking to reactivate its appeal in this court. TEC has taken the position that it may now pursue its appeal in this court because the Supreme Court did not have before it in <em>Maryland v. United States </em>either the challenge to the denial of intervention or the private use issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">AT &amp; T and the government argue that we should dismiss TEC\u2019s appeal. They contend that certification of the intervenors\u2019 appeals from the MFJ under the Expediting Act vested exclusive jurisdiction over the entire case in the Supreme Court, that any appeal TEC might have taken from the denial of intervention should have been to the Supreme Court, and that the Court\u2019s summary affirmance of the MFJ precludes this collateral effort to attack the decree. We agree. In reaching this conclusion, we need address only whether the Expediting Act required that TEC take any appeal from the denial of intervention directly to the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. AT &amp; T, </em>642 F.2d 1285, 1290 (D.C.Cir.1980) (the general rule in this circuit is that \u201cone who is not a party to a record and judgment is not entitled to appeal therefrom\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Under the original Expediting Act of 1903, TEC could have appealed the denial of intervention only to the Supreme Court. Prior to 1974, the Act gave the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments in government-instituted antitrust litigation; section 29 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">In every civil action brought in any district court of the United States under [federal antitrust law], wherein the United States is complainant, an appeal from the final judgment of the district court will lie only to the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Ch. 544, \u00a7 2, 32 Stat. 823 (1903), (current version at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 29 (1976)); <em>see United States v. California Cooperative Canneries, </em>279 U.S. 553, 558, 49 S.Ct. 423, 424, 73 L.Ed. 838 (1929). Although framed in terms of final judgments, the Act applied as well to interlocutory appeals, <em>Tidewater Oil </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Co. v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 151, 154-56, 93 S.Ct. 408, 411-12, 34 L.Ed.2d 375 (1972), including appeals from denial of intervention, <em>California Cooperative Canneries, supra, </em>279 U.S. at 559, 49 S.Ct. at 425; <em>see NAACP v. New York, </em>413 U.S. 345, 355, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2597, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973). When faced with an appeal from denial of intervention, the Court\u2019s practice was to postpone decision on the merits pending disposition of the intervention appeal. <em>See, e.g., Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., </em>386 U.S. 129, 87 S.Ct. 932, 17 L.Ed.2d 814 (1967); <em>Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States, </em>366 U.S. 683, 81 S.Ct. 1309, 6 L.Ed.2d 604 (1961); <em>Sutphen Estates, Inc. v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 19, 72 S.Ct. 14, 96 L.Ed. 19 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Although the 1974 amendments to the Expediting Act dramatically altered appellate procedure in these cases, they did not modify the original Act\u2019s rejection of fragmented appeals in expedited eases. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 29 (1976). To relieve the Supreme Court of the burden of direct review in all government-initiated antitrust cases, Congress vested appellate jurisdiction over final and interlocutory orders in the courts of appeals. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 29(a) (1976); <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 298, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1973); <em>cf. Tidewater Oil Co. v. United States, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 174, 93 S.Ct. at 421. Section 29(a) now provides that any appeal from a final judgment or interlocutory order in a government-initiated antitrust action must be taken to the appropriate court of appeals, subject to review by the Supreme Court upon a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">At the same time, Congress specified that a direct appeal may be taken if \u201cthe district judge who adjudicated the case enters an order stating that immediate consideration of the appeal by the Supreme Court is of general public importance in the administration of justice.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 29(b) (1976). On issuance of such an order and after filing of the appeal and any cross-appeal in the Supreme Court, the Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkkT\">shall thereupon either (1) dispose of the appeal and any cross-appeal in the same manner as any other direct appeal authorized by law, or (2) in its discretion, deny the direct appeal and remand the ease to the court of appeals, which shall then have jurisdiction to hear and determine the same as if the appeal and any cross-appeal therein had been docketed in the court of appeals in the first instance pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADj\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Pursuant to these procedures, TEC and the nineteen intervenors who challenged the MFJ proceedings filed appeals in this court and then asked the district court to certify the appeals to the Supreme Court for direct review. When the district court certified the appeals \u2014 and expressly denied TEC\u2019s request for certification \u2014 appellate jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court. If, as under the original Expediting Act, this exclusive jurisdiction was over the entire case, TEC could have pursued its challenge to the denial of intervention only in the Supreme Court. <em>Cf. California Cooperative Canneries, supra, </em>279 U.S. at 559, 49 S.Ct. at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Although TEC petitioned the Supreme Court for leave to intervene in two of the certified appeals, TEC did not take a direct appeal either from the district court\u2019s denial of intervention or of certification. Ordinarily, failure to pursue an appeal, whether to an intermediate appeals court or to the Supreme Court, precludes subsequent litigation of a claim. Thus, the Court\u2019s judgment in <em>Maryland v. United States </em>is final and, according to well-settled principles, the judgment bars later litigation both as to matters actually litigated and decided and matters that might have been litigated. <em>See Commissioner v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948); <em>Hardison </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>655 F.2d 1281, 1288 (D.C.Cir. 1981); <em>Tutt v. Doby, </em>459 F.2d 1195, 1197 (D.C.Cir.1972); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4406-4415 (1981). Although neither the denial of certification nor intervention was actually litigated, these are matters that could have been litigated in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>TEC nevertheless contends that it need not have taken a direct appeal because the district court\u2019s certification was selective. TEC reads the Expediting Act to allow fragmented consideration of appeals from the MFJ by different courts. Because the Act does not explicitly'require that all appeals be taken at one time to the Supreme Court, TEC argues, this court should not so construe the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We disagree. There is no indication in the Expediting Act that Congress intended to permit multiple appeals in different courts. To the contrary, the language of the Act, its legislative history and purpose, and the case law construing the original Expediting Act suggest that upon certification all parties, including intervenors, must pursue <em>all </em>matters on appeal to the Supreme Court. The Act provides that when the district court certifies an appeal \u201cthe appeal and any cross appeal shall be docketed\u201d in the Supreme Court and the Court shall either \u201cdispose of the appeal and any cross appeal\u201d or reject the certification and \u201cremand the <em>case </em>\u201d to the court of appeals. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 29(b) (emphasis added). Although framed in terms of a single set of litigants and a single appeal and cross appeal, this procedure clearly contemplates immediate resolution of the entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Nothing in the 1974 amendments altered the original Act\u2019s prohibition against fragmented appeals in expedited cases. In the 1974 amendments, Congress sought to relieve the Supreme Court of the burden of hearing direct appeals in all government-initiated antitrust litigation but, in establishing a certification procedure, recognized that the public interest would require direct and immediate review in some cases. <em>See </em>H.R. No. 298, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 7-8 (1973); H.R.Rep. No. 1463, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 10-11 (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, 6535. As the House Committee on the Judiciary noted in its report to the full House,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">The exception provided for possible direct Supreme Court post-trial review of litigated government civil antitrust cases reflects legislative recognition of the Attorney General\u2019s responsibilities to coordinate national antitrust enforcement policies and the necessary discretion incident to this legislatively imposed responsibility; and, that public antitrust cases differ in nature sufficiently from private antitrust cases and concerns to warrant providing the Attorney General with possible direct Supreme Court post-trial review in appropriate cases. Moreover, the legislative conferral of discretion in post-trial appeals on the Attorney General is expected to increase vigorous enforcement of the- antitrust laws by the Department of Justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">H.R.Rep. No. 1463, <em>supra, </em>at 11, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, at 6541.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The congressional purpose in creating a certification procedure \u2014 expedited resolution of cases of sufficient importance to warrant direct review \u2014 obviously would be defeated if an appeal lay in this court from the district court\u2019s denial of intervention at the same time the Supreme Court had under consideration direct appeals from the district court\u2019s final decree. <em>Cf. California Cooperative Canneries, supra, </em>279 U.S. at 559, 49 S.Ct. at 425. Thus, once the Supreme Court assumed jurisdiction to review the MFJ all subsequent appeals, including TEC\u2019s appeal from the denial of intervention or an appeal from the denial of certification, had to have been brought in that court. TEC\u2019s argument that it unsuccessfully sought certification from the district court does not excuse its failure to take a direct appeal; TEC should have appealed the district court\u2019s denial of certification. Nor do we find exculpatory TEC\u2019s observation that \u201c[i]n the face of the District Court\u2019s express refusal to certify TEC\u2019s appeals, it would have constituted gross arrogance for TEC (and its counsel) to have flaunted that order and nevertheless tried to docket TEC\u2019s appeal with the Supreme Court.\u201d TEC Response to United States Motion to Dismiss at 4. Accordingly, we grant the motions to dismiss TEC\u2019s appeal and dismiss as moot TEC\u2019s motion for an order directing the district court to prepare and transmit the record on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
