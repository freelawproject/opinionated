Because he failed to comply with the requirements of Fed.R.App.P. 4(a), we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In 1977, Jester pled guilty to nine counts of armed robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. As a result, he was sentenced to a total of thirty years in prison. Then, in 1981, he filed this \u00a7 2255 motion challenging both the voluntariness of his plea and the procedural regularity of the plea and sentencing proceedings. In a detailed opinion, the district court rejected the appellant\u2019s various contentions. Accordingly, an order was entered on May 18, 1982 denying the requested relief. Almost two months later, on July 9,1982, Jester filed a pleading styled \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of and Evidentiary Hearing for Movant\u2019s Motion to Vacate Sentence.\u201d In an order entered on July 21, 1982, the district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The record discloses no further motions filed by the appellant. However, on September 30, 1982, the district court entered an additional \u201corder\u201d in the case. In that memorandum, the judge described an <em>ex parte </em>discussion that took place, with the government\u2019s consent, between Jester\u2019s attorney and the judge. The conversation apparently centered on the appellant\u2019s progress toward rehabilitation. After summarizing the tenor of the conference, the judge concluded, \u201c[i]n light of my discussion with Mr. Kelley, I have once again reviewed Mr. Jester\u2019s applications for \u00a7 2255 relief. I see no legal justification for any modification of my previous orders denying such relief.\u201d The court then added, \u201c[h]is most recent motion is denied.\u201d Thereafter, on November 29, 1982, Jester filed a notice of appeal citing the district court\u2019s orders of May 18, July 21, and September 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">In a \u00a7 2255 action, the time for filing a notice of appeal is governed by Fed.R.App.P. 4(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2255 Rule 11. Under Rule 4(a), when the United States is a party in the case, the notice must be filed within sixty days of the entry of judgment. <em>See Gribble </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>625 F.2d 1173, 1174 (5th Cir.1980). Of course, Rule 4(a)(4) identifies certain post-trial motions which, if timely filed, will delay the running of the applicable time period until the district court\u2019s disposition of the request. <em>See Browder v. Director, Department of Corrections of Illinois, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 561, 54 L.Ed.2d 521, 531 (1978). On the other hand, \u201can untimely posttrial motion does not toll the running of the 60-day period for appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdosta-Lowndes County Hospital Authority, </em>668 F.2d 1177, 1179 (11th Cir.1982); <em>see also Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 265, 98 S.Ct. at 561, 54 L.Ed.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">In this instance, a final judgment was entered on May 18, 1982. Jester did not file his \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d until fifty-two days later. Whether construed as a motion to amend or make additional findings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b), a motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), or a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), the request was made well beyond the ten-day period prescribed for such motions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 261 n. 5, 98 S.Ct. at 559 n. 5, 54 L.Ed.2d at 529-30 n. 5. Therefore, it was untimely and did not delay the time for filing the notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>264-65, 98 S.Ct. at 561, 54 L.Ed.2d at 531; see <em>also Lewis v. United States, </em>555 F.2d 1360, 1362 (8th Cir.1977); <em>Rothman v. United States, </em>508 F.2d 648, 651 (3d Cir.1975). Moreover, even if the motion had tolled the sixty-day period, the time would have begun running at the latest on July 21, 1982, the date on which the district court denied the request for reconsideration. Yet, Jester did not file the notice of appeal until November 29, 1982, long after the expiration of sixty days from July 21, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Despite having failed to perfect his right to appeal both the original judgment and the denial of reconsideration, Jester seems to argue that the judge\u2019s order of September 30, 1982 preserves his appeal. Since he filed his notice of appeal on the sixtieth day following the entry of that order Jester contends that, at a minimum, he is entitled to challenge that \u201cdecision.\u201d We cannot agree. Despite the district court\u2019s notation that the \u201cmotion is denied,\u201d the memorandum is not an appealable order. At most, the writing reflects an effort by the district court to memorialize an <em>ex parte </em>discussion with Jester\u2019s attorney, a conversation which apparently focused on the appellant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation. This interpretation is buttressed by the fact that the record does not contain any written motion, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b), that is even arguably the subject matter of the September 30, 1982 \u201corder.\u201d As a result, there is no indication in the record as to what, if any, relief was requested and the grounds possibly asserted as a basis for the application. Under these circumstances, we cannot view the September 30, 1982 memorandum as anything more than a statement for the record that the meeting occurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In summary, the order of September 30, 1982 does not constitute a separate appealable judgment. Additionally, because the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, <em>see, e.g., Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 264, 98 S.Ct. at 561, 54 L.Ed.2d at 531, we lack the authority to review the initial judgment and the denial of reconsideration. Accordingly, the appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-10\">. Arguably, the pleading could even be denominated a motion for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). However, such a characterization would not benefit the appellant since such motions, unlike requests made pursuant to Rule 52(b) and Rule 59, do not postpone the time for appeal. <em>See Gibbs v. Maxwell House, a Division of General Foods Corp., </em>701 F.2d 145, 146 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-5\">. Even if we construed the September 30th \u201corder\u201d as a disposition of a motion for reconsideration, we would still be foreclosed from reviewing the earlier orders. Because the request would not have been presented to the district court within the time limitations of Rules 52 or 59, it would have to be treated as a motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b). <em>See </em>6A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 59.-04[7] (2d ed. 1983). As the courts have uniformly recognized, \u201can appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. at 560 n. 7, 54 L.Ed.2d at 531 n. 7; see <em>also Jackson v. Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Co., </em>678 F.2d 992, 1021 (11th Cir.1982). Instead, an appeal in that posture restricts our review to whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the original judgment. <em>See, e.g., Jackson, </em>678 F.2d at 1020. Given the record\u2019s silence on whether Jester asserted one of the specified grounds warranting Rule 60(b) relief, it is difficult to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying such a motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
