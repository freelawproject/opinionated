HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b215-24\">On June 4, 1982, Appellant Edgar Chaux Trujillo arrived at the Miami International Airport after a flight from Bogota, Colombia. During a customs inspection, a cheese-like substance was found in a plastic bag inside appellant\u2019s baggage. A field test identified the substance as cocaine and Trujillo was arrested and read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Appellant told the Customs agents that he had brought the cocaine to Miami as a favor for someone in Colombia to whom he owed $5,000. Trujillo agreed to cooperate with the Customs agents by following through with his original plan to deliver the cocaine to a contact person in Miami. Accordingly, Trujillo arranged a meeting with his contact, Luis Fernando Arenas, at a local hotel room. Trujillo delivered the cocaine to Arenas upon his arrival at the hotel room, and Arenas was immediately arrested and charged with narcotics violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-25\">Trujillo was subsequently indicted in three counts with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, possession with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and importation of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). Following a jury trial, Trujillo was found guilty on all three counts. He now appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a mistrial on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. During closing argument, defense counsel attacked that portion of the indictment which charged that Trujillo and Arenas conspired \u201cwith each other, and with divers other persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury.\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">Well, if you look at the Indictment, the Indictment will tell you that Mr. Trujillo and Mr. Arenas, who is not here, knowingly and willfully combined, and conspired, confederated with others known and unknown. That is terrific. What the Government is going to tell you is that he didn\u2019t conspire with Mr. Arenas, but how about the people back in Colombia who are known and unknown? They know Mr. Herrera. Why didn\u2019t they include him in the Indictment? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">They believed that he existed in a conspiracy with Mr. Herrera, why didn\u2019t they name him? God, they sure know his name. But, they didn\u2019t do that. What they do is they come forward and say to you there are others \u2014 this is a thrill part in the Indictment \u2014 about this big, and he combined and conspired with others known and unknown, and that is what they want you to convict Mr. Trujillo of. They want you to convict him of conspiring with others known and unknown. That is great. That is great.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">In its rebuttal argument, the prosecutor made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">The next argument Mr. DuPree makes to you is a legal argument. Judge Haden is the judge of the law. You\u2019re the judge of the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">He asked you to make a conclusion based upon who the Government charged in its Indictment as to whether this defendant is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">Ladies and gentlemen, just as you govern the facts, the judge governs the law. If that was an improper Indictment, if that was not the way to bring an Indictment, we would not have been here, because the judge would have dismissed it. That is his job, just like it is your job to decide whether this man is guilty or innocent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">Defense counsel objected to the prosecution\u2019s remarks and moved for a mistrial. The district court declined to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and permitted the prosecutor to continue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">So ladies and gentlemen, that is the separation that we have going on in this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">You are here for a certain purpose. The Judge is here for a certain purpose. There are certain things which you did not have to concern yourselves with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-16\">The thing you have to concern yourselves with is this defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, not the sufficiency of the charged Indictment or anything else of that type.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-17\">Trujillo argues that his convictions should be reversed because of the prejudicial nature of the prosecutor\u2019s comments. He contends that the government\u2019s remarks impermissibly suggested to the jury that the court would have dismissed the indictment if appellant was not guilty. The test for determining whether prosecutorial comments during closing argument warrant reversal is (1) whether the remarks were improper and (2) whether they prejudicially affected substantive rights of the defendant. <em>United States v. Vera, </em>701 F.2d 1349, 1361 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Dorr, </em>636 F.2d 117 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-18\">A careful review of the closing arguments of the defense and prosecution establishes that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were neither improper nor prejudicial. Defense counsel suggested that the indictment was insufficient because it did not identify the co-conspirators and implied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>jury should consider the sufficiency of the indictment during its deliberation. However, the sufficiency of the indictment is a question of law, <em>United States v. Mann, </em>517 F.2d 259, 267 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1087, 96 S.Ct. 878, 47 L.Ed.2d 97 (1976), to be decided by the court, not by the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s response was tailored to counter the assertion by defense counsel concerning the sufficiency of the indictment. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were a proper statement on the role of the judge and jury and did not improperly suggest that the court had already decided the defendant's guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In determining whether Trujillo was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we may consider the trial court\u2019s jury instruction and the strength of the evidence against the defendant. <em>United States v. Dorr, </em>636 F.2d 117, 121 (5th Cir. 1981). The district court instructed the jury that the indictment is not evidence of any kind against the accused and directed the jurors not to be prejudiced against the defendant merely because the indictment was returned against him. The court also cautioned the jury that the statements and arguments of counsel were not to be considered as evidence against the defendant. Moreover, the evidence against Trujillo was overwhelming. He was found carrying cocaine in his baggage during a customs inspection at the Miami International Airport. Trujillo admitted that he knew there was cocaine in his baggage and stated that his original plan was to deliver the cocaine to someone in Miami. Viewing the entirety of the prosecution\u2019s challenged statements, the district court\u2019s jury instruction, and the evidence against the defendant, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument were not prejudicial to Trujillo\u2019s substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Furthermore, a defendant can not complain on appeal of alleged error invited or induced by himself, particularly where it is not clear that the defendant was prejudiced thereby. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>524 F.2d 991, 992 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 938, 96 S.Ct. 1673, 48 L.Ed.2d 180 (1976). <em>See also United States v. Sullivan, </em>421 F.2d 676 (5th Cir.1970). The jury argument of government counsel to which Trujillo takes offense was invited by defense counsel\u2019s remark concerning the indictment. It was clearly improper for defense counsel to suggest to the jury that the indictment was insufficient. Any error created by the prosecutor\u2019s remark was invited error, not reversible error. <em>See United States v. Doran, </em>564 F.2d 1176, 1177 (5th Cir.1977); <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 928, 98 S.Ct. 1498, 55 L.Ed.2d 524 (1978); <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>421 F.2d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Appellant also contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defense counsel to argue jury nullification in his closing statement was error. Defense counsel sought to argue that, notwithstanding the law, Trujillo\u2019s governmental cooperation in effecting the controlled delivery entitled him to a not guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">While a jury does have the power to bring a verdict \u201cin the teeth of both law and facts,\u201d <em>Horning v. District of Columbia, </em>254 U.S. 135, 138, 41 S.Ct. 53, 54, 65 L.Ed. 185 (1920), its duty is to apply the law as interpreted and instructed by the court. <em>United States v. Boardman, </em>419 F.2d 110, 116 (1st Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 991, 90 S.Ct. 1124, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970). The courts that have considered the question have almost uniformly held that a criminal defendant is not entitled to a jury instruction which points up the existence of that practical power. <em>Washington v. Watkins, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>655 F.2d 1346, 1374 n. 54 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See e.g., United States v. Wiley, </em>503 F.2d 106, 107 (8th Cir.1974); <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>473 F.2d 1113, 1130-37 (D.C.Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Dellinger, </em>472 F.2d 340, 408 (7th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973); <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>460 F.2d 515, 519-20 (9th Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Boardman, </em>419 F.2d 110, 116 (1st Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 991, 90 S.Ct. 1124, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970); <em>United States v. Moylan, </em>417 F.2d 1002, 1005-09 (4th Cir.1969); <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 910, 90 S.Ct. 908, 25 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In arguing the law to the jury, counsel is confined to principles that will later be incorporated and charged to the jury. <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>443 F.2d 712, 714 &amp; n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1971). The jury in this case was properly instructed on their duty to follow the law as stated in the jury instruction. Appellant\u2019s jury nullification argument would have encouraged the jurors to ignore the court\u2019s instruction and apply the law at their caprice. While we recognize that a jury may render a verdict at odds with the evidence or the law, neither the court nor counsel should encourage jurors to violate their oath.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore join with those courts which hold that defense counsel may not argue jury nullification during closing argument. <em>See e.g., United States v. Dougherty, </em>473 F.2d at 1130-37; <em>United States v. Moylan, </em>417 F.2d at 1005-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Because we find no error in the trial court\u2019s handling of closing argument, we</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\">. Defense counsel did not challenge the form of the indictment prior to trial. Failure to raise objections based on defects in an indictment prior to trial waives those objections. Fed.R. Crim.P. 12(b)(2); <em>United States v. Lerma, </em>657 F.2d 786, 789-90 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 921, 102 S.Ct. 1279, 71 L.Ed.2d 463 (1982). In fact, a conspiracy indictment and a conspiracy charge to a jury may properly refer to unidentified co-conspirators. <em>United States v. Booty, </em>621 F.2d 1291, 1300 n. 27 (5th Cir. 1980). <em>See also Rogers v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 367, 371, 71 S.Ct. 438, 440, 95 L.Ed. 344 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">. Trujillo\u2019s contention that his governmental cooperation entitled him to lenity should be addressed to the court at the time of sentencing or in a motion for correction or reduction of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, not argued to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
