S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">This is an appeal from the determination and judgment of the Middlesex County Court affirming the award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau in a \u201cheart ease.\u201d The essential facts are not greatly in dispute and the sole question for determination is whether petitioner suffered a compensable injury by virtue of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">Petitioner, Joseph Franko, 64 years of age, had been employed as a hand reamer by respondent, Mack Manufacturing Company, for a period of eight years and three months prior to January 9, 1948, the date of his injury. His work was a precision operation involving fine tolerances, for he customarily reamed or cut from <em>iy2 </em>to 4 thousandths of an inch of steel from the inner circumference of bores in steel castings. These castings, also referred to as cases, weighed approximately 200 pounds and the 7% inch diameter hand reamer used by petitioner weighed fifteen to eighteen pounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>and was twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length. A bar was inserted at right angles to and through the handle of the reamer which was revolved by hand pressure, and the steel extracted in truing the bore appeared in the form of powder or light, fine chips. The castings were deposited on the floor near petitioner\u2019s work bench, which was about thirty inches high, and lifted to a fixture on the bench by means of a chain and pulley suspended from an overhead crane.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Petitioner testified that on the day of the alleged accident he started work at the regular hour of eight o\u2019clock, apparently on an unfinished job already on the work bench. After its completion, which consumed about an hour, he put the casting on the floor and hoisted a second, which was a \u201cwelded\u201d or \u201crepair\u201d casting, to the bench with the pulley and chain block. He testified that the casting had been deposited four or five feet from the hoist and that he had rolled it into proper position before lifting it to the bench, although this fact is in dispute. The bore of the welded easting was out of round from one and one-half to two one-thousandths of an inch, and while turning the hand reamer petitioner felt pain in his heart and collapsed about ten o\u2019clock. He was hospitalized and the medical testimony is in agreement that his condition was one of coronary insufficiency \u2014 a loss of blood to the heart muscle resulting from arteriosclerotic heart disease; he continues totally disabled and unable to undertake exertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">An accidental injury to the heart, arising out of and in the course of employment, is a compensable accident within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the law is now well settled, particularly as a result of two recent decisions, <em>Grassgreen v. Ridgeley Sportswear Mfg. Co., </em>2 N. <em>J. Super. </em>62, 64 <em>A. </em>2d 617 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949), and <em>Seiken v. Todd Dry Dock, Inc., </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>469 (1949), which correlate and distinguish prior heart cases, where it was held that in order to rebut the presumption that a heart ailment is due to natural causes, it is incumbent upon the claimant to produce evidence of an <em>unusual strain or exertion beyond- the mere employment itself </em>to constitute an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>In <em>Lohndorf v. Peper Bros. Paint Co., </em>135 <em>N. J. L. </em>352 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1947), the court said that \u201cto render \u2018an injury compensable there must be an event or happening, beyond the mere employment itself, which brings about the final result or contributes thereto, and without which the injury or death would not have resulted/\u201d and defined \u201caccident\u201d as an \u201c \u2018unlooked for mishap\u2019 or \u2018untoward event\u2019 which is \u2018not expected or designed.\u2019 \u201d As was aptly said by Mr. Justice Ackerson in <em>Seiken v. Todd Dry Dock, Inc., supra, </em>\u201ca review of the cases decided since the <em>Lohndorf case, supra, </em>shows a general adherence to the view therein expressed that something of an unusual strain or exertion beyond the mere employment itself is required to establish liability; the mere showing that the claimant was performing his routine, every-day tasks when he suffered a heart attack, does not establish a right to workmen\u2019s compensation,\u201d citing <em>Grassgreen v. Ridgeley Sportswear Mfg. Co., supra; Ames v. Sheffield Farms Co., </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>336, 59 <em>A. </em>2d 811 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948); affirmed, 61 <em>A. </em>2d 502; <em>Temple v. Storch Trucking Co., </em>2 <em>N. J. Super. </em>146, 65 <em>A. </em>2d 70 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949). To the same effect are the very recent cases of <em>Irons v. N. J. Department of Institutions and Agencies, </em>3 <em>N. J. Super. </em>216, 66 <em>A. </em>2d 44 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949), and <em>Carpenter v. Calco Chemical Div., American Cyanamid Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. Super. </em>53, 66 <em>A. </em>2d 177 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">In recognition of the legal prerequisites to recovery, petitioner contends that in the course of his employment he \u201cperformed unusually hard labor in dragging a 200-pound steel casting 3 to 5 feet across the floor and exerted an extra heavy strain and unusual effort in attempting to ream an imperfect bore, and by reason thereof suffered an accidental injury to his heart.\u201d With this factual conclusion, and with, complete awareness of the weight properly to be accorded the factual findings of two prior tribunals, we cannot agree, for it is unsupported in the evidence. While it appears that on occasion the truckmen did not deposit the castings directly under the chain hoist and petitioner testified that in this instance he rolled the casting four or five feet, he also stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u201cthat case when I went to put it on the stand, yon know, was right where I had chain,\u201d and a witness produced by petitioner, one Arnold Schneider, set-up man at the plant who laid out petitioner\u2019s work, testified that \u201cthe case was right underneath the rail\u201d of the chain hoist \u201cas close to his work bench as it could possibly be \u2014 he didn\u2019t have to go over and pick it up.\u201d Another petitioner\u2019s witness, Jacob Eademaeher, a co-worker, testified that the chain of the hoist could be pulled about ten feet from the track. Not only is the testimony barren of any reference to \u201cdragging,\u201d the clear preponderance of the evidence of petitioner and his own witnesses negates, we think, any finding of unusually hard labor in placing the casting on the work bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The factual evidence, incidentally, all introduced by petitioner, likewise fails, in onr opinion, to justify a finding of extra heavy strain and unusual effort in attempting to ream an imperfect bore. Petitioner, at the time of his injury, was working on a welded casting, but the evidence, including petitioner\u2019s own testimony, clearly indicates that it was not exceptional and required no extra heavy strain or unusual effort. The bore was out of round from one and one-half to two one-thousandths of an inch, well within the four one-thousandths of an inch limits of petitioner\u2019s every-day, routine work, and petitioner and his set-up man, Schneider, are in agreement that the work that morning was normal, ordinary, regular procedure. This actually seems to be confirmed by the medical testimony which was not in dispute, for there was no coronary occlusion or damage to the heart \u2014 the finding was coronary insufficiency, a loss of blood to the heart muscle resulting from arteriosclerotic heart disease, and a normally progressive condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Petitioner, at the time he was stricken, was performing routine work to which he was accustomed and as he had done previously, and he has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his heart attack was caused by an unusual strain or exertion arising'out .of his employment arid beyond tlie mere employment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The judgment under appeal is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
