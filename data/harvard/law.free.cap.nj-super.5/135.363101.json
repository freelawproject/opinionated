J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AmD\">This is an appeal by the defendant from a summary judgment for plaintiff entered in the Hudson County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">In 1930, the defendant Alexander Simpson delivered to the plaintiff Hudson County National Bank three promissory notes totalling $19,000, together with stock of the Trust Company of New Jersey as collateral security. The notes were payable on demand and contained numerous stipulations for the Bank\u2019s protection, including a provision that upon sale of the security the maker shall remain responsible for any deficiency in payment of principal or interest \u201cwaiving any and every benefit, exemption and privilege under any law now or hereafter to be in force.\u201d In 1945, the plaintiff, having failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to realize the face amount of the notes by sale of the collateral, filed a complaint in the Hudson County Court of Common Pleas seeking recovery of $17,168.20 plus interest. The defendant\u2019s answer and counterclaim set forth primarily that (1) the statute of limitations had barred the claim, and (2) in 1935 the plaintiff had accepted an assignment of certain moneys due the defendant in full accord and satisfaction of its claim against him. The plaintiff moved to strike the answer and counterclaim but the court, finding that the affidavits submitted \u201cset up controversial issues of law and fact,\u201d denied the motion. The order denying the motion granted leave to the plaintiff to renew it \u201cif the proofs produced at the trial of this cause warrant such action.\u201d In due course the plaintiff filed an amended reply and answer to counterclaim which set forth that the provision in the notes constituted a waiver of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Thereafter, the defendant filed a bill of complaint in the Court of Chancery seeking to restrain the plaintiff from asserting the alleged waiver of the statute of limitations. The bill was dismissed because the issues presented could be adjudicated in the law court and the dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals. See <em>Simpson v. Hudson County National Bank, </em>141 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>353 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). On August 19, 1948, the defendant served notice that he would move for judgment on the pleadings resting \u201cmainly on the Statute of Limitations\u201d and by order dated September 8, 1948, the court directed that the defendant\u2019s motion be considered on briefs. On January 27, 1949, the court, by letter opinion, determined that (1) the statute of limitations had been waived, (2) there had been no consideration for the alleged accord and satisfaction in 1935, and (3) plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment. On March 30, 1949, summary judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $37,618.70 was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We have concluded that the entry of summary judgment was erroneous. The defendant\u2019s motion sought, in effect, a determination in his favor under the statute of limitations. There was no cross-motion for summary judgment and, indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>such cross-motion was presumably unavailable in view of the order, entered by another judge, denying plaintiff\u2019s earlier application for summary judgment upon the finding that there were controversial issues of law and fact. In so far as the record before us discloses the only real issue properly before the lower court was whether the defendant was entitled to judgment under his defense based upon the statute of limitations; having concluded that the provision of the notes constituted-a lawful waiver of this defense the court should simply have denied the defendant\u2019s motion and permitted the plaintiff to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The further question raised by the defendant as to the soundness of the lower court\u2019s determination that the provision in the notes constituted a legally effective waiver of the statute of limitations has given us much concern. In the recent case of <em>National Bond and Investment Co. v. Flaiger, </em>322 <em>Mass. </em>431, 77 <em>N. E. </em>2d 772 (1948), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that an unlimited waiver of the statute of limitations, embodied in the original agreement between the parties, was contrary to public policy and invalid. Implicit in this conclusion was the view that the statute is not designed exclusively for the benefit of individuals but also expresses a public policy against the presentation in court of stale claims. See Comment, <em>Effectiveness of Promises Not to Plead the Statute of Limitations in Contract Cases, </em>30 <em>Col. L. Rev. </em>383 (1930). See, also, <em>Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, </em>325 <em>U. S. </em>304, 314 (1945), where Mr. Justice Jackson described statutes of limitations as \u201cpractical and pragmatic devices to spare the courts from litigation of stale claims, and the citizen from being put to his defense after memories have faded, witnesses have died or disappeared, and evidence has been lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Professor Williston indicates that the rule expressed in the <em>Flaiger case </em>is the better view\u201d and has been adopted by the majority of jurisdictions as well as the Restatement. See 1 <em>Williston, Contracts {Rev. Ed. </em>1936), \u00a7 183. See, also, the cases collected in 1 <em>A. L. R. </em>(2d) 1445- (1948). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the earlier New Jersey cases incline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>to support a contrary view. In <em>Quick v. Corlies, </em>39 <em>N. J. L. </em>11 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1876), the court sustained the validity of a stipulation in a sealed agreement to pay $500 that \u201cit is not to outlaw by the statute of limitations,\u201d and expressed the view that limitation statutes are for the benefit of individuals and \u201cnot to secure general objects of policy or morals.\u201d Later decisions have suggested approval of the statement that limitation statutes are for the exclusive benefit of individuals and may be waived, by contract or otherwise, although none of these cases actually dealt with an attempt to waive indefinitely the statute of limitations at inception of the debt. See <em>Clark v. Augustine, </em>62 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>689 <em>(Ch. </em>1902); <em>Freeman v. Conover, </em>95 <em>N. J. L. </em>89 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1920); <em>Howard v. West Jersey, etc., R. R. Co., </em>102 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>517 <em>(Ch. </em>1928); affirmed, 104 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>201 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Unlike the situation presented in the <em>Quick case, </em>we are not here concerned with a specific waiver of the statute of limitations but are confronted with vague language which purports to waive \u201cany and every benefit, exemption and privilege under any law now or hereafter to bo in force.\u201d We do not believe that the parties contemplated by this language, the suspension, at inception, of all laws which might otherwise be available as defenses, including such statutes as those relating to usury and to discharges in bankruptcy; indeed, any such attempt would generally be held to be invalid. See <em>Willislon, supra,, </em>at \u00a7 1770. Nor do we believe that the parties contemplated, without any specific reference thereto, the suspension forever of the statute of limitations, thus permitting action, fifteen years (as here) or, indeed, fifty years after execution of the notes. <em>Cf. Hellyer v. Baldwin, </em>53 <em>N. J. L. </em>141, 143 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1890). The notes were prepared by the plaintiff Bank and executed by the defendant without any affirmative suggestion that either party considered the remote factor of the statute of limitations. Assuming that a specific waiver, at inception and without limit of time, of the statute of limitations is not to l)o deemed contrary to public policy, considerations of fairness in contractual business relationships would seem to require that, if such far reaching waiver is eontem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>plated by the creditor, he so express himself explicitly rather than in vague language having no certain or readily ascertainable meaning. We are of the opinion that the general provision embodied in the , notes should not be construed to constitute, on its face, a legally effective permanent waiver of the statute of limitations. <em>Cf. Cowart v. </em>Perrine, 21 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>101, 104 <em>(Ch. </em>1870).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The judgment below is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
