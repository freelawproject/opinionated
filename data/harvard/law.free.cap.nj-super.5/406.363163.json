A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AyO_\">This is a workmen\u2019s compensation case. Eespondent appeals from a judgment of the County Court of Bergen County, affirming an award of compensation for temporary disability and 35% of total permanent disability by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau to the petitioner, Irving Goreliek.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">The facts may be summarized as follows: Petitioner, Irving Goreliek (hereinafter referred to as Goreliek), had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>in the employ of appellant for eight years and, 'at the' time' of the accident, supervised approximately thirty female operators of several types of machines and maintained their m\u00e1ch-' ines in workable condition. On August 4, 1947, he began' his' day\u2019s work as usual, apparently in good health. About '9:30 a. M., Gorelick loosened from its stand a new heavy duty binding machine, which had developed operational difficulty,- carried it a distance of 4' feet or 5 feet and Gorelick testified. that \u201c* * * while I was carrying it,-1 felt all of a sudden. terriffie pains,\u201d became dizzy and dropped the machine; that. this machine \u201cwas the heaviest machine in the place.\u201d It. was their only heavy duty high speed binding machine and \u201cwas brought into the place about only one week before the\u2019 accident.\u201d Max Katzman, appellant\u2019s plant superintendent, testified that the machine was \u201c* * * a table extra high' speed binding machine;\u201d that it was heavier than the' other \u2022 machines in that department, \u201c* * * was the heaviest machine of this type in the plant;\u201d and that, it remained where Gorelick had dropped it for a period of one week aftef the accident. Gorelick rested for awhile and the pain continuing, made his way to the office. Unsuccessful efforts of a clerical employee of the appellant to reach a physician, impelled the superintendent of the respondent\u2019s plant, Max Katzman, to accompany Gorelick to the company doctor. As the result of his examination, medication was administered\u2019 and Gorelick was advised to remain at home and return to the doctor the following day. However, petitioner returned to his place of employment, remained on duty for the rest of the day and worked the following day, confining his activities to 'supervisory work. Three days after the accident, his pains continuing, he sought the advice of a heart specialist, who directed that he remain at home, where he was confined to' his bed for about seven weeks. Electro-cardiograms were taken on August 12, 1947, October 6, 1947, and August 27, 1948. Gorelick did not work thereafter for appellant, but undertook' to do lighter work in another field. He still complains of continuing pain in his shoulder and chest, inability to close hi's left hand, shortness of breath, dizziness and confusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>As is usual in such, eases, there was medical testimony sup* porting the theories of the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The only issue asserted by appellant as its ground for a reversal of the judgment below is that petitioner failed \u201cto establish, by a preponderance of probability, that the alleged heart attack arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Dr. Julian Cohen, a cardiac specialist, a witness produced by Gorelick, testified that \u201cthere was a definite causal relationship between the episode of coronary occlusion with myocardial infarction that this man suffered and the lifting episode in the shop and, following the sequence of events that have occurred since then, it is also my definite opinion that Mr. Gorelick at the present time is still suffering from the effects of the coronary occlusion and the myocardial infarction that he experienced in August of 1947, when this accident happened.\u201d Although Dr. Cohen stated that Gorelick had a pre-existing heart disease, Gorelick testified that he had never been ill previously and had no knowledge of any pre-existing heart condition. Dr. Irving Silverman, the appellant\u2019s doctor and a general practitioner, examined and treated Gorelick on the day of the accident. He contradicted Gorelick\u2019s testimony as to the treatment administered to and the statements made by Gorelick, when he examined and treated him. Dr. Silverman admitted that he had made no record of the case; that he was testifying from memory, although he had treated approximately 5,000 other patients in the interim. It appears from the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings that he gave considerable weight to petitioner\u2019s testimony and did not place too much reliance on the testimony of Dr. Silverman. We think that under <em>R. </em>1:2 20 stating, <em>inter </em>alia, <em>\u201c* </em>* * due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d the Deputy Commissioner who heard and observed the witnesses was in a better position to judge of the weight to be given to the respective testimony of Dr. Silverman and petitioner. Dr. James E. Phelps, a recognized heart specialist, testified for appellant that his examination of the electrocardiograms taken by Dr. Shapiro on August <em>12, </em>1.947, re.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>vealed that Goreliek had suffered an acute infarction within a period of \"ten to twelve days of the cardiogram;\u201d -that it might have occurred \"one day previous to the day the cardiogram was taken or twelve days.\u201d In response to a hypothetical question Dr. Phelps said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">\u201cA. Well, if the facts as stated are that he had collapsed at the time he lifted, and he had continuous pain, then we have to assume that there is a relationship between the lifting and the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\u201cIf his pain is not continuous, if he didn\u2019t have collapse, then it would seem that he probably suffered an anginal affair at that time and not his infarction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Dr. Phelps admitted that in considering the anterior wall infarction in the instant case, pain across the chest and down the left arm are symptoms and he estimated petitioner\u2019s partial permanent disability approximately 28% of total.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The rule of law applicable to the case <em>sub judice </em>has been clearly and definitely established in the cases of <em>Lohndorf v. Peper Bros. Paint Co., </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>156 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946); affirmed, 135 <em>N. J. L. </em>352 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1946); <em>Grassgreen v. Ridgeley Sportswear Mfg. Co., </em>2 <em>N. J. Super. </em>62 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949), and the recent case of <em>Seiken v. Todd Dry Dock, Inc., </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>469 (1949). Mr. Justice Oliphant, speaking for the Supreme Court in <em>Lohndorf v. Peper Bros. Paint Co., supra, </em>whose opinion was adopted by the Court of Errors and Appeals, at <em>pp. </em>159, 160, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201cThere is a presumption that any death from heart disease is the result of natural causes. Coronary thrombosis \u2018ordinarily ensues from coronary sclerosis or other morbid state. * * * The <em>onus </em>is on claimant to establish that the asserted accident was at least a contributory cause without which the occlusion would not have occurred.\u2019 <em>Schlegel v. H. Baron &amp; Co., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>611.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">\u201c* * * \u2018The law places the burden of proof on the petitioner for compensation; and it is not sustained unless the evidence preponderates in favor of the tendered hypothesis. That must be a rational inference, <em>i. e., </em>based upon a preponderance of probabilities according to the common experience of mankind. It is required to be a probable or more probable hypothesis with reference to the possibility of other hypotheses.\u2019 <em>Gilbert v. Gilbert Machine Works, Inc., supra </em>[122 <em>N. J. L. </em>533] ; <em>Jones v. Newark Terminal and Trans. Co., </em>128 <em>Id. </em>190.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201c* * * To render an injury compensable there must be an event or happening, beyond the mere employment itself, which brings about the final result or contributes thereto, and without which the injury or death would not have resulted. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Judge Colie in <em>Grassgreen v. Ridgeley Sportswear Mfg. Co., supra, </em>comprehensively reviewed prior decisions involving \u201cheart cases\u201d under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and adhered to the legal principles laid down in <em>Lohndorf v. Peper Bros. Paint Co., supra. </em>In the case of <em>Seiken v. Todd Dry Dock, Inc., supra, </em>Mr. Justice Ackerson at <em>p. </em>416, cited with approval <em>Grassgreen v. Ridgeley Sportswear Mfg. Co., supra, </em>and stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cA review of the cases decided since the <em>Lohndorf case, supra, </em>shows 'a general adherence to the view therein expressed that something of an unusual strain or exertion beyond the mere employment itself is required to establish liability; the mere showing that the claimant was performing his routine, everyday tasks, when he suffered xx heart attack does not establish a right to wox-kmen\u2019s compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> Prom our review o\u00a3 the proofs we conclude that Gore-lick has met the test of the rule for determining compensability laid down in the foregoing cases, viz.: that his heart attack was caused by an unusual strain or exertion beyond that-normally required in the performance of his duties and that it. constituted an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">.The judgment of the County Court affirming the award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
