J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AE0\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered in the Union County Oourt reversing a dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s claim by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bueau.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The petitioner is a pharmacist employed at the appellant\u2019s drug store in Elizabeth. II is work included evening hours and he ordinarily had supper at home between 5 :00 and 6 :00 p. it. On occasions his employer directed him to pick up medicines at Lee\u2019s Drug Store, located near the petitioner\u2019s home but about a mile and a half from his employer\u2019s store. In driving to .Lee\u2019s he would travel along North Avenue for several blocks beyond Gross Avenue where he would turn if he were going directly home.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">On December 29, 1947, the petitioner was told by his employer to stop at Lee\u2019s for a package containing medicine. No instructions were given as to whether the petitioner should stop at Lee\u2019s before or after supper or as to what route he should follow. His employer testified that if he had sent someone else it would have entailed a complete trip, whereas for petitioner it was \u201cpractically on his trip for his supper, it is only a few blocks and he can continue on;\u201d he further testified that on stormy nights, such as the night of December 29th, the petitioner usually did not go home for supper but that he \u201cwont home this night because he would be doing that service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The petitioner testified that he drove his car along North Avenue in the general direction of Leo\u2019s but, because of traffic conditions, turned off at Cross Avenue and went home for supper. After he had supper he left his home to proceed to Lee\u2019s, pick up the medicine and return to his employer\u2019s store. In turning his ear to head toward Lee\u2019s he was caught in a snow hank and, while trying to get the car on its way, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>accidentally thrown underneath it. His claim for compensation is for the resulting injury. The employer does not dispute the amount of the award but denies liability on the ground that the petitioner\u2019s accident did not arise out of and in the course of the petitioner\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In <em>Gullo v. American Lead Pencil Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>484 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1938), the Court of Errors and Appeals approved the general rule that an employee injured on the public highway on his way to or from work is not entitled to compensation. This general rule has been considered applicable even where the employee\u2019s presence on the highway was during a temporary cessation of work while at lunch shortly before returning to his employer\u2019s premises. See <em>Palacono v. Garfield Mfg. Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>757 <em>(W. C. B. </em>1930). \u2022 But <em>Cf. Bollard v. Engel, </em>254 <em>App. Div. </em>162, 4 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>2d 363 <em>(App. Div. </em>1938); affirmed, 278 <em>N. Y. </em>463, 17 <em>N. E. </em>2d 130 <em>(Ct. of App. </em>1938), where Justice Heifernan expressed the thought that it \u201cwould be taking too technical a view of the law to say that a pause in the actual course of his work by an employee for the purpose of eating is a break in his employment from the time he stops work to the time when he begins again.\u201d See also <em>Desautel v. North Dakota Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau, </em>72 <em>N. D. </em>35, 4 <em>N. W. 2d </em>581, 141 <em>A. L. R. </em>858 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942). However, the courts have expressly recognized several broad exceptions dependent upon the nature and circumstances of the particular employment. Car<em>dillo v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 <em>U. S. </em>469, 480 (1947); <em>McCrae v. Eastern Aircraft, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>244, 246 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948). One of these is said to arise where the employee on his way to or from home is performing some special errand incidental to his employment at the direction of his employer. See <em>Voehl v. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>288 <em>U. S. </em>162, 169, 170 (1933); <em>Bobertz v. Board of Education of Hillside Township, </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>444, 447 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946) ; reversed on other ground, 135 <em>N. J. L. </em>555 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1947). <em>Cf. Martin v. Hasbrouck Heights, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>569 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945); <em>Mayo v. Hunt\u2019s Theatre, </em>1 <em>N. J. Super. </em>8 <em>(App. Div. </em>1948). In <em>Locke v. Steele County, </em>223 <em>Minn. </em>420, 27 N. W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>2d 285 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947), the court recently held this exception applicable where \u201cduring lunch hour, the employee, in addition to attending to his personal affairs, engages in some work for his employer pursuant to the latter\u2019s instruction and thereby serves a double purpose \u2014 his own and his employer\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We are satisfied that within the cited authorities the facts presented in the instant case justified the lower court\u2019s award in the petitioner\u2019s favor. The petitioner\u2019s presence on the highway at the time of the accident was for his employer\u2019s benefit as well as his own. Pie was not then outside his employment within the limits of the doctrine of the <em>Gullo case; </em>on the contrary, he had completed his supper and was on his way to Lee\u2019s to pick up the medicine in accordance with his employer\u2019s direction. Under the circumstances, the risks of travel from his home to Lee\u2019s were reasonably incidental to bis employment and the accident may properly be considered as having arisen-out of and in the course thereof within the liberal intendment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. <em>Cf. Gellman v. Reliable Linen &amp; Supply Co., </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>443, 446 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
