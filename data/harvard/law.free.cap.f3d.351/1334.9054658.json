We agree with the ruling of the district court and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-18\">The Vegas, private citizens who lease property from Holiday Cove R.V. Resort (\u201cthe Resort\u201d), filed this class action against Scott D. McKay and McKay Law Firm, P.A. (\u201cMcKay\u201d), alleging violations of the FDCPA. In their complaint, the Vegas asserted that they were obligated to pay rent to the Resort for the lease of trailer space on weekends. The Vegas maintained that McKay represented the Resort in a small claims action to recover damages from the Vegas, and in that regard had sent the Vegas a package containing a civil complaint, a summons to appear for a pretrial conference, and a FDCPA notice. The Vegas argued that McKay was a \u201cdebtor collector\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA, that the complaint package constituted an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the statute as well, and that the summons contained therein \u201covershadow[ed] and eontradict[ed] the debt validation notice required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a) thereby rendering this notice ineffective in violation of [the FDCPA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-19\">McKay moved to dismiss the Vegas\u2019 action' under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that, in light of <em>McKnight v. Benitez, </em>176 F.Supp.2d 1301, 1308 (M.D.Fla.2001), which held that the service of papers in a legal action does not constitute an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA, the complaint package that McKay had served upon the Vegas was not an \u201cinitial communication.\u201d McKay maintained that, because its complaint package did not constitute an \u201cinitial communication\u201d necessitating a notice of debt under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g, the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>FDCPA notice contained in the package was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">The Vegas responded, <em>inter alia, </em>that McKay\u2019s reliance on <em>McKnight </em>was erroneous because <em>McKnight </em>had been overruled by <em>In re Martinez, </em>311 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir.2002), a case in which the underlying bankruptcy court had implicitly found that a state court collection suit constituted an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA. The Vegas noted that <em>In re Martinez </em>failed to directly address the issue of whether a state court collection suit constitutes an \u201cinitial communication.\u201d The Vegas argued, however, that this Court\u2019s summary affirmance of the lower court\u2019s decision evinced an intent to overrule <em>McKnight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">The district court found that, in accordance with <em>McKnight, </em>McKay\u2019s complaint package did not constitute an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA. The court found that, therefore, the adequacy of the \u201cFDCPA Notice\u201d attached to the complaint package was irrelevant. Accordingly, the court granted McKay\u2019s motion to dismiss. In reaching its decision, the court did not address the effect of <em>In re Martinez </em>on <em>McKnight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">The Vegas argue on appeal that the district court erroneously found that McKay\u2019s complaint package did not constitute an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA. The Vegas maintain that, under the plain language of \u00a7 1692a(2), written documents that are conveyed via a process server, and that compose a state court collection suit, should constitute a \u201ccommunication.\u201d Additionally, the Vegas contend that the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>McKnight </em>was erroneous because <em>McKnight </em>was overruled by our decision in <em>In re Martinez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Lotierzo v. A Woman\u2019s World Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>278 F.3d 1180, 1182 (11th Cir.2002). The FDCPA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-9\">[wjithin five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing [required debt verification information],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). \u201cThe term \u2018communication\u2019 means the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">Neither this Court nor any other circuit has addressed the issue of whether a legal action constitutes an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1692g(a). Under factual circumstances similar to the instant case, the Middle District of Florida has held that \u201cit is more consistent with the purpose and intent of Congress ... [that] the term \u2018communication\u2019 as used in the Act does not include a \u2018legal action\u2019 or pleadings or orders connected therewith.\u201d <em>McKnight, </em>176 F.Supp.2d at 1306, 1308 (noting that the purpose of the FDCPA is to \u201ccurb abusive debt collection practices, not legal actions\u201d). Significant to the court\u2019s holding in <em>McKnight </em>was the fact that the Federal Trade Commission does not consider a legal action to be a \u201ccommunication\u201d in connection with the collection of a debt. <em>See id. </em>at 1305-06 (noting that the FTC has stated in non-binding commentary that \u201c[a] debt collector\u2019s institution of formal legal action against a consumer ... is not a \u2018communication in connection with collection of any debt,\u2019 and thus does not confer section 809 notice-and-validation rights on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>the consumer\u201d) (citing 53 FR 50097, 50108).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">On the other hand, at least two courts have issued opinions, although non-binding, that contradict <em>McKnight. </em>The Oklahoma court of civil appeals has expressly held that a legal action does constitute an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA. <em>Mendus v. Morgan &amp; Associates, P.C., </em>994 P.2d 83, 88 (Okla.Civ.App.1999) (citing <em>Heintz v. Jenkins, </em>514 U.S. 291, 299, 115 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 131 L.Ed.2d 395 (1995), which held that the FDCPA governs attorneys who regularly engage in debt collection activities \u201ceven when that activity consists of litigation\u201d). While one could argue that the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of Florida may have implicitly held in <em>In re Martinez, </em>266 B.R. 523, 533 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.2001), that a legal action constitutes an \u201cinitial communication\u201d under the FDCPA, we think not. The sole issue in <em>In re Martinez </em>was whether the defendant had effectively conveyed to the plaintiff notice of the right to dispute the plaintiffs debt, as required by \u00a7 1692q. <em>See id. </em>at 530. In explaining the circumstances under which the FDCPA notice had been conveyed to the plaintiff, the court stated that \u201c[t]he Initial Communication in this case was a 16 page package which included a summons and complaint. The FDCPA Notice was on page eight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533. Notably, the question of whether a legal action constitutes an \u201cinitial communication\u201d was not before the bankruptcy court. Moreover, that issue was not raised or addressed when the case was appealed to the district court or this Court. <em>See In re Martinez, </em>271 B.R. 696, 700 (S.D.Fla.2001); <em>In re Martinez, </em>311 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">We now conclude that the holding of <em>McKnight, </em>that a legal action does not constitute an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA, accurately states the law. The Vegas\u2019 contention, that <em>McKnight </em>has been overruled by <em>In re Martinez, </em>is without merit because the question of whether a legal action constitutes an \u201cinitial communication\u201d was never at issue in <em>In re Martinez, </em>and we in no way indicated our intent to overrule <em>McKnight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">We agree with the conclusion set forth in <em>McKnight </em>that it seems far more consistent with the purpose of the Act that the term \u201ccommunication\u201d as used does not include a \u201clegal action or pleading.\u201d In making this decision we give serious consideration to the interpretation put forth by the Federal Trade Commission which is the agency changed with enforcing the provisions of the FDCPA and has developed the expertise in this area. As we have stated, \u201cit is enough to observe that the well-reasoned views of the agencies implementing a statute constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u201d <em>See BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. Town of Palm Beach, </em>252 F.3d 1169, 1188 n. 11 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, </em>527 U.S. 581, 589, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999)) (following the FCC\u2019s guideline interpretation of a particular statutory provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err by finding that McKay\u2019s complaint and summons package did not constitute an \u201cinitial communication\u201d within the meaning of the FDCPA. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
