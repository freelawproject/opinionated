(\u201cGranite State\u201d), request for injunctive relief against defendant-ap-pellee, the City of Clearwater, Florida (\u201cthe City\u201d or \u201cClearwater\u201d), after several permit applications to construct billboards in the City were denied under Article 3, Division 18 of the City\u2019s Community Development Code (\u201cthe Code\u201d). The district court ruled that Granite State had standing to challenge the <em>entirety </em>of Article 8, Division 18, but not any part of Article 4, the part of the Code that governs the permit denial appeals process. The district court denied injunctive relief based on its ruling that, after unconstitutional provisions of Division 18 were severed from the remainder of the ordinance, the remaining provisions were constitutional. Upon consideration, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-17\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-18\">Granite State is a Georgia corporation in the business of buying or leasing land upon which to construct signs and billboards to be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Granite State has never erected or operated a billboard, nor has it held a permit in its own name to erect a billboard. Granite State receives its profits from the sale of billboard permits it obtains from various cities and municipalities, some of which have been ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>tained through litigation similar to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">Clearwater is a political subdivision of the state of Florida and describes itself as a \u201cresort community on the west coast of the state with more than five miles of beaches on the Gulf of Mexico\u201d and with a tourism-based economy. Clearwater Cmty.Dev.Code \u00a7 3-1801 (1999). Clear-water, like many other cities, has codified various sign regulations to create a comprehensive scheme for regulating, <em>inter alia, </em>the permitting, placement, number, size, height, design, operation, and maintenance of signs within the City\u2019s boundaries. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-1801-1807 (2003). The many purposes of these sign regulations include traffic safety and aesthetics of the community. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-1802 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Granite State entered into lease agreements for a total of eight parcels of real property located in commercial or industrial areas of Clearwater. Granite State\u2019s goal was to construct and operate one freestanding billboard sign on each parcel of property. The City denied each of Granite State\u2019s permit applications because Granite State applied to construct billboards more than four times the allowable height and ten times the allowable area under Clearwater regulations. Rather than appeal the denial of its permits, Granite State initiated the current litigation in the Middle District of Florida challenging the constitutionality of Article 3, Division 18 and Article 4 of Clearwater\u2019s Community Development Code on First Amendment grounds and requesting in-junctive relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">Article 3, Division 18 regulates both commercial and non-commercial signs and dictates when permits are required before certain signs may be erected. In particular, \u00a7 3-1806 regulates \u201c[p]ermitted signs requiring development review.\u201d Part B.l. of this section deals with non-residential, freestanding signs, and it was under this part of \u00a7 3-1806 that Granite State\u2019s permits were denied. Specifically, subparts (c) and (e) of \u00a7 3-1806.B.1. dictate the allowable area and height, respectively, of a freestanding sign. Article 4 sets forth the process for obtaining various levels of permit approval and also details the appeals process to contest denial of a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">The district court granted Granite State standing to challenge the <em>entirety </em>of Article 3, Division 18 on First Amendment grounds, both as applied and under the overbreadth doctrine, and denied it standing to challenge any part of Article 4 on either ground. Because we find the district court misapplied the overbreadth doctrine, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of standing to Granite State to challenge provisions of the City\u2019s sign ordinance that did not give rise to an injury in fact (i.e., provisions other than \u00a7 3-1806.B.L), and we remand this ease for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm the district court\u2019s denials of (1) standing to challenge any part of Article 4, (2) injunctive relief, and (3) attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A4o\">A. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Article III, \u00a7 2 of the United States Constitution requires that there be a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d before a federal court may decide a case. U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2. <em>See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 559-60, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). The constitutional requirements for a federal court to adjudicate a case are accompanied by prudential requirements. <em>See, e.g., Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 162, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1161, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997); <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. at 2136. Together, these constitutional and prudential requirements form the doctrine of standing. <em>See, e.g., Bennett, </em>520 U.S. at 162, 117 S.Ct. at 1161; <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. at 2136.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">The Supreme Court has identified three constitutional requirements for standing, all of which must be satisfied: (1) an injury in fact, meaning an injury that is concrete and <em>particularized, </em>and actual or imminent, (2) a causal connection between the injury and the causal conduct, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Bennett, </em>520 US. at 167, 117 S.Ct. at 1163. The Court also has identified three prudential standing principles. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). Relevant here is the principle that a party generally may assert only his or her own rights and cannot raise the claims of third parties not before the court. <em>See, e.g., id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Certain exceptions to the <em>prudential </em>standing requirements have developed in Supreme Court jurisprudence. Significant to this case is the \u201coverbreadth doctrine,\u201d an exception that applies in First Amendment cases involving noncommercial speech and that permits third-party standing when a statute is <em>constitutionally </em>applied to the litigant but might be <em>unconstitutionally </em>applied to third parties not before the court. <em>See, e.g., Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>444 U.S. 620, 634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 834-35, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980). The over-breadth doctrine, however, is not an exception to the <em>constitutional </em>standing requirements. Bis<em>choff v. Osceola County, Fla., </em>222 F.3d 874, 884 (11th Cir.2000). A plaintiff seeking to make an overbreadth challenge must first show that he has suffered an injury in fact, as required under Article III. <em>See, e.g., Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Ass\u2019n Inc., </em>484 U.S. 383, 392-93, 108 S.Ct. 636, 642-43, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988); <em>Village of Schaumburg, </em>444 U.S. at 634, 100 S.Ct. at 834; <em>Bischoff, </em>222 F.3d at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\"> An \u201cinjury in fact\u201d requires the plaintiff to \u201cshow that he <em>personally </em>has suffered some actual or threatened injury.\u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted). While this requirement is hard to define precisely, we know that the plaintiff must at least claim to <em>personally </em>suffer some harm. <em>See, e.g., Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 562-63, 112 S.Ct. at 2137-38; <em>United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number><em>(SCRAP), </em>412 U.S. 669, 686-87, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">1. <em>Division 18, \u00a7 8-1806.B.1. of the Cleanuater Community Development Code</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">In this case, the only harm that Granite State has personally suffered is under \u00a7 3-1806.B.1. of the Clearwater Community Development Code. It was under this provision that Granite State\u2019s billboard permits were denied. Granite State has suffered no injury regarding any other provision in Article 3, Division 18. Thus, Granite State has standing to challenge the constitutionality of <em>only </em>\u00a7 3-1806.B.1. as applied to it and, under the overbreadth doctrine, as applied to non-commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">This provision was constitutionally applied to Granite State: it sought to construct a billboard sign <em>much </em>larger than any sign allowed under the Clear-water regulations. Moreover, because \u00a7 3-1806.B.1. is content-neutral and gives no discretion to the permitting authority, this provision is not overbroad.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Staub v. Baxley, </em>355 U.S. 313, 322, 78 S.Ct. 277, 282, 2 L.Ed.2d 302 (1958); <em>Horton v. City of St. Augustine, </em>272 F.3d 1318, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, Granite State\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 3-1806.B.1. must fail. This issue is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">2. <em>Article k of the Clearwater Community Development Code</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdA\">Granite State does not have standing to challenge Article 4 of the Code because it has suffered no injury with regard to the City\u2019s permitting and appeals process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Granite State argues that it did not avail itself of the allegedly unconstitutional appeals process because the ordinance does not contain sufficient procedural safeguards. The specific constitutional defect, according to Granite State, is the fact that City officials have an unlimited amount of time to decide whether to grant or deny a permit application. Such an argument, by itself, does not create Article III standing. Granite State has neither alleged nor shown how the City\u2019s permitting and appeals procedure has injured Granite State. To the contrary, the record shows that Granite State\u2019s permits were denied within a reasonable time: the same day they were submitted. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hays, </em>515 U.S. 737, 745, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 2436, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995) (holding that only those voters residing in an allegedly unconstitutionally drawn voting district have standing to challenge the unconstitutionality of the voting district); <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 739, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1368, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972) (affirming \u201c[t]he requirement that a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>seeking review must allege facts showing that he is himself adversely affected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">We note that this case is distinguishable from a line of Supreme Court eases involving (but not beginning with) <em>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ\u2019g Co., </em>486 U.S. 750, 755-56, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 2140, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), and precedent from our circuit relying on the same, allowing litigants to facially challenge a licensing scheme vesting the decision-maker with unbridled discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, </em>493 U.S. 215, 223-24, 110 S.Ct. 596, 603-04, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990); <em>United States v. Frandsen, </em>212 F.3d 1231, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Gold Coast Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Corrigan, </em>42 F.3d 1336, 1343 (11th Cir.1994); <em>Dimmitt v. City of Clearwater, </em>985 F.2d 1565, 1570 (11th Cir.1993); <em>Abramson v. Gonzalez, </em>949 F.2d 1567, 1573 (11th Cir.1992); <em>Sentinel Communications Co. v. Watts, </em>936 F.2d 1189, 1197-98 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">In <em>Lakewood, </em>the city mayor was given unguided discretion to decide which publishers could place newsracks on public property and where they could be placed. 486 U.S. at 753-54, 108 S.Ct. at 2142. The Court held that such unbridled discretion in the permitting official \u201cconstituted a prior restraint and may result in censorship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757, 108 S.Ct. at 2144. The Court then granted the plaintiff standing to facially challenge this defect in the ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 755-56, 108 S.Ct. at 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">Similar to the challenged permitting scheme in this case, the ordinance in <em>Lakewood </em>also did not contain time limits within which the Mayor had to decide whether to grant or to deny a permit. <em>Id. </em>at 771, 108 S.Ct. at 2151-52. The majority noted, however, that \u201c[e]ven if judicial review were relatively speedy, such review cannot substitute for concrete standards to guide the decision-maker\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>108 S.Ct. at 2151. Thus, time limits are required when their lack could result in <em>censorship </em>of certain viewpoints or ideas, <em>see, e.g., Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 58-59, 85 S.Ct. 734, 739, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965), but are not categorically required when the permitting scheme is content-neutral. <em>Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., </em>534 U.S. 316, 322-24, 122 S.Ct. 775, 780-81, 151 L.Ed.2d 783 (2002); <em>see also Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>348 F.3d 1278, 1281 (2003) (noting that, \u201cIn particular, ... the Court never stated time limits were <em>per se </em>required for a [content-neutral] permitting scheme to be valid. Rather, the Court simply held all that was required were \u2018adequate standards to guide the official\u2019s discretion and render it subject to judicial review.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">The Clearwater Community Development Code gives no similar discretion to the permitting authorities as existed in cases such as <em>Lakewood. </em>City officials can only process a permit application and decide to grant or deny the permit based on specific, objective criteria (e.g., the height, size, or surface area of a proposed sign). Moreover, we note that the litigants in <em>Lakewood, </em>who were allowed to facially challenge an ordinance on the ground that it gave permitting authorities unbridled discretion, were injured under the very provisions they challenged. <em>Lakewood, </em>486 U.S. at 754, 108 S.Ct. at 2142. As we have explained, this is not the circumstance for Granite State, which suffered no injury in fact under Article 4.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>The judgment of the district court denying Granite State standing to challenge Article 4 both as applied and facially under the overbreadth doctrine is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">B. <em>Mootness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">Like the requirement of standing, mootness is a justiciability doctrine that must be satisfied before we may decide a case. <em>See, e.g., United States Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, </em>445 U.S. 388, 396-97, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 1208-09, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980). We lack jurisdiction because of mootness \u201cwhen the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1951, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). In this case, the City argues that Granite State\u2019s claims are now moot because Clearwater has revised the Code in accordance with the district court\u2019s decision. Because Granite State has requested damages, however, the changes made to the ordinance do not make this case moot. <em>See, e.g., Firefighter\u2019s Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, </em>467 U.S. 561, 571, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 2584, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984); <em>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363, 371, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1120, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982); <em>see also Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 283, 289, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 1074, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982) (\u201crepeal of the objectionable language would not preclude [Clearwater] from reenacting precisely the same provision if the District Court\u2019s judgment were vacated\u201d). Thus, we must rule on the constitutionality of the provision under which Granite State may be entitled to damages, \u00a7 3-1806.B.1. As we have explained, this section was not unconstitutionally applied to Granite State. Accordingly, Granite State is not entitled to damages resulting from the denial of its permits under this section. The district court\u2019s denial of damages is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">C. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">Granite State argues that it should be entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), which' permits the court to award attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for actions brought under various civil rights provisions, including 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). Granite State argues that, while it did not succeed on all of its claims in the district court, it nevertheless should be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because it has achieved \u201cexcellent results\u201d for third parties who may have sought to post a sign under the provisions of the ordinance stricken by the district court. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 40. Under \u00a7 1988, however, the plaintiff is considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d if he obtains \u201cat least some relief on the merits of his claim\u201d ... \u201c[that] materially alters the legal relationship between the parties.\u201d <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 573, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992) (citations omitted); <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>482 U.S. 755, 760, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 2675, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987); <em>see also Falanga v. State Bar of Ga., </em>150 F.3d .1333, 1347 n. 34 (11th Cir.1998). Furthermore, \u201c[a] favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results in judgment against the plaintiff does not suffice to render him a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>\u2018prevailing party\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 1988. <em>Hewitt, </em>482 U.S. at 763, 107 S.Ct. at 2677.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">In this case, Granite State is not the \u201cprevailing party\u201d and the relationship between the parties is unaltered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have determined that \u00a7 1306.B.1. was constitutionally applied to Granite State and is facially constitutional. We also determined that the district court erred in allowing Granite State standing to challenge any other provisions in Article 3, Division 18. Moreover, we determined that the district court correctly ruled that Granite State did not have standing to challenge Article 4. Thus, Granite State has not prevailed on any of its claims regarding the Clearwater Community Development Code. The district court\u2019s denial of an award of attorney\u2019s fees is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">The district court erred in its conclusion that Granite State had standing to challenge the entirety of Article 3, Division 18 of the Clearwater Community Development Code. Accordingly, this part of the district court\u2019s holding is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. The district court correctly denied Granite State both standing to challenge Article 4 and injunctive relief because the provision under which Granite State\u2019s permit requests were denied is not unconstitutional. Moreover, the district court correctly denied Granite State\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-19\">. The facts in this case that we relate are undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">. Initially, Granite State also requested in-junctive relief from Clearwater Mayor, Brian Aungst, Sr., and its City Manager, William Horne. The district court dismissed Granite State's claims against these defendants both in their individual and official capacities. This dismissal was not challenged on appeal; therefore, the only remaining defendant before us is the City of Clearwater. Additionally, Granite State has not appealed the district court\u2019s rulings regarding its claims that the Clearwater ordinance violates the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection and the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. Accordingly, these issues are not before us: \u201cIssues not clearly raised in the briefs are considered abandoned.\u201d <em>Hardwick v.

Granite State has alleged that this provision is a prior restraint on speech because a permit is required before a billboard may be erected. This section is not a prior restraint, however, for the same reasons why an over-breadth challenge will fail: it is content-neutral and gives no discretion to the permitting authority. <em>See, e.g., Staub v. Baxley, </em>355 U.S. 313, 322, 78 S.Ct. 277, 282, 2 L.Ed.2d 302 (1958); <em>Horton v. City of St. Augustine, </em>272 F.3d 1318, 1332 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">. We note that while 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 forms the statutory jurisdictional basis for Granite State's claim, \u00a7 1983 is not a substitute for the constitutional standing requirements. Section 1983 allows a plaintiff to bring a claim into court without exhausting state administrative appeals. <em>See, e.g., Patsy v. Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>457 U.S. 496, 518, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2559-60, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). It does not, however, permit a plaintiff to challenge an appeals process that the plaintiff chose to forego without showing any actual or potential harm caused by the challenged appeals process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">. To the extent any of our prior decisions allowed facial standing (1) without first determining whether the litigant was entitled to as-applied standing or (2) without mentioning or discussing standing at all, such cases are in-apposite to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">. Moreover, as noted in <em>Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>it is possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>ble that the \u201cCity officials could potentially delay the processing of certain permit applications and thereby arbitrarily suppress disfavored speech.\u201d 348 F.3d 1278, 1282 (11th Cir.2003). Because we find Granite State lacks standing to challenge Article 4, we find that such \"abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1282 (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>534 U.S. at 325, 122 S.Ct at 781).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">. As in <em>Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. City of St. Petersburg, </em>it is true that several provisions in the Clearwater ordinance were voluntarily altered by the City as a result of this litigation. These changes, however, \"have no bearing on Granite [State], and thus their alteration does not serve to confer prevailing party status upon Granite [State].\u201d 348 F.3d at 1284, n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1150-8\">ANDERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ATQ\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
