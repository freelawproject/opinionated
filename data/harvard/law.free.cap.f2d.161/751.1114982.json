In his decision (66 U.S.P.Q. 262), the commissioner in part said:</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">\u201cSubstantially applicant\u2019s entire argument on appeal is directed to the proposition that the word \u2018craft,\u2019 as applied to hosiery, is merely descriptive. Upon the premise that a descriptive word cannot dominate the marks, applicant thus maintains that purchasers of hosiery would look to the words \u2018Edge\u2019 and \u2018Art\u2019 as indicia of origin; and because these words are dissimilar, applicant insists that the marks as a whole are not likely to be confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">\u201cThe manner in which applicant has dissected the marks finds some support in recent decisions of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the argument advanced would be persuasive were I convinced that \u2018craft\u2019 is descriptive. However, I am not so convinced. A number of registrations were introduced by applicant to show, it is said, that \u2018the Patent Office has long considered the word \u201ccraft\u201d as descriptive and that no exclusiveness is obtainable therein.\u2019 These registrations would seem to be incompetent for the purpose offered. Marshall Field &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>R. H. Macy &amp; Co., 115 F.2d 921, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 807. But in any event, since the word \u2018craft\u2019 is disclaimed in none of them, they would not tend to establish applicant\u2019s point.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">\u201cThe examiner of interferences expressed the opinion that as a part of the marks in question, the word \u2018craft\u2019 is \u2018no more than suggestive of the claimed excellence of the products of the parties;\u2019 and I am constrained to agree' with him. I\u2018 am aware that \u2018Master-Craft\u2019 was held to be descriptive of suits and overcoats in Ex parte Hershberg &amp; Co., 184 O.G. 806, 1912 C.D. 364; that \u2018Mastercraft\u2019 was held to be descriptive of granite monuments in Ex parte H. P. Hinman Co., 156 Ms.D. 948; and that \u2018Blindcraft\u2019 was held to be descriptive of products made by the blind in San Fransico Association for Blind v. Industrial Aid for Blind, Inc., D.C., 58 F. Supp. 995, 65 U.S.P.Q. 267. However, each of those complete marks, to borrow the language of District Judge Hulen in the case last cited, is a \u2018consistent natural descriptive term.\u2019 On the other hand, the marks \u2018Edgecraft\u2019 and \u2018Artcraft,\u2019 like the trade-mark \u2018Farmcraft\u2019 considered in Henry Muhs Co. v. Farm Craft Foods, Inc., D.C., 37 F.Supp. 1013, 49 U.S.P.Q. \u25a0 162, are \u2018artificial, not descriptive, * * * a tie of two entirely different words which have no natural but only a forced association.\u2019 And considering the nature of the merchandise to which they are applied, these marks are too nearly alike to be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>concurrently without a reasonable like-,.' lihood of resulting confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">We are in entire accord with the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">It is stated t-hat the prefix \u201cEdge\u201d was adopted as part of applicant\u2019s mark for hosiery for the reason that it is the surname of the president of the applicant corporation. We do not see where this fact has any effect whatsoever upon the decision of the sole issue at bar. It does, however, serve to disclose the reason why applicant adopted a mark so nearly resembling that of the opposer, a-nd of course is intended to negative any contention that the applicant was in bad faith attempting to profit by any confusion that might result from the concurrent use of the two marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\"> The suffix \u201ccraft\u201d is not descriptive wit-hin the meaning of trade-mark law, but even if it were the mark as a whole is not descriptive, and the mark must be considered as a whole. True enough, it has been so frequently held as to require no discussion here that in considering a mark it is proper to take into consideration portions which may be regarded as descriptive and which fall into the realm of that which is publici juris upon the theory that such a suffix ordinarily would not be of a character which could serve to indicate origin of the goods as much as other portions of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Applicant\u2019s main contention here is that \u201ccraft\u201d is descriptive and that the words \u201cArt\u201d and \u201cEdge\u201d are sufficiently dissimilar so that in the concurrent use of the two marks there would be no likelihood of confusion. Applicant relies upon numerous decisions of this and other courts and in effect argues that we must wholly ignore the term \u201ccraft\u201d and pass upon the issue as to whether or not \u201cArt\u201d and \u201cEdge\u201d are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">As did the commissioner, we view the ma-rks as a whole, and it seems to us that there would be great likelihood of confusion resulting from the concurrent use of the marks \u201cArtcraft\u201d and \u201cEdgecraft\u201d upon hosiery.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The opposer has pointed out in its brief the following, which we think properly expresses the situation with reference to the similarity of the marks:</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">\u201cThe applicant\u2019s proposed trademark Edgecraft\u2019 is so nearly alike in sound and appearance to the opposer\u2019s registered trademark \u2018Artcraft\u2019 that their concurrent use on goods of the same kind will inevitably result in confusion in the mind of the purchasing public. The word \u2018craft\u2019 commonly appears in both marks. Further, both marks are written as one word of two syllables, the syllable \u2018craft\u2019 in each case being in the same relation and having the same emphasis with respect to its associated first syllabl-e. Moreover, the first syllables of the two marks are quite similar in sound and appearance, both being short nouns having vowel beginnings which make for a sharp pronunciation thereof. Finally, when these first syllables are respectively combined in a single word form with the identical ending syllable \u2018craft,\u2019 the similarity in sound and appearance of the trademarks in issue becomes striking indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">\u201c\u2018Flametex\u2019 \u2018Opal-Tex\u2019 and \u2018Fir-Tex,\u2019 have each been held to be confusingly similar to \u2018Celotex,\u2019 this in spite of the fact that numerous trademark registrations ending with the suffix \u2018Tex\u2019 had been effected in the same class of goods, such as \u2018Hy-Tex,\u2019 \u2018Unitex,\u2019 \u2018Walltex,\u2019 etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">The Patent Office tribunals in this case also applied the so-called rule of doubt, and we think properly so, although we do not regard it as a close case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">As before stated, certain decisions of this and other courts are relied upon by both parties hereto, which decisions involve trade-marks with either descriptive suffixes or prefixes, or terms that are in very common use, but an examination of the cases referred to will show factors in each not involved here. Moreover, it has been said too frequently to require citation of authorities that in trade-mark cases, where the issue involves a decision as to whether or not there is such similarity of marks as to be likely to result in confusion, the holdings in other cases are not always helpful, since each case must be considered upon its own statement of facts. True enough, the citation of cases sometimes is helpful for the purpose of determining general principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>which have been adopted by the courts, but such principles have little application here to the sole, simple issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The opposer has cited a number of cases holding that, under the 'Stated facts, there was likelihood of confusion, which holdings the opposer thinks have application here. Some of them are as follows: Celotex Co. v. Bronston Bros. &amp; Co., Inc., 49 F.2d 1048, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1490, involving the marks \u201cFlametex\u201d and \u201cCelotex\u201d; Celotex Co. v. Chicago Panel-Stone Co., 49 F.2d 1051, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1504, involving \u201cOpal-Tex\u201d and \u201cCelotex\u201d; Celotex Co. v. Millington, etc., 49 F.2d 1053, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1484, involving \u201cFir-Tex\u201d and \u201cCelotex\u201d; Celanese Corporation of Amer-ica v. Vanity Fair Silk Mills, 47 F.2d 373, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 958, involving \u201cCelan-ese\u201d and \u201cSilkenese\u201d; and Skelly Oil Co. v. Powerine Co., 86 F.2d 752, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 790, involving \u201cPowermax\u201d and \u201cPowerine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Although -these cases tend to support the opposer\u2019s contention herein we do not find it necessary to rely upon them particularly in arriving at the conclusion that the marks \u201cEdgecraft\u201d and \u201cArtcraft\u201d are so similar that when used concurrently upon hosiery confusion would be likely to result.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The decision of the commissioner affirming that of the examiner which sustained the opposition to the registration of applicant\u2019s mark is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
