They contend that the regulation which they were enjoined from violating is not supported by statutory authority; but that, if it is, the Act of Congress is unconstitutional. In either event, it does not follow that their conviction for criminal contempt in violating the injunction should be reversed. On the contrary, it is clear that the judgments below must be upheld upon the direct authority of Howat v. Kansas, 258 U.S. 181, 189, 190, 42 S.Ct. 277, 280, 66 L.Ed. 550, wherein Chief Justice Taft thus expressed the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court: \u201cAn injunction duly issuing out of a court of general jurisdiction with equity powers upon pleadings properly invoking its. action, and served upon persons made parties therein and within the jurisdiction, must be obeyed by them however erroneous the action of the court may be, even if the error be in the assumption of the validity of a seeming but void law going to the merits of the case. It is for the court of first instance to determine the question of the validity of the law, and until its decision is reversed for error by orderly review, either by itself or by a higher court, its orders based on its decision are to be respected, and disobedience of them is contempt of its lawful authority, to be punished.
