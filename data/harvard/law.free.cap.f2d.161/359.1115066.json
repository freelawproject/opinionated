Moving to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, the defendants urged: that the remedy afforded by the Georgia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was by an original proceeding before the Georgia State Board of Workmen\u2019s Compensation; that it was exclusive; and that neither the United States Court nor the Circuit Court of Hinds County, Mississippi, nor any other tribunal than the Georgia State Board had jurisdiction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-31\">The district judge, of the opinion that the motion was well taken, entered his order dismissing the cause for want of jurisdiction. The plaintiff is here insisting that the ruling was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-32\">We do not think so. The Georgia decisions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> settle it that the remedy for enforcement of the rights conferred by the Georgia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Code 1933, is an exclusive one which can be afforded only by the State Board of Workmen\u2019s Compensation in a proceeding brought before it as the statute provides (Sec. 114-103). This being so, it is quite clear that the case is ruled by the principle that where the provision for the liability claimed is coupled with a provision for a special remedy to be afforded not by a court but by a commission, that remedy and that alone must be employed and resort to court action may not be had for relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s reliance on Floyd v. Vicksburg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Cooperage Co., 156 Miss. 567, 569, 126 So. 395, holding that a suit may be brought in Mississippi to enforce the Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act will not do. \u201cThe Louisiana Compensation Law provides for its enforcement in the courts of that state\u201d and \u201cThe liability created is enforceable in the courts of another state\u201d, United Dredging Co. v. Lindberg, 5 Cir., 18 F.2d 453, 454. The Georgia statute sought to be enforced here \u201ccommits the enforcement of its provisions to an administrative board, whereas the Louisiana statute is required to be administered by the courts\u201d, Id., 18 F.2d 454, 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The judgment of dismissal was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-19\"> Grice v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 187 Ga. 259, 200 S.E. 700; Blue Bell Globe Mfg. Co. v.
