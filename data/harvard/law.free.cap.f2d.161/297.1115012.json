The subpoena in question is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-21\">\u201cUnited States of America</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ape\">\u201cOffice of Price Administration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayn\">\u201cSubpoena Dtices Tecum</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APi\">\u201cR.

Hickey, District Enforcement Attorney of the Office of Price Administration, at 609 Kittredge Building, 16th and Glenarm Place in the City of Denver, Colorado, on the 20th day of September, 1946, at 10 o'clock A.

Porter, Price Administrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201cBy J. R. Sledge, Colorado District Director.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The first attack on the validity of the subpoena is that it was issued by the District Administrator and that the Administrator is without authority under the provisions of the Act to delegate his power of subpoena. This question was before us in Smith v. Fleming, 10 Cir., 158 F.2d 791, and was resolved by us against the contention advanced by appellant here. We are asked, however, to .reconsider our decision in that case, abandon the decisions cited in support of our decision, and give our adherence to the decision by the Sixth Circuit in Porter v. Mohawk Wrecking &amp; Lumber Company, 156 F.2d 891. It is sufficient to say that we see no reason for abandoning the conclusion we reached in the Smith case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">It is next urged that the subpoena was void because it required appellants to appear before Frank E. Hickey, District Enforcement Attorney, at 609 Kittredge Building in Denver, Colorado, for the purpose of examination. The argument in support of this contention is that the enforcement attorney was an improper person to conduct the examination. Appellant\u2019s position seems to be that the Administrator alone was empowered by the Act to conduct the hearing and that he was without power to delegate this duty. It is pointed out that Section 202(a) provides that: \u201cThe Administrator is authorized to * * * conduct such hearings, * * *\u201d and that Section 202(b) authorizes the Administrator to administer oaths. From this, the argument is made that since these provisions mention him alone, they are personal to him and the mandate is laid upon him to do these things, and that he may not delegate these responsibilities. This argument merits no serious consideration. Such a construction would destroy the very purpose of the Act and make impossible its enforcement. It is painfully obvious that the administrator himself could conduct no more than a small fractional part of one per cent of the innumerable investigations which obviously were necessary to carry out the broad purposes of the Act. It may be of some significance that not a single case is cited in which this point has even been urged, let alone decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">There are, however, provisions in the Act which clearly indicate that the power is present to delegate the power to carry on investigations. Thus, Section 201(a) empowers the Administrator to \u201cappoint such employees as he deems necessary in order to carry out his functions and duties under this Act.\u201d Section 201(b) provides that while the principal office of the Administrator shall be in the District of Columbia, he \u201cor any duly authorized representative may exercise any or all of his powers in any place.\u201d Section 201(d) provides that \u201cThe Administrator may, from time to time, issue such regulations and orders as he may deem necessary or proper in order to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act.\u201d These and many other provisions clearly indicate that it was contemplated that the Administrator would require the assistance of a large number of examiners, investigators and attorneys in the enforcement of the Act. Without such powers, the attempt to enforce the Act would be foredoomed to failure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">In their assignments of error, appellants urge that the subpoena was void because too vague and indefinite to be complied with. No argument is made in the brief on this point, and it apparently has been abandoned. In- any event, there is no merit in the contention advanced therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">We find no error in the record and the order and judgment appealed from are accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> In Southern Garment Mfrs. Ass'n v Fleming, 74 App.D.C. 228, 122 F.2d 622, at page 625, Judge Vinson, now Chief Justice said: \u201cThe precise question is whether the Administrator can appoint a subordinate to act as the presiding officer at a hearing; is that a function which a subordinate can perform? Sensible administration would seem t\u00a9 call for such a practice. The practice has been approved by the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
