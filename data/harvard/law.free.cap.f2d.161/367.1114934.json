A dye bath for textiles comprising an emulsion of a water-immiscible pigmented lacquer distributed in a continuous aqueous phase, the binder of the lacquer comprising a carbamide formaldehyde resin soluble in organic solvents, and comprising not over 2.5% of the total dye bath, and being present in at least twice the volume of the pigment, the solvent of the lacquer being no more volatile than toluol at 25 \u00b0C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-32\">\u201c3. A dye bath for textiles comprising an emulsion of a water-immiscible pigmented lacquer distributed in a continuous aqueous phase, the binder of the lacquer comprising a carbamide formaldehyde resin soluble in organic solvents, and an alkyd resin compatible therewith, said resins comprising not over 2.5% of the total dye bath, and being present in at least twice the volume of the pigment, the solvent of the lacquer being no more volatile than toluol at 25 \u00b0C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The subject matter of the invention maybe understood from a reading of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The application was prosecuted under what is known as dual prosecution, claims 1, 2 and 3 before Division 50 and claims 4 to 14, inclusive, before Division 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The claims of the first group were rejected by the Primary Examiner as unpat-entable over the patent to, Jenett et al., 2,196,669, April 30, 1940, and he further rejected claims 2 and 3 as being indefinite in the use of the word \u201ccarbamide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In his specification appellant states that he obtains best results with the \u201ccarbamide formaldehyde resins, including the resins made from formaldehyde and urea, thiourea, melamine, and other urea derivatives and substituted ureas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The examiner considered the wording of the quotation objectionable for the stated reason that the meaning of the term \u201ccarba-mide\u201d is distorted. One of the reasons for his holding was that in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, carbamide is defined as being synonymous with the word \u201curea.\u201d He then stated \u201cMelamine is not urea.\u201d The examiner pointed out that no examples were set forth in the specification to make clear the meaning of \u201curea derivatives\u201d and \u201csubstituted ureas,\u201d stating that the scope of the term \u201cderivative\u201d is dubious and that certain \u201csubstituted ureas\u201d such as tri-ethyl urea and tetra-ethyl urea do not form resins with formaldehyde. He, therefore, held the above quotation from the specification to be objectionable as placing a distorted meaning on the word \u201ccarbamide.\u201d By reason of those views he held claims 2 and 3 to be too indefinite, citing the case of In re Hegan, 97 F.2d 86, 25 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1182, to support his statement that \u201c* * * a definition in the specification which distorts the meaning of an accepted term renders the claims confusing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">From the decision rejecting claims 1, <em>2 </em>and 3 appeal was taken to the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Claims 4 to 14, inclusive, were rejected by the examiner as unpatentable over the patent to Jenett et al., supra, and the patent to Jennings, 2,334,199, November 16, 1943, and from his decision appellant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The Board of Appeals held that all of the claims were patentable over the prior art and allowed claims 1 and 4 to 14, inclusive. The examiner\u2019s decision was affirmed by the board with respect to claims 2 and 3 on the ground that they are indefinite and, therefore, do not define the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The issue here is whether or not the claims are indefinite and whether or not they do or do not define the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Appellant contends that a basis for a generic claim is contained in the specification in a recital of the resins he prefers as reaction products of formaldehyde with carbamides, such as urea, thiourea, melamine, urea derivatives and urea substitution products. He argues that in that language he had reference to a common property possessed by those named substances and that \u201c* * * there is little dispute that this property was the similarity of chemical structure and behavior.\u201d Therefore, he states, he properly used the indefinite article with the word \u201ccarbamide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">It is said by appellant that the word \"car-bamide\u201d is applied primarily to the isomer of urea and is' recognized as being the simplest in a series of homologues and that in his application appellant so used it.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">The tribunals below held \u201ccarbamide\u201d to be a term that does not relate to a group or series of compounds, but is confined <em>to </em>the single definite compound \u201curea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">Appellant in his brief states that the examiner, in his rejection on the ground of indefiniteness, relied on the dictionary definition of the word \u201ccarbamide\u201d and points-out that in the case of Application of Jones, 149 F.2d 501, 32 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1020, we held that in technical questions, such as this, standard textbook definitions are preferable to those found in general dictionaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">The Board of Appeals in its decision denying appellant\u2019s request for reconsideration-stated that according to the chemical textbooks available \u201ccarbamide\u201d is a definite individual compound and noted that appellant had cited no such authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">In order to sustain appellant\u2019s, contention that he is entitled to a generic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>claim, as aforesaid, such claim must accurately and definitely define his invention. In re Hegan, supra. Unless an invention is capable of accurate definition, it cannot be held to be patentable. United Carbon Co. et al. v. Binney &amp; Smith Co., 317 U.S. 228, 63 S.Ct. 165, 87 L.Ed. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Had appellant limited his claims to \u201ccar-bamide formaldehyde resin\u201d in all probability they would have been allowed, but in that event they would be specific to only one of the resins. Instead it may be noted that the claims call for \u201ca carbamide formaldehyde resin\u201d and if the recital in the specification heretofore quoted does not accurately define \u201ccarbamide resins\u201d the claims must be held to be indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In support of his position appellant quotes from Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201cCarbamid, <em>n. chem. </em>Urea or one of its isomers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201curea, <em>n. chem. </em>1. A very soluble colorless crystalline compound (CO(NH2)2)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">* * * 2. A derivative of urea.\u201d (Italics quoted)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">And from the Webster New Internationl Dictionary as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">\u201ccarbamide, <em>n. </em>Also -mid. <em>Chem. </em>Urea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">\u201curea, <em>n. Biochem. </em>a. A very soluble crystalline nitrogenous compound, CO(NH2)2. * * * \u2014 called also <em>carbamide * * </em>* b. Hence, any of various derivatives of the above compound: as, alkylated <em>meas. </em>(Italics quoted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Appellant stated that those definitions recognize the word \u201curea\u201d as having a broader meaning than a single specific chemical compound and, therefore, his use of the expression \u201ca carbamide,\u201d as called for in the claims, should not be objectionable. While he recognizes the rule that inadvertent granting of claims to one inventor is of itself not a reason for granting claims to another, citing the case of In re Engelhart, 40 F.2d 760, 17 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1244, he argues in his brief that \u201c* * * an established practice of the Patent Office evidenced by five or six freshly issued patents from the same art ought not be changed without strong reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">We find nothing in the record here which shows any \u201cestablished practice\u201d opposed to the reasoning in the decisions below. The examiner stated that in the case of Ex parte Clifford, 63 USPQ 19, an analogous question was involved. In that case it was sought to define the term \u201caliphatic\u201d in a manner to include compounds not normally considered to be \u201caliphatic.\u201d The board there held that to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">The examiner stated that it had been held by the Board of Appeals in an application, Serial No. 284,213, assigned to appellant\u2019s assignee and prosecuted by the same counsel as appears herein, the expression \u201ca carbamide\u201d was indefinite based on substantially the same definition as here. Counsel for appellant has not shown that statement to be inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-18\">While it is trite, as is contended here, to say that a patent specification may explain the language of the claim, it is incorrect, as pointed out by the solicitor in his brief, to say \u201c* * * the specification may distort a term to mean something it does not mean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">We do not think we would be justified in reversing the decision of the board in view of the fact that no standard work on chemistry has been cited to us, nor have we been able to find one which would support appellant\u2019s position, even though the dictionary definitions cited by him would seem to support his contention. According to available chemical authorities there is only one \u201ccarbamide\u201d and, accordingly, we are compelled to hold that claims 2 and 3 do not accurately define appellant\u2019s invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-21\">The decision appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-22\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
