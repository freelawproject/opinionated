It is not our function in this type of case to substitute our conclusions and inferences for those of the Tax Court. The facts and circumstances furnish a reasonable basis for the conclusion that body reached and there is no other clear-cut question of law upon which we are called to pass. The decision is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
