United States, 274 U.S. 220, <em>224, 47 </em>S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009; and the Court being of the opinion that the ruling of the trial Judge in overruling appellant\u2019s motion was not an abuse of such discretion. Compare United States v. Colonna, 3 Cir., 142 F.2d 210;</p>\n<p id=\"b923-24\">It is now ordered that the order of the District Court denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the plea of guilty is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
