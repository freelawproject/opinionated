We assume t-hat the petitioner means to bring a proceeding in habeas corpus, since certiorari would have no application in a case of this kind. The petition,, however, is addressed to this court, which; does not issue a writ of habeas corpus except in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. The petition for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, on the other hand, is addressed to the \u201cChief Justice and Justices\u201d of this-court.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-25\">The petitioner was unsuccessful in. his effort to get habeas corpus in the state court and in the court below, but he did not appeal. The district court declined to let him proceed in forma pauperis, and the petitioner\u2019s efforts to get habeas corpus from that court ended at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-26\">2. The petitioner has not exhausted his state remedies. He has not triedcoram nobis. He erroneously asserts that such writ is not open to him because \u201cthe errors set forth were known to the court at time judgment and sentence was [sic] pronounced.\u201d This is not correct. The peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>tioner pleaded guilty in the state court, and none of the points he now urges were raised, and therefore none were adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
