It was claimed in appellant\u2019s application that appellant had used its mark on its goods since June 5, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-22\">Appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u2014 \u201cArdena Feather-Light Foundation Cream \u2014 for use on face cream, was registered December 22, 1942, on an application filed May 13, 1941. It was claimed in appellee\u2019s application that appellee had used its mark on its goods since February 28, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-23\">Subsequent to the filing o\u00a3 appellee\u2019s application for registration of its mark, the Examiner of Trade-Marks required appel-lee to disclaim the words \u201cLight and \u201cFoundation Cream\u201d apart from the mark as shown, and it appears from appellee\u2019s registration that those words were disclaimed apart from the mark as shown, \u201cfor registration purposes only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-24\">Each of the parties relied upon its registration and no evidence was introduced by either.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-25\">It was conceded in appellant\u2019s answer to appellee\u2019s petition for cancellation that the goods of the respective parties possessed the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-26\">Each of the tribunals of the Patent Office held that as appellee was the first to file its application, and as its application was filed long prior to the filing date of appellant\u2019s application and appellant\u2019s record date of use, it was unnecessary that ap-pellee submit evidence other than his registration for the purpose of establishing its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>priority of use and its ownership of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In support of his holding, the Examiner of Interferences relied upon the case of Rosenberg Co. v. Phillips-Jones Co., Inc., 1921 C.D. 81, and General Baking Co. v. Commander-Larabee Corp., 82 F.2d 427, 23 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 973, and the commissioner relied upon the cases of Titus v. Burton &amp; Ciomei, 1921 C.D. 97, and General Baking Co. v. Commander-Larabee Corp., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Each of the tribunals of the Patent Office held that the notation \u201cFeather-Light\u201d is an essential part of appellee\u2019s mark; that \u201cFeather-Light\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark, and appellant\u2019s mark \u201cFeather Touch\" were capable of indicating origin of their respective goods; and that, as those terms were substantially identical in meaning, the marks of the parties were confusingly similar and, accordingly, sustained appellee\u2019s petition for cancellation of appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In his decision, the commissioner stated that, to paraphrase certain language in the case of Nehi Corporation v. House-Hold-Pac Corporation, 143 F.2d 613, 31 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1101, he was \u201cnot disposed to speculate at any great length upon the question of how petitioner\u2019s [appellee\u2019s] goods may be called for by purchasers.\u201d He further stated that \u201cIt seems entirely clear to me * * * that \u2018FeatherLight\u2019 is an essential element of petitioner\u2019s [appellee\u2019s] mark. And despite -respondent\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] <em>contention to the </em>contrary, proof of that fact was unnecessary, since it is a matter determinable from' mere inspection.\u201d In support of that statement, the commissioner cited the case of Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. The H. C. Godman Co., 119 F.2d 425, 28 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">It is argued here by counsel for appellant that as the respective registrations of the parties were. copending, and as appellant's registration was the first to be issued, it is entitled to a presumption of \u201cvalidity and non-conflict\u201d with appellee\u2019s registered trade-mark; that as the tribunals of the Patent Office failed to declare an interference between the applications of the parties, such failure is \u201cequivalent to a decision\u201d that the marks are not confusingly similar; that as appellee submitted no testimony to establish how its goods were called for by the purchasing public, it should be presumed that its goods would be called for <em>by its entire </em>mark \u201cArdena Feather-Light Foundation Cream\u201d; and that the holding of the tribunals of the Patent Office that the notation \u201cFeatherLight\u201d is an essential part of appellee\u2019s trade-mark and confusingly similar to appellant\u2019s mark \u201cFeather Touch\u201d is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">It is further argued by counsel for appellant that the word \u201cArdena\u201d is the dominant part of appellee\u2019s trade-mark and that the notation \u201cFeather-Light\u201d is merely descriptive of appellee\u2019s goods and, therefore, is not the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark. In support of the latter argument, counsel for appellant state that \u201cFeatherlight is one word\u201d; that \u201cAs the descriptive nature of a word cannot be destroyed by misspelling, the unity of some syllables of a word cannot be eliminated by placing a hyphen between the syllables\u201d; and that the word \u201cfeathery\u201d is synonymous with the word \u201clight,\u201d and the word \u201cfeatheriness\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as \u201ca state or quality of being feathery or light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Counsel for appellant have cited many cases by this and other courts which hold that a notation or term in a trade-mark which is merely descriptive of the goods on which the trade-mark is used, cannot indicate origin. It is unnecessary that we refer to those cases because this court has frequently held to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The claim made by counsel for appellant that the notation \u201cFeather-Light\u201d is one word and that it is descriptive of appellee\u2019s goods and that its descriptive nature cannot be destroyed by misspelling or by placing a hyphen between the syllables is, in our opinion, not <em>correctly </em>stating the facts. The notation \u201cFeather-Light,\u201d or as counsel for appellant puts it, \u201cFeatherlight\u201d is not an ordinary dictionary term. On the contrary, appellee has combined the term \u201cfeather,\u201d which standing alone has no significance as to weight, with the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201clight\u201d and has, therefore, coined an arbitrary word. Appellee\u2019s trade-mark does not contain the words \u201cfeathery\u201d or \u201cfea-theriness\u201d which counsel for appellant assert in their brief are descriptive and synonymous with \u201clight\u201d or has the \u201cquality of being feathery or light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">It is clear from the decisions of the tribunals of the Patent Office that they considered the notation \u201cFeather-Light,\u201d as tised in appellee\u2019s trade-mark, as highly suggestive but not merely descriptive of appellee\u2019s goods. On the record presented, we are unable to hold that the tribunals of the Patent Office erred in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We are in agreement with the tribunals of the Patent Office that as appellee was the first to file its application for registration. and that as its claimed first use set forth therein is long prior to the claimed first use in appellant\u2019s application, appellee\u2019s registration is prima facie proof that it was the owner of its registered mark. See Rosenberg Co. v. Phillips-Jones Co., Inc., supra, and General Baking Co. v. Commander-Larabee Corp., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We are also in agreement with the views expressed by the tribunals of the Patent Office that appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cFeather Touch,\u201d which is also highly suggestive of appellant\u2019s cream, is confusingly similar to the notation \u201cFeather-Light\u201d in appellee\u2019s trade-mark and that, considering the trade-marks of the parties as a whole, the concurrent use of the trade-marks of the respective parties on their goods would be likely to cause confusion in the minds of the public and deceive purchasers. In so holding, we have taken into consideration that the notation \u201cFeather-Light\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark is preceded by the word \u201cArdena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">In view of the fact that the notation \u201cFeather-Light\u201d has trade-mark significance, as used in appellee\u2019s mark, it is not of vital importance that the term \u201cLight\u201d has been disclaimed along with the words \u201cFoundation Cream.\u201d Nehi Corporation v. House-Hoid-Pac Corporation, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Furthermore, as stated in the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, the registiation of appellant\u2019s mark and the failure of appellee to file a notice of opposition to that registration does mot in any way affect the right of appellee to petition for cancellation of appellant\u2019s registration. Williams Oil-O-Matic Heating Corporation v. The Butler Co., 39 F.2d 693, <em>17 </em>C.C.P.A. (Patents) 934; White House Milk Products Co., etc. v. Dwinell-Wright Co., 111 F.2d 490, 27 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\"><em>On the </em>record presented, we are unable to hold that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the wrong conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b291-14\">BLAND, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">The majority\u2019s opinion is sound and properly affirms the clear and logical decision of First Assistant Commissioner Leslie Fr\u00e1zer. However, the following portion of the opinion is unnecessary in view of the fact that all agree that no part of the marks is descriptive:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Counsel for appellant have cited many cases by this and other courts which hold that a notation or term in a trade-mark which is merely descriptive of the goods on which the trade-mark is used cannot indicate origin. It is unnecessary that we refer to those cases because this court has frequently held to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">A great number of very valuable and well-known trade-marks are dearly descriptive of the goods upon which they are used and serve to indicate origin, some of them by reason of secondary meaning. While secondary meaning does not help an applicant for registration under the 1905 Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq., it is not quite proper to say that a part of a trade-mark which is descriptive cannot indicate origin. It may, to say the least, help to indicate origin. It is true, however, that this and other courts have used broad language in this connection and have not gone to the trouble of pointing out that there are exceptions to such a rule. I have in most cases dissented where a majority expressed such views. The Personal Products Corp. v. Allen Laboratories, Inc., 141 F.2d 702, 31 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 889, 894</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>It would be difficult to point out which part of the mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d, both being descriptive, indicates origin or helps to indicate origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The statement of the majority properly applies where a mark such as \u201cArrow Beans\u201d is involved, because \u201cBeans\u201d is not only descriptive but is the name of the goods and, of course, that portion of the mark does not indicate origin. But take the mark \u201cArrow-Line\u201d and apply it to goods like a line of shirts; the word \u201cLine\u201d, although descriptive, becomes an integral part of the mark and serves to indicate origin.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
