The application alleges that Pedigree \u201chas adopted and used the trade-mark * * * for Piece goods of rayon yarn.\u201d The mark for which registration was sought by appellee is the said word, \u201cPediglo,\u201d surrounded by a small rectangular background which also includes a number of small stars.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">The appellant, Vanity Fair Mills, Inc., hereinafter referred to as Vanity Fair, filed notice of opposition to the registration of the \u201cPediglo\u201d trade-mark, based upon its ownership and use, since 1931, of its mark, \u201cPechglo,\u201d which, as registered, was for \u201cknitted and textile underwear and hosiery for women and children \u2014 namely, vests, bloomers, knickerbockers, union suits, combination underwear, step-ins, chemises, corset covers, night gowns, pajamas, petticoats, princess slips, bandeaux, bandeaux chemises, and knitted and textile underwear for men \u2014 namely, union suits, shirts, and drawers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-18\">Pedigree alone took testimony, while Vanity Fair relied upon its filing date, July 25, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-19\">The testimony shows that the \u201cPediglo\u201d mark is used by Pedigree upon piece goods made of a \u201cduPont\u201d acetate yarn. The application broadly provides for its use on piece goods of rayon yarn. Vanity Fair\u2019s garments and articles of wearing apparel upon which the \u201cPechglo\u201d mark is used are stated in its registration to be \u201cknitted and textile\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-20\">The record also shows that the word \u201cPediglo\u201d is a coined word, alleged to have been derived from a contraction of the word \u201cPedigree\u201d to which the term \u201cglo\u201d is added; that Pedigree does a very large business in piece goods and also in \u201cthe best in woven intimate lingerie\u201d; that the woven, rayon, or other piece goods sold under the trade-mark \u201cPediglo\u201d are, after purchase from Pedigree, made up into various garments such as blouses, dresses, negligees, men\u2019s apparel, infants\u2019 wear and numerous other items; and that Pedigree has a number of so-called \u201cPedi\u201d trademarks used on different kinds of \u201cPedigree fabrics\u201d such as \u201cPedicrepe,\u201d \u201cPedicrest,\u201d \u201cPedicharm,\u201d and \u201cPediswish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-21\">The Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences, among other things, held' that the goods of the respective parties were of the same descriptive properties, that Vanity Fair was senior in use of its \u201cPechglo\u201d mark, and that \u201cthe resemblances between the marks of the parties greatly predominate over the differences and are such that their concurrent use upon goods of the kind specified would be likely to cause confusion in trade and deception of purchasers.\u201d He sustained the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-22\">First Assistant Commissioner of Patents Leslie Frazer reversed the holding of the examiner of interferences, and from the commissioner\u2019s decision (66 U.S.P.Q. 486) Vanity Fair appeals here.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>There is but one question presented here and that relates to the similarity of the marks and the goods and the likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">No great array of authorities need be cited here to the effect that it is well-settled trade-mark law that not orily are fabi'ic piece goods which are afterwards made up into garments of the same descriptive properties as fabric garments, but that, under most circumstances, confusion would grow out of the concurrent use of similar trade-marks on those two kinds of merchandise. See Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co. v. Industrial Undergarment Corporation, 152 F.2d 1011, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 813; Celanese Corporation of America v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 154 F.2d 146, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Pedigree argues that the goods being different and the marks being dissimilar and there being no proof of confusion in six years\u2019 concurrent use of the respective marks, the conclusion that confusion might result is not warranted. It argues that its mark is a three-syllable mark while Vanity Fair\u2019s is a two-syllable one, and cites certain cases which hold, xxnder certain circumstances, that the first part of a trademark consisting of more than one syllable or word is more likely to indicate origin than the last part of such trade-mark, and urges that there is little resemblance in sound or meaning between \u201cPedi\u201d and \u201cPech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The commissioner, in part, stated: \u201c \u2018Ped-iglo\u2019 is a three-syllable word, while \u2018Pech-glo\u2019 has only two syllables. The last syllable is the same in both, but otherwise they have no similarity in sound or significance, and as displayed in the application and the registration they have but slight resemblance in appearance * *</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The term \u201cPech\u201d is said to come from the French word, \u201cpeche,\u201d meaning the fruit, peach, and is pronounced \u201cp\u00e9ch\u201d as if it were spelled \u201cpesh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The endings of the two trade-max'ks are identical, and the term \u201cglo\u201d is quite suggestive of the character of the goods. Each of the words begins with \u201cPe.\u201d \u201cPed\u201d and \u201cPesh\u201d have a similar sound. So in both appearance and sound the marks are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">While the composite \u201cPediglo\u201d mark must be considered as a whole, it is obvious that that part of the mark which would indicate origin is the word \u201cPediglo\u201d and that the other elements of the mark are not sufficiently conspicuous to detract from the importance of the word \u201cPedi-glo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">We do not look upon the question of the likelihood of confusion in this case as a close one. When the goods of the respective parties are referred to as \u201cPechglo\u201d and \u201cPediglo\u201d it seems to us that there can be little doubt that confusion would probably result, and if there were any doubts on the question, they should be resolved against the newcomer. As has been said often, the field is broad from which to select a trade-mark to indicate the origin in its owner without invading fields preempted by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">As to Pedigree\u2019s contention that similarities in the beginnings of trade-marks are more important than similarities in their endings, it is sufficient to say that this depends entirely upon the character of the mark. In this connection we might consider the various \u201cRose\u201d marks with reference to whiskey and many other well-known marks which need not be listed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">The commissioner relied upon the decision of this court in the case of Puerto Rico Distilling Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 120 F.2d 370, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1143, which involved the trade-max'ks \u201cRonricola\u201d and \u201cCoca-Cola.\u201d We there held, by a divided court, that there was no likelihood of confusion and the commissioner\u2019s decision sustaining the opposition to the registration of the mark \u201cRonricola\u201d was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">The facts in that case are so wholly different from those in the instant case that it certainly affords no basis for the conclusion reached by the commissioner herein. We think he properly cited that case, however, as one of the many decisions of this court where the rule was stated that specific differences of goods, evexx though the goods were of the same general description or character, should be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>into consideration in determining the question of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">After taking into consideration the differences in the goods and marks of the respective parties hereto we think there is such similarity in both as to justify the conclusion that the registration applied for by Pedigree should be denied, and the commissioner\u2019s decision dismissing the opposition of Vanity Fair is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
