For, under that complaint, the plaintiff was not entitled to de.mand a jury, since the relief he then sought was exclusively \u201cin equity,\u201d so that there was then no \u201cissue triable of right by a jury.\u201d When, by amending his complaint, he abandoned his prayer for such \u201cequitable\u201d relief, he then, for the first tim.e, was in a position to demand a jury, for only then did there come into being an issue \u201ctriable of right by a j-qry.\u201d He made his demand well within ten days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Defendant seems to suggest that tlie Rules have completely obliterated, for substantive as well as procedural purposes, the historic differences between \u201claw\u201d and \u201cequity.\u201d We cannot agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Those who favor it should have in mind that such obliteration, as to substantive rules, might deprive us of the inestimably valuable flexibility and capacity for growth and adaption to newly emerging problems which the principles of equity have supplied in our legal system. The procedural merger is undoubtedly desirable. A transplanted civilian, however, has shown us the djsadvantages of a system in which \u201claw\u201d and \u201cequity\u201d are fused not only as to procedure but also as to substantive rules ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and another writer has pointed to the danger that, if the courts are not watchful, the procedural fusion may cause a hardening of equity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in its substantive aspects. But our decision here involves no issue of \u201csubstantive\u201d equity.<footnotemark>3a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">We consider inapposite Clark v. Wooster, 119 U.S. 322, 328, <em>7 </em>S.Ct. 217, 30 L.Ed. 392, and Rice &amp; Adams Corporation v. Lathrop, 278 U.S. 509, 515, 49 S.Ct. 220, 73 L.Ed. 480. For, in each of those cases, the defendant \u2014 not the plaintiff\u2014 sought to have the action discontinued in equity after the patent had expired, although suit had been begun before that expiration; consequently, as the plaintiff had not elected to substitute a' law action for his equity action, the court, which had originally obtained equity \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d had discretion to retain such \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d It is of no moment that we believe that trial by a jury of a patent suit is usually undesirable, since it is well settled that such a trial may be demanded where the sole claim is for money, if the demand be timely, as we hold it was here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>There can be no doubt of our power in such a case to issue a writ of mandamus, as it is in aid of our appellate jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The writ will issue directing the respondent to vacate the order striking the jury demand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\"> In Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 317 U.S. 188, 63 S.Ct. 163, 87 L.Ed. 176, the Court refused so to agree even aa to one procedural matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> Pekelis, Legal Techniques and Political Ideologies, 41 Mich.Law R. (1943) 665, 689, 691. Pekelis writes: \u201cIf someone were compelled to explain the essence of civil law to a common lawyer in one sentence, he could perhaps say that civil law is what common law would have been if it had never known a court of chancery. * * * The picture of conflicting and coexisting jurisdictions is * * \u2019* inconceivable to a Latin or even a German lawyer, who believes in * * * the uncompromising and sometimes cruel unity of the legal order.\u201d See also Pokelis, Administrative Discretion and The Rule of Law, 10 Social Research (1943) 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">Cf. Holdsworth, History of English Law, I (3d Ed. 1922) 449: \u201cThe Roman praetor urbanus administered both law and equity; and therefore it was easier to fuse the two systems: the Chancellor and the common law judges were distinct and often rival authorities. Thus Justinian could effect what the English Judicature Acts could not effect. He fused law and equity: they, for the most part, <em>only fused the courts which administered law and equity\u2019' </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-18\"> Emmerglick, A Century of The New Equity, 23 Tex.L.R. (1945) 244. He points, inter alia, to the fact that, after the procedural fusion in England, an English judge, sitting in the Chancery Division, said, \u201cThis Court is not a Court of conscience * * * \u201d.

(1905) 1, 25, 29, noted the enactment of the fusion statutes as one of the causes of equity\u2019s decadence. See also Stone (later Chief Justice Stone), Book Review, 18 Col.L.R. (1918) 97; cf. Bord-well, The Resurgence of Equity, 1 Un. of Chi. L. R. (1934) 741, 750.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3a\">\n<p id=\"b554-22\"> The wording of the federal statute authorizing fusion can leave no doubt that it was not intended to affect \u201csubstantive\u201d rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b554-23\"> Plaintiff\u2019s shift to a \u201claw\u201d action is here peculiarly justifiable, as the long delay, during which his patent expired, resulted 'from compliance with the suggestion of the Judge Advocate General. But we do not rest our decision on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b555-17\"> See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 377; Ex parte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 63 S.Ct. 793, 87 L.Ed. 1014; U.
