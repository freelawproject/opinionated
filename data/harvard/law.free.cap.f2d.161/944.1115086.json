The matter has to do with the registration statement covering a proposed offering of a new issue of securities by a corporation subject to the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77a et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">Section 5(a) makes it unlawful for any person to use the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or the mails, to sell a security \u201cunless a registration statement is in effect\u201d as to such security, upon pain of civil liability as provided in \u00a7 12(1) and criminal liability as provided in \u00a7 24. These sanctions are applicable whether or not the sale is effected by means of misrepresentation or misleading non-disclosure of material facts. Sections 6 and 7 prescribe the formalities of executing and filing a registration statement and the information required to be disclosed therein. Section 8(a) prescribes the procedure for putting a registration statement \u201cin effect\u201d : \u201cSec. 8. (a) Except as hereinafter provided, the effective date of a registration statement shall be the twentieth day after the filing thereof or such earlier date as the Commission may determine, having due regard to the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, to the facility with which the nature of the securities to be registered, their relationship to the capital structure of the issuer and the rights of holders thereof can be understood, and to the public interest and the protection of investors. If any amendment to any such statement is filed prior to the effective date of such statement, the registration statement shall be deemed to have been filed when such amendment was filed; except that an amendment filed with the consent of the Commission, prior to the effective date of the registration statement, or filed pursuant to an order of the Commission, shall be treated as a part of the registration statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-18\">It will be observed that under \u00a7 8 (a) a registration statement automatically becomes effective upon the lapse of twenty days after the issuer has filed the original statement with the Commission, or, if amendments to the statement are filed before it becomes effective, then the effective date is twenty days after the filing of the last amendment. In two ways the Commission may shorten the twenty-day waiting period: (1) It \u201cmay determine\u201d that the effective date shall be sooner than twenty days after the filing of the statement. (2) An amendment filed \"with the consent of the Commission\u201d is to be treated as part of the original registration statement, thus avoiding the necessity of a fresh twenty-day waiting period after the date of the filing of such amendment. In so far as the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>mission may take accelerating action under \u00a7 8(a), such action is ex parte merely; no provision is made for notice or hearing in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">However, the Commission has power to delay or suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement. Under \u00a7 8(b), if it appears to the Commission that a registration statement is on its face incomplete or inaccurate, the Commission \u201cmay\u201d, after notice to the issuer and opportunity for hearing, \u201cissue an order prior to the effective date of registration refusing to permit such statement to become effective until it has been amended in accordance with such order.\u201d Under \u00a7 8(d), if it appears to the Commission \u201cat any time\u201d that a registration statement contains a material misrepresentation or is misleading because of non-disclosure of a material fact, the Commission \u201cmay\u201d, after notice to the issuer and opportunity for hearing, \u201cissue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.\u201d Both \u00a7 8(b) and \u00a7 8(d) thus contemplate a quasi-judicial proceeding, upon notice and hearing, culminating in an \u201corder\u201d which is reviewable as provided in \u00a7 9(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Failure of the Commission to delay the effectiveness of a registration statement by action under \u00a7 8(b), or failure of the Commission to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement by a stop order under \u00a7 8(d), is not, in either case, to be deemed a finding by the Commission that the registration statement is true and accurate or to be held to mean that the Commission has passed upon the merits of, or given approval to, such security. It is explicitly so provided in \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Any person who sells a security in interstate commerce by means of an untrue or misleading statement of material facts in a prospectus or oral communication is subject to civil liability under \u00a7 12(2), and to criminal penalties as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 24. These sanctions are applicable whether or not a registration statement has been filed or has become effective. Civil liabilities on account of a false registration statement which has become effective are spelled out in great detail in \u00a7 11. Criminal penalties for willfully making a material misrepresentation in a registration statement are contained in \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">The Commission is given powers of investigation under \u00a7 20(a) whenever it shall appear to the Commission, either upon complaint or otherwise, that the provisions of the Act have been or are about to be violated. Under \u00a7 20(b) the Commission is authorized to apply to a proper court for an injunction to restrain such violation. Under \u00a7 20(c) the Commission may obtain a writ of mandamus commanding compliance with the provisions of the Act or of an order of the Commission thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Burrillville Racing Association, hereinafter referred to as the issuer, is a Rhode Island corporation engaged in the business of conducting horse racing meetings in Burrillville, Rhode Island. On February 27, 1947, the issuer filed a registration statement for 38,500 shares of class A stock to be offered for the purpose of providing funds to complete the construction of a new racing plant. Pending examination of the registration statement by the Commission\u2019s staff, the issuer filed amendments on various dates between March 17 and April 23, 1947. Some of these amendments were pursuant to suggestions by the Commission\u2019s staff, after consideration of objections made by the present petitioner in informal consultation with members of the staff and in memoranda submitted by him. Petitioner\u2019s several requests for a \u201chearing\u201d were denied by the Commission. Upon consideration of the registration statement, of the memoranda submitted by the petitioner, and of the amendments on file, the Commission determined, as appears from a minute of the Commission\u2019s meeting of April 3, 1947, that a stop order proceeding would be detrimental to the interests of investors. However, petitioner was invited to submit any additional information or data having a bearing upon the problems involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Upon filing the last amendment on April 23, 1947, the issuer requested the Commission to accelerate the effective date, as provided in \u00a7 8(a). On April 28, 1947, the Commission entered an \u201cOrder Consenting to Filing of Amendments to Registration Statement\u201d, which recited that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>mission \u201chereby consents to the filing\u201d of the various amendments, and f\u00farther stated as follows: \u201cThe records of the Commission show February <em>27, </em>1947, as the official filing date and that said Registration Statement, as amended, became Effective at 5:15 P.M. Eastern Daylight Saving Time, April 28, 1947, as of 5:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, March 18, 1947.\u201d This is the \u201corder\u201d which the pending petition seeks to have us review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Upon leave obtained from a judge of this court, Burrillville Racing Association has intervened in the case. It has filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that it appears from the face of the petition that petitioner is not in his own right a person aggrieved by the. order of the Commission. A separate motion to dismiss, filed by the Commission, is based upon the ground that the order in question is not reviewable. We think that the motions to dismiss should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The only allegation of the petition, as amended, purporting to qualify Crooker as a party aggrieved is the following: \u201cYour petitioner files this petition as an aggrieved party as an individual citizen within the provisions of paragraph 2, section 2 of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended; and under the provisions of Paragraph a, Section 9 of said Act, and as attorney for bondholders and stockholders of Burrillville Racing Association, a racing association incorporated under the laws of the State of Rhode Island, and the petitioner, as set forth in petitioner\u2019s Exhibit b and c, attached to said petition, has hitherto made objection before the \u00a1Commission against the action of the Commission herein brought before this Honorable Court for review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Petitioner is no doubt a \u201cperson\u201d within the inclusive definition of \u00a7 2(2) ; but it does not appear that he is, in his own right, a person \u201caggrieved\u201d by the action of the Commission. Petitioner\u2019s standing in this court is by no means aided by the fact that, in the course of the informal administrative screening of the registration statement, members of the Commission\u2019s staff consulted with him and examined his memoranda setting forth objections to the statement. Cf. Pittsburgh &amp; West Virginia R. Co. v. United States, 1930, 281 U.S. 479, 486, 50 S.Ct. 378, 74 L.Ed. 980. The Commission of course was at liberty to consult with anybody who might have relevant data to present. Nor have we been referred to any authority sustaining the contention that an attorney may file a petition for review in his own name, as agent for undisclosed principals alleged to be persons aggrieved. The petition does not even allege that the clients for whom petitioner is acting are resident within the First Circuit or have their principal places of business therein, absent which, this court is not the proper forum for review. Petitioner declined to disclose to the Commission the identity of the persons for whom he claimed to act, nor has he made such disclosure to the court. At a hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion for a stay of the order pending review, petitioner stated that his clients were unwilling to have their names disclosed because they feared some political reprisal in Rhode Island if their identities became known. Assuming, though we doubt it very much, that this court would have power to entertain a petition for review filed on behalf of an unnamed person, upon a confidential disclosure to the court of his identity, together with an adequate showing of his standing as a person aggrieved, and a further showing that his apprehension of possible reprisals rested on a substantial foundation, no such extraordinary showing has been made or offered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\"> Furthermore, we agree with the Commission that the order in question is not reviewable under \u00a7 9(a) of the Act. It is called an \u201corder\u201d by the Commission, but it might just as well have been called a \u201ccertificate\u201d evidencing consent to the filing of amendments to the registration statement. Indeed, it need not have been called anything, but its recitals might have been left to speak for themselves. Section 8(a) of the Act does not require the Commission to give notice and opportunity for hearing before giving consent to the filing of an amendment; it does not even require that this consent be manifested in any particular way, by an \u201corder\u201d or otherwise. Section 9(a) provides that the \u00a1Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>upon being served with a copy of the petition for review, shall thereupon \u201ccertify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. No objection to the order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission. The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d These provisions are obviously inapplicable to the present situation. The action taken by the Commission was not based upon any formal proceeding, in which evidence was taken. No findings of fact have been made, nor were such findings required by \u00a7 8(a). If this court should undertake to review the action by the Commission in consenting to the filing of the amendments and thus, by the automatic operation of \u00a7 8(a), accelerating the effective date of the registration statement, we would be taking upon ourselves a purely administrative function confided to the Commission. In addition to that, a registration statement becomes effective in any event after the lapse of twenty days from the filing of the last amendment. This brief period would necessarily have elapsed before the petition for review could be heard and disposed of by this court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The petition, in addition to asking us to set aside the so-called \u201corder\u201d of April 28, 1947, consenting to the filing of the amendments, asks us to grant leave to the petitioner \u201cto adduce additional evidence before the Commission in objection to said registration application and especially in rebuttal of the Applicant\u2019s latest amendment of said registration statement.\u201d This prayer would seem to imply that there has already been some administrative proceeding at which evidence has been' introduced upon which the \u201corder\u201d complained of was based. As already stated, there has been no such proceeding. If the intent of this prayer is to obtain from this court a decree directing the Commission to institute a proceeding under \u00a7 8(d) looking toward a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement, it is clear that no such power is conferred upon this court. The language of \u00a7 8(d) is permissive merely, conferring administrative discretion upon the Commission to institute such a proceeding \u201cif it appears to the Commission\u201d that a registration statement is false or misleading. Cf. Jacobsen v. National Labor Relations Board, 3 Cir., 1941, 120 F.2d 96, 99, 100. For the same reason we are without power to direct the Commission, at the instance of a private petitioner, to make an investigation under \u00a7 20(a) or to institute injunction proceedings under \u00a7 20(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">An order will be entered dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
