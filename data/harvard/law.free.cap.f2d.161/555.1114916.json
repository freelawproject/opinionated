Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 811. The answer of the Commissioner placed in issue both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">The Tax Cpurt decided only the first issue, holding that the transfer was not made in contemplation of death, a decision not questioned here by the Commissioner. It failed to pass upon the second issue, which was stated by the estate in its opening statement of its trial brief, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">\u201c(b) To take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">\u201cThe Commissioner also ruled that the transfers of the Parke, Davis and American Radiator stock were to be included in the. estate because they were to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">\u201cPetitioner contends that the transfers took immediate effect; that they did not take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of Mrs. Stinchfield; that when the transfers were made on September 15, 1930 they were completed transfers; that there was no reservation, right of re-verter, retention by or any string whatever to Mrs. Stinchfield; no contingency existed on which the stock would revert to her.\u201d because it deemed the briefs filed by the Commissioner did not resist this contention. There was no written or verbal withdrawal of contention (b). The briefs are in the record here and we think they do not show the Commissioner\u2019s abandoned resistance to the issue of the taxability of the gift of the shares he decided to be one to take effect in the possession or enjoyment of the donees at or after death.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">The Commissioner after the Tax Court\u2019s decision moved for a reconsideration and determination of issue (b). We think the Tax Court erred in denying it. The Su-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>reme Court has reversed the Tax Court on an issue not presented below and advanced by the Commissioner for the first time on appeal. Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 556, 61 S.Ct. 719, 85 L.Ed. 1037. In Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., the Supreme Court in overruling two of its prior tax decisions stated of the \u201cconclusion\u201d on which they were based, \u201cIn the light of the expanding needs of state and nation, the inquiry has been pressed whether this conclusion has adequate basis; * * *.\u201d Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, 384, 58 S.Ct. 623, 626, 82 L.Ed. 907. Certainly the expanding needs for revenue of State and Natiqn have not declined since this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The case was tried on the testimony of witnesses heard by the Tax Court\u2019s judge. Since it is the intent of Congress that such an issue of fact should be first determined by the Tax Court, we reverse its final determination that the shares be not included in the decedent\u2019s estate and remand the case to that court with instructions to make such determination. Diller v. Commissioner, <em>9 </em>Cir., 91 F.2d 194, 195 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
