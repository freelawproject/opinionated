The complaint undertakes to describe several episodes. Though it characterizes appellees\u2019 alleged conduct as wrongful, unlawful, and malicious, it does not sufficiently disclose the conduct to enable a court to judge whether or not it was tortious.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">The complaint shows that appellant and appellees were army officers. It may be that an official privilege covers the whole case, but we have no occasion to decide that broad question.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
