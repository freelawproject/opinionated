Zieber pleaded not guilty, was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years. He has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Zieber, a member of the sect known as \u201cJehovah\u2019s witnesses\u201d, registered under the Selective Training and Service Act on December 24, 1942 with Local Draft Board No. 2 in Berks County, Pennsylvania, on his eighteenth birthday. On January 29, 1943 he returned his questionnaire asserting that he was a minister of religion. He stated that he was employed secularly as a paint filler with the Glidden Company of Reading but that he was forced to engage in this secular employment in order to support his mother, an invalid. He claimed exemption as a minister of religion and requested classification as IV-D. He asserted also that he was a conscientious objector and shortly after returning his questionnaire filled out form 47 and filed it with the Board. He was given a physical examination, was found to be unfit for training, and on March 11, 1943 he was' classified IV-F. He was reclassified II-B(F) on August 28, 1944 after the Board had received form 42-A filed by the Glidden Company stating that Zieber was engaged in war work and was employed in an essential industry. Zieber remained in this deferred classification for about a year. He was then given another physical examination and on being found physically fit he was reclassified IV-E on August 13, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">On August 21, 1945 Zieber appeared at the office of the Board and presented a document about 20 pages in length entitled \u201cWritten Argument\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this he set forth reasons why he should be classified IV-D, as a minister of religion and not IV-E as a conscientious objector. He was notified that the Board rejected this claim. On August 21, 1945 he filed a written request for an opportunity for personal appearance before the Board and was granted permission to appear on August 27, 1945. On that day he appeared before the Board. The clerk of the Board stated at the trial that on that occasion Zieber talked about his case for more than 45 minutes; that during this time the members listened to and heard everything that he had to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Zieber testified that at his appearance before the Board on August 27 he was permitted to testify or to talk for not more than 4 or 5 minutes; that he endeavored to inform the Board as to certain facts relating to his ministry and the practice among the congregations of Jehovah\u2019s witnesses; for example, that he wanted to tell the Board what his duties as assistant presiding minister of the Kutztown congregation were, but that he was not permitted to testify in respect to any of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">It is clear that on August 27, 1945, the day of Zieber\u2019s personal appearance, the Board was confused as to the status of Zieber\u2019s case. It is apparent from the testimony of the clerk and that of the chairman that whether the Board listened to Zieber for 45 minutes or for only 4 or 5 minutes, it did not consider his testimony in determining his classification because the members were of the opinion that, he had appealed <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his case when he filed with the Board the \u201cWritten Argument\u201d, hereinbefore referred to. If the filing of this document was in fact deemed by the Board to constitute an appeal (as seems to have been the case) it is difficult to see why Zieber\u2019s request for a personal appearance should have been granted by the Board on August 24 or why he should have been heard at all on August 27. But nothing contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201cWritten Argument\u201d, requests an appeal or makes any reference to an appeal. The Board was not entitled to treat it as an appeal and the analogy now attempted to be drawn by the appellee between the contents of Zieber\u2019s \u201cWritten Argument\u201d and those of the appeal made by Tung in Chih Chung Tung v. United States, 1 Cir., 142 F.2d 919, is far-fetched.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">It is at this point that' the first serious difficulty arises in the appellee\u2019s case. Subparagraph (b) of Selective Service Regulations \u00a7 625.2 provides that at a personal appearance the registrant may \u201cpresent such further information as he believes will assist the local board in determining his proper classification.\u201d The regulation cited also states, that \u201cSuch information shall be in writing or, if oral, shall be summarized in writing and, in either event, shall be placed in the registrant\u2019s file.\u201d It will be observed that that portion of the regulation first quoted employs the words \u201cfurther information\u201d. If Zieber furnished \u201cfurther information\u201d at his personal appearance the Board was required to reduce Zieber\u2019s oral statement to writing and place the transcript in his cover sheet or file. If Zieber sought to furnish \u201cfurther information\u201d and was not permitted by the Board to supply it, he was denied a right afforded him by the regulation. Whether he did present new information or did endeavor to present new information became important questions of fact to be determined by the jury at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Subparagraph (c) .of the regulation last referred to provides that after the registrant has appeared before his local board the \u201cboard shall consider the new information\u201d arid \u201cshall again classify the registrant in the same manner as if he had never been classified * * * If Zeiber furnished no new information the Board was not required, to classify him again. If he did furnish new information the Board was required to classify him as if he had never been classified. If he was prevented by the Board from presenting new information the Board was required to give him an .opportunity to present it and if the-Board did not afford Zieber this opportunity, it denied him a right required by the regulation. Here, again, occur the same-important questions of fact for the determination of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The question of the correctness of Zie-ber\u2019s classification did go to the Appeal Board. Just how it got to the Appeal Board<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, is not entirely clear from the record, but. apparently the Local Board did treat-Zieber\u2019s \u201cWritten Argument\u201d as an appeal' and did send Zieber\u2019s cover sheet or file-te the Appeal Board. The latter body passed upon Zieber\u2019s classification de novo-on the basis of the contents of Zieber\u2019s. cover sheet or file. The cover sheet or-\u00edlle did not of course contain any written! transcript of what'Zieber stated to the Local Board at the time of his personal appearance on August 27. If Zieber didl offer \u201cfurther or new information\u201d at his-personal appearance before the Board,, that information should have been reduced, to writing and included in Zieber\u2019s cover sheet and would have been before the Appeal Board when it considered the appeal' in Zieber\u2019s case. But, if Zieber offered no-new or further information on August <em>27 </em>what he said on that occasion would not have had to be reduced to writing or included in his file for the consideration of the Appeal Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u25a0 If Zieber endeavored' to offer new or further information and) was prevented from doing so by the Appeal. Board, he was denied a right given him by the regulation. Here, again, appear the-same fundamental questions o'f .fact for the determination of the jury at Zieber\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">If the Local Board did refuse, to consider new or further information offered by Zieber and to include it in his cover sheet and to consider it in classifying him after it had been offered, or if the Local Board refused to receive new or further information which Zieber endeavored to offer to it, we think it is clear that he was denied due process of law. Moreover, a failure by the Local Board to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the duties imposed upon it by the Selective Training and Service Act and the regulations could not have been cured by the de novo consideration of Zieber\u2019s classification by the Appeal Board if material which should have been included by the Local Board in Zieber\u2019s file was not included so that the Appeal Board could consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Whether a selectee has or has not been afforded due process of law by the Selective Service agencies, there being disputed fundamental questions of fact as in the case at bar, should have been determined by the jury under proper instructions from the court. If the jury had believed that Zieber had given new or further information to his Local Board or had endeavored to give new or further information to the Board and had been prevented from doing so by the action of the Board, under a proper charge from the trial judge the jury could and should have found Zieber not guilty of failing to comply with the order of the Local Board to entrain for work of national importance. Zieber was not under a duty to comply with an illegal order. The court below did not present the important questions of fact, hereinbefore outlined, to the jury for its determination or instruct the jury that action of the Local Board contrary to the Act or regulations \u201cwould be lawless and beyond its jurisdiction\u201d. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 121, 66 S.Ct. 423, 427. The court\u2019s charge did not deal with these essential points.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"> The learned Judge in fact charged the jury that if the members of the Local Board \u201cendeavored honestly and fairly to comply with\u201d the provisions of the Selective Training and Service Act and the applicable regulations \u201cthen the fact that they may have made errors could not be complained of in the courts\u201d. He went on to say that \u201cIt would be no defense to an indictment that they had honestly made a mistake, because if they honestly <em>made a </em>mistake then it was the duty of the registrant to obey that order and to report for induction and be inducted.\u201d This statement of law is incorrect. Good faith and honest intention on the part of the Local Board is not enough. There must be full and fair compliance with the provisions of the Act and the applicable regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The judgment of conviction will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\"> Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\"> Selective Service Regulation 027.11 provides that an appeal to a board of appeal shall be taken \u201cBy filing with the local board a written notice of appeal. Such notice need not be in any particular form but must state the name of the registrant and the name and identity of the person appealing so as to show the right of .appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\"> It will be observed that Zieber had no appeal to the President for the actions of both the Local Board and the Board were unanimous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
