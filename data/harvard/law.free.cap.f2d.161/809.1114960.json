It involves a deficiency in declared value excess profits tax for the year 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-31\">The Commissioner determined that the petitioner had failed to elect, in a capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>stock tax return filed before the expiration of the statutory filing period- (July 31, 1940), to declare a value for its capital stock, under \u00a7 1202(e), Internal Revenue Code, as added by \u00a7 301 of the Revenue Act of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 1202(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The evidence in behalf of the petitioner established that the requisite \u00a1return and election were enclosed in an envelope, properly addressed to the Collector\u2019s office at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with proper postage duly affixed thereto, and deposited in the United States mail at Tulsa, Oklahoma, in time to have been received by the Collector, in the ordinary course of mail, within- the statutory filing period. The Commissioner introduced evidence as to the careful method of handling mail received by the Collector\u2019s office in Oklahoma- City, from which it could have been inferred that the return and election were not received through the mail by the Collector\u2019s office. The Tax Court did not find that the return was not filed within the statutory period. It merely held that the presumption of delivery was insufficient to 'overcome the presumption of correctness of the Commissioner\u2019s determination. We think the Tax Court fell into an error of law. The presumption of the correctness of the Commissioner\u2019s finding is one of law. It is not an inference of fact. It disappears when evidence, sufficient to sustain a contrary finding, has been introduced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">When mail matter is properly addressed and deposited in the United States mails, with postage duly prepaid thereon, there is a rebuttable presumption of fact that it was received by the addressee in the ordinary course of mail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The presumption of receipt is a strong one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A finding in opposition to such inference of fact, absent evidence of nonreceipt, is against the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Proof of due mailing is prima facie evidence of receipt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">It follows that the proof of regular mailing, in time to reach the Collector, in due course of mail, within the statutory filing period, was sufficient to support a finding that the return was timely filed; that the presumption of correctness attached to the Commissioner\u2019s finding vanished; and that the issue was for decision wholly on the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>The cause is reversed with instructions to the Tax Court to determine the issue of fact and to give no weight to the presumption of correctness of the Commissioner\u2019s finding.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-10\"> Hemphill Schools, Inc., v.
