Insurers can not defeat an action on a policy of insurance issued by them, by the objection that a magistrate\u2019s certificate required thereby was never served on them, after they had received and examined other proofs of loss presented by the insured, and stated in answer t\u00f3 subsequent inquiries On his part whether there were any further proofs that ho could show, or any thing further was wanted of him, that there was not, and offered to compromise the claim, without any objection to the proofs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-8\">2. when a Motion to dismiss the comp\u00edaint in su\u00f3h case' at the trial, placed solely upon the ground that the papers served on the defendants were not in compliance with tho terms of the policy is denied, no objection can be raised on appeal by the insurers against such denial, that the person on whom a magistrate\u2019s certificate required by the policy was served, was not the authorized agent of the defendants to receive it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-9\">8. A chattel mortgage given upon goods covered by a policy of insurance upon a stock of merchandise, including goods sold but not delivered, without parting with their possession or the right of possession thereto, will not avoid such policy, although one of its printed conditions provides that \u201c in case of any transfer or termination of the interest of the insured in the property, by sale or otherwise * * * the policy shall be void; and.\u201cthat in case of any sale, alienation, transfer or change of title in the property insured * * * or of any individual interest therein, such insurance shall be void; and the entry of a foreclosure of a mortgage, or the levy of an execution, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors, shall be deemed an alienation of the property.\u201d The meaning of the words \u201c sale, alienation or transfer \u201d in such condition is to be confined to acts which absolutely divest the title of the insured.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b79-10\">(Before Bosworth, Ch.

Property on storage must be separately and specifically insured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">If the. interest in property to be insured be a <em>leasehold, </em>or any other interest not <em>absolute, </em>or if it be equitable, it must be so represented to the company in writing, with the true title of the insured and the extent of his interest, and so expressed in the policy in writing, otherwise the insurance shall be void, And this policy shall not be construed to protect the interest of any person not named herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-10\"><em>[Note.] </em>By\u2018property held in trust\u2019 is intended property held under a deed of trust, or under the appointment of a court of law or equity, or property held as collateral security; in which latter case, this company shall be liable only to the extent of the interest of the assured in such property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-11\">IV. This policy, or any claim arising under it, shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged or sold, either before or after a loss, without the consent of the company, expressed by indorsement made thereon. In case of assignment, transfer, pledge or sale, without such consent, whether of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>policy, or of any interest in it, the liability of the company, present and future, shall then cease. And the company reserves the right to elect, either to consent to a transfer before a loss, or return a ratable proportion of the premium and cancel the policy. And in case of any sale, alienation, transfer or change of title in the property insured by this company, or of any undivided interest therein, such insurance shall be void and cease. And the entry of a foreclosure of a mortgage, or the levy of an execution, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors, shall be deemed an alienation of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">In case of claim for loss or damage on a policy assigned, where there is no act\u00faal sale or transfer of the property insured, proofs of loss shall be made by the assured, in. conformity with the conditions of this policy, the same as if no assignment had been made; otherwise this policy shall be void, and all liability on the part of this company shall cease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">An additional condition (VIII) required the insured, in case of loss, to deliver an account and proofs thereof to the defendants, and also to \u201cproduce a certificate under the hand and seal of a magistrate, notary public, or commissioner of deeds, (most contiguous to the place of the fire and not concerned in the loss, as a creditor or otherwise, or related to the insured or sufferers,) stating that he has examined the circumstances attending the loss alleged, and is acquainted with the character and circumstances of the claimants, and that they have sustained loss to a specified amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">The goods insured were almost wholly destroyed by fire on the 5th day of December,. 1861. The plaintiff\u2019s loss was $11,116.79. Upon the trial Elisha Peek, the agent of the defendants, in the city of New York, testified that immediately after the fire he wrote to the defendants to send somebody down to look after it, and they sent their agent Chapman, (who heard of the fire a day or two after it occurred) to examine into the circumstances. He arrived in New York on the 9th day of December, went to the scene of the fire with Peck, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and made a \u201c critical examination,\u201d and examined the plaintiff\u2019s hooks of account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">On the 10th, upon Chapman\u2019s asking the plaintiff for his proofs of loss, the latter gave him the paper containing them, which Chapman took to the office of the defendants in Hartford, Conn, and the defendants produced it on the trial. The plaintiff and another witness testified that two or three days after this, and before Chapman left the city, the plaintiff asked him \u201c <em>if there was any thing further he could do, any thing furthey they wanted of him.\u201d </em>The reply was, \u201c <em>There was not; if there was, they ioould let him know.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">After the plaintiff had rested, the defendants\u2019 counsel moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the paper so served on the defendants was not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the policy, as a prerequisite to the right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">The court denied the motion ; to which denial the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">In the proofs of loss it was stated in an affidavit of the insured, that such <em>\u201c </em>property was at the time of said fire subject to a mortgage executed by the \u00a3 insured,\u2019 to Mark R. Van Deusen, of the town of Alford, Berkshire county, Mass, dated July 6, 1861, and filed in the register\u2019s office for the city and county of Hew York, which contained the condition that the insured \u00a3 should pay the holders thereof, when due, or cause to be paid, all promissory notes which \u2019 had been .or thereafter might be \u00a3 made and signed by the \u2019 insured \u00a3 as prin-. cipal, apd indorsed or signed as surety by the \u2019 mortgagee. That there was no other mortgage or incumbrances on said property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-9\">The counsel for the defendants offered, in evidence, the chattel mortgage mentioned in the proofs of loss, to show an alienation, transfer, or change of title, in the property insured, which was admitted, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception. It did not appear that the mortgagee had ever had the right to take possession, or had actually entered into possession of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-10\">A certificate of a notary was made and delivered to Elisha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Peck, on the 13th day of December, which he sent to the home office, a day or two after he received it; but the president of the defendants testified that they never received it. The plaintiff, before the commencement of this action, called upon the defendants for payment of his claim, and they refused, but finally offered to pay .a portion of it, by way of compromise. There was no evidence that they ever requested further proofs, or objected to payment on the ground that the proofs were defective, or intimated that the plaintiff had not complied with the terms and conditions of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury, that under the terms of the policy there could be no waiver, except in writing signed by the secretary, Also that the chattel mortgage put in evidence showed that there was such a <em>sale, alienation, transfer </em>or\u2022 <em>change of title, </em>in the property insured by the defendants, as rendered the insurance void, and it ceased. The court refused so to charge, to which ruling the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $5254.70, and judgment having been entered, the defendants appealed therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-7\"><em>Henry C. Pratt, for </em>the defendants, appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-8\">I. The court erred, in not dismissing' the complaint. The \u2022 plaintiff alleges performance of all the conditions on his part, The conditions of flie policy required the .plaintiff to produce with his proofs of loss, a formal certificate in regard to certain specified facts. None such was produced. No evidence on the part of the plaintiff shows a performance. Nor does it show a waiver of such certificate under the terms' of the policy. Nor is a waiver a performance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-9\">II. The court erred in not charging the jury, as requested, that there could be no waiver, except in writing signed by the secretary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-10\">III. The court erred in not charging the jury, as requested, that the chattel mortgage rendered the insurance void. That mortgage was a sale and transfer to the mortgagee, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>whole legal title to the goods and chattels mortgaged, being \u201cthe property insured.\u201d <em>(Bank of Rochester </em>v.

The defendants could waive a compliance with the conditions in the policy relating to preliminary proofs, either expressly or by implication. There is no requirement in the policy, that such waiver should be in writing, and signed by the secretary. In this case a waiver may be implied from either of the following facts:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-7\">1. From the declaration of the defendants\u2019 agent. <em>(Franklin Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coates, </em>14 <em>Md. Rep. </em>285. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>New England Ins.

From the silence of the defendants touching the proofs. <em>(\u00c6tna Fire </em>Ins. <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>16 <em>Wend. </em>400. <em>Savage </em>v. <em>The Corn Exch. Ins.

From the negotiations and offer of the defendants to pay a part of the claim. <em>(Bodle </em>v. <em>The Chenango Ins.

The object of the defendants in the condition requiring preliminary proofs, was fully attained. <em>(Lawrence </em>v. <em>Ocean Ins.

The proofs having been accepted without objection, it is immaterial whether they were in compliance with the terms and conditions of the policy or not. The motion to dismiss the complaint was made upon a specified ground only. <em>(Boynton </em>v. <em>Clinton &amp;c. Ins. Co., </em>16 <em>Barb. </em>254. <em>Bumstead </em>v. <em>Dividend Mutual Ins.

The mortgage put in evidence by the defendants, was not such an alienation as rendered the insurance void. <em>(Shepherd </em>v. <em>The Mutual Ins. </em>Co., 38 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>232. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Mass. Fire Ins. Co., </em>23 <em>Pick. </em>418. <em>Conover </em>v. <em>The Mutual Ins.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3z\">The objection that the preliminary proofs do not contain the certificate of a magistrate, as required by the eighth of the conditions annexed to the policy, can not be taken for the first time at the trial. <em>(Bilbrough </em>v. <em>Metropolis Ins. Co., </em>5 <em>Duer, </em>587. <em>O\u2019Niel </em>v. <em>The Buffalo Fire Ins. Co., </em>3 <em>Comst. </em>128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The objection to these proofs, taken on the motion to dismiss the complaint, was that \u201c the paper <em>served on the defendants, </em>as above, was not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the policy, as a prerequisite to the right to recover.\u201d The terms of the objection not only do not raise any question whether the person on whom the service was made was a proper person for the purpose, but import that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">The plaintiff had testified that \u201c either Bowers (the president of the City a Fire Insurance Company which had also insured the same property,) or Chapman (the defendants\u2019 agent) asked for the proofs of loss, and I went and got them, and handed them to them, and they examined the proofs; * * two or three days afterward we had a conversation, and I then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>asked if there was any thing further that I could do ; any further proofs that I could show in the case; any thing further they wanted of me; they said there was <em>not; </em>if so they would let me know; \u201d * *</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The defendants, by their authorized agent, Elisha Peck, subsequently offered to settle and compromise the claim; but no complaint or intimation of the insufficiency of the preliminary proofs was1 at any time suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On such a state of facts, the rule stated in <em>Bodle </em>v. <em>The Chenango Mut. Ins. Co., (2.Comst, </em>57, 58,) should be applied, and the defect be held to he waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The only other question of substance relates to the effect of the giving of the chattel mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The policy declares that \u201cin case of any transfer or termination of the interest of the insured in the property, by sale or otherwise, * \u00ae the policy shall be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The fourth condition declares that \u201cin case of any sale, alienation, transfer or change of title in the property insured, * * or of any individual interest therein, such insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">shall be void. And 'the entry of the foreclosure of a mortgage, or the levy of an execution, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors, shall be deemed an alienation of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">The giving of the mortgage would not avoid the insurance, as being an <em>\u201calienation, sale </em>or <em>transfer of </em>title,\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The mortgagee did not take actual possession, and had no right to do so until the plaintiff made default in payment of the moneys secured thereby. <em>(Conover </em>v. <em>The Mutual Ins. Co. of Albany, </em>1 <em>Comst. </em>290. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>1 <em>Gray, </em>426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">Does the giving of the mortgage work a \u201c change of title,\u201d within the meaning of the policy ? If it does, then if the goods were mortgaged when insured, payment of the mortgage before the loss, would also work \u201ca change ef title.\u201d Such a construction makes the words equivalent to <em>alteration in, or modification of, the nature of the title.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">I think the words \u201c change of title,\u201d as used in this policy, should be construed to mean some act which <em>divests it </em>abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>lutely, and thus permit the words, <em>\u201c </em>the entry of the foreclosure of a mortgage,\u201d to have a natural, and not a forced application. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Construing the whole as permitting the insured to mortgage, where he retains possession and has the right of possession, without avoiding-the policy, then the same effect is given to an entry to foreclose the mortgage, as to the levy of an execution, either of which the parties agree shall be deemed an alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Any other construction would restrict the application of the words, <em>\u201c </em>the entry of the foreclosure of a mortgage,\u201d to goods mortgaged when the policy was issued, and would defeat the policy by reason of the mere fact of paying the mortgage prior to a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">For whatever change of title is effected by the mere execution of a mortgage, a corresponding change is produced by satisfying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>Orrell </em>v. <em>Hampden Fire Ins. Co. </em>(13 <em>Gray, </em>431,) is not an authority to the point, that a mortgage is a change of title, within the meaning of a policy written like the present. The concluding part of the opinion is, that to constitute a breach of the condition of insurance, <em>\u201c </em>there must have been an actual sale or transfer of property, valid as between the parties.\u201d All else that is said is qualified by the word <em>C( </em>perhaps,\u201d and does not touch a point in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">In <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Hampden Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(30 <em>Maine Rep. </em>414,) one article of the defendants\u2019 by-laws was, that the policy should be void if the assured should sell or alienate the property, in whole or in part, without consent of the company. The conveyances in that case were held to be <em>an alienation in part. </em>This case, therefore, has not much application to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">In <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>Mut. Safety Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1 <em>Allen, </em>311,) the by-laws provide that <em>\u201c </em>all alienations and <em>alterations in the ownership, </em>situation or state of the property insured by this company, in any material particular, shall make void any policy covering such property.\u201d A subsequent mortgage of the property was said to be &lt;\u00a3an <em>alteration </em>in the <em>oionership. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>* * It introduces a new owner, to the extent of the sum secured by the mortgage, and to the same extent it takes away the direct interest of the assured.\u201d That' case may be conceded to be correctly decided, upon the particular facts of the case, and yet not be an authority in support of the proposition that a mortgage, though not due, and not giving the mortgagee a right to the possession of the property, works \u201c a change of <em>title/\u2019 </em>within the meaning of the policy, in the case at bar. In neither of the three cases last cited, does there appear to be any clause in -the by-laws to the effect that \u201c the entry of the foreclosure of a mortgage \u201d shall be deemed an alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Within the good sense and spirit of the terms of the body of the policy, and of the fourth condition, the words, <em>\u201c </em>any <em>sale, alienation ox'transfer\u201d </em>should be construed as applying to acts which terminate the interest of the assured. By the body of the policy, property <em>\u201csold, </em>but <em>not delivered,\u201d </em>is insured. This shows that \u201csale\u201d means an executed contract of sale, which has transferred the title. Applying the maxim <em>noseitur a sociis </em>to the words \u201c change of title,\u201d and keeping in mind the further provision, that \u201c the entry of the foreclosure of a mortgage\u201d shall be deemed an alienation, the conclusion is reasonable, and I think clear, that the change of title -here meant, is a termination of it, and that the giving of the mortgage no more worked a change of title, within the meaning of the policy, than it did a transfer or alienation. That it is not an alienation, within the meaning of the policy, is settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">If these views are correct, the further questions involved in the other exceptions taken need not be considered, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
