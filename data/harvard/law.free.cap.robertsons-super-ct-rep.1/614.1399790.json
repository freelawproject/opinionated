The defendant, \u00a1Nicholas, answered, denying various allegations of the complaint, and set up either as a second and distinct defense as to the claim of the plaintiff in this action, or as to the principal or some part thereof, or in mitigation of the damages (if any) to be recovered in this action, that before and at the time of the recovery of the judgment specified in the complaint, and also before and at the respective times of the issuing and return of the two executions specified in the complaint, and of each of them respectively, R. L\u2019Amoureux was, and ever since has been, and still is, utterly insolvent, and had no property whatever that could, or ought to be, or was liable to be applied to, or towards the payment or satisfaction of such judgment or any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-5\">To this second defense in the answer the plaintiff demurred.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aln\">The only question presented by this appeal is whether special bail who have become fixed can, in an action against them as such bail, show either in bar of the action, or in mitigation of' damages, that before the recoveiy of judgment against their principal, he was, and at all times since, has been utterly insolvent, and had no property whatever that could,. or was liable to be applied towards the payment of such judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">That fact is not one of those which the Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S. </em>383, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 34,) provides may be placed or presented as a ground for relieving bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u25a0 Oil .a breach of the bail bond given on the arrest of a\" defendaht, conditioned for his appearance, and putting in bail, such bail, are liable for the aniount of the debt or demand against the principal; the costs of the original suit and of the \u2022 suit, on the bond (to the extent of the penalty of such bond.) (2 <em>R. S. </em>349, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12. <em>Id. </em>358, \u00a7 12.) And special bail who\" have .\u00a1become fixed, and are liable as such,, can only be relieved by- paying the judgment against their principal, (that not being larger than the sum in which they undertook as bail,) and the costs of the action against themselves. <em>(Graham\u2019s Pr. </em>pp. 426, 427. <em>Blaney </em>v. Holt, <em>and Same </em>v. <em>Hardell, </em>3 <em>Nev. .&amp; Mann. </em>529. <em>See Stever </em>v. Sornberger, 24 <em>Wend. </em>275; <em>Gregory </em>v. Levy, 12 <em>Barb. </em>610; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 199, [174,] <em>and </em>200, [175.]</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">. Such .was . clearly the \"measure of the liability of special bail; .and\" the character and extent of the relief to which a plaintiff, on such a State of facts, was entitled before the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Section 468 of the Code, declares- that all rights of action given or secured by existing laws may .be prosecuted in the manner provided by this act.\u201d \"</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Rights given or liabilities created and defined by existing laws,, are not modified, impaired or diminished by - the general provisions\" of the. Code prescribing the procedure to .be conformed to in civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"AT2\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b640-8\">Robertson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">The- undertaking of the defendants was that the -debtor in, the former suit\" (L\u2019Amoureux,) should at all times render himself amenable to the process- of the court, during the. pendency of the action, and to such as might- be issued to -enforce the judgment therein. They have at all times authority, to produce the person of the debtor in then-exoneration, and, the plaintiff in such action was entitled to insist on the production of the body or payment of the debt. They were,not public officers, upon whom the execution of process may, devolve even against his will, but volunteers, such as are most usually friends of the party arrested. The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of arrest would be of little avail to procure the payment of a debt, if the sureties for his appearance could refrain from producing his body, and speculate on their ability to prove his insolvency, when the most important witness, himself, might be absent. Eor an accidental inability to produce the body of the debtor at the time, the court may furnish relief. <em>(Barker </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>11 <em>Barb. </em>303.) But if negligent or indifferent in attempting to produce it, the law implies either indemnity or fraud, and makes the sureties liable. Bail may also be substituted for the actual deposit of the amount for which the defendant is ordered to give bail, which amount would, if given, be applied immediately to satisfying the judgment. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 199,200.) The change of security ought not to alter the plaintiff\u2019s rights. Besides this, the plaintiff is bound to test the solvency of the debtor, by executions against his property, and the facility of procuring his person as a pledge by an execution against it, (2 <em>B. S. </em>382, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30,) and any fraud or collusion in mere pretended efforts by such executions, to collect the amount due, deprives him of the right to proceed against the bail. <em>(Id. </em>383, \u00a7 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The Oode of Procedure reenacts the cases for exonerating bail, originally provided for in the Revised Statutes, as amended by a statute passed in 1845. (2 <em>R. S. </em>382, \u00a7 22. <em>Sess. L. of </em>1845, <em>ch. </em>231, \u00a7 3. <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 191.) One of them is the legal discharge of the debtor, not from the debt, but from the obligation of rendering himself amenable to process, showing that the plaintiff was to have the money or the defendant\u2019s body, if amenable to process as security for the debt. The same principle is laid down in elementary works.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">I therefore concur in affirming the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
