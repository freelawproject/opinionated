J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEP\">It appears that the parties to this action have settled the judgment appealed from, and that the plaintiff has acknowledged satisfaction of the judgment. It does not distinctly appear that the judgment has been satisfied of record, inasmuch as the paper read by the defendant as an affidavit made by him is not sworn to. If the defendant had not in fact sworn to it, the reading of it as an affidavit actually sworn to, is highly reprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney should not issue execution on a judgment satisfied of record, nor an appellate court hear an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>appeal from it, taken by the defeated party, when the attorney of the party acknowledging satisfaction is the only person asking for judgment on the appeal, and the opposite party objects to farther proceeding in the appeal, on the ground that the judgment is satisfied of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The- plaintiff\u2019s attorney, if he thinks the settlement and discharge of the judgment is a fraud on his rights, should move to vacate the entry of satisfaction, as was done in <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Sec. Av. R. R. Co., </em>(18 N. <em>Y. Rep. </em>368;) or move for an <em>order </em>that thes defendant pay his costs, as in <em>Read </em>v. <em>Dupper, </em>(6 <em>T. R. </em>361;) and <em>see Barker </em>v. <em>St. Quintin, </em>(12 <em>M. &amp; Wels. </em>441;) and <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sixth Av. R. R. Co., </em>(1 <em>Am. L. R. </em>[N. S.] 410, 416 ; and note to the same, <em>Id. </em>423, 4, Remedies.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The cause must be stricken from the calendar, because it appears the judgment has been settled, and satisfaction of it acknowledged ; and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney be left to his motion to vacate the entry of satisfaction, and for leave to proceed in the action to collect his costs ; or to take such further course as he may be advised. This motion is granted without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
