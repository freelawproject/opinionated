Chadwick. The plaintiff claimed title by virtue of an attachment made November 3,1884, in a suit brought by her against said Chadwick,-and a sale on the execution which issued on the judgment .recovered in the suit. Jt was undisputed that Chadwick conveyed the premises, situated in Palermo., Waldo county, by deed of warranty, to Edwin O. Chadwick, May 17, 1875 ; and that said Edwin conveyed the same to the defendant, Prescott, April 27, 1878 ; also that neither of these deeds was recorded at the time of the attachment, nor at the time of the sale. These deeds -were not recorded until 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-11\">The issue of fact submitted to the jury was whether the plaint-' iff, at the time of making her attachment, had actual notice of the deed from Willard H. Chadwick to Edwin O. Chadwick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-12\">Under the instructions of the presiding justice, to which no exceptions were taken, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-13\">The testimony showed that the plaintiff, having an unsatisfied judgment against Willard H. Chadwick, ascertained by the registry of deeds for Waldo county that the record title of the demanded premises was in him, and caused the same to be attached and sold on execution as his property. The plaintiff who resides in Worcester, Massachusetts, was a stranger to the premises, and had recovered a judgment against said Chadwick in Worcester county, Massachusetts, for board furnished him in 1872, 1876, and 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-14\">The defense relied upon the testimony of Chadwick and his wife to prove that the plaintiff had actual notice of the unrecorded deed of Willard H. Chadwick to Edwin O. Chadwick in 1875. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The testimony related to conversations in 1875 with the plaintiff at Worcester. The plaintiff denied the conversations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-5\">The testimony also showed that Willard H. Chadwick was married January 1, 1871. After their marriage, he and his wife boarded with Mrs. Parker, the plaintiff, until they left Worcester and came to Palermo in the latter part of 1871 or the first of 1872. After his arrival in Palermo, Chadwick bought a farm, the demanded premises, in Palermo, of his father. In May, 1875, he sold the farm to his brother, Edwin O. Chadwick. In the fall of 1875, Mrs. Chadwick commenced to board again with the plaintiff, and in January, 1876, Chadwick went there to board. They continued to board with the plaintiff until January 10, 1878. Mrs. Chadwick testified that after she went to Mrs. Parker\u2019s to board in the fall of 1875, and while she was boarding there, she informed Mrs. Parker that the place was sold to Edwin O. Chadwick, and that she was glad the farm was gone, and that they, (the plaintiff and her mother) were glad for her sake. This witness testifies that the matter of the sale of the place was talked over between her and the plaintiff several times and that she had heard her husband tell the plaintiff that he had disposed of his farm to his brother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">Willard H. Chadwick testifies that he informed the plaintiff that he had disposed of his place and was glad of it; that on one occasion he told him that he got no money for the place, but had got notes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-7\"><em>J.
