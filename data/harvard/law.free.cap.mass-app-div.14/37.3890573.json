That the declaration sets forth no legal cause of action against the defendant. 2. Res Judicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3G\">Since, as the plaintiff correctly suggests in his brief, there is nothing in his declaration which indicates that the eviction proceedings in the Municipal Court of the Dorchester District (hereinafter referred to as the Dorchester Court) have ever gone to trial or judgment, the defense of res judicata is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>However, the demurrer was properly sustained for the assigned reason that the declaration fails to set forth a legal cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">It is readily apparent that the declaration does not allege the essential elements of a cause of action for deceit or fraud. Thus, there is no allegation that the defendant made the alleged misrepresentation with the intent to induce the plaintiff to rely upon it, or that the plaintiff did in fact believe or rely upon the alleged misrepresentation, and vacate the premises in reliance thereon. <em>Butler v. Martin, </em>247 Mass. 169, 173. cf. <em>Cheraska v. Ohanasian, </em>259 Mass. 341, 346. See Restatement, Torts, sec. 525. On the con- . trary, the plaintiff alleges that he was caused to vacate the described premises \u201cby threats of illegal eviction\u201d and \u201cby proceedings filed with the Municipal Court of the Dorchester District. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">If this action be regarded as one of tort for wrongful eviction, the declaration is likewise insufficient to sustain it. There is no allegation of actual expulsion of the plaintiff from the premises. His claim must, therefore, rest upon the theory of constructive eviction, which has been defined by the Supreme Judicial Court as \u201can act of a permanent character, done by the landlord, or by his procurement, <em>with the intention and effect of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the premises </em>demised, ... to which he yields and abandons possession.\u201d (Italics supplied.) <em>Royce v. Guggenheim, </em>106 Mass. 201, 202. <em>Shindler v. Milden, </em>282 Mass. 32, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Conceding the intention of the present defendant to deprive the plaintiff of the enjoyment of the described premises, the acts alleged to have been done by the defendant, including undefined threats of illegal eviction, misrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>sentation to the Office of Price Administration, the commencement of eviction proceedings in the Dorchester Court, and the filing therein of a fraudulently obtained O. P. A. certificate authorizing the defendant to institute eviction proceedings, did not have the effect of depriving the tenant of the use of the premises. From all that appears in the declaration, the plaintiff could have continued to occupy the premises until all of the issues in the eviction proceedings, including the question of landlord\u2019s good faith and the purpose for which he actually desired the premises, were tried and adjudicated in the Dorchester Court. Consequently, the declaration does not allege facts showing a constructive eviction by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\">It has been stated in argument before this Appellate Division that the landlord had in fact obtained judgment in his favor in the eviction proceedings in the Dorchester Court prior to the tenant\u2019s vacating the premises. No such facts are alleged in the declaration, and in our opinion, they may not be inferred from the facts alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">However, even if the declaration were to be construed as alleging that the eviction of the tenant was effected pursuant to a judgment of the Dorchester Court in favor of the landlord in the proceedings referred to, the present action would be barred by the doctrine of res judicata. In the recent case of <em>Gradetsky v. Siegel, </em>(No. 258813), we held that the entry of judgment after trial in eviction proceedings is conclusive1 upon the parties with respect to the issues involved in such proceedings, including the landlord\u2019s good faith and the purpose for which he actually desired the premises, and that the tenant may not thereafter, in collateral proceedings, seek a re-determination of those issues. See, also, <em>David v. Fayman, </em>273 App. Div. 408, 78 N. Y. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>2d 188. <em>Thomsen v. Texon, </em>189 Misc. 972, 73 N. Y. S. 2d 543. That decision was based upon the established principle that the entry of judgment is conclusive on the parties with respect to the issues which were or might have been litigated by them in the proceedings leading to the judgment. <em>Homer v. Fish, </em>1 Pick. 435. <em>Fishman v. Alberts, </em>321 Mass. 280. On the assumption that the declaration might be construed as alleging that the eviction of the plaintiff was effected pursuant to a judgment of the Dorchester Court in the eviction proceedings referred to, the defense of res judicata would be open on demurrer. See <em>Lonnquist v. Lammi, </em>242 Mass. 574. <em>Fishman v. Alberts, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">There is no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s alternative contention that his declaration sets forth a cause of action under the federal Price Control Act then in effect. <em>Gradetsky v. Siegel supra. Leidy v. Connor, </em>70 Fed. Supp. 1022. <em>Fleming v. Fosternock, </em>71 Fed. Supp. 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Order sustaining demurrer affirmed, report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
