(2) That there is no sufficient evidence to warrant a finding for the plaintiff. (3) That there is no sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant, his agent or servant, was negligent. (6) That there is no sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the conduct of the defendant was wanton, willful or reckless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The court, however, allowed the following two requests of the defendant :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">(4) That if the plaintiff and/or her husband had received a notice to vacate the premises prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>date of the accident, the plaintiff and her husband were tenants at sufferance at the time of the accident. (5) That the plaintiff cannot recover in the absence of wanton, willful, or reckless misconduct on the part of the defendant and made the following finding of facts:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">\u201cI find that the defendant had notice that the ceiling in the ldtchen of the apartment occupied by the plaintiff and her family was in a dangerous condition; that he willfully refused to repair said dangerous condition; that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, and was injured by a part of the ceiling in said kitchen falling down upon her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The court, by allowing defendant\u2019s requests numbered 4 and 5 correctly ruled that the plaintiff and her husband had become tenants at sufferance at the time she received her alleged injuries, and that the defendant is only liable for wanton, willful or reckless conduct towards her. <em>Margasian v. Markarian, </em>288 Mass. 197, 199; <em>Mescall v. Semerset Savings Bank, </em>305 Mass. 575, 577. See also our opinion in the case of <em>Galjaard v. Day et al., </em>App. Div. Northern Dist. No. 4350.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The trial judge, however, found for the plaintiff on the ground that the defendant \u201cwillfully refused to repair said dangerous condition. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The first question then before us is whether willfully, refusing to repair a dangerous condition is the same as wanton, willful or reckless misconduct. The Court has defined a wanton and willful act as one done by a person, who \u201cinflicts the injury intentionally or is so utterly indifferent to the right of others that he acts as if such right did not exist.\u201d <em>Wentzell v. Boston Elevated Railway, </em>230 Mass. 275, 277; <em>Burwick v. Rosenberg, </em>269 Mass. 21, 25: <em>Coulombe v. Horne Coal Co., </em>275 Mass. 226, 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>In the case at bar, the trial judge only found that the defendant \u201cwilfully refused to repair.\u201d That is quite far from finding that he acted \u201cwilfully, wantonly and recklessly.\u201d Any failure to; repair a defect, after knowledge thereof, may be said to be willful, but it is not wanton unless danger to life or property is so obvious or may be readily anticipated. <em>Palmer v. Davidson, </em>211 Mass. 556; <em>Cohen v. Davies, </em>305 Mass. 152; <em>Desmond v. Boston Elevated Railway, </em>319 Mass. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">And since some repair was made in said premises after the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the most that may be inferred from the facts is that they were made negligently. We do not think that failure to repair alone, or repairing negligently, as was done in this case is sufficient to warrant a finding of willful, wanton or reckless misconduct. Nor is there any evidence in any event that the defendant ever agreed to maintain and keep the premises in good repair, in which case he was under no legal obligation to the plaintiff to do so. <em>Commonwealth v. Watson, </em>97 Mass. 562, 563; <em>Looney v. McLean, </em>129 Mass. 53; <em>Mellen v. Morrill, </em>126 Mass. 545, 546; <em>Kearines v. Cullen, </em>183 Mass. 298; <em>Mackey v. Lonergem, </em>221 Mass. 296; <em>Fiorntino v. Mason, Tr., </em>233 Mass. 451; <em>Chelefou v. Springfield Institution for Savings, </em>297 Mass. 236, 239; <em>Ryerson v. Fall River Philanthropic Burial Society, </em>315 Mass. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The fact that the defendant made some repairs in the upstairs apartment does not render him liable for negligence. It was a gratuitous act. <em>Conahan v. Fisher, </em>233 Mass. 234, 238; <em>McKeon v. Cutter, </em>156 Mass. 296; <em>Kearines v. Cullen, </em>183 Mass. 398; <em>Hannaford v. Kinne, </em>199 Mass. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">We think therefore that there was prejudicial error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s requests numbered 2 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Having reached that conclusion, we do not think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>necessary to consider the defendant\u2019s first request regarding the plaintiff\u2019s rights to recover on a declaration fox ordinary negligence in a case where she had to prove willful, wanton and reckless misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">The finding for the plaintiff is to be vacated and a new finding is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
