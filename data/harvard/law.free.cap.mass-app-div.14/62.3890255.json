Holmes. On May 28, 1946, the day before the funeral, and while in Chicago, the defendant executed and delivered to the plaintiff a written instrument which was introduced in evidence, and a complete copy of which is annexed to the Report and marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201cA\u201d. In this document the defendant directed the plaintiff to furnish articles and equipment and conduct the funeral. He promised to pay therefor, on or before June 15, 1946, the amount shown as \u201cTotal Charges.\u201d Document \u201cA\u201d also contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-3\">\u201cI . . . authorize irrevocably, any attorney of any court of record to appear for me ... in any court ... at any time hereafter and confess a judgment against me . . . without process, in favor of the holder of this obligation for such amount as may appear to be unpaid thereon . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">A second document purporting to be a record of judgment was introduced in evidence. A complete copy of it is annexed to the Report and is marked \u201cB\u201d. Document \u201cB\u201d is entitled \u201cConfession of Judgment.\u201d It contained a statement by the plaintiff of the amounts which he claims are owed him by the defendant which total $811.02. It also contains a \u201cCognovit\u201d the material parts of which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201cThe defendant by his attorney, waives service of process and confesses judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for . . . $811.02 and costs .... Charles S. Bergh</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">Attorney for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Below the \u201cCognovit\u201d is an order of the Judge of the Chicago Court directing judgment to be entered for $811.02 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The defendant has at all times been a resident of Massachusetts and was in Illinois on the occasion of his execution of document \u201cA\u201d for the purpose of attending the funeral of his uncle. He received no notice of the commencement of an action against him in Illinois, no notice of the appearance of Charles S. Bergh for him in the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>action, no notice of the finding against him and no notice of the judgment, prior to the commencement of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">The defendant duly filed twelve requests for rulings of law. The Court allowed five and denied the other seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The trial Court made special findings of fact, which so far as not already recited, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cThere was a payment made by the Veteran\u2019s Administration of $150 to be applied for the said burial \u2022services .... The said Court is a court of record and there was an authorized appearance by an attorney for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The Court found for the plaintiff in the sum of $661.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The defendant claiming to be aggrieved by the denial of his requests and the refusal of the Court to apply Bequest Number 12' (mistakenly stated in the Beport as Number 11), the case is reported to this Appellate Division for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The cases of <em>Van Norman v. Gordon, </em>172 Mass. 576 (1899) and <em>Ferranti v. Lewis, </em>271 Mass. 186 (1930), are decisive of the instant case and the finding for the plaintiff must stand unless some facts of the present case distinguish it from those decisions or unless, since those decisions were handed down, some statute has been enacted in this State rendering those decisions no longer in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The defendant contends there are such facts, and there is such a statute, and makes the following claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">(1) There was no power in Bergh (the person who confessed judgment) to make the confession since document \u201cA\u201d authorized him to confess judgment only \u201cfor such amount as may appear to be unpaid thereon\u201d and the only promise was to pay \u201cthe amount shown as total charges, \u2019 \u2019 and no amount is shown after these words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>This contention is without merit. It is true that there are no figures in the column after the words <em>1 \u2018 </em>Total Charges\u201d but in this column shortly above the words are the figures $698.95 which is the total of the detailed charges and is very evidently the \u201cTotal Charges.\u201d Further, document \u201cA\u201d shows the defendant promised to pay the \u201cTotal Charges\u201d \u201cin the following manner . . . (b) $698.95 on or before June 15,1948.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\">(2) There was no power in Bergh to confess judgment because document \u201cA\u201d authorizes only \u201cany attorney of any court of record\u201d to confess judgment and there is no evidence that Bergh was such an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Document \u201cB\u201d, the record of judgment in the Chicago Court, shows that Bergh signed the confession of judgment as \u201cAttorney for the defendant\u201d and that the Chicago judge, who had document \u201cA\u201d before him, ordered judgment for the plaintiff on the confession. To do this he must have found that Bergh was an attorney of a court of record. The trial judge in this Commonwealth expressly found that \u201cBergh under authority of such instrument (document \u201cA\u201d) appeared for and confessed judgment against the defendant in the Municipal Court of Chicago.\u201d We cannot say the trial judge was clearly wrong. Every presumption is to be made in favor of the regularity of the proceedings in the Chicago Court. Moreover the defendant offered no evidence tending to show Bergh was not an attorney of record. <em>Van Norman v. Gordon, supra, </em>at p. 579; <em>Makorios v. Greene Co., </em>256 Mass. 598.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">(3) ' Even though the plaintiff might have recovered in this case prior to 1931 under the. authority of <em>Van Norman v. Gordon </em>and <em>Ferranti v. Lewis, supra, </em>both of which were decided prior to 1931, he cannot now recover because of the provisions of G. L. C. 231 \u00a7 13 A which was enacted in 1931.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The pertinent portions of this- statute are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-3\">\u201cAny judgment entered in an action upon a contract, promissory note ... in which ... is contained a stipulation whereby the defendant in such action waived .. . the service of process . . . shall be set aside and annulled on motion of the defendant, unless it appears that service in the usual manner was had upon him or . . .. Any stipulation in a contract, . promissory note, . . . whereby a party thereto agrees to confess judgment in any action which may be brought thereon or authorizes . . . another person to confess judgment as aforesaid shall be void and any judgment by confession taken in pursuance of such a stipulation shall be set aside and annulled on motion of the defendant. Upon the setting aside and annulling of any judgment under authority hereof, all outstanding executions issued thereon shall be stayed or superseded without security.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We believe the operation of this statute is confined to actions originally brought in Massachusetts and does not apply to actions such as the present, brought upon a judgment secured in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The wording and provisions of this statute cause us so to find.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">This statute, \u00a7 13A, is an amendment to, and now a part of, G. L. C. 213, commonly known as the Practice Act, of Massachusetts Practice Act. It is evident that its provisions can be, and were intended to be, carried out only in the courts of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">It is unnecessary to discuss in detail the defendant\u2019s re- . quests for rulings which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We find no prejudicial error. The order must be Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
