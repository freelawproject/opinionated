Appellant presents one argument on appeal: Did the circuit court err in entering summary judgment against him? For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">On August 13, 2015, appellant filed a four-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u201cCity\u201d); four employees of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Baltimore City Fire Department (\u201cBCFD\u201d), specifically, Jeffrey Segal, Mark Wagner, James Wallace, and Charles Dwyer; and the Baltimore City Professional Fire Fighters, IAFF Local 734 (the \u201cUnion\u201d). Appellant had been an employee with the BCFD from September 18,1995, until April 15, 2015, when he was discharged. During his employment, appellant had risen through the ranks, and at the time of his discharge he was an emergency vehicle driver assigned to a HAZMAT unit. It is not disputed that appellant was a dues paying member of the Union at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The first count of appellant\u2019s complaint was an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against each of the defendants. He alleged that during his employment he was subject to \u201cunjustified, illegal and malicious harassment\u201d by Wagner, Wallace, and Dwyer, that caused, without elaboration, \u201ccertain disciplinary actions\u201d and \u201cdisparate adverse treatment\u201d to be made against him; \u201ccast [asper]sions\u201d on his character; and violated his rights to seek assistance from his Union. He alleged that the City, the BCFD, and Segal, Assistant Chief of the BCFD, acquiesced in those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The second count alleged tortious interference with contract and was against Wagner, Wallace, and Dwyer, who allegedly induced the BCFD to \u201cbreach its contractual obligations\u201d regarding employment opportunities and promotions for appellant. Appellant alleged, again without elaboration, that as a result of those employees\u2019 actions he was removed from his position and forced to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The third count alleged negligence by: 1) the City, the BCFD, and Segal for allowing the three named employees to harass appellant; and 2) the City and the BCFD for failing to provide appropriate medical care to appellant for the work-related injury to his right hand and thumb, which caused \u201cserious permanent disability,\u201d and in failing to properly process appellant\u2019s retirement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The fourth count alleged breach of contract and alleged that the Union failed to represent him in his employment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Appellees responded by moving for summary judgment. In support of their motion appellees argued, among other things, that appellant had failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing the action in circuit court; appellant\u2019s tort claim was barred by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cMWCA\u201d), <em>see </em>Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 9-101, <em>et. </em>seq.; and appellant\u2019s tortious interference with contract claim against the three named employees was not actionable because the employees were parties to the contract with the City. Appellees clarified that appellant was removed by administrative action for two reasons. First, he was deemed no longer fit for duty by the opinion of the Medical Director of the Mercy Medical Center Public Safety Infirmary due to the injury to his hand. Second, appellant had exhausted his paid leave (from January 8, 2014 to April 15, 2015) for a line of duty injury and had to either return to work, be separated from City employment, or challenge his status by means of an internal appeal or grievance, which he has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City agreed with appellees and entered summary judgment against appellant on grounds that he did not exhaust his administrative and contractual remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Appellant argues on appeal that the circuit court\u2019s ruling was in error, because the ruling was \u201cerroneously predicated on the assumption\u201d that his claims were \u201cwithin the scope of available administrative and contractual remedies.\u201d Appellees preliminarily respond that appellant has waived his appeal because he has cited no case law to support his argument. Even if appellant\u2019s argument is preserved, appellees argue that the circuit court\u2019s ruling was correct\u2014appellant was required and failed to exhaust available remedies under the Baltimore City Charter, Art. VII, \u00a7 100, and Arts. 6 and 12 of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the City and the Union and the MWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>We will quickly dismiss appellees\u2019 waiver argument. Md. Rule 8-504, governing the content of appellate briefs, contains no requirement that an appellant must cite case law in support of his arguments. <em>Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 577-78, 694 A.2d 150 (1997), the main case cited by appellees for its waiver argument, stands for the proposition that where a brief only recites facts and does not relate those facts to a legal theory, we shall not address the potential merits of the argument presented. Here, appellant contests the lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Appellant cites several cases regarding the standard of review for summary judgment and several legal theories on which his claims are based. Although his arguments are not the pinnacle of clarity, they are sufficiently presented, factually and legally, for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Md. Rule 2-501 (f) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. See Todd v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>373 Md. 149, 154, 816 A.2d 930 (2003)(citations omitted). Accordingly, we first determine whether a dispute of material fact exists, and if not, only then will we proceed to determine whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 110, 854 A.2d 1191 (2004). Because there are no disputed material facts, the standard of review is whether the trial court was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The MOU for fiscal years 2014-2016 memorializes the understanding between the City and members of the Union on a range of issues, including wages, hours, discipline and discharge, health, and other terms and conditions of employment. MOU Art 6:A defines \u201cgrievance\u201d as \u201ca dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of [the MOU]\u201d or \u201ca claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the rules or regulations of the [ejmployer affecting the terms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>conditions of employment!!.]\u201d Article 6:A sets forth the grievance procedure in detail. <em>See </em>MOU Art. 6:A. Additionally, MOU Article 12:A provides that \u201c[a]ny employee who is discharged, reduced in pay or position, or suspended for more than thirty (30) days may contest the action either (i) by lodging an appeal with the Civil Service Commission ... or (ii) by filing a grievance on the form that is referred to in Article 6[.]\u201d None of the complained actions occurred outside the scope of appellant\u2019s employment. Therefore, appellant\u2019s termination and the conduct that negatively affected the terms and conditions of his employment were subject to the mandatory grievance procedure of the MOU.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Appellant attempts to avoid this result with several arguments. First, he argues that the word \u201cmay\u201d in Article 12:A, setting forth the two avenues for grievance, is permissive rather than mandatory, which appellant suggests permits an employee to take other avenues for a grievance. We reject this interpretation. We are persuaded that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in Article 12:A clearly means that an employee who is discharged, or whose pay or position is reduced may either choose between the two exclusive actions offered\u2014appealing to the Civil Service Commission or filing a grievance\u2014or an employee may do nothing at all. <em>Cf. Gazunis v. Foster, </em>400 Md. 541, 565, 929 A.2d 531 (2007)(reaching the same interpretation of the word \u201cmay\u201d in a collective bargaining agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Second, appellant argues that the MOU applies only to the limited actions stated in Article 12:A, an employee who is discharged, reduced in pay or position, or suspended for more than 30 days. Appellant argues that Count 1 and 4 of his complaint do not allege wrongs based on discharge, reduction of pay, or suspension. Appellant also argued, during oral arguments, that his use of the adverbs \u201cunjustified\u201d, \u201cillegal\u201d, and \u201cmalicious\u201d to describe the actions complained of, took his claims outside the employment context. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Appellant\u2019s claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count I), tortious interference with contract (Count II), and negligence (Count III) are all clearly based on em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ployment actions and duties and are covered by MOU 6:A. Because all of appellant\u2019s claims arise out of his employment and are based on duties established and defined in the MOU, he is bound by the administrative procedures set forth in the MOU.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Fleming v. United Parcel Serv., </em>255 N.J.Super. 108, 604 A.2d 657, 671 (Law. Div. 1992)(holding that an employee\u2019s tort claim is so inextricably intertwined with the terms of the labor contract that the employees tortious interference claim is preempted and cannot be adjudicated without consideration of the labor contract). Moreover, the use of adverbs to describe a claim regarding one\u2019s employment does not elevate the claim outside the employment context. <em>Cf. Nash v. AT &amp; T Nassau Metals, </em>298 S.C. 428, 381 S.E.2d 206, 209-10 (1989)(employee Nash\u2019s claim that Nassau deliberately and willfully deprived him of his benefits and terminated his employment was preempted because whether the actions were \u201cillegal\u201d involved a determination as to whether the parties complied with the employment contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Additionally, that part of Count III which relates to appellant\u2019s claim involving his work-related injury is actionable solely under the MWCA. The MWCA is a \u201ccomprehensive scheme to ... provide sure and certain relief for injured workmen, their families and dependents regardless of questions of fault.\u201d <em>Hastings v. Mechalske, </em>336 Md. 663, 672, 650 A.2d 274 (1994)(quotation marks and citations omitted). The MWCA entitles covered employees to compensation for accidental injuries that arise out of the course of employment and is the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for an injured employee against his employer. <em>Rodrigues-Novo v. Recchi America, Inc., </em>381 Md. 49, 57, 846 A.2d 1048 (2004); <em>Hastings, </em>336 Md. at 672, 650 A.2d 274; and Lab. &amp; Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 9-101(b), 9-501, 9-509(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Lastly, we also note that appellant\u2019s breach of contract claim against the Union (Count IV), and to the extent he alleges a cause of action against the Union in tort and contract, is not actionable. As the appellees correctly point out, appellant\u2019s cause of action against the Union is based on the theory of breach of the duty of fair representation. This theory is \u201cbased on the member\u2019s claim that the union had, without good cause or reason, refused to take to arbitration the member\u2019s grievance against his employer.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>58 Md.App. 501, 508, 473 A.2d 956 (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 794, 481 A.2d 239 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1016, 105 S.Ct. 2021, 85 L.Ed.2d 303 (1985). This is because the Union is required to: 1) serve all of its members without hostility or discrimination; 2) exercise its discretion with good faith and honesty; and 3) avoid arbitrary conduct. <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 177, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967)(citation omitted). Before the Union has any duty to represent, however, the member must file a grievance. <em>See </em>MOU Art. 6:C. Because appellant never grieved and did not pursue his contractual remedy, he has no cause of action against the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In sum, because appellant failed to exhaust the administrative and statutory remedies available, the lower court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-5\">. Appellees are also correct that appellant\u2019s tortious interference with contract claim cannot lie against the other City employees because they are party to the contract to which they allegedly interfered, and agents of the employer. <em>See Kaser v. Fin. Protection Mktg., Inc., </em>376 Md. 621, 630, 831 A.2d 49 (2003) and <em>Pope v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs of Baltimore City, </em>106 Md.App. 578, 592, 665 A.2d 713 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 116, 673 A.2d 707 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
