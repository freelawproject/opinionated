The appellees, Brett Austin and Joshua Foti, are the contract purchasers of the License (the \u201cContract Purchasers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The question presented, slightly rephrased, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">Did the circuit court err in its determination that the License had not expired by operation of law when the transfer of the License to the Contract Purchasers was not completed within 180 days after the Board approved the transfer?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We hold that it did and reverse the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Notwithstanding the extended procedural history of this case, the dispositive facts are not in dispute. Turner\u2019s closed for business on or about July 11, 2009,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> during the license year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ending April 30, 2010. The first application to the Board to transfer the License to the Contract Purchasers was filed on June 19, 2009. That application was approved by the Board on July 23, 2009. On January 19, 2010, Samuel Daniels (the then-Executive Secretary of the Board) signed a memorandum recommending that the deadline to complete the transfer be extended 180 days (to July 5, 2010) \u201c[biased on discussion w/ Mr. Austin and receipt of projected completion schedule.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board granted three additional sixty-day extensions to complete the transfer, all of which were granted after the prior extension period had ended. The last extension was granted on November 15, 2012. In the meantime, the License was renewed in the name of the Contract Purchasers for the license years ending on April 30 in 2011, 2012, and 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">On February 25, 2013, a second Application for Transfer and Expansion was filed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The validity of the License itself was raised when, \u201cdespite having prevailed in their case in chief,\u201d the Association sought judicial review on that issue. On December 13, 2013, a hearing was held, and on December 23, the circuit court remanded the case to the Board to create a record on the validity issue. On February 20, 2014, the Board held the remand hearing \u201cto determine the status of the license under the provisions of [Maryland Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol.) Article 2B, \u00a7 10-504(d) (\u201cArticle 2B \u00a7 10-504(d)\u201d) ]\u201d related to liquor license transfers and the expiration of a license 180 days after a license holder has closed the business or ceased actual alcoholic beverages business operations in Baltimore City. At that hearing, the Association argued that the License had \u201csat dormant since July 2009,\u201d and even though the \u201cBoard approved the application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>transfer of ownership to a new location and repeatedly extended [the] approval, no transfer was ever completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The Contract Purchasers argued that the annual renewal of the License without protest \u201ccan certainly be construed as a tolling of the period under Article 2B.\u201d Moreover, the \u201cvalidity\u201d of their License for May 1, 2013-April 30, 2014, \u201cwas ruled upon,\u201d and because they had relied on the renewals and the direction they received from the Board, \u201cprinciples of collateral estoppel\u201d and res judicata precluded revisiting the validity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The Board, in the \u201cdecision phase\u201d of the February 20, 2014 hearing, concluded that \u201ceven with an extension, legal or otherwise, the [LJicense would have been considered dormant\u201d as of October 17, 2011, notwithstanding extensions or \u201ca transfer of ownership hearing after that time.\u201d Characterizing the Contract Purchasers\u2019 arguments as \u201cgenerally centering] around estoppel,\u201d the Board concluded \u201cthat the only way to avoid the injustice ... is to declare the [Ljicense viable as of today.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The Association again sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. On August 13, 2014, a Stipulation of Dismissal and Agreement for Remand to the Board was entered at the request of the Board and the Association and, on September 17, 2014, the circuit court issued an order remanding to the Board and dismissing the case. The stated purpose of the remand was \u201cso the [Board] can conduct further proceedings on this matter within sixty (60) days after the date of the dismissal of this appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The second remand hearing was held on September 25, 2014.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Contract Purchasers moved to dismiss the proceeding on the grounds that the Board had failed to inform them of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the judicial review proceedings challenging the Board\u2019s February 20, 2014 decision that the License was \u201cviable.\u201d In response, the Chair noted that the Contract Purchasers had actual notice of the judicial review proceedings because their counsel, by \u201cletter dated April 9, 2014,\u201d wrote the then-Chairman of the Board acknowledging that the Association \u201chad filed an appeal in the Circuit Court.\u201d Observing that the Contract Purchasers had not appealed the circuit court decision, the Board denied the motion to dismiss and the hearing proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">As to the Board\u2019s right to reconsider the viability of the License, the Association argued that the issue was not one of fact, but one of law that the Board was entitled to review. It pointed out that the Board\u2019s prior decision had been based on a theory of estoppel resulting from the Board\u2019s acceptance of renewal fees after the License had expired. But, it argued, \u201cthe government cannot be estopped under the same terms as other litigants,\u201d and the Contract Purchasers could not rely on the \u201cunauthorized acts\u201d of the Board\u2019s agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The Association called as a witness former Senator George Della, who had sponsored the 2000 legislation creating Article 2B \u00a7 10\u2014504(d), which is commonly referred to as the \u201c180 day rule.\u201d According to Senator Della:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">It basically says [a] license can remain dormant for 180 days. And then if there\u2019s a hardship, then that licensee can come back to the [Bjoard and make their case, if they\u2019re in a hardship situation. And then the Board could then grant them another extension of 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u215c \u215c \u215d \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">Beyond that, if they don\u2019t activate that license, that license is dead. That\u2019s what the legislative intent is behind the 180 day rule. And the Board knew it. The Board knew it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ6\">Counsel for the Contract Purchasers stated that they were not arguing estoppel or a mistake by the Board or its agents. Nor were they relying on the hardship extension provisions of the statute. Rather, they were contending, citing <em>Yim, LLC v. Tuzeer, </em>211 Md.App. 1, 63 A.3d 1078 (2013), that, notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>standing cessation of the business itself, the successive renewals of the License \u201ctolls the 180 period.\u201d In addition, the Contract Purchasers advanced a policy argument that the Board\u2019s adoption of the Association\u2019s position would thwart redevelopment efforts in the city because these projects can \u201ctake years\u201d to complete. The better policy, in their view, was to permit a developer to \u201cpreserve\u201d an existing license by renewals rather than issuing a new license. That, they argued, would satisfy the legislative \u201cgoal [of] reducing] the number of licenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In response, counsel for the Association asserted that the Contract Purchasers\u2019 policy argument \u201cis essentially something to be taken up with the legislature,\u201d but it did not reflect the intent of the current legislation, and thus, its adoption by the Board would be a \u201crewrite [of] the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The Board expressly ruled on the validity of the License and, by implication, on the Contract Purchasers\u2019 recently filed hardship extension request, which would fail in the absence of a viable License to transfer. The Chairman concluded that \u201cthe license has expired.\u201d He based his decision on the \u201cclear command of the law,\u201d and which had been \u201cignored\u201d by the Board in granting the earlier purported extensions and license renewals \u201coutside the scope of its authority.\u201d Commissioner Petersen Moore \u201cagree[d]\u201d with the Chairman \u201cfor all the reasons stated.\u201d Although Commissioner Jones also agreed that \u201cthe license is dead,\u201d he voted \u201cno\u201d because, under the circumstances, he thought that a \u201csecond chance is needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On October 7, 2014, the Contract Purchasers filed a Petition for Judicial Review. A hearing was held on May 1, 2015, and on May 5, 2015, the circuit court reversed the Board, stating that its decision \u201cwas not supported by substantial evidence and was clearly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d The court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">failure to complete a transfer of a license within 180 days pursuant to Art. 2B \u00a7 10-503(d)(4) does not carry a sanction of expiration of the license. To hold that such a sanction applies is illogical in the face of Art. 2B \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)(i), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>which provides an exception to the 10\u2014504(d)(2) 180 day expiration provision when a transfer \u201chas been approved or is pending.\u201d Furthermore, in the instant case the Board approved the transfer on July 23, 2009, and the record contains several references to the approval and the fact that the transfer \u201cremains pending.\u201d Thus, the 2B \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)\u00ae exception for approved or pending transfers would apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The Board filed its timely appeal on May 29, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cOn appellate review of the decision of an administrative agency, this Court reviews the agency\u2019s decision, not the circuit court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 273, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012) (quoting <em>Halici v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>180 Md.App. 238, 248, 949 A.2d 85 (2008)). We \u201cdetermine whether the agency\u2019s decision is in accordance with the law or whether it is arbitrary, illegal, and capricious.\u201d <em>Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. at 274, 47 A.3d 1087 (quoting <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v. Ives, </em>136 Md.App. 581, 585, 766 A.2d 657 (2001)). In doing so, we will uphold factual decisions and discretionary judgments that are \u201csupported reasonably by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>HNS Dev., LLC v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>425 Md. 436, 449, 42 A.3d 12 (2012) (citations omitted). Our review of the agency\u2019s legal conclusions is less deferential, but, we respect the agency\u2019s expertise in its field and give considerable weight to its interpretation and application of any statutes or regulations it is charged with administering. <em>Thanner Enters., LLC v. Balt. Cty., </em>414 Md. 265, 275, 995 A.2d 257 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">When, as here, the issue centers on statutory construction, and thus, legislative intent, we look first at \u201cthe statute\u2019s plain language as ordinarily understood\u201d because that is \u201c[t]he most reliable indicator of the [legislative] intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 995 A.2d 257. And, when the language is \u201cclear and unambiguous, we ordinarily \u2018need not look beyond [its] provisions and our analysis ends.\u2019 \u201d <em>Opert v. Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>403 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Md. 587, 593, 943 A.2d 1229 (2008) (alteration added) (quoting <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 173, 935 A.2d 699 (2007)). \u201c[Wjhere a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but then-meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986). In other words, a provision within an integrated statutory scheme must be understood in its broader context and, to the extent possible, harmonized with the other provisions. <em>Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>305 Md. 145, 157, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Association contends that under Article 2B, \u00a7 10-504(d), a liquor license in Baltimore City expires 180 days after the licensee \u201chas closed the business or ceased active alcoholic beverage business operations.\u201d If an application to transfer the license is filed and approved by the Board, the Association asserts that the approved transfer <em>\u201cmust </em>be completed\u2014by operating an alcoholic beverage business\u2014within 180 days,\u201d unless, under Article 2B \u00a7 10-504(d)(4), the Board finds that undue hardship exists.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original). Therefore, it argues, the grant of any extensions in this case was contrary to the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute, and any Board practice or course of conduct \u201cinconsistent with the statutory scheme\u201d is entitled to \u201cno weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">As to the applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the Association contends that the Board, \u201cas a government agency,\u201d cannot be \u201cestopped from applying the express direction it has been given by the Legislature merely because an employee of the agency accepted [a renewal] payment for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>expired license.\u201d In support, it cites <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 195, 783 A.2d 169 (2001) (Baltimore County Board of Appeals not estopped from enforcing zoning regulation that prevented appellant, who had substantially constructed a reptile barn and obtained a permit approval to do so from the Baltimore County Department of Permits and Licenses, from using his property to breed reptiles); <em>ARA Health Servs., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety and Corr. Servs., </em>344 Md. 85, 95, 685 A.2d 435 (1996) (Department of Corrections not estopped from seeking reimbursement for overpayment of a contract provider to which the Department had remitted the excessive payments without objection); and <em>Heckler v. Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford Cty. Inc., </em>467 U.S. 51, 60, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984) (Department of Health and Human Services not estopped from recouping overpayments made to a nonprofit organization).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The Board contends that \u201cunder the appropriate interpretation of the applicable statutory provisions, the License had expired as a matter of law.\u201d The transfer application was approved by the Board on July 23, 2009, and under Article 2B \u00a7 10-503(d), the transfer had to be completed by January 19, 2010. Once the 180 day expiration period provided for in the statute was \u201cno longer suspended,\u201d the License \u201cwhich had already been inactive for well over 180 days\u2014expired as a matter of law.\u201d Therefore, according to the Board, any \u201cpurported\u201d extensions were invalid because they are not authorized by the statute. And, \u201c[t]he same analysis applies\u201d to the Board\u2019s acceptance of renewal fees \u201cfor the inactive License,\u201d because the renewal of the License does not \u201creset\u201d or \u201cextend\u201d the \u201c180 day rule.\u201d The Board recognizes, however, that there may be a situation where the transfer deadline \u201cover-lapis] two licensing periods.\u201d When that happens, the license would have to be renewed \u201cbefore the transfer has been completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Contract Purchasers mount a two pronged attack on the denial of their motion to dismiss the remand proceedings. The first is the failure of the Board to notify them of the judicial review proceeding initiated by the Association and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>subsequent remand to the Board by stipulation. The second is the contention that the Board was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">barred from holding a second hearing on the same issue when a substantial record has already been created before it, it rendered a decision based on that record ... and no hearing of any kind, nor ruling made on any substantive issue, has been heard nor rendered by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">As to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute at the September 17, 2014, remand hearing, the Contract Purchasers appear to object to the fact that Senator Della had been called as a witness and had testified to the intent of the \u201c180 day rule\u201d legislation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They further contend that the Board \u201caccepted legal conclusions drawn by [Senator] Della as the basis for its decision.\u201d More particularly, however, they point to \u201cthe lack of recognition by both [Senator Della] and [the Board] of the pertinent section of Article 2B, namely \u00a7 10-504(d)(2)(i).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They argue that the subsection\u2019s \u201cthen pending\u201d language \u201cexpand[s] upon the 180 day rule,\u201d and, citing <em>Yim, </em>211 Md.App. at 36, 63 A.3d 1078, that a purchaser of such a license can keep a license from expiring by annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>renewals of the license as long as the intended transfer remains \u201cpending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The Board, in its reply brief, contends that the Contract Purchasers\u2019 reliance on <em>Yim </em>is \u201cmisplaced\u201d because the <em>Yim </em>Court \u201cmerely held that a liquor license did not expire when the licensee had filed a timely request for a hardship extension under \u00a7 10\u2014504(d)(2)(iii) of Article 2B, even though the licensee did not file his annual renewal application on time while the hardship request was pending.\u201d As to \u201cimpermissibly\u201d relying on the testimony of Senator Della \u201cas the basis\u201d for its interpretation of the statutory language, the Board \u201cmade clear that it was not seeking a legal conclusion\u201d but \u201conly background information on the legislative history\u201d from Senator Della and it made only a mention of legislative history in its \u201cmethodically summarized\u201d opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In regard to the Contract Purchasers\u2019 argument that the Board was not authorized to hold the September 25, 2014 hearing and reconsider its February 20, 2014 decision, the Board states that it denied the Contract Purchasers\u2019 motion to dismiss and the circuit court had agreed. Therefore, in the absence of an appeal of the circuit court decision by the Contract Purchasers, the denial of the motion to dismiss was not \u201cproperly\u201d before the Board in the September 25, 2014 hearing but had it been, it would fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Regarding the Board\u2019s failure to provide notice to the Contract Purchasers of the Association\u2019s petition for judicial review, the Board argues that the record demonstrates actual notice to the Contract Purchasers within three weeks of the petition being filed. Nevertheless, they took no action to participate in the proceeding in the months leading up to the circuit court\u2019s remand to the Board. Moreover, any \u201ctechnical deficits\u201d resulting from the Board\u2019s failure to provide notice \u201cwere cured\u201d because there was no judicial review as a result of the remand and the Contract Purchasers had a full opportunity to participate in the subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">As to Contract Purchasers\u2019 res judicata argument, the Board, citing <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Cecil Cty. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Racine, </em>24 Md.App. 435, 450, 332 A.2d 306 (1975), acknowledges that principles of res judicata may apply to a final administrative agency decision \u201cpassed in the exercise of its discretion upon issues of fact or upon mixed issues of law and fact.\u201d But, \u201cwhen there has been substantial change of conditions or it is shown that the decision was the product of ... mistake,\u201d the Board\u2019s decision may be reconsidered and, in the proper case, reversed. <em>Id. </em>Here, on remand, the Board \u201cwas singularly focused\u201d on \u201creconsidering its prior interpretation and application of the law,\u201d and not the facts of the case. Not only did the Board have the right to reconsider, it had a duty to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The Association, in its reply brief, also responds to the Contract Purchasers\u2019 argument that the remand proceedings should have been dismissed based on \u201clack of notice\u201d by the Board and \u201cprinciples of <em>res judicata.\u201d </em>In regard to the former, it too references the Contract Purchasers\u2019 actual notice and their failure to intervene. Regarding the latter, the Association contends that the remand meant that there was no final judgment. The February 20, 2014, decision of the Board went to the circuit court on the Association\u2019s petition for judicial review and was then remanded to the Board for further proceedings without a ruling on the merits. But, even if there had been a final judgment, the Association agrees that \u201can agency is not bound by inflexible principles of res judicata with regard to decisions that are legally, as opposed to factually, erroneous.\u201d Quoting <em>Radio Communications, Inc. v. Public Service Commission of Maryland., </em>50 Md.App. 422, 430-31, 441 A.2d 346 (1982), the Association asserts \u201can affirmative duty upon an administrative agency to correct a prior decision when, because of an error of law, a continued adherence to its erroneous decision would place a litigant at an unfair disadvantage.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The Association rejects the circuit court\u2019s reading of Article 2B, \u00a7 10-503(d)(4) that a \u201cpending\u201d transfer would extend the life of the License. It contends that argument is \u201cbased on a misreading\u201d of the relevant provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>As to the Contract Purchasers\u2019 reliance on <em>Yim, </em>the Association asserts that the \u201cprimary issue\u201d in that case was \u201cwhether alleged defects in applications to transfer the license rendered the transfers ineffective.\u201d But, because \u201cany defects in the applications to transfer had been corrected ... the statutory period was tolled,\u201d and the License did not expire. In its view, the Contract Purchasers \u201chave attempted to seize on language in dictum in a footnote in <em>Yim\u201d </em>that is unrelated to the Court\u2019s decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We begin by addressing the Contract Purchasers\u2019 arguments regarding the denial of their motion to dismiss the remand proceeding. The first argument relates to the failure of the Board to notify them that the Association had sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s February 20, 2014, decision regarding the License.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They raised this argument in passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>at the September 25, 2014 remand hearing and in the circuit court hearing on their Petition for Judicial Review of the Board\u2019s Decision. They also argued that the Board violated its Administrative Rule Number One, which was adopted to avoid the Board \u201creviewing the decisions of past liquor boards\u201d and required motions for reconsideration to be filed within sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The circuit court expressly rejected the argument related to Administrative Rule Number One because there was no motion for reconsideration in this case. The circuit court otherwise found the \u201cdenial of the motion to dismiss was appropriate\u201d and moved directly to the issue of whether the License had \u201cexpired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Contract Purchasers did not press the notification argument or question the court\u2019s failure to expressly address it, and they did not appeal the court\u2019s decision. Therefore, the issue is not before us on appeal, but, if it were, they would fare no better.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Not only did the Contract Purchasers have actual notice of the petition for judicial review \u201cas early as April 9, 2014,\u201d they took no action in that proceeding in the 161 days between that date and September 17, 2014, when the court signed the order for remand. And, because of the remand, there was no judicial review on the merits. In short, the purpose of the rule was effectively satisfied, and the Contract Purchasers were not deprived of an opportunity to assert their legal rights before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">As to any concern regarding Senator Della\u2019s testimony, the circuit court did not \u201cfind any error,\u201d and it is clear from the record that the Board\u2019s decision that the License had expired was based on the plain language of the applicable statutory provisions and not on Senator Della\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The Contract Purchasers argue that the Board was \u201cbarred from holding a second hearing [because] a substantial record ha[d] already been created before it, it [had] rendered a decision based on that record, and no hearing of any kind, nor ruling made on any substantive issue, ha[d] been heard nor rendered by the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.\u201d In support, they cite <em>Gaywood Comty. Ass\u2019n v. Metro. Transit Auth., </em>246 Md. 93, 227 A.2d 735 (1967); <em>Woodlawn Area Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Board of Cty. Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s Cty., </em>241 Md. 187, 216 A.2d 149 (1966); <em>Whittle v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals of Balt. Cty., </em>211 Md. 36, 125 A.2d 41 (1956); <em>Bensel v. Mayor and City Council of Balt., </em>203 Md. 506, 101 A.2d 826 (1954); and <em>Mayor and City Council of Balt. v. Linthicum, </em>170 Md. 245, 183 A. 531 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">They assert that such cases, especially <em>Whittle, </em>211 Md. 36, 125 A.2d 41, stand for the proposition that the Board, as an administrative body exercising quasi-judicial authority, could not reach a different conclusion on the viability of the License because \u201cthe facts and the law ... have remained unchanged since February 20, 2014.\u201d Quoting <em>Gaywood Community Ass\u2019n, </em>246 Md. at 99-100, 227 A.2d 735, they state that their argument \u201crest[s] not strictly on the doctrine of res judicata, but upon the proposition that it would be arbitrary for the Board to arrive at opposite conclusions on substantially the same state of facts and the same law.\u201d They draw further support from <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>486, 331 A.2d 55 (1975), in which the agency first determined that the claimant was an independent contractor, and later, \u201cupon its own initiative,\u201d and on the same facts, determined he was an employee. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 331 A.2d 55. There, the Court of Appeals held that the agency\u2019s \u201cattempt to redetermine [Gould\u2019s] status was clearly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMk\">The redetermination in this case came about when the Association filed for judicial review of the Board\u2019s initial decision. Rather than a reapplication of the same facts to the same law, the issue before the Board in the \u201csecond hearing\u201d was essentially the interpretation of the law itself, and whether it had made a mistake in its prior interpretation of the controlling law. Because it determined that it had, the Board could reverse its prior decision. As the <em>Racine </em>Court concluded: \u201cPerpetuation of illegality by an administrative body by inflexible application of the principle of res judicata is impermissible.\u201d <em>Racine, </em>24 Md.App. at 452, 332 A.2d 306. Notably, the <em>Racine </em>Court found support for that conclusion in <em>Gould, </em>in which the Court of Appeals stated \u201c[mjistaken interpretations of law, however honestly arrived at, are held not to be within the exercise of sound administrative discretion and the legislative prerogative, but to be arbitrary and illegal.\u201d 273 Md. at 521, 331 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"ArK\">Turning now to the expiration of the License in this case, our analysis begins and ends with the provisions of Article 2B, \u00a7 10-504(d), read in the context of the statutory scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a0l-dedup-0\">(d) Baltimore City.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4D\">(1)(i) This subsection applies only in Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aud\">(ii) In this subsection, \u201cBoard\u201d means the Board of License Commissioners or the Office of the Comptroller, whichever is the issuing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIx\">(2) 180 days after the holder of any license issued under the provisions of this article has closed the business or ceased active alcoholic beverages business operation of the business for which the license is held, the license shall expire unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>(i) An <em>application </em>for approval of a transfer to another location or an <em>application </em>for assignment to another person pursuant to \u00a7 10-503(d)[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] of this subtitle <em>has been approved or is then </em>pending;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auk-dedup-0\">(ii) An <em>application </em>pursuant to \u00a7 10-506[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] of this subtitle <em>has been approved or is then pending-, </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgU\">(iii) A <em>written request for a hardship extension, </em>as provided in this subsection, is <em>filed within the 180-day period.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXq\">(3) The licensee or other appropriate interested parties may-make a written request to the Board for an extension of the life of the license due to undue hardship, <em>for a time period of no more than a cumulative period of 360 days </em>after the date of closing or cessation of alcoholic beverages business operations of the business for which the license is held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMb\">(4) After a hearing conducted on the extension request, on a finding that undue hardship currently exists causing the closing or cessation of business operations, the board may grant an extension of the life of the license for a time period not to exceed 360 days as defined in paragraphs (3) and (5) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5e\">(5) It is the intent of this subsection that <em>the total time period for which a license may be deemed unexpired under paragraph (2) of this subsection is 180 days if no undue hardship extension is granted, and no more than 360 days if an undue hardship extension has been granted. </em>The time period begins at the earlier of the closing of the business or cessation of alcoholic beverages business, and shall be tolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>only upon the filing of an application or request described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the expiration period to begin running again, cumulatively to the time period before the filing of the application or request, upon the occurrence of the later to occur of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ama-dedup-1\">(i) Final action of the Board granting or denying a request authorized by paragraph (3) of this subsection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1N\">(ii) Final action of the Board denying an application described under paragraph (2)(i) or (ii) of this subsection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ass-dedup-0\">(iii) Final judgment of the appellate court when judicial review of the Board\u2019s action on an application or request authorized by paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection has been sought, or on dismissal of a petition for judicial review.

The 180 days can be tolled by \u201c[a]n application for approval of a transfer to another location or an application for assignment to another person\u201d which \u201chas been approved or is then pending.\u201d In context, \u201cpending\u201d clearly refers to a transfer application that is awaiting Board action and not the intended completed transfer. In the absence of a \u201chardship extension\u201d by the Board, the transfer of the License had to be completed not more than 180 days after the Board <em>approved </em>the transfer on July 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"AZi\">Not only is the plain language of the statute clear, paragraph (5) of the subsection states the legislative intent, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u201cthe total time period for which a license may be deemed unexpired ... is 180 days if no undue hardship extension is granted, and no more than 360 days if an undue hardship extension has been granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10-503(d)(5). And, this same intent is reflected in other related statutory provisions. For example, the initial transfer request was filed under \u00a7 10-503(d), which also provides that the transfer \u201cshall be completed not more than 180 days after the Board approves the transfer.\u201d And, under section 10\u2014504(d), a hardship extension \u201cfiled within the 180 day period,\u201d may extend the life of the license to \u201cno more than 360 days\u201d from \u201cthe date of closing or cessation of alcoholic beverages business operations!!]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">When the application was approved on July 23, 2009, the applicant had 180 days to complete the transfer, i.e., until January 19, 2010, subject to filing a request for a hardship extension during the 180 day period.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As noted, no hardship extension request was filed until August 13, 2013. But, even if the first 180 day extension could be considered a hardship extension, the transfer had to be completed within 360 days of the closing of the business or the cessation of liquor sales in July of 2009.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">At the September 25, 2014 hearing, counsel for the Contract Purchasers indicated that they had \u201cnever filed for 180 day hardship, but what [they] did do was renew the license every year,\u201d and that \u201cthe renewal tolls the 180 day period\u201d to complete the transfer. On appeal, and \u201c[assuming arguendo, the five (5) years of license renewals cannot be construed as evidence of a \u2018pending transfer,\u2019 \u201d the Contract Purchasers argue, citing <em>Yim, </em>\u201cthe renewals are still permitted by law to preserve the validity of the licensef.]\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>In <em>Yim, </em>the Court considered whether a liquor license issued to Two Sisters, LLC for its restaurant operation had expired for its failure to renew the license in a timely manner. 211 Md.App. at 21-24, 63 A.3d 1078. In its analysis, the Court noted the difference between the Board\u2019s authority to accept a late filed renewal application and its authority under Article 2B \u00a7 10-504(d), where \u201c[sjeparate statutory provisions apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 63 A.3d 1078. The Court concluded that a late filed renewal application, which could be accepted by the Board, did not preclude the filing of a hardship extension within 180 days of the \u201clast day of active alcoholic beverages business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 63 A.3d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The Contract Purchasers seek support in a footnote in <em>Yim </em>that states: \u201cAs we discuss below, this time period [the 360 days from cessation of alcoholic beverages business] is held in abeyance upon the receipt of a transfer or renewal application, making the effective length of the hardship extension longer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36 n.30, 63 A.3d 1078. The footnote is unrelated to the issue being considered by the <em>Yim </em>Court and has no application to the facts of this case. In its later discussion, the Court states that if the Board \u201cgrants the transfer application, the transfer <em>must occur within 180 days of the Board\u2019s approval.\u201d Id. </em>at 38, 63 A.3d 1078 (emphasis added). But, \u201conce the Board granted the hardship extension request, Two Sisters\u2019 license was considered unexpired for 360 days after Two Sisters stopped serving alcohol.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated that the 360 days is tolled when \u201ca transfer application is pending\u201d and commented that \u201cthere is no statutory requirement that Board render a decision on a transfer application within a certain period of time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The language of the footnote in no way suggests that the renewal of a license overcomes the requirements of Article 2B \u00a7 10-504(d) to complete an <em>approved </em>transfer within 180 days of the approval in the absence of a granted hardship extension request. At most, it recognizes a possible delay between the filing of a transfer request and it being acted upon by the Board. <em>See </em>footnote 17, <em>supra </em>at 21, 63 A.3d 1078. That the Two Sisters license \u201csurvived beyond Two Sisters\u2019 business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>itself and lived on to be renewed or transferred,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 63 A.3d 1078, simply means that the Two Sisters license was kept alive on the statutory life support of a timely hardship extension request that was filed within 180 days of the cessation of the alcohol sales business.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In sum, the Board correctly determined that the License had expired. And, neither the approved but uncompleted transfer nor the Board\u2019s subsequent renewals of the License could imbue it with new life.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
