At the closing a month later, Ms. Mitchell, to her surprise, realized that the loan documents she had just executed were actually for an adjustable rate mortgage. She halted the closing, had the word \u201cVOID\u201d stamped on all executed documents, and informed the lender of the error and requested acknowledgment of cancellation in writing. Several days and notices later, the lender sent Ms. Mitchell a notice stating that her loan had been modified to a fixed rate loan at 6.2% interest. Ms. Mitchell was apparently satisfied with this and made payments on the loan for nearly eight years after <em>moving </em>into the residence. No new loan documents were executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Ms. Mitchell defaulted in January 2018, and in August 2015, substitute trustees for the current loan servicer, Keith M. Yacko, Robert E. Frazier, Thomas J. Gartner, Jason L. Hamlin, Glen H. Tschirgi, and Gene Jung (\u201cAppellees\u201d or \u201cSubstitute Trustees\u201d), filed an order to docket a foreclosure in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Ms. Mitchell filed a motion to stay the sale and dismiss the action, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the order to docket did not contain copies of a valid and enforceable note or deed of trust. After her motion was denied without a hearing, Ms. Mitchell appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">A close examination of the documents in the record reveals that on July 14, 2005\u2014three days after Ms. Mitchell terminated the closing\u2014the adjustable rate deed of trust was filed in the land records for Prince George\u2019s County with the \u201cVOID\u201d marks excised. This document, devoid of all \u201cVOID\u201d marks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>was attached as an exhibit to the 2015 order to docket filed 10 years later. Also, appearing for the first time was a copy of the Adjustable Rate Note that Ms. Mitchell signed at the closing, with the \u201cVOID\u201d stamps removed. In place of the \u201cVOID\u201d stamps, both documents donned new stamps reading simply \u201cREDACTED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Ms. Mitchell raises four questions in her appeal, but the first is dispositive: \u201cDid the Circuit Court err in failing to dismiss the foreclosure action because the Note and Deed of Trust in the Order to Docket are not valid and enforceable?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that a foreclosure proceeding cannot be instituted upon forged documents. The aforementioned documents\u2014 clearly false and materially altered to look genuine\u2014suggest forgery,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and equitable relief is not available to a party with unclean hands. Ms. Mitchell\u2019s Rule 14-211 motion to stay the sale and dismiss the action stated a facially valid defense to the foreclosure. As such, the circuit court erred in denying the motion without a hearing. We vacate the court\u2019s order and remand for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"all-dedup-0\">A. Closing the Closing</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In June 2005, Rene Mitchell decided to purchase residential property located at 9003 Harness Way in the City of Bowie, Maryland (\u201cthe Property\u201d) from Maria and Harold J. Moxley. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>On June 8, 2005, Ms. Mitchell signed a sales contract, listing the purchase price at $555,900.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Ms. Mitchell desired to finance the purchase with a fixed rate 80-year mortgage from Fremont Investment and Loan (\u201cFremont\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to an affidavit she filed in the underlying foreclosure action, Ms. Mitchell and Fremont had agreed to a conventional fixed rate loan, as documented by the terms of the sales contract. However, at the closing on July 11, 2005, Ms. Mitchell noticed, contrary to her expectations and much to her surprise, that the promissory note contained an adjustable interest rate and the deed of trust contained an adjustable rate rider.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Ms. Mitchell then informed her realtor and the settlement agents of the error, requested that the closing be terminated, and refused to sign any further documents. She also requested the return of all documents that she had signed up to that point. E. 34. Although the settlement agents, Barbara Licon and Philip Sardelis, agreed to terminate the closing, they told Ms. Mitchell that they had to keep the documents and shred them. Consequently, Ms. Mitchell requested that they stamp a \u201cVOID\u201d mark on each page of each document that she signed. Ms. Licon complied. Ms. Mitchell also wrote a note on the adjustable rate note which read: \u201cI requested this copy of Voided documents with Barbara Licon signature of Void [sic]. My Realtor is present to witness. We are to come back tomorrow to execute corrected documents. I have requested Fremont provide me a letter acknowledging cancellation of this debt loan, Deed + promissory note. RM[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Ms. Mitchell followed-up on the same day with the following letter to Fremont:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">I am requesting that you immediately cancel my loan and return all monies due back to me based on the Loan Documents, executed by Sandler Title &amp; Escrow, LLC on behalf of Fremont Investment &amp; Loan, not reflecting my sales contract!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Upon my review of the signed loan documents prepared by Barbara Licon from Sandler Title <em>&amp; </em>Escrow, LLC ... [t]he loan package was not explained very well and was rushed. I saw many errors in the loan package mid way through the closing and stopped the closing. Ms. Licon stated that they would correct the documents and I must immediately contact Fremont Investment &amp; Loan directly and cancel the original loan documents, which she kept in her possession, claiming she would have to shred. I kept the blank documents and requested her to draw a void line across each one. None of the second copy documents have my signature and I am very uncomfortable with leaving the original documents for her to shred but she states this is a normal procedure. My realtor Paula Haynes was a witness to this conversation between Ms. Licon and me as was the notary Mr. Phillip Sardelis who also signed the documents as we went through them. Both can also verify that I requested the documents to this loan be destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">... The loan terms are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">1st Mortgage 30 year conventional firm fixed at an interest rate of 6.200%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">2nd Mortgage 30 year conventional firm fixed at an interest rate of 9.125%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">Please advise me on what the next course of action is to provide new accurate loan documents for review and signatures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">Again, this is my official notice to cancel the original Adjustable Rate loan documents that I did not agree to purchase and were not accurate based on the attached documents for the property at 9003 Harness Way, Bowie[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Fremont responded by letter on July 12, 2005, acknowledging receipt of Ms. Mitchell\u2019s request to cancel her loan. Fremont agreed to cancel the loan \u201ctransaction,\u201d and indicated there was a \u201cnew transaction\u201d that was adjusted to provide the \u201cproper loan requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On the same day, Fremont issued two notices to Ms. Mitchell. The first affirmed that, \u201c[a]s of the date of this Notice, the principal loan balance that is owed to Fremont Investment <em>&amp; </em>Loan for 444,728.00 AT 8.6770% ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE AS REFLECTED ON THE FEDERAL TRUTH-IN-LENDING DISCLOSURE STATEMENT IS CANCELLED AS OF THE ABOVE REFERENCED DATE.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The second notice stated that Ms. Mitchell\u2019s loan would henceforth be a conventional fixed rate loan, and provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">As of the date of this Notice, the principal loan balance that is owed to Fremont Investment <em>&amp; </em>Loan for 444,728.00 AT 6.200% 360 MONTHS CONVENTIONAL FIXED RATE FULLY AMORTIZING LOAN.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>In addition, we would like to advise you that you have thirty (30) days after receipt of this Notice to dispute the validity of the above debt, or any portion thereof. If you do not do so, the debt will be assumed to be valid. If you canceled notify us in writing within this thirty (30) day period that you dispute the debt, or any portion thereof, we will obtain and mail to you verification of the debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">Furthermore, you have thirty (30) days after the receipt of this Notice to request the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor. Upon receipt of a written request from you within the thirty (30) day period, we will provide you with the name and address of your original creditor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">No new loan documents were executed. On July 15, 2005, Fremont returned the cancelled documents\u2014the deed of trust and note, bearing the \u201cVOID\u201d marks and Ms. Mitchell\u2019s handwritten note\u2014to Ms. Mitchell. Significantly, the first pages of the deed and note sent to Ms. Mitchell contain stamps reading \u201cCANCELLED AND SATISFIED IN FULL without recourse\u201d followed by a signature line dated July 15, 2005. Although it takes some deciphering, the signature line on the stamp reads \u201cFremont Investment &amp; Loan, Lizbeth Stokes, Vice President.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">B. Foreclosure Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Ms. Mitchell lived at the Property and made consistent payments for almost eight years. On January 1, 2013, Ms. Mitchell first failed to make a payment on the loan and continued to miss installment payments each month thereafter, according to the affidavit of default and indebtedness executed by an agent for the loan servicing company.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>On October 10, 2014, the Substitute Trustees, acting for U.S. Bank, sent a notice of intent to foreclose to Ms. Mitchell. Then, on August 24, 2015, the Substitute Trustees filed an order to docket foreclosure in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As required by Maryland Rule 14-207, the order to docket foreclosure contained copies of a note and deed of trust as exhibits revealing that 10 years earlier a deed of trust was filed in the land records for Prince George\u2019s County on July 14, 2005\u2014-just three days after the terminated closing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These documents were apparently doctored, because they <em>do not </em>bear the \u201cVOID\u201d marks. Instead, the copy of the deed of trust filed with the order to docket bears the marking \u201cREDACTED\u201d on each page, and contains an adjustable rate rider. Similarly, each page of the adjustable rate note bears the marking \u201cREDACTED.\u201d The note does not contain the \u201cVOID\u201d marks, Ms. Mitchell\u2019s handwritten note, or the lend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>er\u2019s cancellation mark.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">As further required by Maryland Rule 14-207, the order to docket contains an affidavit, executed by the servicing agent, stating that the note is a \u201ctrue and accurate copy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Another affidavit, this one executed by Robert E. Frazier, affirms, in pertinent part, \u201c[t]hat [ ] attached hereto is a true and accurate copy of the Deed of Trust that is the lien instrument subject to this foreclosure action. If applicable, any personal and/or private information has been redacted as noted on the document.\u201d The Substitute Trustees also filed an affidavit of default and indebtedness, stating that, as of June 25, 2015, Ms. Mitchell owed $478,879.94.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">On September 25, 2015, before the Substitute Trustees filed the final loss mitigation affidavit, Ms. Mitchell filed, under Maryland Rule 14-211, a \u201cMotion to Dismiss for Improper Service and Motion to Stay Sale and Dismiss Action for Failure to State a Claim.\u201d In her <em>pro se </em>motion, she argued that she was not served properly and that the action should, as a result, be dismissed. On the merits she argued that: (1) the order to docket did not provide a copy of a valid and enforceable note or deed of trust because the note and deed of trust were voided; (2) the Substitute Trustees and U.S. Bank had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>failed to plead that they owned or held the note and deed of trust; and (3) the note was non-negotiable and the indorsement was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">On November 6, 2015, the Substitute Trustees filed an opposition, arguing that Ms. Mitchell was served properly. In addition, the Substitute Trustees contended that the note and deed of trust were valid and had not been cancelled, but that only the loan\u2019s interest rate had been adjusted, and that this was consistent with the fact that Ms. Mitchell never returned the proceeds of the loan and made consistent payments for almost eight years. The Substitute Trustees further maintained that they included an affidavit certifying ownership and proper indorsement of the note in their order to docket foreclosure and that the note was negotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On February 11, 2016, the circuit court, without a hearing, entered an order denying Ms. Mitchell\u2019s motion to stay the sale and dismiss the action. On March 14, 2016, Ms. Mitchell timely noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The Voided Note and Deed</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Before this Court, Ms. Mitchell argues that the note was voided before the closing was completed, and that she can-celled the transaction properly, as acknowledged by Fremont in their cancellation notices. She contends that the note and deed of trust included in the order to docket are fraudulent because someone had removed the \u201cVOID\u201d marks and other information.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The Substitute Trustees respond by claiming that Ms. Mitchell and Fremont modified the interest rate, and that they did not cancel the loan. They observe that Ms. Mitchell\u2019s actions in keeping the loan proceeds and making consistent payments on the note as if it were a fixed rate loan for almost eight years are inconsistent with the cancellation of the note and deed of trust. Indeed, they point out that Ms. Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>moved into the house and made payments to the bank without demanding a new note or deed of trust\u2014a beguiling argument, until we examine the evidence and see that it is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We open our analysis with Maryland Rule 14-207, which addresses the pleadings and exhibits that must be filed to commence a foreclosure, and Rule 14-211, which addresses a borrower\u2019s ability to file a motion to stay a foreclosure sale. Maryland Rule 14-207(a) provides that \u201c[a]n action to foreclose a lien pursuant to a power of sale shall be commenced by filing an order to docket.\u201d Maryland Rule 14-207(a)(l). Then, subsection (b) specifies which exhibits must be filed with the order to docket. Relevant to the present case, an order to docket must \u201cinclude or be accompanied by:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">(1) a copy of the lien instrument supported by an affidavit that it is a true and accurate copy, or, in an action to foreclose a statutory lien, a copy of a notice of the existence of the lien supported by an affidavit that it is a true and accurate copy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">(2) an affidavit by the secured party, the plaintiff, or the agent or attorney of either that the plaintiff has the right to foreclose and a statement of the debt remaining due and payable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">(3) a copy of any separate note or other debt instrument supported by an affidavit that it is a true and accurate copy and certifying ownership of the debt instrument;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">(4) a copy of any assignment of the lien instrument for purposes of foreclosure or deed of appointment of a substitute trustee supported by an affidavit that it is a true and accurate copy of the assignment or deed of appointment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Md. Rule 14\u2014207(b) (emphasis added). The law is clear then, that in order to commence a foreclosure action pursuant to a power of sale, as in the present case, one must file an order to docket a foreclosure accompanied by copies of the lien instrument (the deed of trust) and the debt instrument (the note), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>supported by affidavits stating that they are \u201ctrue and accurate cop[ies.]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Before we turn to Maryland Rule 14-211, we consider <em>Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. v. Neal, </em>398 Md. 705, 922 A.2d 538 (2007), a foreclosure case that guides our analysis. In that case, Wells Fargo, the mortgagee by assignment, instituted foreclosure proceedings against Neal, the homeowner, after Neal fell behind on his mortgage payments. 398 Md. at 711-12, 922 A.2d 538. Neal then filed a complaint against Wells Fargo, instituting a new action and alleging that Wells Fargo breached the terms of the underlying deed of trust by not participating in pre-foreclosure loss mitigation prescribed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. <em>Id. </em>at 712, 922 A.2d 538. His complaint argued that Wells Fargo\u2019s failure to engage in loss mitigation was a breach of contract that would entitle him to money damages, and requested declaratory and injunctive relief preventing Wells Fargo from foreclosing on the property. <em>Id. </em>at 712-13 &amp; n.4, 922 A.2d 538. The circuit court granted summary judgment to Wells Fargo after a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 713, 922 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The Court of Appeals held, first, that Neal could not advance, as an affirmative claim, a breach of contract claim based on Wells Fargo\u2019s alleged violation of the HUD regulations mentioned in the deed of trust. <em>Id. </em>at 711, 922 A.2d 538. Nonetheless, the Court also held that Neal <em>could </em>raise a violation of the HUD regulations as a defense in a motion to stay the sale and dismiss the foreclosure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Court\u2019s reasoning is applicable to the present case. The Court observed that a foreclosure involving a power of sale\u2014 as we have in the present case\u2014is \u201c Intended to be a summary in rem proceeding\u2019 which carries out \u201c \u2018the policy of Maryland law to expedite mortgage foreclosures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>922 A.2d 538 (quoting <em>G.E. Capital Mortg. Servs., Inc. v. Levenson, </em>338 Md. 227, 245, 657 A.2d 1170 (1995)). Nonetheless, the Court stated that former Maryland Rule 14-204, governing the commencement of foreclosure actions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> did not \u201cprohibit mortgagors from raising viable defenses to a foreclosure to which the mortgagee is not entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bachrach v. Washington United Coop., </em>181 Md. 315, 319, 29 A.2d 822 (1943)). The Court then stated that a mortgagor could combat a foreclosure in three ways: a pre-sale injunction, a post-sale exception, and an exception to the auditor\u2019s statement of account. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Importantly, the Court then specified that Maryland\u2019s foreclosure procedure was \u201cequitable in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728, 922 A.2d 538 (citations omitted). Therefore, the Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">the venerated equity doctrine of clean hands which requires that \u201che who comes into equity must come with clean hands,\u201d <em>Hlista v. Altevogt, </em>239 Md. 43, 48, 210 A.2d 153, 156 (1965), is applicable in foreclosure proceedings such as the one implicated in the present case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">The clean hands doctrine states that \u201ccourts of equity will not lend their aid to anyone seeking their active interposition, who has been guilty of fraudulent, illegal, or inequitable conduct in the matter with relation to which he seeks assistance.\u201d <em>Hlista, </em>239 Md. at 48, 210 A.2d at 156; see also <em>Hicks v. Gilbert, </em>135 Md.App. 394, 400, 762 A.2d 986, 989-90 (2000). The doctrine does not mandate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>that those seeking equitable relief must have exhibited unblemished conduct in every transaction to which they have ever been a party, but rather that the particular matter for which a litigant seeks equitable relief must not be marred by any fraudulent, illegal, or inequitable conduct. <em>Hlista, </em>289 Md. at 48, 210 A.2d at 156; <em>Hicks, </em>135 Md.App. at 400-01, 762 A.2d at 990 (\u201cThere must be a nexus between the misconduct and the transaction, because \u2018[w]hat is material is not that the plaintiffs hands are dirty, but that he dirties them in acquiring the right he now asserts.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Adams v. Manown, </em>328 Md. 463, 476, 615 A.2d 611, 617 (1992)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 729-30, 922 A.2d 538 (emphasis added). Thus, in order to seek relief through foreclosure, the matter \u201cmust not be marred by any fraudulent, illegal, or inequitable conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730, 922 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">As the <em>Neal </em>opinion observed, a party may combat a foreclosure before the sale by filing what is currently called a motion to stay the sale and dismiss the action (what the <em>Neal </em>Court called a \u201cpre-sale injunction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Now we turn to Maryland Rule 14-211, which governs motions to stay and dismiss and which begins by defining who may file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">(a) Motion to Stay and Dismiss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">(1) <em>Who May File. </em>The borrower, a record owner, a party to the lien instrument, a person who claims under the borrower a right to or interest in the property that is subordinate to the lien being foreclosed, or a person who claims an equitable interest in the property may file in the action a motion to stay the sale of the property and dismiss the foreclosure action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">After stating the timing requirements for filing the motion, Maryland Rule 14-211(a) lists the substantive requirements of the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">(3) <em>Contents. </em>A motion to stay and dismiss shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">(A) be under oath or supported by affidavit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>(B) state with particularity the factual and legal basis of each defense that the moving party has to the validity of the lien or the lien instrument or to the right of the plaintiff to foreclose in the pending action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">(C) be accompanied by any supporting documents or other material in the possession or control of the moving party and any request for the discovery of any specific supporting documents in the possession or control of the plaintiff or the secured party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">(D) state whether there are any collateral actions involving the property and, to the extent known, the nature of each action, the name of the court in which it is pending, and the caption and docket number of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">(E) state the date the moving party was served or, if not served, when and how the moving party first became aware of the action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">(F) if the motion was not filed within the time set forth in subsection (a)(2) of this Rule, state with particularity the reasons why the motion was not filed timely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Subsection (b) of the Rule then states that the circuit court may deny the motion without a hearing if the motion (1) was not timely filed and there is no good cause for this lack of compliance; (2) does not substantially comply with the Rule\u2019s requirements; or (3) does not state a valid defense on its face. If the motion fulfills these three requirements, however, the Rule goes on to say that the court must hold a hearing on the motion. Maryland Rule 14-211(b)(2). <em>See also Fishman v. Murphy ex rel. Estate of Urban, </em>433 Md. 534, 543 n.5, 72 A.3d 185 (2013). Subsections (c) and (d) of the Rule address stays of sales pending hearings and scheduling orders, respectively. Finally, subsection (e), governing the court\u2019s final determination on the motion, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">(e) Final Determination. After the hearing on the merits, if the court finds that the moving party has established that the hen or the lien instrument is invalid or that the plaintiff has no right to foreclose in the pending action, it shall grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the motion and, unless it finds good cause to the contrary, dismiss the foreclosure action. If the court finds otherwise, it shall deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In <em>Buckingham v. Fisher, </em>223 Md.App. 82, 115 A.3d 248 (2015), this Court analyzed the proper pleading standard for stating a facially valid defense under Rule 14-211, and whether a hearing on the merits is required to make a determination on the motion once a defense is properly pleaded. In that case, as in the instant case, the appellants filed a Rule 14-211 motion to stay or dismiss a foreclosure action filed against them. <em>Id. </em>at 85-86, 115 A.3d 248. The appellants there raised two defenses: one challenging the validity of the lien based on forgery and the other challenging the right of the trustees to foreclose based on defects in the notice of sale. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 115 A.3d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Judge Friedman, writing for this Court, explained that \u201c[i]t is clear from this provision[, Rule 14\u2014211(a)(3),] that the factual and legal bases of a defense must be stated \u2018with particularity\u2019 and that any available supporting documents or material must be provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 115 A.3d 248. And, we recognized that a \u201c[fjailure to state a facially valid defense is one of the three grounds for denial at the initial determination phase[,]\u201d but that, nonetheless, \u201cSection 14\u2014211(b)(2) [] requires that the court hold an evidentiary hearing on the merits if none of the three grounds for denial provided in subsection (b)(1) are present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 115 A.3d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The Court further stated that forgery is a valid defense under Rule 14-211, and set out the three elements of forgery as a defense under Rule 14-211: \u201c \u2018[1] a false making or material alteration, [2] with intent to defraud, [3] of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy or the foundation of a legal liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 115 A.3d 248 (quoting <em>Harding v. Ja Laur Corp., </em>20 Md.App. 209, 212, 315 A.2d 132 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Returning to the present case, we first recognize that the denial of a motion to stay a foreclosure sale and dismiss the action under Maryland Rule 14-211 \u201clies generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Burson, </em>424 Md. 232, 243, 35 A.3d 452 (2011) (citing <em>Wincopia Farm, LP v. Goozman, </em>188 Md.App. 519, 528, 982 A.2d 868 (2009)). Although we generally review the circuit court\u2019s denial of Ms. Mitchell\u2019s Rule 14-211 motion for an abuse of discretion, <em>Svrcek v. Rosenberg, </em>203 Md.App. 705, 720, 40 A.3d 494 (2012), \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(citing <em>Wincopia Farm, </em>188 Md.App. at 528, 982 A.2d 868). Further, we review the circuit court\u2019s decision to deny Ms. Mitchell\u2019s motion without a hearing for legal correctness. <em>Buckingham, </em>223 Md.App. at 92-93, 115 A.3d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We hold that a party cannot institute a foreclosure upon forged documents. Foreclosure is an equitable procedure, and the Substitute Trustees must demonstrate, upon remand, that this particular foreclosure has not \u201cbe[en] marred by [ ] fraudulent, illegal, or inequitable conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Neal, </em>398 Md. at 730, 922 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">When Ms. Mitchell discovered at the July 11, 2005 closing that the deed of trust and the note contained an adjustable rate, she terminated the closing and had \u201cVOID\u201d stamped on the documents. The record contains no other deed of trust or note executed by the parties, nor is there any evidence that a valid deed or note exists. Nonetheless, the order to docket foreclosure was filed with copies of a deed of trust and note\u2014materially altered to look genuine\u2014accompanied by an affidavit stating that they are each \u201c[a] true and accurate copy[.]\u201d But a \u201ctrue and accurate copy\u201d of the deed of trust would have had \u2018VOID\u201d displayed on each page, and the note that Ms. Mitchell signed would have contained her nota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tions indicating that it had been voided along with the cancellation stamp signed by Fremont\u2019s representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Ms. Mitchell\u2019s <em>pro se </em>Rule 14-211 motion sufficiently pleaded her defense. Her motion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">Attached to the Plaintiffs Order to Docket is what is alleged to be a \u201cRedacted\u201d copy of the canceled Adjustable Rate Promissory Note and Deed of Trust. However, the alleged \u201cRedacted\u201d copy of the canceled Adjustable Rate Promissory Note and Deed of Trust are exactly the same as the cancelled Adjustable Rate Promissory Note and Deed of Trust returned by the lender Fremont to the Defendant with the exception of the missing signed \u201cCancellation and Satisfaction in Full\u201d stamp placed by the lender Fremont and the \u201cVoid\u201d stamps and initials placed by the settlement agent Barbara Licon and the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">At no time has the lender Fremont presented to the Defendant the opportunity to execute any new documents constituting the new Conventional Fixed Rate 30-year Note and Deed of Trust as agreed. The Defendant has stood ready to execute such documents but none have been issued. Further the defendant has taken numerous steps to resolve the issues with the note and security instrument including making consistent payments but was frustrated at every turn by an ever changing cast of characters and entities each fraudulently attempting to assert rights that they did not possess or could not prove with any certainty they had the right to assert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">(Emphasis added; citations omitted). Ms. Mitchell further stated that the order to docket did not contain true and accurate copies of the note and deed of trust because those documents had been voided. Ms. Mitchell supported her allegations with exhibits, attaching the deed of trust and note with \u201cVOID\u201d marks and the deed of trust and note without the \u201cVOID\u201d marks (filed with the order to docket) to her motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Construing this pleading liberally,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we determine that Ms. Mitchell has pleaded with particularity the elements of forgery and that her motion, \u201cstates on its face a valid defense to the validity of the lien instrument[.]\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 14-211(b). In this case, Ms. Mitchell in her motion not only asserted that the lender and its successors \u201cfraudulently attempted] to assert rights that they did not possess,\u201d but she also attached the materially altered documents that demonstrate \u201cthe fraudulent making of a false writing having apparent legal significance.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 457, 460, 256 A.2d 357 (1969). We conclude, therefore, that the circuit court erred in denying Ms. Mitchell\u2019s motion to stay the sale and dismiss the foreclosure action without a hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">ATTACHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"avp-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"pAp4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">.

On December 1, 2005, Fremont transferred the servicing of the loan to HomeEq Servicing Corporation (\"HomeEq\u201d).

On September 1, 2010, HomeEq transferred the loan\u2019s servicing rights to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (\"Ocwen\u201d), and Ocwen became the loan\u2019s servicing agent. On June 3, 2013, Mortgage Electronic Registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Systems (\"MERS\u201d), as nominee for Fremont, assigned the deed of trust to a securitized trust in which U.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\u201d) served as Trustee under a Pooling and Servicing Agreement as of November 1, 2005 (\"Mastr Asset-Backed Securities Trust 2005-FRE1 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-FRE1\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The record is equivocal as to whether any loan servicer actually charged an interest rate higher than 6.2% (and Ms. Mitchell does not contend that any entity did, either in her circuit court motions or in her brief before this court). What is clear is that the current servicing agent, Ocwen, sent Ms. Mitchell a letter on June 24, 2015, describing the loan as an \"Adjustable-Rate Mortgage\u201d and stating that the interest rate could be changed every six months. Thus, in 2015, Ocwen treated the loan as if it had an adjustable rate. Apparently, something was lost in translation between what Fremont had agreed to in its letters to Ms. Mitchell and the multiple servicers and noteholders along the way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\">.
