Piper, appellant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, CBS Corporation (\u201cCBS\u201d), appellee, filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the statute of repose barred Piper\u2019s cause of action against it. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). Following a hearing, the court granted CBS\u2019s motion. Piper noted this appeal, presenting three issues, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>our review, which we have consolidated into the following question:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">Did the circuit court err in granting CBS\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">For the reasons stated below, we answer this question in the negative and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">CBS is a Delaware corporation that is the successor by merger to a Pennsylvania corporation bearing the same name, which was formerly known as Westinghouse Electric Corporation (\u201cWestinghouse\u201d). In early 1970, Westinghouse entered into a contract with the Potomac Electric Power Company (\u201cPepeo\u201d) to sell a turbine generator for Pepco\u2019s Morgantown Generating Station (\u201cMorgantown\u201d) in Woodzell, Maryland. Pepeo signed a separate contract with Westinghouse for the installation of the turbine generator at the site. The specifications in that installation contract called for the use of insulation containing asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Piper worked as a steamfitter at Morgantown. Although he did not work directly on the installation of the turbine generator, he worked in the vicinity of the workers installing the turbine generator\u2019s insulation. The last day workers installed such insulation was June 28, 1970, and the turbine generator was operational by July of 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">On December 26, 2013, Piper was diagnosed with mesotheli-oma.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Piper, his mesothelioma was caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>inhalation of asbestos fibers during his career as a steamfitter, which included the time that he worked at Morgantown.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On March 26, 2014, Piper filed a complaint in the circuit court for damages caused by his exposure to asbestos.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On January 9, 2015, CBS filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that Piper\u2019s cause of action against it was barred by the statute of repose. Following a hearing, the court entered an order granting CBS\u2019s motion on March 9, 2015. Piper thereafter noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>PRELIMINARY MATTER</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">At the outset of this case, CBS contends that we should dismiss Piper\u2019s appeal because he appealed from a non-appealable order, and thus we lack jurisdiction. We deny CBS\u2019s motion and determine that we do have jurisdiction to hear this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">A fundamental principle of the statute that defines the jurisdiction of the appellate courts is that, as a general rule, a party may appeal only from \u201ca final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d CJ \u00a7 12-301 [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA9C\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">[A] ruling must ordinarily have the following three attributes to be a final judgment: (1) it must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy[;] (2) unless the court acts pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b) to direct the entry of a final judgment as to less than all of the claims or all of the parties, it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties; [and] (8) it must be set forth and recorded in accordance with Rule 2-601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\"><em>Metro Maint. Sys. S., Inc. v. Milburn, </em>442 Md. 289, 297-98, 112 A.3d 429 (2015). There are three exceptions to the final judgment requirement: \u201c(1) appeals from interlocutory orders specifically allowed by statute; (2) immediate appeals permitted under Maryland Rule 2-602; and (3) appeals from interlocutory rulings allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>Md. Bd. of Physicians v. Geier, </em>451 Md. 526, 546, 154 A.3d 1211 (2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The order granting CBS\u2019s motion for summary judgment was not final when it was entered, because it did not resolve all claims as to all parties in the instant case. Neither did the order fall into one of the three exceptions listed above. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>cordingly, at the time Piper noted his appeal, it was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">After noting the appeal, however, Piper dismissed from the case the sole remaining defendant, Walter E. Campbell Co., Inc., and asked the circuit court for an order entering a final judgment. On February 8, 2016, the court granted the dismissal and issued the requested order.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Maryland Rule 8-602(e) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">(1) If the appellate court determines that the order from which the appeal is taken was not a final judgment when the notice of appeal was filed but that the lower court had discretion to direct the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2\u2014602(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the appellate court, as it finds appropriate, may ... (D) if a final judgment was entered by the lower court after the notice of appeal was filed, treat the notice of appeal as if filed on the same day as, but after, the entry of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az7S\">(Emphasis added). Because a final judgment was entered by the trial court after Piper noted his appeal, Rule 8-602(e)(1)(D) authorizes us to treat his notice of appeal as if it was filed on the same day as the final judgment, but after the entry thereof. <em>See McCormick v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>219 Md.App. 485, 506 n. 5, 101 A.3d 467 (2014) (finding \u201c[ajlternatively, because the circuit court\u2019s order effectively became final when the [appellants] dismissed their claims against Dr. Rosner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>with prejudice, we may treat their \u2018notice of appeal as if filed on the same day as, but after, the entry of the judgment.\u2019 Md. Rule 8\u2014602(e)(1)(D).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to address the merits of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Maryland appellate courts have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cOn review of an order granting summary judgment, our analysis \u2018begins with the determination [of] whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists; only in the absence of such a dispute will we review questions of law.\u2019 <em>D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 574, 36 A.3d 941, 955 (2012) (quoting <em>Appiah v. Hall, </em>416 Md. 533, 546, 7 A.3d 536, 544 (2010)); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Balt. Cnty., </em>382 Md. 102, 110, 854 A.2d 1191, 1196 (2004). If no genuine dispute of material fact exists, this Court determines \u2018whether the Circuit Court correctly entered summary judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 <em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of the Gables on Tuckerman Condo., </em>404 Md. 560, 571, 948 A.2d 11, 18 (2008) (citations omitted). Thus, \u2018[t]he standard of review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment on the law is de novo, that is, whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions were legally correct.\u2019 <em>D\u2019Aoust, </em>424 Md. at 574, 36 A.3d at 955.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\"><em>James G. Davis Constr. Corp. v. Erie Ins. Exch., </em>226 Md.App. 25, 34-35, 126 A.3d 753 (2015) (quoting <em>Koste v. Town of Oxford, </em>431 Md. 14, 24-25, 63 A.3d 582 (2013)), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 Md. 705, 133 A.3d 1110 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">In the case, <em>sub judice, </em>the parties do not claim that there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact. It is undisputed that (1) the last date of Piper\u2019s exposure to asbestos dust generated by the installation of insulation to Unit 1 turbine generator at Morgantown was June 28, 1970; (2) Morgantown\u2019s Unit 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>turbine generator, which was fabricated and installed by Westinghouse, was substantially completed no later than July 1970; and (3) Piper was diagnosed with mesothelioma on December 26, 2013. The primary issue in the instant case is whether Piper\u2019s cause of action against CBS is barred by the statute of repose, CJP \u00a7 5-108, which is an issue of law. Resolution of that issue will require us to engage in statutory construction of Section 5-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The statute of repose, as codified in Section 5-108, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">(a) <em>Injury occurring more than 20 years </em>later.\u2014Except as provided by this section, no cause of action for damages accrues and a person may not seek contribution or indemnity for damages incurred when wrongful death, personal injury, or injury to real or personal property resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property occurs more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first becomes available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pARQ\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">(e) <em>When action </em>accrues.\u2014A cause of action for an injury described in this section accrues when the injury or damage occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">In <em>Rose v. Fox Pool Corp., </em>335 Md. 351, 643 A.2d 906 (1994), Judge Irma Raker, writing for the Court of Appeals, set forth the principles of statutory construction that guide us in interpreting Section 5-108. Judge Raker wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">The issues raised in this appeal require us to discern the meaning of \u00a7 5-108(a). The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to effectuate and carry out legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Comptroller v. Jameson, </em>332 Md. 723, 732, 633 A.2d 93, 97 (1993); <em>GEICO v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 131, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993). Every statute is enacted to further some underlying goal or purpose\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cto advance some interest, to attain some end\u201d\u2014and must be construed in accordance with its general purposes and policies. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987); <em>see also State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275, 278 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976). When called upon to construe a particular statute, we begin our analysis with the statutory language itself since the words of the statute, construed according to their ordinary and natural import, are the primary source and most persuasive evidence of legislative intent. <em>Jameson, </em>332 Md. at 732, 633 A.2d at 97-98; <em>Comptroller v. Fairchild Industries, </em>303 Md. 280, 284, 493 A.2d 341, 343 (1985). The statute must be construed as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993); <em>Md. Port Adm. v. Brawner Contracting Co., </em>303 Md. 44, 60, 492 A.2d 281, 289 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">When the language of a statute is plain and clear and expresses a meaning consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, no further analysis of legislative intent is ordinarily required. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 633. As we explained, however, in <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">[0]ur endeavor is always to seek out the legislative purpose, the general aim or policy, the ends to be accomplished, the evils to be redressed by a particular enactment. In the conduct of that enterprise, we are not limited to study of the statutory language. The plain meaning rule \u201c \u2018is not a complete, all-sufficient rule for ascertaining a legislative intention ....\u2019\u201d The \u201cmeaning of the plainest language\u201d is controlled by the context in which it appears. Thus, we are always free to look at the context within which the statutory language appears. Even when the words of a statute carry a definite meaning, we are not \u201cprecluded from consulting legislative history as part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the process of determining the legislative purpose or goal\u201d of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">319 Md. at 603-04, 573 A.2d at 1349 (citations and footnote omitted); <em>see also Baltimore Cty. C.A.U.T. v. Baltimore Cty., </em>321 Md. 184, 203-04, 582 A.2d 510, 519-20 (1990); <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513, 525 A.2d at 632. The legislative history of a statute, including amendments that were considered and/or enacted as the statute passed through the Legislature, and the statute\u2019s relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation are \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d of legislative purpose that may be taken into consideration. <em>Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank v. Pearce, </em>329 Md. 602, 619, 620 A.2d 941, 949 (1993) <em>(quoting Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 632).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 358-60, 643 A.2d 906 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">As previously indicated, the primary issue before us in this appeal is whether the statute of repose, Section 5-108, applies to Piper\u2019s cause of action against CBS. Piper however, does not base his argument for the non-applicability of the statute on \u201cthe statutory language itself\u2019 of Section 5-108. <em>See id. </em>at 359, 643 A.2d 906. Yet, because we believe that the language of the statute \u201cis plain and clear[,]\u201d we will begin our analysis with \u201cthe words of the statute, construed according to their ordinary and natural import.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">It is clear that Piper\u2019s cause of action against CBS is based on \u201cpersonal injury ... resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-108(a). Piper\u2019s cause of action, however, is barred if the personal injury \u201coccurs more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first becomes available for its intended use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because Morgantown Unit 1 turbine generator became operational by July 1970, Piper\u2019s injury must have \u201coccurred\u201d on or before July of 1990 for his cause of action to survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The date of Piper\u2019s last exposure to asbestos dust from Unit 1 turbine generator was June 28, 1970; but his mesothelioma was not diagnosed until 2013. Section 5-108(e) states that \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>cause of action for an injury described in this section accrues when the injury or damage occurs.\u201d In <em>Burns v. Bechtel Corp., </em>212 Md.App. 237, 66 A.3d 1187, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 Md. 312, 75 A.3d 317 (2013), this Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">And as the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Hilliard &amp; Bartko Joint Venture v. Fedco Sys., Inc., </em>309 Md. 147, 162, 522 A.2d 961 (1987), the Statute of Repose incorporates the common law discovery rule of accrual: \u201c[T]he language of present subsection (e), equating accrual with \u2018when the injury or damage occurs,\u2019 means when the injury or damage is discovered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 243, 66 A.3d 1187 (emphasis added). In the present case, Piper\u2019s injury, mesothelioma, was discovered, and thus \u201coccurred,\u201d in 2013, forty-three years after Unit 1 turbine generator \u201cfirst bec[a]me[ ] available for its intended use.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-108(a). Therefore, because Piper\u2019s cause of action did not accrue within 20 years of the placement into operation of Unit 1 turbine generator, Section 5-108(a) applies to his cause of action and precludes its prosecution against CBS.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Piper, however, contends that his cause of action is not barred by the statute of repose because of the statutory language used by the General Assembly when the statute was originally enacted in 1970. Chapter 666 of the Acts of 1970 reads its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">CHAPTER 666</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apz\">(Senate Bill 241)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">AN ACT to add new Section 20 to Article 57 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1968 Replacement Volume), title \u201cLimitations of Actions,\u201d to follow immediately after Section 19 thereof, to prohibit the bringing of actions based on injuries arising out of defective conditions of improvements to real property against certain persons after a specified period of time and providing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>provision of the Act shall not apply to actions accruing prior to its effective date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Section 1. <em>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, </em>That new Section 20 be and it is hereby added to Article 57 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1968 Replacement Volume), title \u201cLimitations of Actions,\u201d to follow immediately after Section 19 thereof, and to read as follows: <em>20.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\n<em>No action to recover damages for injury to property real or personal, or for bodily injury or wrongful death, arising out of the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property, nor any action for contribution or indemnity for damages incurred as a result of said injury or death, shall be brought more than nine TWENTY years after the said improvement was substantially completed. This limitation shall not apply to any action brought against the person who, at the time the injury was sustained, was in actual possession and control as owner, tenant, or otherwise of the said improvement. For purposes of this section, \u201csubstantially completed\u201d shall mean when the entire improvement is first available for its intended use.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Sec. 2. <em>And it be further enacted, </em>That this Act shall not apply to any cause of action arising on or before June 30, 1970.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">Sec. 3. <em>And it be further enacted, </em>That this Act shall take effect July 1,1970.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">Approved May 21,1970.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">(Italic emphasis in original) (bold emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Piper contends that the circuit court erred in applying the statute of repose to bar his cause of action against CBS, because his injury \u201carose\u201d on June 28, 1970, and the session law that passed the original statute of repose contained language indicating that the statute does not apply to injuries arising on or before June 30, 1970. Piper notes that he agrees with CBS that his injury \u201caccrued\u201d in 2013 when his injury was discovered, but distinguishes the date of accrual from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>date his that injury arose by arguing that the date of accrual is irrelevant here. Furthermore, Piper argues that the statute of repose cannot be applied retroactively to him, \u201cbecause subsequent revisions and amendments to the statute lack a \u2018clear expression\u2019 in favor of retroactivity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">CBS responds that the circuit court correctly found that CBS was entitled to repose, because Piper\u2019s cause of action accrued more than twenty years after the improvement was substantially completed. CBS asserts that Piper\u2019s reliance on when his injury \u201carose\u201d is misplaced, because the anti-retroac-tivity language appearing in Section 2 of the session law was not codified after the statute was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">CBS is correct that, when Chapter 666 of the Acts of 1970 was codified in Article 57 \u00a7 20, Section 2 was not included. Piper, however, relies heavily on the case of <em>Roe v. Doe, </em>193 Md.App. 558, 998 A.2d 383 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>419 Md. 687, 20 A.3d 787 (2011), for the proposition that \u201cthe uncodified sections of the statute of repose continue to carry the force of law.\u201d In <em>Roe, </em>this Court construed and applied the uncodified retroac-tivity provisions of a statute that increased the limitations period from 3 years to 7 years for minor victims of sexual abuse to bring an action for damages arising out of such abuse after attaining the age of majority. <em>Id. </em>at 564-69, 998 A.2d 383. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed our construction of the retroactivity provision of Chapter 360 of the Acts of 2003. <em>Doe v. Roe, </em>419 Md. 687, 699, 709-10, 20 A.3d 787 (2011). In so doing, the Court noted that the retroactivity provision of Chapter 360 had not been codified in CJP \u00a7 5-117. <em>Id. </em>at 699, 20 A.3d 787. In a footnote to that observation, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\"><em>See </em>MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF LEGISLATIVE SERVICES, LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING MANUAL 2011, at 97 (2010) (\u201cProvisions of law need not be codified in order to be legally binding.\u201d); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Maringo, </em>151 Md.App. 662, 671 n. 1, 828 A.2d 257, 262 n. 1 (2003) (\u201cThe parties do not dispute that this uncodified portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the bill has the same force and effect as the codified portion.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 699 n. 11, 20 A.3d 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The problem with Piper\u2019s reliance on <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe </em>is that the uncodified retroactivity provision of Chapter 360 was never subject to repeal and reenactment. Here, Article 57, \u00a7 20, the codified version of Chapter 666, was repealed in 1974 and reenacted as CJP \u00a7 5-108. <em>See Hillard, </em>309 Md. at 160, 522 A.2d 961. Section 2 of Chapter 666 was not included in CJP \u00a7 5-108. <em>See id. </em>at 160-61, 522 A.2d 961. Moreover, as pointed out by CBS, \u201c\u00a7 5-108 was enacted with substantive changes in its definition of scope and operation of the repose afforded thereby.\u201d <em>See also id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Nevertheless, Piper argues that, because (1) none of the amendments or revisions to the statute of the repose expressly repealed Section 2, and (2) \u201cthere is a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 against finding that a statutory revision implicitly repeals a section of a statute absent \u2018clear legislative intent [in] support,\u2019 \u201d \u201cthe uncodified sections of the statute of repose continue to carry the force of law.\u201d We need not resolve the issue of Section 2\u2019s viability, because even if Section 2 of Chapter 666 retains \u201cthe force of law,\u201d we conclude that Piper\u2019s cause of action is still barred by the statute of repose. We shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Under Section 2 of Chapter 666, the question is whether Piper\u2019s cause of action \u201carose\u201d prior to July 1,1970. To answer this question, we need to determine what the General Assembly meant by the term \u201carising\u201d in Section 2: does it mean, as Piper contends, when one is exposed to asbestos, or does it mean, as CBS contends, when a cause of action accrues, which, under the discovery rule, is the date that one discovers the injuries caused by asbestos exposure? <em>See Mathews v. Cassidy Turley Md., Inc., </em>435 Md. 584, 611, 80 A.3d 269 (2013) (Under the discovery rule, \u201ca cause of action accrues when the wrong is discovered or when with due diligence it should have been discovered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">In <em>Hillard, </em>the Court of Appeals set forth the history of CJP \u00a7 5-108, beginning with the enactment of Chapter 666 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the Acts of 1970. 309 Md. at 160, 522 A.2d 961. Speaking for the Court, Judge Lawrence Rodowsky wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">The predecessor to present \u00a7 5-108 was enacted by Ch. 666 of the Acts of 1970. In the year preceding this enactment <em>Steelworkers Holding Co. v. Menefee, </em>255 Md. 440, 258 A.2d 177 (1969) had applied the discovery rule to determine accrual of a cause of action for general statute of limitations purposes in a malpractice action against an architect. That same year <em>Mattingly v. Hopkins, </em>254 Md. 88, 253 A.2d 904 (1969) had held the discovery rule governed accrual of a malpractice action against a professional engineer. The discovery rule had earlier been applied in <em>Callahan v. Clemens, </em>184 Md. 520, 41 A.2d 473 (1945) to the accrual of a cause of action by an adjoining property owner against a contractor who had allegedly negligently erected a wall. It was clear that one purpose of Ch. 666 was to set a time limit after which the discovery rule could not operate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">Chapter 666 was modified as part of the Code revision project when the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article was enacted, effective January 1, 1974. From a prohibition, \u201c[n]o action ... shall be brought,\u201d the language was changed to read in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Except as provided by this section, <em>no cause of action for damages accrues ... </em>when ... injury to real ... property resulting from the defective ... condition of an improvement to real property occurs more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first becomes available for its intended use. [Md.Code (1974), CJ \u00a7 5-108(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Present \u00a7 5-108(d) was subsection (b) in the 1974 enactment. The 1974 changes also added as subsection (c) the language now found in (e) (\u201cA cause of action for an injury described in this section accrues when the injury or damage occurs.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 522 A.2d 961 (italic emphasis in original) (bold emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Because \u201cone purpose of Chapter 666 was to set a time limit after which the discovery rule could not operate[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 160, 522 A.2d 961, a cause of action based on a latent defect or injury that had not accrued under the discovery rule was cut off after twenty years from the time the improvement first became available for its intended use. <em>See id. </em>at 161-62, 522 A.2d 961. Piper\u2019s construction of the statute, however, would create a class of unaccrued causes of action exempted from the statute where the latent defect or injury was present prior to July 1, 1970. Such a construction is contrary to the \u201cclear\u201d purpose of Chapter 666. <em>See id. </em>at 160, 522 A.2d 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In addition, in the preamble to Chapter 666, the General Assembly set forth the purpose of Section 2 by stating \u201cthat the provision of the Act shall not apply to actions <em>accruing </em>prior to its effective date.\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 2 then states \u201c[tjhat this Act shall not apply to any cause of action <em>arising </em>on or before June 80, 1970.\u201d (Emphasis added). To construe the term \u201carising\u201d in Section 2 to mean something different from the term \u201caccruing\u201d in the preamble would create an ambiguity, if not an outright conflict, between the purpose of Section 2, as expressed in the preamble, and the statutory language of Section 2 implementing that purpose. Moreover, the distinction between when a cause of action \u201carose\u201d and when a cause of action \u201caccrued\u201d did not exist in Maryland case law until sometime after the enactment of Chapter 666 in 1970 when personal injury cases based on a disease with a long latency period, such as asbestos exposure cases, were brought. <em>See John Crane, Inc. v. Scribner, </em>369 Md. 369, 383, 390, 800 A.2d 727 (2002) (noting, for purposes of the non-economic damages cap statute, which was passed in 1986, \u201cthe distinction made by the Legislature between when an action arises and when it accrues\u201d). Piper\u2019s argument that the two terms have distinct meanings, although correct today for asbestos exposure cases, cannot be grafted onto the General Assembly\u2019s intent in 1970 when the statute of repose was passed, because those terms had not yet been distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Finally, under the Maryland Constitution, the General Assembly cannot take away vested property rights. <em>See </em>Md. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 40, Md. Const. Declaration of Rights, Art. 19, 24. In general, a property right becomes vested only when it accrues.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Dua v. Comcast Cable of Md., Inc., </em>370 Md. 604, 632-33, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002). (\u201c[TJhere normally is a vested property right in a cause of action which has accrued prior to the legislative action.\u201d). Because of such constitutional limitation, the preamble states that Chapter 666 does not apply to causes of action \u201caccruing prior to its effective date.\u201d Section 2 of Chapter 666 implements that purpose so that the application of Chapter 666 will be constitutional. There is nothing in the language of Chapter 666 to indicate that Section 2 goes beyond protecting the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Therefore, from the standpoint of Chapter 666\u2019s constitutionality, \u201carising\u201d in Section 2 means \u201caccruing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In sum, because of the history, language, and purpose of Chapter 666 of the Acts of 1970, we conclude that the term \u201carising\u201d in Section 2 carries the same meaning as the term \u201caccruing:\u201d the date that the injury is discovered. Accordingly, Section 2 does not bar the application of the statute of repose to Piper\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"pAJe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"AfTf\">The statute of repose has an exemption for manufacturers in asbestos-related litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alj-dedup-0\">(2) This section does not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAG8\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">(ii) In a cause of action against a manufacturer or supplier for damages for personal injury or death caused by asbestos or a product that contains asbestos, the injury or death results from exposure to asbestos dust or fibers which are shed or emitted prior to or in the course of the affixation, application, or installation of the asbestos or the product that contains asbestos to an improvement to real property[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arlo\">CJP \u00a7 5\u2014108(d)(2)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AnT\">Piper contends that, if the statute of repose applies, CBS does not benefit from it, because CBS is a manufacturer of asbestos, and thus falls within the statute\u2019s exemption. CBS responds that it is not a manufacturer, because the turbine generator installed at Morgantown is not a \u201cproduct,\u201d and because CBS did not manufacture the injury-causing asbestos used in the insulation. CBS also argues that, even if it is a manufacturer under Section 5-108(d)(2), the application of that section\u2019s exemption to Piper\u2019s cause of action would be unconstitutional, because such exemption was not enacted until 1991, which was after Piper\u2019s claim was barred on July 1, 1990. We agree with CBS that applying the manufacturer\u2019s exemption of the statute of repose to Piper\u2019s claim would be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-0\">The Court of Appeals made clear in <em>Dua </em>that \u201c[f]rom the earliest cases to the present, this Court has consistently taken the position that retroactive legislation, depriving persons or private entities of vested rights, violates the Maryland Constitution, regardless of the reasonableness or \u2018rational basis\u2019 underlying the legislation.\u201d 370 Md. at 625, 805 A.2d 1061. One such vested right is the right not to be sued on \u201ca cause of action that was otherwise barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 805 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>A.2d 1061 (\u201cA statute, which retroactively created a cause of action, resulting in reviving a cause of action that was otherwise barred, was held to deprive the defendant of property rights in violation of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.\u201d (citing <em>Smith v. Westinghouse Elec., </em>266 Md. 52, 57, 291 A.2d 452 (1972))).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Piper\u2019s cause of action against CBS as to the turbine generator was barred by the statute of repose prior to the enactment of the manufacturer\u2019s exemption in 1991. The turbine generator was completed in July of 1970. Pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5-108(a), Piper\u2019s cause of action would have had to \u201caccrue\u201d on or before July of 1990, for Piper to avoid the bar of the statute. Both parties agree that Piper\u2019s cause of action accrued on December 26, 2013, when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Because Piper\u2019s cause of action accrued after July of 1990, CBS had a vested right in not being sued as of that date. <em>See Dua, </em>370 Md. at 627, 633, 805 A.2d 1061. Accordingly, the 1991 amendment creating the manufacturer\u2019s exemption could not revive Piper\u2019s claim against CBS, \u201ca cause of action that was otherwise barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 805 A.2d 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In sum, the plain language of the statute of repose, CJP \u00a7 5-108, bars Piper\u2019s cause of action against CBS, because Piper\u2019s cause of action accrued when his mesothelioma was diagnosed in December 2013, which was more than twenty years after the turbine generator installed by Westinghouse at Morgantown became operational in July of 1970. Section 2 of the original statute of repose, Chapter 666 of the Acts of 1970, which precluded application of the statute to \u201cany cause of action <em>arising </em>on or before June 30, 1970[,]\u201d does not apply to Piper\u2019s cause of action, because the term \u201carising\u201d means \u201caccruing\u201d in the context of the history, language, and purpose of the statute. (Emphasis added). The manufacturer\u2019s exemption, set forth in Section 5-108(d)(2), also does not apply, because the application of such exemption would unconstitutionally deprive CBS of its vested right in not being sued for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>causes of action barred by the statute of repose prior to the exemption\u2019s enactment in 1991.
