Grimm argues that the suppression court erred in concluding that the dog was reliable and that the dog\u2019s alert provided probable cause for the police officer to search the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>vehicle. Grimm entered a conditional guilty plea (to possession of heroin with intent to distribute), reserving the right to challenge the denial of his motion to suppress. After he was convicted and sentenced, he noted this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Grimm presents three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">I. Did the circuit court err in finding that there was probable cause to search Appellant\u2019s vehicle without a search warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">II. Does the good faith exception to the warrant requirement apply?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">III. Did the lower court err in admitting testimony and documents pertaining to the certification of the canine that scanned Appellant\u2019s vehicle, where the certification occurred four months after the scan occurred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to Questions I and III, which obviates the need for us to address Question II. We will affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">On April 18, 2014\u2014one day prior to the traffic stop of Grimm\u2019s vehicle\u2014Sergeant Christopher Lamb, of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police, received a tip from a federal drug enforcement program referred to as \u201cHIDTA,\u201d advising that a suspect named Brian Grimm \u201cmay be traveling northbound on Interstate 95 from Atlanta, Georgia to the area of Baltimore, Maryland ... with a large quantity of CDS.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sgt. Lamb\u2019s contact at HIDTA provided descriptive information about Grimm, including his race and approximate age. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The following day, while Sgt. Lamb was on patrol, he received telephone calls from HIDTA providing additional information about the suspect: the vehicle of interest was a maroon Honda with Georgia registration, carrying multiple occupants, and it was traveling in Anne Arundel County in the vicinity of the Arundel Mills shopping complex, on Maryland Route 100, about to turn onto Route 295 North, toward Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Sgt. Lamb spotted a vehicle matching the description provided by HIDTA, <em>ie., </em>a maroon Honda with Georgia tags traveling northbound toward Baltimore on Route 295. When Sgt. Lamb observed that none of the occupants of the Honda were wearing seatbelts, he initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle. Grimm was driving the maroon Honda at the time of the stop; there was one passenger in the front seat, and a second passenger in the back seat. After stopping the vehicle, Sgt. Lamb noted that the front seat passenger would not look at him, and she stared straight ahead throughout the traffic stop. But the back seat passenger seemed \u201coverly polite\u201d throughout the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">When Sgt. Lamb asked the driver about his travel itinerary, Grimm explained that he had just purchased the Honda in Atlanta, and that he had flown from Baltimore to Atlanta to pick up the vehicle and also to visit friends in the Atlanta area. Grimm further explained that he had been driving all night to return to the Baltimore area. Grimm possessed a Maryland driver\u2019s license, and the vehicle had been registered two days earlier, but it was not registered in Grimm\u2019s name. Grimm explained that he did not have enough money to register the vehicle in his own name because he had purchased four airline tickets from Baltimore to Atlanta in order to pick up the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Sgt. Lamb testified at the suppression hearing that he asked Grimm to exit the vehicle because he had detected several indicia of possible criminal activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">The rear seat passenger was over-polite. The front seat passenger was staring forward, she wouldn\u2019t speak with me, she wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with me. The driver was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>traveling from source city to source city for drugs\u2014meaning Atlanta, Georgia, which is a source city of drugs to Baltimore City which is a source city of drugs. The fact that they had flown down four individuals from Baltimore, Maryland to Atlanta, Georgia, purchased a vehicle, but then the operator Mr. Grimm who stated [he was] to be the owner was not able to afford to put that vehicle in his name, register that vehicle in his name when he drove it back. And the totality of those things ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">While speaking with Grimm, Sgt. Lamb observed that Grimm looked \u201cdisheveled\u201d and \u201cunkempt like he had been on the road and hadn\u2019t been staying anywhere.\u201d Sgt. Lamb felt that Grimm was \u201cmumbling\u201d and \u201crambling\u201d when answering questions, and would \u201clook away, and then look back\u201d at Lamb throughout their conversation. Grimm did not, however, appear to be nervous. Sgt. Lamb eventually instructed Grimm to reenter his vehicle. While Sgt. Lamb was writing the seat-belt warnings to be issued to the occupants of the Honda, he noticed that Grimm \u201cnever fully closed his door when he got into his vehicle,\u201d and he \u201cmaintained his left foot out of the vehicle and on the asphalt.\u201d Sgt. Lamb considered Grimm\u2019s conduct \u201cvery unusual,\u201d and thought that it indicated that Grimm might be a \u201cflight risk.\u201d Nevertheless, Sgt. Lamb testified that he did not believe he had probable cause to search Grimm\u2019s vehicle at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">While Sgt. Lamb was still in the process of writing out the warnings, Maryland Transportation Authority Police Officer Carl Keightley arrived with his drug-detection dog, a Malinois named \u201cAce.\u201d Officer Keightley had been Ace\u2019s handler since 2012. They had gone through an initial three-month training period, and Ace had been trained to detect heroin, methamphetamine, MDMA, marijuana, and cocaine. Both the dog and the handler had been certified by the Maryland Transportation Authority Police through testing in various situations, including searches of buildings, luggage, vehicles, and open areas. Officer Keightley and Ace held current certifications when they were called to scan Grimm\u2019s vehicle on April 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>2014, having been most recently recertified by the Maryland Transportation Authority Police on January 22, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Officer Keightley and Ace conducted an exterior scan of Grimm\u2019s vehicle, and Ace gave a positive alert to the presence of narcotics. Officer Keightley testified that, while he was leading Ace around the vehicle, Ace jumped up and stuck his head inside of the driver\u2019s side window, sniffed, and sat, which was Ace\u2019s \u201cfinal alert\u201d to the presence of narcotics. Sgt. Lamb then searched Grimm\u2019s vehicle, and discovered a \u201clarge quantity of heroin and amphetamine\u201d hidden in the rear panel of the passenger side door. Grimm was arrested and charged with possession with intent to distribute heroin (and other related offenses that are not material to this appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In the circuit court, Grimm moved to suppress the evidence discovered during the search, and contended that Sgt. Lamb lacked probable cause to search his vehicle. The court held a lengthy evidentiary hearing on the motion. Both sides argued that their respective positions were supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Florida v. Harris, </em>568 U.S. 237, 133 S.Ct. 1050, 185 L.Ed.2d 61 (2013), in which the Court held that \u201cevidence of a dog\u2019s satisfactory performance in a certification or training program can itself provide sufficient reason to trust his alert,\u201d but also said that a defendant \u201cmust have an opportunity to challenge such evidence of a dog\u2019s reliability, whether by cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>133 S.Ct. at 1057. Grimm urged the suppression court to find that Ace was not a reliable drug-detection dog, that his training was deficient, and that his purported alert therefore did not provide support for Sgt. Lamb\u2019s belief that he had probable cause to search the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">During the suppression hearing, each side called two expert witnesses. Officer Keightley (Ace\u2019s handler) was accepted by the court as an expert in the field of K-9 police dogs and the detection of heroin, marijuana, cocaine, MDMA, and methamphetamine. Officer Keightley explained that he generally trains with Ace one day each week in various scenarios <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>designed to mimic situations they might encounter in the field. The State introduced in evidence written records of training conducted with Ace during 2012, 2013, and 2014. During Officer Keightley\u2019s testimony, the State also introduced the field reports that had been completed by Officer Keightley after each drug scan performed by Ace. Officer Keightley explained that the Maryland Transportation Authority Police has generated K-9 certification guidelines, and that Ace had first been certified in 2012, and was thereafter recertified every six months. The initial certification of Ace was performed by Officer Michael McNerney (who would later be called by Grimm as an expert witness at the suppression hearing). After reviewing with the court the dash-cam video recording of the scan of Grimm\u2019s Honda, Officer Keightley reiterated that Ace gave an alert indicating that he had detected the odor of narcotics in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">During cross-examination of Officer Keightley, Grimm\u2019s counsel reviewed with the officer the fact that the field reports reflected that Ace had given positive alerts to vehicles during 51 scans, but no contraband was found in 19 of those vehicles. Officer Keightley had interviewed the occupants of those 19 vehicles and had been told by occupants of ten of the vehicles that, in fact, drugs had recently been present in those vehicles. On redirect examination, Officer Keightley said that there were several possible explanations other than error on the part of the dog that might explain why no drugs were found on the nine other occasions on which Ace had alerted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A132\">[S]omething might have [actually] been in the vehicle and it might not have been located [during the search]. Somebody might have used narcotics recently in the vehicle or used narcotics and touched the vehicle, contaminated the vehicle. Any of those things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Officer Keightley conceded on cross-examination that, although he generally conducted weekly training with Ace, because of the manner in which he had routinely logged training time before his supervisor mandated a change, the hours he had spent each month had not met the organization\u2019s standard until some point in time after the scan of Grimm\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>vehicle. He acknowledged that he had not spent 16 hours of actual \u201csniff time\u201d training with Ace in any of the six months leading up to April 19, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The State also presented testimony from Sergeant Mary Davis, who was a police supervisor and narcotics-detection dog trainer for the Montgomery County Police Department. She had been working in that police department\u2019s canine unit for over twenty years, and had been the head trainer since 2008. She indicated that, although the State of Maryland does not mandate any particular standards for the performance of drug-detection dogs, she was very familiar with the standards recommended by the United States Police Canine Association and other similar organizations. Defense counsel stipulated that Sgt. Davis \u201cis an expert in K-9 training and K-9 handling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Sgt. Davis testified that the State of Maryland does not require certification of police dogs, but both the Montgomery County Police Department and the Maryland Transportation Authority Police had adopted requirements for certification and periodic recertification. She confirmed that the certification protocol adopted by the Maryland Transportation Authority Police does \u201cgenerally comport with industry standards.\u201d In August 2014, Sgt. Davis and two other officers from the Montgomery County Police Department had conducted an evaluation of the canine teams at the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Officer Keightley and Ace were tested on that occasion, and they passed the testing conducted by the officers from Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Sgt. Davis further testified that she had reviewed all of the training records that Officer Keightley had maintained for Ace, covering training exercises during 2012 through July of 2014. She saw that, during 2013, Ace had participated in 209 training scenarios in which drugs had been hidden, and during those exercises, Ace had had 24 non-productive responses (sometimes referred to as \u201cNPRs\u201d by dog trainers, and referred to as false alerts by defense counsel). Sgt. Davis said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>that she would not characterize \u201cany one particular amount [of NPRs] as acceptable or unacceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">With respect to the 51 field scans that had been performed by Ace, Sgt. Davis testified that the fact that no drugs were discovered in nine vehicles (for which the follow-up interviews provided no explanation) would not concern her, \u201cNot even in the least bit.\u201d In her view, even though there was no admission of the prior presence of drugs in those vehicles, the vehicles could have been previously used to transport drugs. She said: \u201cSo I would not be shocked that we didn\u2019t [get] an admission and we weren\u2019t able to find target odor. That can occur very easily.\u201d Furthermore, Sgt. Davis considers a dog\u2019s training records more useful than the field records because training typically occurs in a more controlled environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Based upon her review of the dash cam video recording of the scan of Grimm\u2019s vehicle conducted by Officer Keightley and Ace, Sgt. Davis expressed an opinion that Ace clearly alerted to the presence of drug odor, and she saw no evidence that the handler cued the dog to alert. Sgt. Davis rejected defense counsel\u2019s suggestion that Ace may have exhibited a false alert at Grimm\u2019s driver-side door simply to get a reward. She explained: \u201cIt looked to me that the dog was working independently to odor. And once he got into the odor he gave the indication.\u201d She agreed that, in her experience, she had observed some dogs give a false alert just for a reward, but, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t see that that\u2019s what occurred here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">When asked directly if she had an opinion regarding the \u201coverall competence of the team of Officer Carl Keightley and K-9 Ace,\u201d Sgt. Davis testified that, \u201c[biased on the totality of the circumstances, looking at all of the training records in their totality, and having observed the team personally on three separate occasions,\u201d she believed that \u201cthey are competent to be working the street and deploying, and making probable cause decisions on the street.\u201d When asked, on cross-examination, to comment upon the strength of Ace\u2019s abilities, Sgt. Davis said: \u201cHe has a tremendous skill set. He\u2019s got a lot of drive. He has a huge work ethic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The defense likewise called two canine experts as witnesses. Ted Cox was a retired police officer who had extensive experience as a K-9 trainer for the Baltimore City Police Department, including six years as chief trainer. He had also been employed as the K-9 trainer for the Maryland Transportation Authority Police from 2007 to 2012. The State stipulated that he was an expert in K-9 training and handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Mr. Cox had analyzed Ace\u2019s training records for the period covering April 15, 2013, through March 24, 2014, and concluded that, by his count, Ace had been put through 179 scenarios, and had made 44 false alerts, which Mr. Cox viewed as unacceptable. He also criticized Ace for \u201cexcessive barking\u201d during the approach to Grimm\u2019s vehicle. Mr. Cox expressed opinions that were critical of Ace\u2019s training as reflected in the training records, and he believed that Ace should not have been recertified on August 19, 2014, because of a false alert the dog gave during that testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">He concluded that Ace\u2019s hours of training, as recorded prior to the scan of Grimm\u2019s vehicle, did not meet \u201cthe industry standard,\u201d and he said, \u201cafter reviewing the records and the dash cam video, it\u2019s my opinion that the dog is unreliable at this point.\u201d In his opinion, Ace did not alert to the odor of the drugs that were later found in the car, but instead alerted to the \u201chuman scent\u201d of the occupants of the car, in particular, Grimm, who had been resting upon the driver-side door for several minutes prior to the scan. Mr. Cox reiterated: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the dog is unreliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The second dog expert called by the defense was Senior Officer Michael McNerney, who had been a trainer for the Maryland Transportation Authority Police since 2009, and had worked under Ted Cox until the end of 2012. Officer McNer-ney then became the head trainer for explosives-detection dogs, and in September 2013, Officer McNerney assumed the additional responsibility for training of narcotics-detection dogs as well. He was accepted by the court as an expert in the field of canine training and handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Officer McNerney explained that, in March 2014, when he reviewed the training records for Officer Keightley and Ace, the records did not reflect that that team had met the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s standard requiring 240 minutes of \u201csniff time\u201d in training each month. As a consequence of that discovery and other concerns Officer McNerney had communicated to his superiors regarding training deficiencies in the canine unit, Officer McNerney \u201cstepped down\u201d from his position as head trainer on March 11, 2014. But he was ordered back to the position in May 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">When Officer McNerney resumed the position of head trainer in May 2014, he \u201cdecertified\u201d Ace and Officer Keightley because of the manner in which Officer Keightley (and other officers in the K-9 unit) had been recording their training hours. Nevertheless, Ace and Officer Keightley were recerti-fied by Officer McNerney just two days later. Despite acknowledging that he had recertified Officer Keightley and Ace in May 2014, Officer McNerney testified that he had observed several problems with the manner in which Officer Keightley trained with Ace, including \u201ccuing,\u201d \u201cobject focusing,\u201d and \u201ca lot of falsing issues,\u201d in addition to inadequate sniff time. He also reported that he was concerned that the drug samples that were being hidden as training aids for the dogs to find had become stale, and he had replaced several of the samples during the summer of 2014 after a chemist\u2019s analysis confirmed that the sample drugs being used for training contained \u201csignificant impurities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">On cross-examination, Officer McNerney acknowledged that, after he became head trainer (in September 2013), he had personally conducted recertification testing of Officer Keightley and Ace in January 2014, and he had certified that they passed the test on January 22, 2014. Pursuant to Maryland Transportation Authority Police standard operating procedures, recertification is supposed to occur every six months. Consequently, the January 22, 2014, certification would have been current and \u201cin effect\u201d at the time of the scan of Grimm\u2019s vehicle on April 19, 2014. Officer McNerney also acknowledged that he had been \u201cinvolved with\u201d the initial certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>of Officer Keightley and Ace back in 2012, and that they passed the initial certification test on the first try.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">After the close of evidence at the suppression hearing, defense counsel argued that, based upon the training records and field performance records for Ace and Officer Keightley, the court should find that Ace was not a reliable drug-detection dog on April 19, 2014, and that his alert to narcotics therefore did not provide probable cause to conduct a warrant-less search of Grimm\u2019s vehicle. Grimm also disputed whether Ace actually alerted to contraband at all during the stop. The State countered that the evidence established that Ace was well-trained and certified, and was therefore reliable, which meant that, under <em>Florida v. Harris, </em>Sgt. Lamb had probable cause to search Grimm\u2019s vehicle based upon Ace\u2019s alert to the presence of contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The circuit court denied Grimm\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the search of his vehicle. The court observed that there was no dispute that Sgt. Lamb had a reasonable basis to conduct a <em>Whren </em>stop of the vehicle because none of the occupants were wearing seatbelts. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (\u201cAs a general matter, the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.\u201d). And, the court noted, there was no suggestion that the traffic stop was unreasonably extended for the purpose of conducting the dog scan. <em>Cf. Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 583, 774 A.2d 420 (2001) (K-9 scan was conducted prior to officer\u2019s completion of tasks incident to the initial purpose of the traffic stop). The suppression court noted that \u201cthe State concedes[,] as I think it rightly should[,] that there is no probable cause absent the K-9 alert.\u201d And, the court added: \u201cI will tell you that[,] absent the K-9 alert, if this had been litigated solely on those issues <em>[i.e., </em>what the officers knew prior to the K-9 alert], I would not have found probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">But the court concluded that, after Ace scanned the vehicle and gave an alert for the presence of narcotics, Sgt. Lamb had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>probable cause to search Grimm\u2019s vehicle. The court found that Ace and Officer Keightley were certified at the time of the stop and the scan. The court expressly found Sgt. Davis to be the most credible witness who testified in the case. The court elaborated: \u201cI find her qualifications, her knowledge, her training and experience to be impeccable.... I find her to be the most credible witness and it is she who I rely upon the most and find to be the best and most objective observer.\u201d The court also said: \u201cI find her analysis of the stop and the dog\u2019s actions to be credible.\u201d The court further commented: \u201cShe explains, ... to the satisfaction of the Court that I can find Officer Keightley and K-9 Ace to be credible and to be a certified dog that the Court can rely upon for assessing whether or not probable cause exists.\u201d The court therefore concluded that there was probable cause in this case for the officers to believe that there was a \u201cfair probability\u201d that one of the drugs that Ace was trained to detect would be found in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-242(d)(2), Grimm entered a conditional plea of guilty to possession of heroin with intent to distribute; he was sentenced to a 15-year term of imprisonment. This direct appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">A. Standard of Review of Motions to Suppress Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">When we review a ruling from the circuit court concerning a motion to suppress evidence, \u201cwe must rely solely upon the record developed at the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Briscoe v.

The defendant, for example, may contest the adequacy of a certification or training program, perhaps asserting that its standards are too lax or its methods faulty. So too, the defendant may examine how the dog (or handler) performed in the assessments made in those settings. Indeed, evidence of the dog\u2019s (or handler\u2019s) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>history in the field, although susceptible to the kind of misinterpretation we have discussed, may sometimes be relevant .... And even assuming a dog is generally reliable, circumstances surrounding a particular alert may undermine the case for probable cause\u2014if, say, the officer cued the dog (consciously or not), or if the team was working under unfamiliar conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1057-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The <em>Hards </em>Court expressly rejected \u201crigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries in favor of a more flexible, all-things-eonsidered approach\u201d for a suppression court to apply when assessing whether a drug-detection dog was sufficiently reliable for its alert to be used in establishing probable cause to conduct a warrantless search. <em>Id. </em>at 1056.

Most prominently, an alert cannot establish probable cause under the Florida court\u2019s decision unless the State introduces comprehensive documentation of the dog\u2019s prior \u201chits\u201d and \u201cmisses\u201d in the field. (One wonders how the court would apply its test to a rookie dog.) No matter how much other proof the State offers of the dog\u2019s reliability, the absent field performance records will preclude a finding of probable cause. That is the antithesis of a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The Supreme Court summarized the proper approach to be followed by the court hearing a motion to suppress a warrant-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>less search for which the State claims probable cause was provided by an alert by a drug-detection dog:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">In short, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog\u2019s alert should proceed much like any other. The court should allow the parties to make their best case, consistent with the usual rules of criminal procedure. And the court should then evaluate the proffered evidence to decide what all the circumstances demonstrate. If the State has produced proof from controlled settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defendant has not contested that showing, then the court should find probable cause. If, in contrast, the defendant has challenged the State\u2019s case (by disputing the reliability of the dog overall or of a particular alert), then the court should weigh the competing evidence. In all events, the court should not prescribe, as the Florida Supreme Court did [in <em>Harris v. State, </em>71 So.3d 756, 759 (Fla. 2011)], an inflexible set of evidentiary requirements. The question\u2014similar to every inquiry into probable cause\u2014is whether all the facts surrounding a dog\u2019s alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime. A sniff is up to snuff when it meets that test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvF\"><em>Id. </em>at 1058 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">C. Ace\u2019s Reliability</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In Grimm\u2019s briefs in this Court, he urges us to review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether Ace was a \u201cwell-trained dog.\u201d He asserts: \u201cSpecifically, the question of whether Ace is well-trained or otherwise reliable for purposes of establishing probable cause is a mixed question of law and fact subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d Citing <em>Ornelas, supra, </em>517 U.S. at 696-98, 116 S.Ct. 1657, Grimm argues that appellate courts are obligated to conduct <em>de novo </em>review of probable cause determinations. But he neglects to take sufficient notice of the point that, although the <em>Ornelas </em>Court held that, \u201cas a general matterf,] determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 699, 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>S.Ct. 1657, the Court also emphasized, in the very next sentence, that findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, with deference to the trial-level court: \u201cHaving said this, we hasten to point out that a reviewing court should take care both to review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Grimm\u2019s request for us to conduct <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence presented regarding Ace\u2019s ability (or lack of ability) to detect drugs invites us to commit an error similar to the one that ensnared the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Harris v. State, </em>71 So.3d 756, 772-75 (2011), wherein that appellate court was highly critical of the quality and quantity of evidence the State of Florida had presented at the suppression hearing regarding the drug dog\u2019s successes and failures during training sessions and scans in the field. But, after the United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded that case, the Florida Supreme Court abandoned its list of eviden-tiary hurdles the prosecution was required to overcome, and summarily affirmed the suppression court\u2019s denial of Harris\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Harris v. State, </em>123 So.3d 1144 (Fla. 2013) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Whether Ace was\u2014at the time of the scan of Grimm\u2019s vehicle\u2014a well-trained or reliable dog, whose alerts could be relied upon by Officer Keightley as indicating that there was a fair probability that the vehicle contained one of illegal drugs Ace had been trained to detect, was a question of fact properly committed to the adjudicatory skill of the judge who heard the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress. An appellate court is ill-equipped to determine the proper amount of weight to be given to various pages of the extensive documentation in evidence regarding a dog\u2019s performance during training exercises, or to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or weigh the conflicting testimony of experts. Such factual determinations are best left to the suppression court judge who hears the evidence, and are best reviewed under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard that gives deference to that judge\u2019s superior opportunity to evaluate credibility and weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the evidence. <em>See Longshore, supra, </em>399 Md. at 520-21, 924 A.2d 1129 (stating that \u201c[findings of fact and credibility are to be made by trial courts, not appellate courts\u201d); <em>Haley, supra, </em>398 Md. at 131, 919 A.2d 1200 (explaining that appellate courts \u201cdo not engage in <em>de novo </em>fact-finding.\u201d). As an appellate court, we are obligated to \u201cgive deference to the first-level factual findings made by the suppression court, and we accept those findings unless shown to be clearly erroneous,\u201d <em>Briscoe, supra, </em>422 Md. at 396, 30 A.3d 870, while giving \u201cdue regard to the [suppression] court\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Gorman v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 412, 421, 897 A.2d 242 (2006). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Florida v. Harris, </em>\u201ca probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog\u2019s alert should proceed much like any other.... [If] the defendant has challenged the State\u2019s case (by disputing the reliability of the dog overall or of a particular alert), then the court should weigh the competing evidence.\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 1058. Clearly, the court that \u201cshould weigh the competing evidence\u201d is the suppression court, not the appellate court reviewing a challenge to the suppression court\u2019s finding on the issue of the reliability of the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Here, the circuit court evaluated all the evidence and expert testimony, and determined that Sgt. Mary Davis was the most credible of the experts who testified. Although the court, in the judicious exercise of courtroom courtesy, commented that the experts called by the defense were \u201cboth credible,\u201d the court also expressed concern that their testimony was colored by some \u201cdissension in the ranks\u201d regarding management at the Maryland Transportation Authority Police, and \u201csome of this [testimony by Mr. Cox and Officer McNerney] was an airing of dirty laundry.\u201d The weighing of testimony and evaluation of which experts\u2019 opinions to credit are functions quintessentially best performed by the judge who hears the witnesses testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Although Grimm urges us to review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether Ace was a well-trained dog, he argues, in the alternative, that, even \u201cif the lower court\u2019s findings bear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>ing on whether Aee was well-trained or reliable are not themselves subject to <em>de novo </em>review, they are clearly erroneous .... \u201d In support of this argument, Grimm points to several aspects of the suppression court\u2019s ruling with which he disagrees. He asserts that the court\u2019s conclusion that Sgt. Davis was \u201cthe most credible expert\u201d was clearly erroneous because the court also commented: \u201cI find her to be a witness who has no ties to the case, neutral and unbiased and has\u2014I find that she has no issue with the handler or the dog.\u201d Grimm asserts that, because Sgt. Davis had performed a recertification of Ace in August 2014, \u201cher [own] professional reputation was also challenged\u201d and she \u201chad a direct investment in the outcome of this suppression hearing\u2014her reputation.\u201d This argument addresses the suppression court\u2019s weighing of the evidence, and does not support a claim that the court made a clearly erroneous finding of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>United States v. Ludwig, </em>641 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 2011), the suppression court had resolved in favor of the prosecution conflicting testimony of dog experts. The appellate court found no clear error, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">[A]t the end of this battle of the experts, the district court chose to credit [the government\u2019s expert] rather than [the defendant\u2019s] expert. On appeal, we may not revisit the site of this battle, recreate it in our imaginations, and resolve it for ourselves anew. Neither is it enough for [the defendant] to ask us (as he does) simply to credit his expert\u2019s conclusions rather than the government\u2019s. Instead, it is incumbent on [the defendant] to show that the district court\u2019s resolution of the experts\u2019 credibility contest was not just wrong but clearly or pellucidly (and so reversibly) wrong. And this he has not done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">So, too, in this case, the suppression court chose to credit the testimony of the State\u2019s expert rather than the defendant\u2019s experts. We detect no clear error in the suppression court\u2019s decision to accept the expert opinions offered by Sgt. Davis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>regarding the reliability of Ace, the adequacy of his training, and the validity of his alert to Grimm\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Grimm also urges us to conclude that the court\u2019s finding that Ace was a reliable dog was clearly erroneous in the face of evidence of training deficiencies. Grimm states: \u201cPerhaps the most obvious flaw in Ace\u2019s training is the fact that Keightley [personally] placed Ace\u2019s training aids, with cuing being the result.\u201d A double-blind training regimen would have been preferable, according to the Scientific Working Group on Dog and Orthogonal Detector Guidelines. Further, according to Grimm, Ace\u2019s training records did not reflect adequate training efforts to address the dog\u2019s \u201cfalse alerts.\u201d Mr. Cox opined that too little effort was documented to satisfy him that Officer Keightley had conducted training exercises sufficient to \u201cextinct\u201d Ace from alerting to non-target odors. And, according to Grimm, Sgt. Davis\u2019s testimony as to why she was not overly concerned about Ace\u2019s false alerts was not supported by the training records.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Grimm further urges us to conclude that the suppression court was clearly erroneous in finding Ace to be reliable because there was evidence presented at the suppression hearing to show that the drug samples used as training aids had become contaminated with impurities, which may have led to Ace responding to odors other than the five target narcotics. In addition, Grimm contends that the training conducted by Officer Keightley had \u201cinadequate trainer supervision,\u201d which was a problem for all of the dog handlers at the Maryland Transportation Authority Police due to inadequate staffing\u2014part of the \u201cdirty laundry\u201d to which the suppression court made reference. Grimm states in his brief: \u201cMcNerney eventually resigned over the dysfunction surrounding the training of Ace and other MTA K-9s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">As noted above, Officer McNerney decertified Ace and Officer Keightley in May 2014 because of the manner in which the handlers logged training time. But Officer McNerney also recertified Ace and Officer Keightley just two days after decertifying them, and presumably, they could not have com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>pleted much compensatory training during those two days. Sgt. Davis said she would not have \u201cdecertified\u201d Ace and Officer Keightley, and she saw no issue with the manner in which Officer Keightley had been logging training hours; she said that, in her experience, she had seen handlers typically record training hours in the same manner as Officer Keight-ley.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Grimm nevertheless argues that the fact that Ace was decertified in May 2014 proved that \u201cAce was not actually certified in any meaningful sense at the time of the scan\u201d of his vehicle. He makes this argument in spite of the fact that his expert witness was the trainer who conducted Ace\u2019s recer-tification in January 2014 and testified that certifications are valid for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Grimm asserts that Mr. Cox\u2019s analysis of the dash-cam video recording of the scan should have been accepted by the suppression court as proof that Ace did not actually alert to an odor of narcotics. But Sgt. Davis presented a different analysis, putting a stamp of approval on the scan and the alert; and the suppression court found her to be the more credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Grimm also urges us to focus on Mr. Cox\u2019s testimony regarding his analysis of Ace\u2019s training records that showed 44 \u201cfalse alerts\u201d in 179 training scenarios. Mr. Cox considered that unacceptable. But, in contrast to Mr. Cox\u2019s analysis, Sgt. Davis had analyzed a different period of time and found a much lower rate of false alerts during training scenarios. And she testified that there was no particular amount of false alerts that she would find unacceptable. Instead, she said, \u201cI would always be wondering why they are occurring.... And I would make a plan to address them if I thought they were problematic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">After pointing out evidence that was favorable to the defense, Grimm argues, \u201cthere was overwhelming evidence that Ace was not well-trained and not reliable when he scanned Appellant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d Grimm urges us to conclude: \u201cEven under a clearly erroneous standard, when this Court reviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the \u2018entire evidence\u2019 on its own it will be \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u2019 i.e., that Ace was neither well-trained, nor reliable. <em>Kusi [v.

[362,] 383, 91 A.3d 1192 [ (2014) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The State takes issue with most of Grimm\u2019s characterizations of the evidence, and devotes a portion of its brief to a countering review of Ace\u2019s training records. The State asserts that the records from 2012 through July 2014 reflect that \u201cAce was tested 679 times in his training history,\u201d and it appears that, during those tests, \u201cAce gave false positive alerts 16 times.... That equates to a mere 2 percent false-positive rate.\u201d And, the State argues, \u201cAce failed to alert to the presence of drugs 32 times, ... which equates to a false-negative rate of 4.7 percent.\u201d Grimm disagrees with the State\u2019s analysis of how well Ace performed during his training classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">But, because our standard of appellate review requires us to view \u201cthe trial court\u2019s findings of fact, the evidence, and the inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the [prevailing] party,\u201d <em>Robinson, supra, </em>451 Md. at 108, 152 A.3d 661, we need not respond to each item of evidence that Grimm highlights. It is sufficient for us to say that there was competent evidence in the record that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, supported the suppression court\u2019s finding that Ace was a sufficiently well-trained drug-sniffing dog that it was appropriate for Officer Keightley and Sgt. Lamb to rely on Ace\u2019s alert as an indication that there was a fair probability they would find narcotics in Grimm\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">D. Admission of Ace\u2019s Post-Scan Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Grimm\u2019s final argument as to why we should reverse the ruling of the suppression court is based upon the admission of evidence regarding the recertification of Ace four months after the scan of his vehicle. Grimm asserts: \u201cWhether Ace passes a certification four months after the scan of Appellant\u2019s vehicle is not relevant to an assessment of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>reliability on the day of the scan .... \u201d Grimm argues that the court committed reversible error in admitting irrelevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The issue arose during the direct examination of Sgt. Davis, who testified that she and other officers from the Montgomery County Police had participated in an evaluation and certification of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police\u2019s canine unit during August 2014 (ie., approximately four months after the scan of Grimm\u2019s vehicle). When the prosecutor offered documents relative to the August visit, defense counsel objected, and the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">[Counsel for Grimm]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">THE COURT: Grounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">[Counsel for Grimm]: Relevance, Your Honor. These documents are all from August of 2014. The incident in question here happened on April 19th, 2014. So this is months after the fact. So it\u2019s just a question of relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">THE COURT: I understand that, but it still relates to the overall training of the dog .... I\u2019m going to overrule. I think it\u2019s relevant. I mean, I think that the field performance and the training that they do after can be just as important as before. It confirms whether or not the dog still can do what the dog was trained to do or the dog can\u2019t do what the dog was trained to do. So I think it can come in a couple different ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">[Counsel for Grimm]: Oh, I understand, Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know how much weight I\u2019m going to give it ... but in terms of admissibility I think it\u2019s admissible for a couple of reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">We review a question of whether evidence is legally relevant for legal error. <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 725, 25 A.3d 144 (2011); <em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 437, 970 A.2d 320 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Maryland Rule 5-401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d to mean \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Here, a primary issue for the suppression court to decide was whether Ace was a well-trained, reliable dog on the date of the scan of Grimm\u2019s vehicle. There was no dispute in the testimony that Ace had been certified by the Maryland Transportation Authority Police, and had been recertified many times, to be well-trained in the detection of heroin and other narcotics. Yet, although Ace had been recertified in January 2014, Grimm was arguing at the suppression hearing that Ace was no longer reliable in April 2014. Grimm\u2019s attack upon Ace\u2019s reliability\u2014despite the fact that his own expert had previously certified him as reliable\u2014was tantamount to arguing that Ace had somehow lost his ability to reliably detect the odor of narcotics. Although, as the suppression court noted, the recertification in August 2014 might be of limited weight in establishing whether Ace had lost the ability to detect narcotics as of April 19, 2014, it was evidence that had some tendency to make it improbable that Ace had suffered a loss of his olfactory sense, and consequently, this evidence would rule out one potential argument or possible explanation as to why Ace might have been less reliable on April 19, 2014, than he had been in January 2014. The evidence was, therefore, not irrelevant as a matter of law, and the suppression court did not err in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.
