An Anne Arundel County jury convicted Williams of second-degree assault, but he was acquitted of first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, a number of weapons offenses, and posting revenge porn in violation of Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.), \u00a7 3-809 of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In Williams\u2019s timely appeal, he complains of the trial court\u2019s admission of his prior conviction for battery on cross-examination of his character witnesses and of the court\u2019s response to a jury question. Finding no error or abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Williams and Swan were involved in an intimate relationship from 2012 to October of 2015. Although they did not live together, Swan had a key to Williams\u2019s house, often stayed overnight, and kept her belongings there. Swan testified that in the last few months of their relationship they had argued frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">On October 23, 2015, Swan stayed at Williams\u2019s house at his request. The next morning, while Swan was in the bathroom, wearing only a shirt, her cell phone started ringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Williams was near her phone at the time. He noticed a text message from a man whom Swan had denied knowing only days earlier. Williams read the man\u2019s text messages, along with messages from three other men. He saw that Swan had sent a nude photograph to someone. Williams grabbed Swan\u2019s cell phone and confronted her in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Swan claimed that Williams called her a \u201cbitch,\u201d accused her of cheating on him, shoved her against the bathroom wall, threw her phone towards her, hit her upper body, pushed her to the floor, and kicked her while she was on the floor on her back, all the while demanding that she leave. According to Swan, she said that she would leave, and Williams backed away, but continued yelling at her. After a few moments, she went upstairs to gather her clothes and belongings. She claimed that Williams threw her pants down the stairs and held a gun to her head while he was using her phone to tell someone to come and get her before he killed her. She also claimed that he pushed her down the stairs as she begged him to let her leave. After Williams allegedly pushed her into a closet and took her purse, she claimed that she was able to escape, with a towel wrapped around herself, and with some of his possessions (which she said she intended to trade for hers). She said that she found her pants and some of her belongings outside of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">After the confrontation, Swan drove to a nearby convenience store to call 911. She told the operator that Williams had attacked her and held a gun to her head, but that she did not need medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">A police officer arrived. He spoke to Swan, who was \u201cvisibly upset,\u201d \u201cshaking,\u201d and \u201ccrying a lot.\u201d She told the officer that Williams had physically assaulted her, pulled a gun on her, and pushed her down the stairs. The officer requested emergency medical services, but Swan refused treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The officer went to Williams\u2019s house and retrieved Swan\u2019s phone. After he returned it to her, Swan received a call on her cell phone from a friend. The friend told Swan to check her Facebook account because nude photographs of her had been posted on her Facebook page. The officer showed Swan how to delete the posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Testifying in his own defense, Williams denied punching or kicking Swan or threatening her with a gun. He claimed that after looking at the information in her phone and discovering evidence of her infidelity, including the nude picture that she had sent to another man, he had ordered her out of his house. He admitted that he had \"tried to grab the towel\" that she had around her waist and that he \"tried to push her out the front door.\" Williams denied that he owned a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Williams called Arkina Taylor, his former neighbor, as a character witness. Taylor said she had known Williams for ten years and that he was her \"best friend.\" Taylor offered her opinion that Williams was a \"hard-working fun-loving guy that just likes to have a good time.\" She testified that he had a reputation in the community as being a \"[pleaceful\" person and that she had \"never\" seen him with a firearm or become violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">When given the opportunity to cross-examine Taylor, the State asked to approach the bench, and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">[STATE]: Now that she has said he's a peaceful person-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">[COURT]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">[STATE]: -the State is entitled to rebut that by asking her if she's aware that he has a prior conviction for battery.[ <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">[COURT]: Uh-huh. I think you are, too. Do you want to say anything about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I do. I think that the State should not be allowed to do that. If the State knew the specific facts of what that battery is, they-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>[COURT]: Well, why would that be, because I don\u2019t think the State is allowed to get into the facts; all they\u2019re allowed to do is ask that single question. Remember, they\u2019re not allowed to say or ask for their\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would think at this point, that they\u2019re referring to a conviction back in 1990 and I think it\u2019s certainly more prejudicial than probative and I don\u2019t think the State should be allowed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">[STATE]: It is 1990, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">[COURT]: 1990. If she\u2019s known him for 10 years\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">[STATE]: But they\u2019re\u2014it\u2019s her best friend, so it\u2019s very relevant if she [sic] ever told him if she is aware of his prior convictions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">[COURT]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">[STATE]: \u2014that he\u2019s a peaceful and non-violent man. I mean it\u2019s completely relevant, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">[THE COURT]: Uh-huh. I think it is, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I would just argue that this is a conviction that dates back 25 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\">[THE COURT]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It dates a full 16 years prior to her knowing him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-15\">[THE COURT]: Does that make any difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think it does. I think it\u2019s certainly more prejudicial than probative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-17\">[COURT]: Well, here\u2019s the problem I\u2019m having and maybe you can help me with this; there\u2019s a difference between admitting it (indiscernible\u201410:52:04) and admitting it because it may not be a true fact, if he\u2019s always been a peaceful man, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-19\">[THE COURT]: And I think the State is trying to get it in to show that he\u2019s not peaceful. And so there\u2019s no requirement that it did not date back to at least\u2014you know, even in 15 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think there is. I specifically-asked whether or not, based upon her knowledge of him and the length of time that she knew him, that he was peaceful, and based upon that, her knowledge, and those ten years of his reputation in the community, I think unless the State has some other hinge of evidence that he\u2019s gotten a reputation, based upon that past prior for being not peaceful or being violent, it shouldn\u2019t be allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u215c * \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">[STATE]: They opened the door. They put his peacefulness in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">[THE COURT]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">[STATE]: Whether\u2014and I\u2019m not going to do this\u2014first off, I do it (indiscernible\u201410:53:03) how well she knows him, because if she doesn\u2019t know about this, then she really doesn\u2019t know him that well, and if she does know about this, then he\u2019s not a peaceful\u2014his reputation is in question. They\u2019ve completely opened this door\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">[COURT]: I think it comes in and the [State] will be entitled to say, knowing that, does that change your opinion of his peaceful character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Over a defense objection, the State asked Taylor if she was aware of Williams\u2019s prior conviction for battery and, if she was not, whether this knowledge would cause her to change her opinion of him. She answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">After the court had permitted the State to impeach Williams\u2019s first character witness with evidence of his 1990 conviction for battery, Williams called two more character witnesses: Dana Webb, a former girlfriend; and Kamran Jones, a coworker. They had known Williams for six and 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>years, respectively. They testified that Williams had a reputation for peacefulness and that they had never seen him with a firearm or become violent. On direct examination, Williams\u2019s attorney asked both of them whether they knew of Williams\u2019s 1990 battery conviction and, if they did not, whether it would change their opinion of him. Both said, \u201cno.\u201d The State revisited that topic on cross-examination, and the witnesses reiterated their earlier answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">At the end of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the court granted a motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of posting revenge porn. The State entered a nolle prosequi on the charge of use of a handgun in a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The court submitted the remaining counts to the jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the second-degree assault count and acquitted Williams of the four remaining counts. The court imposed a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but six months suspended, to be followed by two years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Williams filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Williams presents two issues on appeal, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by allowing the State to ask a witness about Mr. Williams\u2019s prior battery conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by failing to give a complete response to jurors\u2019 question about second-degree assault?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">For the reasons that follow, we answer both questions in the negative. Consequently, we shall affirm Williams\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">I. The Admission of Williams\u2019s Prior Conviction for Battery</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">In general, \u201cevidence of a person\u2019s character or character trait is not admissible to prove that the person acted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>accordance with the character or trait on a particular occasion.\u201d Md. Rule 5-404(a)(l). In a criminal case, however, \u201c[a]n accused may offer evidence of the accused\u2019s pertinent trait of character.\u201d Md. Rule 5\u2014404(a)(2)(A). \u201cIf the evidence is admitted, the [State] may offer evidence to rebut it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In <em>Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 479, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948), the Supreme Court explained: \u201cThe price a defendant must pay for attempting to prove his good name is to throw open the entire subject which the law has kept closed for his benefit and to make himself vulnerable where the law otherwise shields him.\u201d If a defendant\u2019s character witness is unaware of information bearing on the defendant\u2019s character, \u201cthe jury may doubt whether [the witness] is capable of giving any very reliable conclusions as to [the defendant\u2019s] reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 69 S.Ct. 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Williams contends that his prior conviction was \u201ctoo remote in time to be relevant.\u201d Alternatively, he contends that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We disagree that the court erred or abused its discretion in permitting the State to question the character witnesses about the conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">A. Relevance</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">A court may admit relevant evidence, but it has no discretion to admit evidence that is irrelevant. <em>Smith v. State, </em>218 Md.App. 689, 704, 98 A.3d 444 (2014). A ruling that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>evidence is legally relevant is a conclusion of law, which we review <em>de novo. See id. </em>A prior conviction is relevant to impeach character testimony if it \u201cimpugns the particular character trait or traits in issue.\u201d <em>State v. Watson, </em>321 Md. 47, 55, 580 A.2d 1067 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Williams relies on <em>Watson </em>to establish that his prior conviction was \u201ctoo remote in time to be relevant\u201d on cross-examination of his character witnesses. <em>Watson </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In <em>Watson, </em>the defendant was charged with first-degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 580 A.2d 1067. In his defense, he \u201ccalled eight character witnesses, all of whom testified to their opinions as to [his] peaceful and non-violent character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 580 A.2d 1067. The State countered by cross-examining the character witnesses about their knowledge of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for second-degree rape. The circuit court allowed the cross-examination over the defendant\u2019s objection that the offense \u201cdid not involve force\u201d and that \u201cthe conviction was for having sexual intercourse with a consenting 13-year-old girl.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 580 A.2d 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On appeal, the Court concluded that the circuit court erred in allowing the State to use the conviction for second-degree rape in cross-examining the character witnesses, because \u201chaving sexual intercourse with a consenting 13-year-old girl [bore] little, if any, relationship to the defendant\u2019s character for peacefulness and non-violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 580 A.2d 1067.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the prior conviction was irrelevant to the character trait at issue, the <em>Watson </em>Court did not consider whether the conviction for second-degree rape was \u201ctoo remote in time to be relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In reaching its decision, the <em>Watson </em>Court referred to a multi-volume treatise on federal evidence, which, the Court said, \u201csuggest[s]\u201d that the trial judge should take the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>steps when the State seeks to cross-examine a character witness about a defendant\u2019s prior misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">1) determine that there is a good faith basis for the inquiry; 2) determine that the acts or events about which the [State] proposes to inquire are relevant to the particular character trait testified to by the witness on direct examination; 3) <em>determine that the acts are not too remote in time to be relevant cross-examination of the character witness-, </em>4) reject any inquiry where the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value; and 5) if requested, instruct the jury that the purpose of the question is only to test the basis for the character witness\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 54, 580 A.2d 1067 (quoting 2 David W. Louisell &amp; Christopher B. Mueller, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 138, at 152 (1985)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Nonetheless, <em>Watson </em>did not explore when a conviction is \u201ctoo remote in time to be relevant\u201d on cross-examination of character witnesses. Nor has any subsequent Maryland decision. Williams himself offers no guidance as to when a defendant\u2019s conviction might be so old and stale that, as a matter of law, it is irrelevant to impeach a witness\u2019s testimony about a defendant\u2019s character. Instead, Williams concedes that, \u201cthere is no hard-and-fast time limit for convictions to be subject to cross-examination of a character witness.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Although Williams cites no authority besides the dicta in <em>Watson, </em>we have examined the treatises of Professor McLain, Judge Murphy, Judge Weinstein, McCormick, and Wigmore to see if they shed any light on when a conviction might be so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>remote that it becomes legally irrelevant for purposes of impeaching a character witness\u2019s credibility. None do. McCormick does, however, state that \u201cmost courts\u201d adopt the \u201cpractical solution\u201d of \u201caccept[ing] testimony about reputation as of any pretrial time period which the judge in his discretion finds is not too remote.\u201d <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 43, at 282-88 (7th ed. 2013). Similarly, in <em>Michelson, </em>335 U.S. at 484, 69 S.Ct. 213, the Supreme Court wrote that \u201c[t]he court, in its discretion, may well exclude inquiry about rumors of an event so remote, unless recent misconduct revived them.\u201d In other words, although some convictions might be so old that they no longer have any conceivable bearing on the character of the person whom the defendant has become <em>(see, e.g., </em>Victor Hugo, <em>Les Miserables </em>(1862)), the question of whether a conviction is too remote to be used to impeach a character witness\u2019s testimony is typically one for the trial court, in its discretion, to resolve. <em>State v. Cummings, </em>332 N.C. 487, 422 S.E.2d 692, 703 (1992) (it is within the sound discretion of the trial judge to determine whether a past instance of conduct should be excluded after weighing its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Williams\u2019s 1990 battery conviction was not so old that, as a matter of law, it no longer had any conceivable relevance to his character for peacefulness. Evidence is \u201crelevant\u201d if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. Williams\u2019s character for peacefulness was a \u201cfact that [was] of consequence to the determination of the action,\u201d and we cannot say that Williams\u2019s battery conviction was too remote to have any bearing on whether he was a peaceful person or whether his character witnesses had a sound basis for their testimony. Even though the conviction was not particularly fresh, the jury might arguably have gotten an incomplete impression of Williams\u2019s character for peacefulness if it heard only the favorable accounts from his character witnesses and did not hear of his conviction for a violent act at an earlier stage in his life. The circuit court, therefore, did not err in concluding that the battery conviction was relevant for purposes of impeaching the character witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">B. Probative Value vs. Danger of Unfair Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Even if evidence is relevant, a court may exclude it \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-403. The trial court declined to exclude the evidence of Williams\u2019s prior battery conviction on this ground. We review that decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 705, 824 A.2d 123 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">When weighing the probative value of proffered evidence against its potentially prejudicial nature, a court abuses its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>discretion \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court, or when the court acts without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d <em>Webster v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 100, 112, 108 A.3d 480 (2015) (citations and quotation marks omitted). For the court to have abused its discretion, \u201c[t]he decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009). The decision \u201cwill not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Williams claims that the battery conviction was \u201chardly probative at all\u201d because it occurred a decade or more before any of the character witnesses knew him. Neither the circuit court nor the jury, however, was required to give the conviction the weight that Williams assigns to it. Even though the conviction predated their friendship or association with Williams, the jury could have discounted the witnesses\u2019 testimony about his character for peacefulness because they did not know of a violent incident in his past. <em>See Watson, </em>321 Md. at 53, 580 A.2d 1067. Alternatively, because the witnesses said that they maintained their good opinion of Williams after becoming aware of his conviction, the conviction may have led the jury to question the soundness of their judgment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Williams cites <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 436 A.2d 906 (1981), for the proposition that once the jurors were \u201cinformed that [Williams] had been previously convicted of the same [sic] crime in the past,\u201d they were \u201cseriously prejudiced\u201d against him. His reliance on <em>Ricketts </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\"><em>Ricketts </em>concerns the State\u2019s misuse of a prior conviction to impeach a defendant\u2019s own credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 714, 436 A.2d 906. In this case, however, no such risk existed. In closing, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">I want to talk briefly about the Defense witnesses you heard from. You heard from a parade of the Defendant\u2019s friends who talked about how he was a peaceful or a non-violent person. Well, you know, when I asked them, were you aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the Defendant had ever been previously convicted of battery, none of them knew. None of them knew. Then I asked them if it would change their opinion. All of them: No, it wouldn\u2019t change my opinion. Are you kidding me? It\u2019s not going to change your opinion of this person that you know has been previously convicted of assaultive behavior. Are you kidding me? Friends are friends, but that doesn\u2019t make sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The State\u2019s use of Williams\u2019s prior conviction to challenge the reliability of the character witnesses\u2019 testimony was unequivocal. Unlike <em>Ricketts, </em>where the prior conviction \u201cshed[ ] no light\u201d upon the defendant\u2019s veracity <em>(id. </em>at 713-14, 436 A.2d 906), knowledge of Williams\u2019s prior conviction in this case \u201csheds light\u201d upon the soundness of the character witnesses\u2019 judgment. <em>See Watson, </em>321 Md. at 53, 580 A.2d 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Furthermore, even if the evidence of Williams\u2019s prior conviction was prejudicial, it was not <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial, because the State\u2019s questions were not \u201can inquiry specifically directed to a prior bad act\u201d <em>(Winters v. State, </em>301 Md. 214, 232, 482 A.2d 886 (1984)), but an \u201ceffort to probe the veracity of the opinions offered and the witnesses\u2019 basis of knowledge in formulating those opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 482 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In summary, although a different judge might have reached a different conclusion, the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, was not required to prohibit the State from impeaching the character witnesses with evidence of Williams\u2019s 25-year-old battery conviction. Because the character witnesses testified to Williams\u2019s reputation for peacefulness based on their experiences over as much as 15 years, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to permit the State to use Williams\u2019s conviction to challenge the basis for the witnesses\u2019 testimony. <em>Cf. Jackson v. State, </em>340 Md. 705, 722, 668 A.2d 8 (1995) (concluding that it would be \u201cpatently unfair\u201d to permit defendant to present a \u201cstellar\u201d picture of himself to the jury, but preclude the State to impeach him -with evidence of a prior conviction that contradicts this image).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>II. Jury Instruction on Defense of Property</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">During deliberations, the jury asked the trial court for the definition of second-degree assault. At that time, defense counsel asked the court to include a reinstruction on the defense of property, which Williams says was one of his defenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court refused to \u201chighlight\u201d it and, instead, recited the second-degree assault instruction that it had given earlier. <em>See </em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions (\u201cMPJI-Cr\u201d) 4:01 (2d ed. 2013). The court apparently agreed with the State that reinstructing the jury on defense of property \u201cwould emphasize a particular instruction that they have not inquired about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Williams complains that the court\u2019s refusal \u201cleft jurors with an incomplete instruction and inhibited Williams\u2019s defense.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Under Maryland Rule 4-325(a), \u201c[t]he court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing arguments and may supplement them at a later time when appropriate.\u201d \u201c \u2018The main purpose of a jury instruction is to aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Appraicio v. State, </em>431 Md. 42, 51, 63 A.3d 599 (2013) (quoting <em>Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 48, 650 A.2d 727 (1994)). \u201cSupplemental instructions can include an instruction given in response to a jury question.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision to give a particular jury instruction under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s decision to give a particular jury instruction will not be disturbed on review except on a clear showing that it was manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons. <em>Id.; see also Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 653-60, 702 A.2d 261 (1997) (suggesting that the refusal to given an instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Had the jury inquired about the effect of Williams\u2019s claim of defense of property on the second-degree assault charge, then reinstruction on defense of property might have been necessary. <em>See, e.g., State v. Baby, </em>404 Md. 220, 263-64, 946 A.2d 463 (2008) (when jurors inquired about the effect of withdrawing consent during vaginal intercourse, it \u201cwas not sufficient\u201d simply to refer the jury to the legal definition of rape); <em>Lovell, </em>347 Md. at 659-60, 702 A.2d 261 (concluding that where the jury\u2019s question indicated concern about youthful age as a statutory mitigating circumstance, the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to provide further guidance on the term \u201cyouthful age\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In this case, however, the jury had asked only for the definition of second-degree assault, not for any further information concerning defense of property or its relation to second-degree assault. The trial court, therefore, was not required to reinstruct the jury on the defense of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In both of the rulings challenged by Williams, the trial court acted within its discretion. \u201c[Wjhile the law gives [Williams] the option to show as a fact that his reputation reflects a life and habit incompatible with commission of the offense charged, it subjects his proof to tests of credibility designed to prevent him from profiting by a mere parade of partisans.\u201d <em>Michelson, </em>335 U.S. at 479, 69 S.Ct. 213. Moreover, the jury\u2019s request for the definition of second-degree assault required only one answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\">. Because Williams was acquitted of most of the charges against him (including the most serious charges), we do not view the facts, as we normally would, in the light most favorable to the State. In recounting the factual background in this case, we largely recount the evidence that the jury heard, and not necessarily the facts that the jury found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">. On the day after the altercation, Swan did go to a hospital to seek treatment for a bruise on her leg, which she attributed to the assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">. The record contains a certified copy of a document from the District Court of Maryland for Prince George's County (District 5). The document indicates that on April 25, 1990, Williams pleaded guilty to battery, which was a common-law offense at the time. See Robinson v. State, 353 Md. 683, 694, 728 A.2d 698 (1999). Williams paid a $75.00 fine and court costs and was placed on probation for one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\">. Before calling the character witness and eliciting her opinion, Williams did not move <em>in limine </em>for a ruling concerning whether the State could impeach her with the battery conviction. Nor did Williams request a cautionary instruction to the effect that the jury should consider the conviction only insofar as it bore on the witness\u2019s testimony about his character. <em>See generally State v. Watson, </em>321 Md. 47, 58, 580 A.2d 1067 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">. Although Williams himself raised the issue of the conviction with the second and third character witnesses, the State does not argue that he has waived his challenge to the court's ruling. <em>See Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 433, 583 A.2d 218 (1990) (quoting <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 144, 202 A.2d 585 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 1001, 85 S.Ct. 721, 13 L.Ed.2d 702 (1965)) (\u201c[t]he general rule is that a party waives his objection to testimony by subsequently offering testimony on the same matter' \u201d); <em>compare Cure v. State, </em>421 Md. 300, 305, 26 A.3d 899 (2011) (holding that when court has ruled <em>in limine </em>that State may impeach defendant with prior conviction, defendant does not necessarily waive the ability to challenge that ruling by bringing up the prior conviction while testifying on direct examination in order to \"draw the sting\u201d out of the conviction). Because the State does not argue waiver, we do not decide that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">. Despite the references by Court and counsel to the 13-year-old victim\u2019s \u201cconsent,\u201d today we would recognize that she was legally incapable of consenting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\">. Williams does not argue that a court must apply the 15-year time limit that Rule 5-609 imposes on the use of convictions to impeach the credibility of a witness. In decisions concerning the analogous federal rule, courts have refused to apply that time limit to restrict the use of defendant's convictions to cross-examine a character witness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, </em>549 F.2d 362, 367 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 828, 98 S.Ct. 107, 54 L.Ed.2d 87 (1977); <em>State v. Hart, </em>72 Ohio App.3d 92, 593 N.E.2d 463, 467 (1991) (\"Courts have previously rejected the notion that the ten-year limitation under Evid. R. 609, concerning impeachment by prior conviction, should be construed in conjunction with Evid. R. 405(A)\u201d) (quoting <em>Edwards).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\">. The Louisell treatise, which the Court of Appeals quoted in <em>Watson, </em>no longer appears to be in print. A successor treatise asserts that the probative value of a conviction is doubtful if it concerns events that occurred more than 10 years in the past. <em>See </em>2 Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 4.43, at 33 (4th ed. 2013). Nonetheless, the treatise cites no case for the proposition that such a conviction is irrelevant as a matter of law. Instead, the treatise cites a number of cases, including the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Michelson, </em>in which courts have permitted the prosecution to cross-examine character witnesses with convictions that are more than 10, or even 20, years old. <em>Id. </em>at 33 n.41 (citing <em>Michelson, </em>335 U.S. at 484, 69 S.Ct. 213 (permitting inquiry about arrest 27 years earlier, where some acquaintances had known defendant for 30 years, and defendant had volunteered information about another arrest 20 years earlier)); <em>United States v. Booz, </em>451 F.2d 719, 722 n.1 (3d Cir. 1971) (permitting inquiry about conviction 13 years earlier); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>549 F.2d 362, 367 (5th Cir. 1977) (affirming court\u2019s exercise of discretion to permit inquiry about 25-year-old conviction, and rejecting argument that court should have applied 10-year limit contained in rule concerning impeachment of defendant with prior convictions bearing on character for truthfulness); <em>Harbin v. Interlake S.S. Co., </em>570 F.2d 99, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>(6th Cir. 1978) (permitting inquiry about 13- and 15-year-old convictions); <em>Cummings, </em>422 S.E.2d at 703 (affirming discretionary decision to permit inquiry about 23-year-old conviction); <em>see also United States v. Spero, 625 </em>F.2d 779, 780 (8th Cir. 1980) (district court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant\u2019s 22-year-old prior conviction where credibility of witnesses\u2019 testimony was crucial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">. Although the court instructed the jury on defense of property, the State argues that Williams did not generate the defense (and hence that the court could not have erred in declining to reinstruct the jury on that defense). In particular, the State argues that Williams adduced no evidence of his belief that Swan was illegally interfering with his property. <em>See Maryland Criminal Jury Instructions and Commentary </em>\u00a7 8.04 (2014-2015 ed.). In view of Swan\u2019s testimony that she absconded with some of Williams\u2019s belongings in the hope that she could trade them for her phone, we assume for the sake of argument that Williams satisfied his minimal burden of generating some evidence to support an instruction on this defense. <em>See, e.g., Dykes </em>v. <em>State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
