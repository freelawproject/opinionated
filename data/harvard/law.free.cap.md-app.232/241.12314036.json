Johnson (\u201cAppellant\u201d or \u201cJohnson\u201d) for a broken tail light in Germantown, Maryland. After more officers and a K-9 unit arrived at the scene, Johnson and her two passengers were asked to exit the vehicle. The police searched Johnson\u2019s two jacket pockets and found nothing, but when they searched Anthony Haqq, the front passenger, they found a baggie of 13 grams of marijuana in his waistband and smelled PCP on his breath. As they arrested the front passenger, the police proceeded to search Johnson\u2019s entire vehicle, including the trunk, while the K-9 stood idly by. A digital scale and 104.72 grams of marijuana were found inside a paper bag inside a backpack that was inside the trunk. Then the officers arrested Johnson, and diming the search incident, found $544.00 on her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">A grand jury charged Johnson with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and conspiracy possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Prior to trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Johnson moved to suppress all evidence seized by the police, who she claimed, violated the protection afforded her under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution against unreasonable searches and seizures. The circuit court denied Johnson\u2019s motion, and the case proceeded to trial. The jury found Johnson guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>court sentenced Johnson to five years suspended in favor of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On appeal, Johnson presents two issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">1. \u201cDid the police have reasonable articulable suspicion to continue detaining Ms. Johnson after a reasonable amount of time to process a traffic stop had passed?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">2. \u201cDid the police have probable cause to search Ms. Johnson\u2019s trunk based on drug evidence found on the person of her front-seat passenger?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Johnson\u2019s questions confine our review to the facts and argument presented before the suppression court. <em>See Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 498-99, 924 A.2d 1129 (2007); <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 368, 735 A.2d 491 (1999). Because the officers lacked probable cause to believe that drugs were in the trunk based solely on the drugs found in the waistband and on the breath of the front passenger, we hold that the suppression court erred by concluding the officers were permitted to conduct a warrantless search of the trunk pursuant to the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine. <em>See Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925); <em>see also California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1999); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 434, 921 A.2d 881 (2007). Given our disposition of this issue, we need not address Johnson\u2019s first question.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A3J\">Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The circuit court held a hearing on Johnson\u2019s motion to suppress on April 16, 2015. Because the State tried Johnson and her front-seat passenger, Haqq, together, the suppression court heard arguments from both defendants on their pending motions. Johnson claimed the officers lacked reasonable artic-ulable suspicion to prolong the stop past the purpose of writing a citation for the traffic law violation and that the officers lacked probable cause to search the trunk of Johnson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>vehicle. Officers Robert Sheehan and Michael Mancuso testified for the State, and Haqq testified for the defense. The following facts were established at the suppression hearing from these witnesses, and from Officer Sheehan\u2019s dashboard camera video of the traffic stop, which was played during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The defective tail light on Johnson\u2019s car was apparent on the video of the stop that occurred at 7:25 p.m. on January 9, 2015 near the intersection of Middlebrook Road and German-town Road in Germantown. Johnson had two passengers with her: Anthony Haqq<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the front seat and Kevin Helms<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">At the time of the stop, Officer Sheehan was assigned to the Germantown District Community Action Team, a unit placed \u201cin areas of high crime for crime suppression.\u201d He had served as a police officer for twelve years, including approximately one year on the Special Investigations Criminal Street Gang Unit, and approximately one year on the Special Investigations Narcotics Enforcement Team. Officer Sheehan also took several classes concentrating on drug interdiction, and completed 417 hours of training on drug interdiction. He testified that the stop occurred in a high-crime area.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Officer Sheehan explained that he initiated the traffic stop to issue the driver a safety equipment repair order. When he activated his emergency equipment, Johnson drove \u201cvery slowly,\u201d turned into a Safeway parking lot, and stopped in the second parking aisle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It had been snowing and was dark out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>so Officer Sheehan shined a spotlight on the rear window of Johnson\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Furtive Movements and Nervousness</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Officer Sheehan perceived, through the rear window of the vehicle, Johnson and the front-seat passenger, Haqq, making \u201cfurtive movements.\u201d Specifically, he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">It looked like [Johnson] may have been manipulating something in the center console area. She was bent over it. I could see her hand, her left hand on the steering wheel as she bent over the center console area, reaching in that area and reaching over towards Haqq\u2019s seat. ... I could see her, portion from her elbow up moving, and I could see her shoulder. I couldn\u2019t see her arm. I\u2019m sorry. Her hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAFE\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">[Haqq] was moving around in his seat. He appeared to be either reaching under his seat on to the floorboard in front of his seat, and occasionally would lift his rear end up off the seat and then bring it back down, as if he was either trying to reach underneath where he was sitting, or the seat or the floorboard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Haqq contested Officer Sheehan\u2019s observations and testified that neither he nor Johnson were moving around in their seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Officer Sheehan related that, after observing the furtive movements, the first thought that came to his mind was that the vehicle\u2019s occupants were trying to conceal drugs or weapons. So at 7:25:50 p.m. he \u201cjump[ed] out of [his] car real quick to [go] up to the vehicle to see what was going on.\u201d Shining his flashlight into the vehicle as he approached, he observed Haqq \u201cleaned over his own legs\u201d and that \u201chis hands were in between his legs.\u201d According to Officer Sheehan, when he got to the driver\u2019s window and introduced himself, Haqq \u201cimmediately jumped back in his seat ... and pulled his shirt down over his crotch area.\u201d Johnson\u2019s \u201cvoice was shaking[,]\u201d and Officer Sheehan observed \u201cthe carotid pulse in her neck [was] beating rapidly[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Officer Sheehan attested that in his twelve years of experience conducting traffic stops, he developed a sense for \u201ctraffic stop nervous,\u201d which he described as \u201ca normal baseline for a person that I just stopped for a regular violation.\u201d Johnson, however, was \u201cextremely nervous\u201d according to Officer Shee-han, who described Johnson\u2019s \u201ctrembling\u201d hands \u201cfumbl[e] through her wallet for her license .... \u201d From these observations, Johnson appeared to Officer Sheehan more nervous than \u201ctraffic stop nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Johnson asked Haqq for help locating the vehicle\u2019s registration in the glove box, but \u201che didn\u2019t move\u201d and instead sat \u201clike a statue\u201d staring out the window. Haqq\u2019s brief testimony during the hearing that he \u201cjust sat in [his] seat and stared out the window\u201d was consistent with Officer Sheehan\u2019s version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Upon returning to his patrol car at 7:26:27 p.m., Officer Sheehan called in to request that his Germantown District Community Action Team members assist him with the stop. Immediately thereafter, he began processing the traffic stop on \u201ceTix,\u201d and conducting the routine license, registration, and warrant cheeks in four systems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While conducting these checks he observed Haqq resume making furtive movements. Specifically, Officer Sheehan testified that \u201c[a]s I am working on the computer, I can see now that Mr. Haqq is no longer statue-esque [sic] and not moving\u201d but rather, \u201cI could see ... the top of [Haqq\u2019s] body moving back and forth ... lifting up off his seat and leaning back a little bit\u201d and \u201chis arms moving in front on him.\u201d At the point on the video corresponding to Officer Sheehan\u2019s testimony, a voice is heard on the video informing Officer Sheehan that \u201cNICIC clear. 2009 Mitsubishi 4-door. License status, valid. Points zero. NCIC person clear.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Just after Officer Sheehan received the information on the background checks, Officer Dos Santos arrived at the stop at 7:29:30 p.m. Officer Sheehan brought Officer Dos Santos up to date, explained that he had already requested a K-9 unit, and recommended that they wait for another member of the team to arrive for \u201cofficer safety reasons\u201d before approaching the vehicle again because there were three occupants in the car. At 7:32 p.m. Officer Mancuso arrived, and after Officer Shee-han summarized his observations, the three officers approached Johnson\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Frisk and Search Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Officer Sheehan asked Johnson to step out of the car so that he could show her the broken brake light and ask her a few questions. The video displayed the following exchange beginning at 7:32:44 p.m.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">Officer Sheehan: Who are these people in the car with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">Ms. Johnson: Oh. My friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">Officer Sheehan: Friends? Where are y\u2019all coming from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">Ms. Johnson: Coming from right over here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">Officer Sheehan: Okay. And then stopping you, I could see a lot of movement in the car, all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">Ms. Johnson: Oh. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">Officer Sheehan: Okay? You were moving around a lot, he was moving around an awful lot, front passenger, and I couldn\u2019t see him because of the salt on the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-14\">Ms. Johnson: Oh. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-15\">Officer Sheehan: What were you guys doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-16\">Ms. Johnson: Oh, nothing. I was just, I mean, moving around, because I don\u2019t understand. I was just (unintelligible), I wasn\u2019t doing anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-17\">Officer Sheehan: Okay. All right. Is anything illegal in the car that I need to know about? No drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-18\">Ms. Johnson: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Officer Sheehan: No weapons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">Ms. Johnson: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">Officer Sheehan: Okay. Where do these guys live? Do they live in the area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">Ms. Johnson: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">Officer Sheehan: Okay. How long have you known them for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">Ms. Johnson: I don\u2019t know. You know, about a month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaV\">Officer Sheehan: Do you know if they have anything illegal on them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\">Ms. Johnson: No. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">Officer Sheehan: Okay. Nothing illegal in the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-12\">Ms. Johnson: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">Officer Sheehan: Can I search your vehicle to make sure there\u2019s nothing illegal inside there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-14\">Ms. Johnson: I\u2019m not understanding why you need to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzR\">Officer Sheehan: I just explained why. Because after I stopped you, you guys were moving around an awful lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-15\">Ms. Johnson: I understand that, I\u2019m just saying that, to me, I\u2019m not understanding why you have to search the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-16\">Officer Sheehan: I don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m just asking consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmS\">Ms. Johnson: Yeah. I just don\u2019t think that that\u2019s appropriate, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-17\">Officer Sheehan: Okay. So, you don\u2019t want me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-18\">Ms. Johnson: I mean, I mean, I don\u2019t\u2014no. Because I don\u2019t understand why you need to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-19\">Officer Sheehan: Okay. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve talked to you, I just thought that I might (unintelligible) them too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZo\">Ms. Johnson: Yeah, I mean. I mean. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">As the quoted exchange demonstrates, Johnson denied Officer Sheehan consent to search her vehicle. But soon after, she did consent to Officer Sheehan\u2019s request to search the outer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>two pockets of her sweatshirt. That search did not reveal any contraband or weapons. Officer Sheehan\u2019s exchange with Johnson concluded at 7:35:16 p.m.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Meanwhile, Officer Mancuso had retrieved Haqq\u2019s information, and Officer Dos Santos had retrieved Mr. Helms\u2019 information. Officer Mancuso remained standing next to Haqq\u2019s passenger window, while Officer Sheehan ran the passengers\u2019 checks. By 7:37:07 p.m. there were five officers on the scene\u2014 Officers Sheehan, Dos Santos, Mancuso, Stone, and Dzenkow-ski. Officer Sheehan testified that while he ran the background checks he also re-opened the e-ticket for the repair order for Johnson\u2019s broken brake light at 7:41 p.m.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By 7:42:39 p.m. Officer Sheehan completed the passengers\u2019 background checks, which revealed both passengers had \u201cPWID [possession with intent to distribute] or distribution priors,\u201d and Haqq had \u201ca couple of assault on law enforcements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">At 7:44:18 p.m. Officer Kelly\u2014the sixth officer\u2014arrived with a K-9. Officer Sheehan informed Johnson that a K-9 unit would conduct a scan of her vehicle. Officer Mancuso testified that, at this point in the stop, he asked Haqq and Helms to exit the vehicle in accordance with the police department\u2019s policy. At 7:46 p.m., before the K-9 scan of the vehicle, Haqq exited the vehicle and, on his own initiative, turned around, placing his hands on the roof of the car, and spread his feet. Haqq testified that he did that because he was nervous. Officer Mancuso testified that he then asked Haqq whether he could conduct a search of his person, and that he smelled POP on Haqq\u2019s breath when Haqq responded to his request. Haqq <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>claimed Officer Mancuso did not ask him anything, but proceeded to search his pants area and shirt. The search revealed a baggie of 13.14 grams of marijuana in Haqq\u2019s waistband. Officer Mancuso testified that based on his training and experience, he knew the baggie contained over 10 grams of marijuana.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Haqq was arrested. The officers then conducted a search of the entire vehicle, including the trunk. In the trunk they discovered a backpack, according to Officer Sheehan, who testified: \u201cI opened up the backpack, and inside was ... a large black shopping bag ... inside, I could see orange peels, coffee grounds, a digital scale, and a large container of 4C Iced Tea Mix. When I opened up the container of 4C Iced Tea Mix, there was a gallon sized bag of marijuana inside of it.\u201d He related that the marijuana was found to weigh 104.72 grams. When the officers placed Johnson under arrest, Officer Dzenkowski searched Johnson and found $544.00 in cash \u201cfolded into different bundles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">During closing arguments, the State argued that <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), permits officers to conduct traffic stops with the dual purposes of issuing a citation for a traffic law violation and investigating a suspected crime and that the traffic stop can transmute into a <em>Terry </em>investigation of a suspected crime. The State contended that the officers did not unreasonably detain Johnson and Haqq because the traffic stop began at 7:25 p.m. and was ongoing through 7:32 p.m., at which point the officers had developed reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop when they learned that both passengers had \u201cpossession with intent to distribute priors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>According to the State, by 7:46 p.m., the officers had developed probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of the entire vehicle pursuant to the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine after Officer Mancuso smelled POP on Haqq\u2019s breath and performed a consent search revealing a baggie of 13.14 grams of marijuana in Haqq\u2019s waistband. The State confirmed that Officer Kelly did not conduct a K-9 scan of the vehicle because the marijuana found on Haqq \u201csupplied the probable cause\u201d to search the entire vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Johnson countered that the police detained her unlawfully beyond the time it took to effectuate the traffic stop\u2014and that the furtive movements and Johnson and' Haqq\u2019s degree of nervousness were insufficient to form reasonable suspicion for a second stop because police cannot rely on nervousness to form the requisite probable cause under <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 497, 698 A.2d 1115 (1997). Johnson urged the suppression court (as to the second and dispositive issue in this appeal) that there was no nexus between the marijuana found on Haqq and the marijuana and scale found inside the backpack that was in the trunk of the car. Johnson\u2019s counsel adopted the closing argument of Haqq\u2019s counsel, who asserted that there was \u201cno independent probable cause for the officers to search the inside of the vehicle, let alone the trunk of the vehicle.\u201d \u201c[Mjarijuana found on a passenger is not enough to search a vehicle that he doesn\u2019t own, that he has not been driving.\u201d At best, counsel reasoned, the officers could have performed a <em>Gant </em>search,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which would have been limited to the passenger side of the vehicle where Haqq was sitting. Counsel maintained that the police could only perform a <em>Carroll </em>search if they had probable cause to believe <em>the vehicle </em>contained contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Suppression Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the suppression court reconvened on April 28, 2015 and, in denying Johnson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>motion to suppress, made extensive findings of fact. The court began by observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">[u]pon stopping the vehicle the officer approached and asked for the driver\u2019s information. Thereafter the officer followed normal procedures associated with the routine stop for a broken taillight. Both before and while in the midst of these normal procedures the officer became suspicious of additional illegal activity and initiated further measures of investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">The stop began at 7:25:45. We had the benefit of a video that, of the stop which had a time sequence reported and marijuana was taken from the front passenger, Mr. Haqq, at 7:46:45 just short of 21 minutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The court acknowledged that the determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on \u201ccommon sense judgments and inference about human behavior,\u201d and credited the experience and specialized training of the police officers. The court credited the other facts relied upon by the State, including that 1) the stop occurred in a high crime area, 2) the officer observed Johnson and Haqq\u2019s furtive movements, and 3) Haqq and Johnson showed an \u201cunusual degree of nervousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The court concluded that the repair citation was completed at 7:41 p.m. (even though Officer Sheehan did not physically give the citation to Johnson at that time), \u201capproximately 16 minutes after the stop[,]\u201d and that during this time there was no unlawful detention \u201cwith all that was going on with regard to the warrant checks and with regard to the observations of the defendants by the police officer.\u201d The court next observed that a few minutes later the passengers were asked to exit the vehicle in accordance with police department policy for the purpose of conducting a canine search. The court found that Haqq consented freely to the search of his person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">[Officer Mancuso] testified that upon defendant Haqq stepping outside the vehicle that the defendant immediately faced the car and put his hands up onto the vehicle\u2019s roof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">The defendant admits he did this without officer direction ... because he was nervous .... The officer then asked if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>he could search the defendant\u2019s person to which the defendant responded according to Officer Mancuso [\u2018]go ahead.[']</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQd\">The court also noted that Officer Mancuso smelled PCP on the breath of defendant Haqq when he had exited the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The court rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments that, even if Haqq gave consent, that consent was not voluntary. The court stated its finding on the voluntariness of Haqq\u2019s consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9o\">The Court finds that a reasonable person in this situation would have felt free to decline the officer\u2019s request. The defendant\u2019s consent, defendant Haqq was not coerced or granted only in submission to a claim of lawful authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Significant to this finding is the fact that just minutes earlier defendant Johnson refused to consent to the search of the vehicle which lends credence to and support of the finding that the environment of the stop was not one in which the defendant\u2019s [sic] will were overborne.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The suppression court then turned to the issue of whether the officers had developed probable cause to conduct a search of the entire vehicle pursuant to the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine. In denying the motion to suppress, the court announced its finding that the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle\u2019s trunk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">Under [the Carroll] doctrine if a car is readily mobilef,] and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband[,] the Fourth Amendment permits police to search the vehicle without warrant. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">... Probable cause is a flexible common sense standard. It exists for a warrantless automobile search where facts and circumstances known to the police are such that it would warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that the vehicle contained articles lawfully subject to seizure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">A practical, nontechnical probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">In this case[,] the police recovered a baggie of marijuana from defendant Haqq. The police ... had testified there was a strong odor of PCP on his breath. These facts, in conjunction with the furtive behavior previously observed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>officer, the location of the stop, the evasive answers provided by the occupants and the extreme nervousness of both the front driver and the front passenger occupant were sufficient to establish probable cause to search the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Johnson was tried on the charge for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After a two-day jury trial, Johnson was found guilty on September 22, 2015. As mentioned <em>supra, </em>the trial court sentenced Johnson to five years of imprisonment suspended in favor of supervised probation on November 19, 2015. Johnson filed this appeal timely on December 17, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The Supreme Court has made clear that when the police stop a motor vehicle and detain the oceupant(s), the detention is a seizure that implicates the Fourth Amendment, <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985); <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979), and is \u201csubject to the constitutional imperative that it not be \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). A traffic stop \u201cis reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391; <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 109, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">There is no dispute that the initial traffic stop in this case was valid. Officer Sheehan had probable cause to believe that Johnson violated a traffic law by driving with a broken tail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>light. Indeed, Johnson does not challenge the traffic stop itself; instead, in her first question on appeal she assails the constitutionality of the traffic stop\u2019s duration, and claims Officer Sheehan did not have reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to conduct a <em>Terry </em>investigative stop after the traffic stop concluded. Because we hold that the officers lacked probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of the trunk of Johnson\u2019s vehicle, the issue of whether Officer Sheehan developed reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to conduct a <em>Terry </em>investigative stop is a constitutional question that is not necessary to decide today. <em>Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 171, 638 A.2d 93 (1994) (\u201cWe have long adhered to the policy of not deciding constitutional issues unnecessarily.\u201d). We therefore turn to the second issue presented by Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">H-(</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The issue before us concerns the trial court\u2019s denial of Johnson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence; therefore, we view the facts presented at the suppression hearing in the light most favorable to the prevailing party\u2014in this case, the State. <em>Sellman v. State, </em>449 Md. 526, 531, 538, 144 A.3d 771 (2016); <em>see also Moats v.

We defer to the suppression court\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, and review those findings and determinations for clear error. <em>Williams v. State, </em>372 Md. 386, 401, 813 A.2d 231 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Although we \u2018\u201cdo not engage in <em>de novo </em>fact-finding[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>Padilla v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 210, 218, 949 A.2d 68 (2008) (quoting <em>Haley v. State, </em>398 Md. 106, 131, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007)), \u201c[i]n determining whether a constitutional right has been violated, we make an independent, <em>de novo, </em>constitutional appraisal by applying the law to facts presented in a particular case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>372 Md. at 401, 813 A.2d 231 (citing <em>Wilkes v.

In so doing, we note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>that the burden of justifying the search before the suppression court in this case was upon the State, for \u201conce it is established ... that the search in issue was warrantless, a tectonic shift occurs in the allocation of the burdens. The respective roles of the State and of the defense are procedurally and dramatically reversed.\u201d <em>Epps v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 687, 703, 1 A.3d 488 (2010). \u201c \u2018The very possibility of such a shift is a direct consequence of the Supreme'Court\u2019s strong preference for searches and seizures pursuant to judicially approved warrants over warrantless searches and seizures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704, 1 A.3d 488 (quoting <em>Herbert v.

The Search Exceeded the Scope Permitted Under the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Before this Court, Johnson argues that the police did not have probable cause to search the trunk of her vehicle based on discovering marijuana in Haqq\u2019s waistband and smelling PCP on Haqq\u2019s breath.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Johnson contends that police were required to have a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d to believe that Johnson granted Haqq access to her trunk before they could search the trunk without a warrant. Furthermore, Johnson argues that searches under the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine do not give police officers carte blanche to search the <em>entire </em>vehicle including the trunk. Instead, Johnson contends that the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d limits the scope of a warrant-less search to specific places within a vehicle for which police officers have probable cause to search for the object of the suspected criminal activity. According to Johnson, Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>courts have drawn a distinction between passengers and the driver: passengers, unless there is something indicating otherwise, do not have control over the contents of the vehicle.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Johnson points out that the officers only recovered evidence of drugs on the person of the front-seat passenger, Haqq, prior to their search of the trunk and there was no indication (or evidence) that Haqq may have placed drugs in the trunk of Johnson\u2019s vehicle. According to Johnson, neither Johnson\u2019s furtive movements reaching toward the center console, nor passenger Haqq\u2019s furtive movements pulling his shirt over his knees and reaching toward the floor, could supply the probable cause required for a lawful search of the trunk. Johnson revisits Officer Sheehan\u2019s testimony that Haqq \u201cmight have shoved something under his seat,\u201d and concedes, at most, the facts available to police at the time were that drugs may have been placed by Haqq in the front-passenger side of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Conversely, the State contends the police are not required to have a \u201cparticularized basis\u201d to search specific areas of a vehicle where there is probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime is within the vehicle. The State relies on <em>Acevedo, Ross, </em>and <em>Wilson, supra, </em>for the proposition that because the police recovered marijuana from Haqq during a consent search and further smelled PCP on his breath, the \u201cprobable cause to search Johnson\u2019s car for drugs or paraphernalia extended to every part of the car in which such items could be concealed!,]\u201d including the trunk. Citing <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999), the State rejects Johnson\u2019s contention that we should differentiate between drivers and passengers in determining whether the police developed probable cause, and presses that Johnson\u2019s nervousness and furtive movements proved she was aware Haqq had contraband in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We have not had occasion to examine whether the police may have probable cause to search the trunk of a vehicle without a warrant under the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine based solely on finding drugs on the person of a passenger. We begin our analysis with the ascendant constitutional framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">1. The Requirements and Scope of Searches Pursuant to the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The Reasonableness Clause of the Fourth Amendment provides \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated!.]\u201d U.S. Const, amend. TV. Surveying federal constitutional law, we explained in <em>State v. Andrews, </em>that \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment protects not against all intrusions as such, \u2018but against intrusions which are not justified in the circumstances, or which are made in an improper manner.\u2019 \u201d 227 Md.App. 350, 373-74, 134 A.3d 324 (2016) (quoting <em>Maryland v. King, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1958, 1969, 186 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013)). As such, the Fourth Amendment mandates that searches and seizures be reasonable, but <em>\u201cwhat is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place.\u201d Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Alexander, </em>124 Md.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>App. 258, 265, 721 A.2d 275 (1998)) (emphasis added in <em>Alexander </em>). Reasonableness \u201cgenerally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant[,]\u201d <em>Riley v. California </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2482, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014), for it is an established principle that \u201csearches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u2014subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The National Prohibition Act drove the Supreme Court\u2019s first significant articulation of the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement. <em>Carroll, 267 </em>U.S. at 136, 45 S.Ct. 280. We quote Chief Justice Taft\u2019s vivid rendition of the facts in <em>Carroll:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">We know in this way that Grand Rapids is about 152 miles from Detroit, and that Detroit and its neighborhood along the Detroit river, which is the international boundary, is one of the most active centers for introducing illegally into this country spirituous liquors for distribution into the interior. It is obvious from the evidence that the prohibition agents were engaged in a regular patrol along the important highways from Detroit to Grand Rapids to stop and seize liquor carried in automobiles. They knew or had convincing evidence to make them believe that the Carroll boys, as they called them, were so-called \u2018bootleggers\u2019 in Grand Rapids; i.e., that they were engaged in plying the unlawful trade of selling such liquor in that city. The officers had soon after noted their going from Grand Rapids half way to Detroit, and attempted to follow them to that city to see where they went, but they escaped observation. Two months later these officers suddenly met the same men on their way westward presumably from Detroit. The partners in the original combination to sell liquor in Grand Rapids were together in the same automobile they had been in the night when they tried to furnish the whisky to the officers, which was thus identified as part of the firm equipment. They were coming from the direction of the great source of supply for their stock to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Grand Rapids, where they plied their trade. That the officers, when they saw the defendants, believed that they were carrying liquor, we can have no doubt, and we think it is equally clear that they had reasonable cause for thinking so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 160, 45 S.Ct. 280. The Court held that where \u201cthe search and seizure without a warrant are made upon probable cause, that is, upon a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is subject to seizure and destruction, the search and seizure are valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 45 S.Ct. 280. The Court underscored the difference between a search for contraband located in a premises such as a house, office, or building, versus the search of a movable vessel where the contraband \u201creadily could be put out of reach of a search warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 45 S.Ct. 280. The underlying rationale for the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, therefore, is that vehicles are inherently mobile, and by their very nature, create an exigency. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 45 S.Ct. 280; <em>see also Berry v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 144, 178, 843 A.2d 93 (2004) (explaining that the automobile exception has no separate exigency requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>Carroll, </em>the Court did not address the scope of the search that is permissible, and it took many years before the Supreme Court re-examined the automobile exception in 1982 in <em>Ross, supra, </em>456 U.S. 798, 102 S.Ct. 2157.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The subsequent decisional detours under and around the <em>Carroll </em>doctrine are particularly instructive in considering the present case involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ing the search and arrest of a passenger, followed by the search of a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Historically, the automobile exception was not so relevant where the occupant of a vehicle was arrested, because attendant to that arrest, police were permitted to search the entire vehicle. <em>See United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950), <em>overruled in part by Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969)). The automobile exception assumed greater prominence, however, after <em>Chimel </em>and <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981)\u2014cases in which the Supreme Court limited significantly the breadth of a permissible search incident to arrest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In <em>Ross, </em>the Supreme Court set out to address \u201cthe extent to which police officers\u2014-who have legitimately stopped an automobile and who have probable cause to believe that contraband is concealed somewhere within it\u2014may conduct a probing search of compartments and containers within the vehicle whose contents are not in plain view.\u201d 456 U.S. at 800, 102 S.Ct. 2157. There, detectives had received a tip from a reliable informant that Ross was selling narcotics from the trunk of his car parked at a certain address. <em>Id. </em>The detectives drove immediately to that address to investigate. <em>Id. </em>After identifying the car, the detectives drove around the block to avoid alerting anyone of their presence. <em>Id. </em>Upon their return five minutes later, the detectives observed the same car turning on to another street. <em>Id. </em>at 801, 102 S.Ct. 2157. The detectives confirmed the driver matched the informant\u2019s description of Ross, stopped the car, and asked Ross to exit the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>A bullet was discovered on the front seat and then a pistol was found in the glove compartment. <em>Id. </em>Ross was arrested. Then detectives proceeded to search the trunk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>car, finding a paper bag containing heroin and a leather pouch with $3,200.00 in cash. <em>Id. </em>After Ross was charged with possession of heroin with intent to distribute, he moved to suppress the heroin and money found in closed containers in the trunk. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In holding that a warrant was not required to search both closed containers, the Supreme Court explained that the scope of a warrantless search of an automobile \u201cis defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 824, 102 S.Ct. 2157. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">Just as probable cause to believe that a stolen lawnmower may be found in a garage will not support a warrant to search an upstairs bedroom, probable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantless search of a suitcase. Probable cause to believe that a container placed in the trunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Accordingly, \u201cthe scope of the warrantless search authorized by the [automobile] exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could authorize legitimately by warrant. If probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825, 102 S.Ct. 2157. The police were therefore permitted to search the closed containers\u2014a paper bag and leather pouch\u2014in the trunk without a search warrant because the officers had probable cause that contraband was concealed somewhere in the vehicle based on the reliable informant\u2019s tip that he had seen Ross sell narcotics from the trunk of his car and \u201cheard [Ross] say he possessed additional narcotics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817 n.22, 102 S.Ct. 2157.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">In 1991, the Supreme Court rejected the distinction made in earlier cases between an automobile and personal property that may be placed in an automobile and held that the reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>expectation of privacy in an automobile now applies to containers placed in vehicles. <em>Acevedo, supra, </em>500 U.S. at 576, 111 S.Ct. 1982. In <em>Acevedo, </em>a federal drug enforcement agent seized a package of marijuana sent via federal express, and arranged a sting operation with a police officer to arrest the individual who arrived to claim the package. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 111 S.Ct. 1982. After Jamie Daza claimed the package, the officers followed him to his apartment. <em>Id. </em>The officers later observed Charles Acevedo enter Daza\u2019s apartment and leave with a paper bag similar in size to the marijuana package. <em>Id. </em>The officers then observed Acevedo put the bag in the trunk of his car and drive off. <em>Id. </em>Concerned that they would lose the evidence, the officers stopped Acevedo, opened the trunk, and found the bag of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>After Acevedo was charged with possession of marijuana for sale, he moved unsuccessfully to suppress the marijuana found in the trunk. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 111 S.Ct. 1982. The state intermediate appellate court reversed, concluding that the motion should have been granted. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that because \u201cthe officers had probable cause to believe that the paper bag contained drugs but lacked probable cause to suspect that Acevedo\u2019s car, itself, otherwise contained contraband,\u201d the officers needed a search warrant to open the paper bag. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the officers required a warrant to search a closed container\u2014the bag of marijuana found in the trunk\u2014when the officers had probable cause to believe that the bag contained drugs but lacked probable cause to search the entire vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 111 S.Ct. 1982. Thus, the distinction between <em>Ross </em>and <em>Acevedo </em>was the probable cause; in <em>Ross </em>officers had probable cause to believe that contraband was somewhere in the vehicle whereas in <em>Acevedo </em>officers had probable cause to believe that contraband was in the container in the trunk. The Court noted that, in <em>Ross, </em>the Court had already recognized that \u201c \u2018prohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing [the police] first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 574, 111 S.Ct. 1982 (quoting <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 821, 102 S.Ct. 2157). The Court affirmed the interpretation of the <em>Carroll </em>doctrine set forth in <em>Ross, </em>and held the same principles apply to containers found in an automobile. <em>Id. </em>Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority in <em>Acevedo, </em>observed that the <em>Ross </em>Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">went on to note: \u2018Probable cause to believe that a container placed in the trunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.\u2019 <em>[Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 824, 102 S.Ct. 2157.] We reaffirm that principle. In the case before us, the police had probable cause to believe that the paper bag in the automobile\u2019s trunk contained marijuana. That probable cause now allows a warrantless search of the paper bag. The facts in the record reveal that the police did not have probable cause to believe that contraband was hidden in any other part of the automobile and a search of the entire vehicle would have been without probable cause and unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Although, as we have already noted, there is no appellate decision in Maryland that has examined the precise question at issue in this appeal, in 2007 <em>Wilson, supra, </em>this Court had occasion to apply the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine as defined by <em>Ross </em>and <em>Acevedo. </em>In that case, a police officer initiated a traffic stop upon observing Wilson exceed the posted speed limit. <em>Wilson, </em>174 Md.App. at 438, 921 A.2d 881. As the officer asked Wilson for his driver\u2019s license and registration, he noticed the smell of burnt marijuana emanating from the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>The officer informed Wilson that he detected the odor and asked Wilson and his passenger to step out of the vehicle so he could search the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>The officer requested a K-9 drug detection unit, which did not arrive until after the officer concluded his search. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 921 A.2d 881. The officer did not find contraband in the passenger compartment of the vehicle but he found six and a half pounds of marijuana in the trunk. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>After surveying the decisions from numerous other jurisdictions that had addressed circumstances similar to those presented in <em>Wilson, </em>this Court concluded the warrantless search of the trunk was permissible under the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 921 A.2d 881. The Court noted that \u201cthe odor of burnt marijuana emanating from a vehicle provides probable cause to believe that additional marijuana is present elsewhere in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the location-specific principle\u2014 that the search is limited to where officers have probable cause to believe the item is located\u2014\u201cdoes not apply when officers have only probable cause to believe that contraband is located somewhere within the vehicle, rather than in a specific compartment or container within the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In summary, \u201cif officers have probable cause to believe that contraband is in only one part of a car, then they are limited to that area. If, on the other hand, officers have probable cause to believe that contraband is located somewhere in a car, but they don\u2019t know exactly where, then they can search the entire vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444-45, 921 A.2d 881 (quoting <em>United States v. Seals, </em>987 F.2d 1102, 1107 n.8 (5th Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Turning to the case on appeal, we first note important factual distinctions from <em>Ross, Acevedo, </em>and <em>Wilson. </em>In each of those cases the officers had probable cause to suspect that drugs were located in the trunk based on an informant\u2019s tip\u2014 as in Ross\u2014or by police observation\u2014as in Acevedo\u2014or, based on the odor of marijuana emanating from the vehicle, that drugs were \u201csomewhere in the car\u201d\u2014as in <em>Wilson. </em>In this case, the police found a baggie of marijuana in a front passenger\u2019s waistline and smelled the odor of PCP on his breath after he stepped out of the vehicle. The police had already searched Johnson\u2019s pockets\u2014the driver and owner of the vehicle\u2014and found no contraband on her person. There was no indication that she had taken any illegal drugs, and certainly her nervousness could not, alone, establish reasonable suspicion, let alone probable cause, that she was transporting contraband in the trunk of her car. <em>See Ferris, supra, </em>355 Md. at 389, 735 A.2d 491 (cautioning against placing too much reliance upon nervousness when analyzing a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>reasonable suspicion). The information given to the police about the passenger, Haqq, was that he was a friend of Johnson\u2019s, whom she had known only \u201cabout a month.\u201d There was no testimony or evidence presented to suggest that Haqq had any control over the vehicle, or would have had access to the trunk as say, if he was on a long road trip or in a common criminal enterprise with Johnson. Indeed, neither Officer Sheehan nor Officer Mancuso testified as to why they had probable cause to believe drugs were located in the trunk. Interestingly, this case presents circumstances that are exactly inverse to those presented in Acevedo\u2014here the police had probable cause to believe that there were drugs in the passenger compartment of the vehicle, but not the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Applying the principles expressed in <em>Acevedo, Ross, </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>the permissible scope of the search in this case was defined by the object of the search: to find contraband that Haqq may have left or concealed within the vehicle. The police did not articulate a reasonable suspicion to believe that contraband was hidden in the trunk, or somewhere generally in the car,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or beyond the passenger compartment, and therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the police lacked probable cause to support a warrantless search of Johnson\u2019s trunk.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The State urges that <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, supra, </em>526 U.S. 295, 119 S.Ct. 1297, supports its argument that there is no longer a distinction between a driver and a passenger in determining the scope of the search of a vehicle under the <em>Carroll </em>doctrine. In <em>Houghton, </em>a police officer stopped a vehicle for exceeding the speed limit and driving with a broken brake light. 526 U.S. at 297, 119 S.Ct. 1297. While questioning the driver, the officer noticed a hypodermic syringe in the driver\u2019s shirt pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 298, 119 S.Ct. 1297. After the driver admitted to using the syringe to take drugs, backup officers ordered the two passengers\u2014one of whom was Sandra Houghton\u2014out of the ear so that they could search the passenger compartment for contraband. <em>Id. </em>In the backseat of the vehicle, the officer found Houghton\u2019s purse, proceeded to search it, and found drug paraphernalia and a syringe containing methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>Houghton was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>charged with felony possession of methamphetamine and was convicted of that crime after the court denied her motion to suppress. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In <em>Houghton, </em>it was uncontested that the police officers had probable cause to believe there were illegal drugs in the car and, therefore, could search the vehicle without a warrant pursuant to the <em>Carroll </em>doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 119 S.Ct. 1297. The issue the Court addressed was whether a container (Houghton\u2019s purse) belonging to a passenger and left in the passenger compartment of a vehicle was lawfully within the scope of a <em>Carroll </em>search. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 119 S.Ct. 1297. The Court declined to create an exemption to the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine for a passenger\u2019s property, and, instead, held that police officers with probable cause to search a vehicle under the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine may also search a passenger\u2019s purse capable of concealing the object of that search found in a vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 119 S.Ct. 1297. \u201c[Njeither <em>Ross </em>itself nor the historical evidence it relied upon admits of a distinction among packages for containers based on ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 119 S.Ct. 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The State reasons that because the <em>Houghton </em>Court refused to create a passenger-property exemption to the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine, all passenger-driver distinctions are irrelevant under the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine. Accordingly, the State maintains that the drugs found in Haqq\u2019s waistband and the PCP odor on his breath were all the police needed to form the requisite probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of the entire car, including the trunk, for drugs and paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The State\u2019s reading of <em>Houghton </em>is a paralogism, for it ignores the point that once the <em>object </em>of the search establishes the proper <em>scope, </em>all areas and property within the scope may be searched. \u2018 \u201cIf probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of that search.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 301, 119 S.Ct. 1297 (quoting <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 825, 102 S.Ct. 2157). The <em>Houghton </em>Court reasoned that an exemption for property belonging to a passenger, \u201cwould dramatically reduce the ability to find and seize contraband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and evidence of crime\u201d because \u201cone would expect passenger-confederates to claim everything as their own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305-06, 119 S.Ct. 1297. Nothing in <em>Houghton </em>suggests, however, that it is irrelevant whether the probable cause to search a vehicle or part of a vehicle is developed through interactions with the driver versus a passenger. We do not interpret the holding in <em>Houghton </em>as eliminating the distinction between passengers and drivers in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The factual circumstances surrounding the stop of Johnson\u2019s vehicle fell short of establishing probable cause that she was transporting contraband in the trunk of her car. Because the scope of a warrantless search of an automobile \u201cis defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found,\u201d <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 799, 102 S.Ct. 2157, before the police may conduct a warrantless search of the trunk of a vehicle, the police must either have probable cause to believe drugs are in the car generally, or, as in this case, where the police find drugs on a passenger, they must articulate a particularized basis to search the trunk, such as the reasons for their belief that the passenger had access to the trunk. Here, the officers lacked probable cause to believe that drugs were in the trunk based solely on the drugs found on the breath and in the waistband of the front-seat passenger. Consequently, the suppression court concluded erroneously that the officers were permitted to search the trunk of the car under the <em>Carroll </em>Doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

At this point during Officer Sheehan's testimony, Johnson's counsel again requested the court rule on the motion to suppress, arguing that the officers did not have probable cause to believe criminal activity was afoot based on the exchange between Officer Sheehan and Johnson, to continue detaining Johnson and her passengers after 7:35 p.m. The suppression court declined again to rule at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\">.

In <em>Wallace, </em>during a valid traffic stop, a canine made two positive alerts indicating that the vehicle may have contained contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 812 A.2d 291.

The Court noted that under Maryland law, there is a \"distinction between drivers and owners and passengers of vehicles.\" <em>Id. </em>at 158-59, 812 A.2d 291.

In the intervening years, the Supreme Court had created a container exception, <em>see United States v.

Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 765-766, 99 S.Ct. 2586, 61 L.Ed.2d 235 (1979). The ensuing confusion between the <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Chadwick </em>principles provoked the Court, in 1999, to overrule <em>Sanders, </em>reasoning that \"it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in <em>Sanders.\u201d Acevedo, supra, </em>500 U.S. at 579, 111 S.Ct. 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\">. On appeal Johnson does not argue, as before the suppression court, that, at most, the officers may have been able to conduct a <em>Gant </em>search limited to the passenger compartment. In <em>Gant, </em>the Supreme Court further limited the rule established in <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981) allowing police to search the passenger compartment of a vehicle after the arrest of a recent occupant of the vehicle. 556 U.S. at 351, 129 S.Ct. 1710. The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">Although it appears that the State\u2019s reading of <em>Belton </em>has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years,11 many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the <em>Chimel </em>exception. Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASG\"><em>Id. </em>at 349, 129 S.Ct. 1710. The <em>Gant </em>Court held that \"[pjolice may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 129 S.Ct. 1710. The Court further explained that when these justifications are absent, \u201ca search of an arrestee's vehicle will be unreasonable unless police obtain a warrant or show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We note that Johnson's case illustrates how the reasonable articulable suspicion required as a basis for a <em>Gant </em>search and the probable cause required for a <em>Carroll </em>search are qualitatively different, and how the scope of the search permitted under each may contrast as well. The doctrines are separate and distinct exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. Clearly, given that reasonable articulable suspicion is a lesser standard than probable cause, <em>see Sellman, supra, </em>449 Md. at 543, 144 A.3d 771, every warrantless search that intrudes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>into an automobile does not automatically become a distended <em>Carroll </em>search.</p>\n<p id=\"aad-dedup-0\">Although <em>Gant </em>was intended to clarify the scope of a search incident to arrest in the context of a motor vehicle search, as Judge Wilner recently noted in <em>Taylor v.

In <em>Taylor, </em>the police conducted a search incident to an arrest after arresting the petitioner for driving under the influence. 448 Md. at 245, 137 A.3d 1029. The search uncovered cocaine in the passenger compartment, and the petitioner was convicted of driving under the influence and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 137 A.3d 1029. After reviewing the different interpretations among other jurisdictions, the Court of Appeals determined that \u201creasonable to believe\u201d is \u201cthe equivalent of reasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 137 A.3d 1029. And, accordingly, it held that the search of the passenger compartment incident to the arrest was permissible under <em>Gant </em>because the officers had reasonable articulable suspicion, based on prior experience with similar arrests, that evidence related to driving under the influence\u2014open containers\u2014\u25a0 might be found in Taylor\u2019s car. <em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 137 A.3d 1029. Once again, neither Johnson nor the State advance an argument based on <em>Gant.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">. Recently, the Court of Appeals held that although the General Assembly had decriminalized the possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana, when the police detect the odor of marijuana emanating from a vehicle, they have probable cause to search the entire vehicle. <em>See Robinson </em>v. <em>State, </em>451 Md. 94, 124-25, 137-38, 152 A.3d 661 (2017). In <em>Norman, supra, </em>the Court considered a different issue: \"whether a law enforcement officer who detects an odor of marijuana emanating from a vehicle with multiple occupants has reasonable articulable suspicion that the vehicle\u2019s occupants are armed and dangerous, and thus may <em>frisk\u2014i.e., </em>pat down\u2014the vehicle's occupants for weapons.\u201d Op. at 378, 156 A.3d 940. The Court reversed the judgment of the circuit court denying Norman's motion to suppress and this Court\u2019s decision affirming, concluding that \"there were insufficient circumstances giving rise to reasonable articulable suspicion that Norman was armed and dangerous to justify the frisk.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 427, 156 A.3d 940. A plurality joined in the precise holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABQ\">where an odor of marijuana emanates from a vehicle with multiple occupants, a law enforcement officer may frisk, <em>i.e., </em>pat down, an occupant of the vehicle if an additional circumstance or circumstances give rise to reasonable articulable suspicion that the occupant is armed and dangerous.
