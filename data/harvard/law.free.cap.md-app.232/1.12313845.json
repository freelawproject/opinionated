We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">On November 25, 2014, by a vote of three to two, the County Commissioners adopted Resolution 14-31, which approved Queenstown\u2019s new zoning classification for the annexed parcel that allowed land uses substantially different, or at a substantially higher density, from what previously had been allowed. On December 2, 2014, four County Commissioners, elected at the 2014 general election, were sworn into office. On December 9, 2014, by a vote of four to one, the County Commissioners adopted Resolution 14-33, which withdrew, rescinded, voided, and nullified Resolution 14-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">In response to the adoption of Resolution 14-33, the Town Commissioners of Queenstown (\u201cthe Town Commissioners\u201d) and the Waterman Family Limited Partnership (\u201cWaterman\u201d), the owner of the subject property, filed, in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, a petition for judicial review and request for a writ of administrative mandamus. Waterman also filed a declaratory judgment action in the same court against the County Commissioners. In both cases, the Town Commissioners and Waterman alleged that the County Commissioners lacked authority to rescind Resolution 14-31. The two cases were consolidated. Kathleen Boomer, Marie McNurlan, Paul A. McNurlan, Stacy L. Swartwood, and the Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation Association (\u201cQACA\u201d) intervened as interested parties, all of whom were aligned with the County Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">After a hearing on July 21, 2015, the circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of Waterman and the Town Commissioners and declared Resolution 14-33 \u201cnull, void and of no legal force and effect\u201d on the ground that the County Commissioners lacked the \u201cauthority to repeal or rescind [Resolution] 14-31.\u201d In addition, the court granted the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>requested in the petition for judicial review and the request for a writ of administrative mandamus filed by the Town Commissioners and Waterman. The County Commissioners and the interested parties filed motions for reconsideration. On September 30, 2015, the court denied the motions. This timely appeal followed. Subsequently, the County Commissioners voluntarily withdrew from the appeal. As a result, the parties before us are the interested parties, whom we shall refer to collectively as \u201cthe QACA appellants,\u201d and the Town Commissioners and Waterman, appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">ISSUE PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The sole issue presented by the QACA appellants for our consideration is whether the County Commissioners had the authority to rescind or repeal Resolution 14-81. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the County Commissioners did have that authority, and as a result, we shall reverse the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The basic facts are not in dispute. Waterman is the owner of approximately 140 acres of land in Queen Anne\u2019s County, commonly referred to as the Wheatlands Farm property, located immediately south of U.S. Route 50 and across from a commercial development known as the Queenstown Outlets. Prior to the events that are the subject of this appeal, the property was zoned Countryside, a designation that permitted agricultural and low density uses. On June 25, 2014, Waterman filed a petition with the Town of Queenstown seeking to have the Wheatlands Farm property annexed into the town. The goal, after annexation, was to seek rezoning. After a public hearing, the Town Commissioners voted to annex the property. Thereafter, the Town Commissioners adopted an ordinance rezoning the Wheatlands Farm property from Countryside to Planned Regional Commercial, which permitted commercial and high density uses. The effective date of that ordinance was dependent upon a waiver by the County Commissioners of the existing zoning density pursuant to Md. Code (2013 Repl. Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 4-416(b) of the Local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Government Article (\u201cLG\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute provided that the property could not be rezoned to permit development for uses substantially different from previously authorized uses or uses at a substantially higher density, for a period of five years, unless the County Commissioners granted express approval and waived the five-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">After a public hearing, on November 25, 2014, the County Commissioners passed Resolution 14-31, which granted the express approval needed to allow for rezoning to a classification that was substantially different and at a higher density. The approval of Resolution 14-31 allowed development consistent with the \u201cPlanned Regional Commercial\u201d classification without having to wait the five-year period referred to in LG \u00a7 4-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">On December 2, 2014, the newly elected commissioners took office. On December 9, 2014, the County Commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>adopted Resolution 14-33, which rescinded the express approval that previously had been granted. In response to that action, Waterman and the Town Commissioners filed the court actions described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Ultimately, the circuit court concluded that the County Commissioners \u201chad no authority to repeal and rescind Resolution 14-31.\u201d On July 21, 2015, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Waterman and the Town Commissioners, and granted the relief requested in the petition for judicial review and writ of administrative mandamus. It also issued a declaratory judgment providing that \u201cResolution 14-33 adopted by the County Commissioners of Queen Anne\u2019s County on December 9, 2014, ... hereby is declared to be null, void and of no legal force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">After the court denied motions for reconsideration, the County Commissioners and the QACA appellants noted appeals to this Court. Subsequently, the County Commissioners dismissed their appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The QACA appellants contend that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Waterman and the Town Commissioners because, under Article XI-F, Section 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>of the Maryland Constitution, the county had the legal authority to adopt Resolution 14-33, thereby rescinding Resolution 14-31. They argue that both Resolutions were public local laws, not public general laws; that LG \u00a7 4-416 cannot restrict Queen Anne\u2019s County\u2019s power under the Maryland Constitution to repeal a public local law like Resolution 14-31; and that even absent an express power to rescind a resolution, the County Commissioners have the inherent power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Appellees argue that, in this context, the County Commissioners\u2019 sole source of authority to act was LG \u00a7 4-416, a public general law; thus, Resolution 14-33 cannot be a public local law under the Maryland Constitution. Pointing out that LG \u00a7 4-416 does not contain an express right to rescind and relying on language in the statute providing that, once waiver has been granted, the Town Commissioners have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over zoning, appellees conclude that the plain language of the statute prohibited the rescission of Resolution 14-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Maryland\u2019s Constitution provides that \u201c[a] code county may enact, amend, or repeal a public local law of that county by a resolution of the board of county commissioners. The General Assembly may amplify the provisions of this section by general law in any manner not inconsistent with this Article.\u201d Md. Const, art. XI-F, \u00a7 6. The Constitution defines \u201cpublic local law\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">a law applicable to the incorporation, organization, or government of a code county and contained in the county\u2019s code of public laws; but this latter term specifically does not include (i) the charters of municipal corporations under Article 11E of this Constitution, (ii) the laws or charters of counties under Article 11A of this Constitution; (iii) laws, whether or not Statewide in application, in the code of public general laws, (iv) laws which apply to more than one county, and (v) ordinances and resolutions of the county government enacted under public local laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Md. Const, art. XI-F, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">There is no dispute that Queen Anne\u2019s County is a code county. <em>See Kent Island Def. League, LLC v. Queen Anne\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>County Bd. of Elections, </em>145 Md.App. 684, 689, 806 A.2d 341, <em>cert. denied, </em>371 Md. 615, 810 A.2d 962 (2002). Thus, the issue to be resolved is whether Resolutions 14-31 and 14-33 were public local laws. Our decision in <em>Kent Island Def. League </em>provides guidance on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><em>Kent Island Def. League </em>arose out of two ordinances enacted by the Queen Anne\u2019s County Commissioners approving a petition to re-designate property pursuant to the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program, which had been enacted by the General Assembly. <em>Kent Island Def. League, LLC, </em>145 Md.App. at 686-87, 806 A.2d 341. A voters\u2019 organization known as Kent Island Defense League, LLC, presented to the Queen Anne\u2019s County Board of Elections a petition to refer the two ordinances to the voters of the County. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 806 A.2d 341. The Elections Director determined that the petition was legally deficient because the ordinances were not subject to referendum and the petition was deficient in form. <em>Id. </em>Kent Island Defense League, LLC and its president, who was a registered voter in Queen Anne\u2019s County, filed, in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, a petition for judicial review of that decision. <em>Id. </em>The developer of the property that was the subject of the referendum petition and others filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that the petition for referendum was legally deficient. <em>Id. </em>After a hearing, the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County held that the ordinances were not subject to referendum. <em>Id. </em>Kent Island Defense League, LLC appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In affirming the circuit court\u2019s judgment, we addressed the issue of whether the ordinances were \u201cpublic local laws\u201d within the meaning of Article XI-F, Section 7 of the Maryland Constitution which provided, in part, as it does now, that \u201c[a]ny action of a code county in the enactment, amendment, or repeal of a public local law is subject to a referendum of the voters in the county[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 806 A.2d 341. We held that the ordinances in question were enacted under the authority of the public general law that established the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program and not pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>county\u2019s home rule powers. <em>Id. </em>at 692, 806 A.2d 341. As a result, the ordinances were not public local laws. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">In reaching that conclusion, we discussed the process of determining whether a law is general or local as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">The classification of legislative action as general or local is based on \u201csubject matter and substance and not merely on form,\u201d <em>Cole v. Secretary of State, </em>249 Md. 425, 433, 240 A.2d 272 (1968), and is determined by applying \u201csettled legal principles to the facts of particular cases.\u201d <em>Dasch v. Jackson, </em>170 Md. 251, 260, 183 A. 534 (1936). Enactments that apply to a single subdivision of the state regarding a subject of local import are considered local laws. <em>See Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 507, 801 A.2d 148, 154 (2002)(citing <em>Steimel v. Bd. of Election Supervisors of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>278 Md. 1, 5, 357 A.2d 386 (1976); and <em>Norris v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 192, 192 A. 531, 537 (1937)). Even an enactment that appears local in nature is a general law if it affects the interests of more than one geographical subdivision or the entire state. <em>See Cole, </em>249 Md. at 434-35, 240 A.2d 272 (citations omitted)(\u201cThe rationale ... lies in the concept that while the immediate objective sought to be achieved was local in character, the statutes indirectly affected matters of significant interests to the entire state: <em>i.e., </em>regulation of elections, control of natural resources, and protection of state revenues derived from licenses.\u201d)(footnote omitted). The fact that the County\u2019s actions followed standard home rule procedures does not mean that the original authorization for the action was the home rule power. The actions were pursuant to, were affected by, and had an effect on, the entire State Critical Area Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 693-94, 192 A. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Applying the analysis discussed in <em>Kent Island Def. League </em>to the facts of the instant case, we conclude that Resolutions 14-31 and 14-33 were public local laws adopted pursuant to Article XI-F, Section 6, and subject to rescission. Both Resolutions applied to the Wheatlands Farm property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>that is located within \u201ca single subdivision of the state.\u201d <em>Kent Island Def. League, </em>145 Md.App. at 693, 806 A.2d 341. Appellees argue that the Town of Queenstown is a subdivision separate from the County. As used in <em>Kent Island Def. League </em>and in the context of this case, the term \u201csubdivision\u201d refers to a county or Baltimore City, however, not a municipality or municipal corporation. A decision regarding the zoning density limits applicable to Wheatlands Farm has no consequence on any land outside of Queen Anne\u2019s County and is a matter of purely local import. Unlike <em>Kent Island Def. League, </em>the instant case does not involve a State mandated program requiring uniformity. Rather, the County\u2019s ability to waive its zoning density limits was purely discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The subject matter of the Resolutions in question leads us to reject appellees\u2019 argument that the County\u2019s authority to waive its zoning density limits for the subject property is derived solely from LG \u00a7 4-416(a), a public general law. Article XI-F, Section 6, allows the General Assembly to \u201camplify the provision of this section by general law in any manner not inconsistent with this Article.\u201d The use of the word \u201camplify\u201d is important in that it allows the General Assembly to increase the County\u2019s power to pass local laws. There is nothing that restricts the power to rescind a local law adopted pursuant to the power granted to the County by Article XI-F, Section 6. Indeed, any express or implied limitation on the County\u2019s right to rescind a local law would stand in direct conflict with the State\u2019s Constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The language in LG \u00a7 4-416 giving \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to the Town Commissioners, relied on by appellees, does not address the issue before us. It simply provides that, once the County has validly approved the rezoning, the Town Commissioners have exclusive jurisdiction. It does not address whether, in fact, a valid approval exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Moreover, even absent an express provision in LG \u00a7 4-416 permitting the rescission of a local resolution, the County has the inherent power to do so. In <em>Dal Maso v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>in reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>actions of the Montgomery County Commissioners, sitting as the District Council, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\">When a zoning board defines or prescribes the character and nature of the buildings which may be made or erected in a given area, its effect is all in the future; its plan is a guide to those who may erect buildings and the uses and businesses to which they may be devoted; its activities are legislative within the limits of the delegation of powers conferred. The Legislature can amend, qualify, or repeal any of its laws, affecting all persons and property which have not acquired rights vested under existing law; all of the courts agree on this. It has been frequently held that this rule applies also to boards and agencies to which legislative power has been delegated and that they may undo, consider and reconsider their action upon measures before them. \u2018It is a general rule, subject to certain qualifications hereinafter noted, that a Municipal Corporation has the right to reconsider its actions and ordinances, and adopt a measure or ordinance that has previously been defeated or rescind one that has been previously adopted before the rights of third parties have vested. Moreover, in the absence of statute or a rule to the contrary, the Council may reconsider, adopt or rescind an ordinance at a meeting subsequent to that at which it was defeated or adopted, at least where conditions have not changed and no vested rights have intervened.\u2019 37 Am.Jur.Sec. 150, p. 762.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><em>Dal Maso, </em>182 Md. 200, 206, 34 A.2d 464 (1943). <em>See also Schultze v. Montgomery County Planning Bd., </em>230 Md. 76, 81-82, 185 A.2d 502 (1962) (An administrative body acting in a quasi-judicial capacity has the right to correct errors in its decisions, but this power must not be exercised arbitrarily and can only be exercised where there is justification and good cause); <em>Cinque v. Montgomery County Planning Bd., </em>173 Md.App. 349, 361, 918 A.2d 1254 (2007) (Maryland recognizes the inherent authority of agencies to reconsider their own quasi-judicial decisions). The Resolutions in question in this case were statements of position or policy with an administrative effect. The reasoning of <em>Dal Maso </em>is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Section 4-416 of the Local Government Article is silent with respect to the power to rescind a waiver. We presume that, at the time the Legislature enacted \u00a7 4-416 and its predecessors, it had full knowledge and information regarding a county\u2019s inherent right to rescind a prior decision. <em>Harden v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>277 Md. 399, 406-07, 354 A.2d 817 (1976) (\u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\u201d) (citing <em>Allers v. Tittsworth, </em>269 Md. 677, 684, 309 A.2d 476 (1973)). Absent a law or doctrine prohibiting such an action, we conclude that the County has the inherent power to reverse its own action with respect to a public local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">As the Court of Appeals recognized in <em>Dal Maso, </em>however, the authority to rescind a resolution is not without limitation. If rights were to vest during the interim between the enactment of a resolution and its rescission, the County would lose its ability to rescind, at least to the extent that rights had vested. <em>Dal Maso, </em>182 Md. at 206-07, 34 A.2d 464. <em>See also Town of Sykesville v. West Shore Communications, Inc., </em>110 Md.App. 300, 305 and 317-22, 677 A.2d 102 (1996)(regarding zoning changes, rights do not vest unless there is some significant and visible construction undertaken in good faith and pursuant to valid permit). There is no assertion in the instant case that any rights vested during the short time that elapsed between the adoption of Resolution 14-31 and the adoption of Resolution 14-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The substantive analysis required by <em>Kent Island Def. League, </em>the provisions of Article XI-F and LG \u00a7 4-416, and Maryland law recognizing the County Commissioners\u2019 inherent right to rescind a prior decision, lead us to conclude that Resolutions 14-31 and 14-33 are public local laws and that the County had the power to reverse its action in Resolution 14-31 by adopting Resolution 14-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Although appellees\u2019 frustration is understandable, the result in this case is a product of our form of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-6\">.

Waterman and the Town Commissioners filed motions to dismiss that petition for judicial review on the grounds that it was untimely and barred by res judicata. An interested party, Edward G.
