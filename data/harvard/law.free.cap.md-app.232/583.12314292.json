Caron imposed money bail as a condition of Smith\u2019s release. Smith became angry and shouted at Caron. As a result, Smith was charged with threatening a State or local official.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">On June 27, 2016, a jury trial was held in the Circuit Court for Washington County. Smith was convicted by the jury and sentenced to three years\u2019 incarceration, all suspended, with nine months to be served in home detention, followed by a period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Smith timely appealed, asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">I. Did the trial court commit plain error in failing to require the jury to find that the Appellant intended to threaten the complainant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">II. Did the trial court err in finding sufficient evidence to convict the Appellant for threatening a State or local official in the manner charged in the State\u2019s indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">III. Did the trial court err in admitting testimony that the Appellant spat in the direction of the complainant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">On August 13, 2015, Caron met with Smith following his arrest (the \u201cInitial Appearance\u201d). Caron testified that after she set money bail, Smith became furious. Caron testified that Smith \u201cexploded and started cursing, yelling profanities. He said, \u2018Fuck you bitch.\u2019 \u201d Caron testified that Smith also shouted, \u201cI\u2019m going to find you,\u201d and \u201cYou better find another job.\u201d Caron further testified that Smith put his finger up, made eye <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>contact with her, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find you\u201d while thrusting his finger into the glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The guards then came to take him away. Deputy John Hinman of the Washington County Detention Center testified that, as Smith started to leave the room, \u201che turned back around and spit towards the Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In a pretrial motion <em>in limine, </em>defense counsel moved to exclude any mention of why Smith had been arrested, citing Maryland Rule \u00a7 5\u2014404(b), which generally prohibits admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, outside of the crime charged. The prosecutor and defense counsel agreed that there would be no mention of the arrest warrant or Smith\u2019s criminal history. Rather, they agreed to stipulate to the jury that Smith had been at the Initial Appearance to be given information about his rights, and that the case for which he was coming in was subsequently dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Defense counsel also moved to exclude any testimony that Smith spat in the direction of Caron at the conclusion of the meeting. The spitting occurred out of Caron\u2019s view. The circuit court denied the motion, finding that the testimony about the spitting was admissible to provide context to Smith\u2019s words. Defense counsel objected when Deputy Hinman testified that Smith spat in the direction of Caron.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Before the circuit court instructed the jury, defense counsel renewed a motion for judgment of acquittal. Defense counsel noted that the charging document in this case narrowed the charge by alleging that Smith threatened to create bodily injury to a State official, while omitting mention of other modes of threatening. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Additional facts will be provided as they become relevant to our discussion, below.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">I. Intent to Threaten</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">Smith avers that the circuit court committed plain error, which requires reversal, by failing to require the jury to find that Smith intended to threaten Caron.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Smith relies on <em>Elonis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 2012, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015), where the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C \u00a7 875(c), the federal threats statute, did not apply to negligent conduct. According to the Supreme Court, the pattern jury instruction requiring the government to prove only that a reasonable person would regard the communication as a threat was erroneous and, thus, it reversed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>Smith asserts that the jury instruction in <em>Elonis </em>is \u201csubstantially similar to the instruction propounded in the instance case\u201d and, therefore, employs a negligence standard of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The State responds by distinguishing the law under which Smith was convicted, Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-708(b) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), which includes an intent element, from the federal threats statute, which did not include an intent element. The State also avers that the jury instructions adequately addressed the intent requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Smith recognizes that this issue was unpreserved for appeal because defense counsel did not object at the time of the jury instruction. However, Smith asks that we exercise our discretion to recognize plain error under Maryland Rules 4-325(e) and 8-131. \u201cPlain error is \u2018error which vitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 236, 623 A.2d 630 (1993) (quoting <em>State v. Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 211, 582 A.2d 521 (1990)). It is error that is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The factors to be considered by an appellate court in deciding whether to review jury instructions for plain error include the opportunity to use the unpreserved issue to illuminate an area of the law, the egregiousness of the error, the likely impact of the alleged error on the defendant, and the degree of lawyerly diligence or dereliction. <em>See, Austin v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 254, 268-72, 600 A.2d 1142 (1992). In <em>Austin, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>On rarer occasions, we might even be influenced by the opportunity that the notice of \u201cplain error\u201d might afford to illuminate a murky recess of the law. The interpreting and molding of the law is as weighty a consideration in appellate councils as is the correction of error in individual cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGr\"><em>Id. </em>at 271, 600 A.2d 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Smith asks that we exercise our discretion to review for plain error here. He argues that each of the factors weigh strongly in his favor, most notably that this is an issue of first impression since this is the first time the question has been raised since <em>Elonis. </em>He also asserts that it would afford this Court an opportunity to address the question of if a jury must be instructed to determine whether the defendant intended to threaten as an element of the crime. For these reasons, we accept Smith\u2019s invitation to review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We conclude that intent to threaten is indeed an element of the crime which must be included in jury instructions, but hold that the jury was adequately instructed on this element in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In <em>Elonis, </em>the petitioner was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8-<em>75(e)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and the jury instructions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">135 S.Ct. at 2007 (internal citations omitted). The Court held that requiring the prosecution to prove only that a \u201creasonable person\u201d would regard the communication as a threat meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>that the conduct was determined by a negligence standard. <em>Id. </em>at 2011. The \u201creasonable person\u201d standard \u201cis inconsistent with the conventional requirement for criminal conduct\u2014 <em>awareness </em>of some wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Court held that the prosecution must prove the defendant\u2019s subjective intent to threaten. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In the present case, Smith was charged under CL \u00a7 3-708(b) which imposes an intent requirement that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8-75(c) lacks. CL \u00a7 3-708(b) provides that, \u201cA person may not knowingly and willfully make a threat to take the life of, kidnap, or cause physical injury to a State official, a local official, a Deputy State\u2019s Attorney, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, or an Assistant Public Defender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Smith correctly states in his brief that the jury instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">A statement is a threat if it was made under such circumstances that a reasonable person hearing or reading the statement would understand it as a serious expression of an intent to physically injure a State Official. In deciding whether the Defendant made a threat you may consider among other circumstances the language the Defendant used and whether a reasonable person hearing or reading the words and knowing all of the circumstances would have considered the words to be a threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Smith asks that we read this instruction, derived from the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 4:12.2, as substantially similar to the instruction in <em>Elonis </em>and, therefore, requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Smith fails to recognize that this is merely an excerpt of the jury instruction. On appeal, \u201cinstructions are reviewed in their entirety to determine if reversal is required.\u201d <em>Fleming v. State, </em>373 Md. 426, 433, 818 A.2d 1117 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Additional relevant jury instructions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">Intent is a state of mind and ordinarily cannot be proven directly because there is no way of looking into a person\u2019s mind. Therefore, a Defendant\u2019s intent may be shown by surrounding circumstances. In determining the Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>intent you may consider the Defendant\u2019s acts and statements as well as the surrounding circumstances. Further you may but are not required to infer that a person ordinarily intends the nature and probable consequences of his acts or omissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAX9\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">... knowingly, knowing is generally defined as having knowledge. Mr. Smith acted knowingly if he realized what he was doing, was aware of the nature of his conduct and did not act through mistake, accident, carelessness or other innocent reason. The State has the burden of proving knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. Knowledge can be established from all the surrounding facts and circumstances. You may find Mr. Smith had knowledge if he acted with an unlawful purpose and deliberately ignored the obvious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA_T\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">... willfully means an act that is done knowingly and with deliberate intention. An act that is done merely because of mistake, accident, carelessness or other innocent reason is not done willfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">The Defendant is charged with threatening a State Official. In order to convict the Defendant the State must prove, one, that the Defendant communicated a threat to another. Two, that the threat was to physically injure a State Official and, three, that the Defendant made the threat knowingly and willfully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAdD\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">A threat is knowingly or consciously made if the person writing or speaking comprehends the meaning of the words used.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Putting aside the differences in the statutes, namely that CL \u00a7 3-708(b) includes an intent requirement where 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8-75(c) did not, and assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>are substantially similar<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that <em>Elonis </em>is therefore controlling, Smith\u2019s argument that reversal is required still fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In <em>Elonis, </em>the defense counsel requested a jury instruction that \u201cthe government must prove that he intended to communicate a true threat.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2007 (citation omitted). The circuit court denied that request. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he jury was instructed that the Government need to prove <em>only </em>that a reasonable person would regard Elonis\u2019s communications as threats, and that was error.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendant\u2019s mental state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2012 (emphasis added). The Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEq\">[t]he presumption in favor of a scienter requirement should apply to <em>each </em>of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.... communicating <em>something </em>is not what makes the conduct \u201cwrongful.\u201d Here the crucial element separating legal innocence from wrongful conduct is the threatening nature of the communication. The mental state requirement must therefore apply to the fact that the communication contains a threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 2011 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Here, unlike in <em>Elonis, </em>the jury <em>was </em>instructed that the State must prove that Smith made a threat \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d and further that willfully means \u201cwith deliberate intention\u201d and where the speaker comprehends the words. The reasonable person standard was not used to eliminate the <em>mens rea </em>requirement that is fundamental to find criminal wrongdoing. To rule otherwise would require this Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ignore the requirement to review instructions in their entirety. Therefore, the jury instruction given in this case adequately meets the <em>Elonis </em>holding that negligence is not sufficient to support a conviction under the relevant threats statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Next, Smith avers that there was insufficient evidence to convict him for threatening a State official.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In reviewing the merits of a claim relating to the sufficiency of evidence, the standard of review is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (citation omitted). In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial, the limited question before us is not \u201cwhether the evidence <em>should have </em>or <em>probably would have </em>persuaded the majority of fact finders but only whether it <em>possibly could have </em>persuaded <em>any </em>rational fact finder.\u201d <em>Allen v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 194, 249, 857 A.2d 101 (2004) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>387 Md. 389, 875 A.2d 724 (2005). The Court views not just the facts, but \u201call rational inferences that arise from the evidence,\u201d in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Abbott, </em>190 Md.App. at 616, 989 A.2d 795. Appellate review should not involve undertaking \u201ca review of the record that would amount to a retrial of the case.\u201d <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 325, 765 A.2d 97 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">\u201c[T]he general rule is that matters essential to the charge must be proved as alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Green v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 680, 685, 329 A.2d 731 (1974) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he evidence in a criminal trial must not vary from those allegations in the indictment which are essential and material to the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Smith avers that \u201cthe State\u2019s evidence presented at trial deviated from the essential elements the State charged in its indictment.\u201d The statute prohibits threats to \u201ctake the life of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>kidnap, or cause physical injury!.]\u201d CL \u00a7 3-708(b). Smith asserts that the State specified the distinct type of injury threatened, bodily harm, which therefore limited the scope or type of threat that the jury could convict him for, but that the State then failed to present any evidence that Smith threatened bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Smith avers that here, the variance between the elements alleged and the evidence presented was fatal to the conviction and requires reversal. To support this position, Smith looks to <em>McDuffy v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 537, 538, 252 A.2d 270 (1969), where an indictment charged the defendant with forgery of an \u201cAmerican Oil Credit Card\u201d but the evidence proved the forgery of a receipt for purchased merchandise. We reversed the forgery conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence, stating \u201can individual cannot be convicted of forging one instrument when the proof shows that he forged an entirely different instrument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 252 A.2d 270. \u201cWhen there is a material variance between the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata, </em>the judgment must be reversed.\u201d <em>Green, </em>23 Md.App. at 685, 329 A.2d 731 (citation omitted). Smith asserts that the same is true here\u2014that he \u201ccannot be convicted for threatening to cause bodily injury to a State official when the State\u2019s evidence at trial does not show that there was a threat to cause bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Smith misinterprets <em>McDuffy, </em>stating that the <em>allegata </em>was \u201cbodily harm\u201d but the <em>probata </em>were nonspecific words. <em>McDuffy </em>would apply if the State had charged Smith with threatening bodily injury (the <em>allegata), </em>but at trial, it attained a conviction by proving that he threatened kidnapping (the probata). That is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Rather, what Smith is asserting is that the State failed to present adequate evidence that the words Smith communicated to Caron threatened bodily injury. Smith asserts that even if the statement, \u201cI\u2019m going to find you,\u201d was indeed a threat to do \u201csome harm,\u201d that \u201csome harm\u201d is not sufficient to constitute bodily harm beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith states that \u201cegging the complainant\u2019s house, slashing her tires, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>or lobbying in front of her office building to get her fired\u201d are all types of \u201csome harm\u201d that are not criminalized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">While Smith correctly identifies examples of harm that a jury could infer from the statement, he fails to recognize that his burden is to persuade that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt when considering the statements and circumstances. <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The State responds that the words and actions used by Smith suggested that he was going to harm Caron and the movements toward her, when viewed in context, sufficed for a jury to find a threat of bodily injury. <em>See State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 246, 424 A.2d 720 (1981) (\u201cThat threats of force need not be made in any particular manner in order to put a person in fear of bodily harm is well established. Indeed, conduct, rather than words, may convey the threat.\u201d) (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Here, the State presented evidence that numerous components of Smith\u2019s behavior coalesced to show that Smith threatened Caron with bodily harm, including that Smith threatened to \u201cfind\u201d her, he shouted obscenities at her, he made \u201cviolent motions\u201d with his body, and that he leaned as close to the glass barrier as he could and pointed at her menacingly. The State further avers that Smith\u2019s action of spitting at Caron is particularly suggestive and notes that in a number of jurisdictions, spitting is sufficient to support a conviction for battery or assault because it shows intent to harm the target. <em>See, e.g., Ray v. U.S., </em>575 A.2d 1196, 1199 (D.C. 1990); <em>Hobbs v. State, </em>127 Nev. 234, 251 P.3d 177, 180 (2011); <em>Gilbert v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 67, 608 S.E.2d 509, 511 (2005). The State concludes that these are all words and actions that Smith used to suggest that he was going to harm Caron.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Viewing all rational inferences that arise from the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, we affirm that a reasonable jury could have found that Smith threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Caron with bodily harm. <em>Abbott, </em>190 Md.App. at 616, 989 A.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">III. Evidence that Smith Spat at Caron</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Finally, Smith avers that the circuit court erred in admitting testimony that he spat in the direction of Caron.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Defense counsel moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence that Smith spat at Caron, asserting that it occurred outside of the Initial Appearance. Defense counsel contended that it should be excluded as irrelevant because it happened out of her sight and as unduly prejudicial because the jury could draw harmful inferences regarding Smith\u2019s character and criminal propensity. The following exchange occurred regarding the admission of the spitting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">THE COURT: Well, and to me that\u2019s an uncharged act. I guess they\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Right. He\u2019s not charged with a Second Degree Assault here so I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">THE COURT: Having said that I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s inadmissible. I mean, it\u2019s part of the, his, part of his conduct as to his person and how is it not admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqj-dedup-0\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, I think it simply paints a picture that is not necessary to the charge of actually making a threat to a State official in this case. It\u2019s outside of her presence. He\u2019s not charged with an assault. If he\u2019d been charged with an assault in this case we\u2019d be having a different discussion but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s simply charged with an oral threat with a State official. There\u2019s nothing in the language of Section 3709 that says a gesture or a motion can constitute a threat. It has to be an oral or written statement that\u2019s a threat. Spitting is not an oral or written statement so I think it is outside of what is relevant to the charge of threatening a State official.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">THE STATE: Your Honor, often times when you have a statement that is not completely explicit like you do in this case you have to take the context. The context is important. If he were laughing and joking and said this we may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>even be here. But the fact that he spit at the end of it after having several outbursts is part of the context of whether he meant it as a threat and whether the trier of fact can determine that it was a threat or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">THE COURT: I do think that it\u2019s necessary information. For example, if instead of that if he, you know, were making a punching motion while it may not have been charged as an intent to frighten assault it certainly would be part of his demeanor and character during the time that these statements were made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And if it had happened during the Initial Appearance again I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019d be having a difference discussion over but this happened outside the Initial Appearance. She doesn\u2019t even see it happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abg-dedup-1\">THE COURT: Right. But the statute\u2014The purpose of the statute is not to limit what the person sees or is exposed to. The purpose of the statute is to get to any, any threat made. I do think it\u2019s a part of the relevant context. I think it\u2019s probative as to what was meant by the statements that were made. And it\u2019s not unfairly prejudicial. It\u2019s not going to mislead the jury. It\u2019s not going to confuse the jury. It\u2019s simply part of the context of what was said or done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Defense counsel objected during the trial when a State\u2019s witness testified about the spitting, properly preserving this question for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Maryland Rule 5-403 provides that \u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Whether evidence is relevant under Maryland Rule 5-403 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>439 Md. 698, 708-09, 98 A.3d 236 (2014). \u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d has been said to occur \u201c \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nash v. State, </em>439 Md. 53, 67, 94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>A.3d 23 (2014) (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)). A ruling reviewed for an abuse of discretion will not be reversed \u201csimply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.\u201d <em>Norwood v. State, </em>222 Md.App. 620, 643, 114 A.3d 267 (2015) (citation omitted). Rather, a trial court\u2019s \u201cdecision is an abuse of discretion when it is well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Maryland Rule 5-404(b) prohibits admission of a defendant\u2019s \u201cbad acts\u201d at trial, subject to certain exceptions, reading in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts including delinquent acts as defined by [Md.] Code [1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.], Courts [&amp; Judicial Proceedings] Article, \u00a7 3-8A-01 is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. Such evidence, however, may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Maryland Rule 5-404(b) prohibits other bad acts evidence to protect against the risk that a jury will assume that because a defendant committed other crimes, he is more likely to have committed the crime for which he is on trial. <em>Smith v. State, </em>218 Md.App. 689, 709-10, 98 A.3d 444 (2014). The prohibition \u201creflects a fear that jurors will conclude from evidence of other bad acts that the defendant is a \u2018bad person\u2019 and should therefore be convicted, or deserves punishment for other bad conduct and so may be convicted even though the evidence is lacking.\u201d <em>Behrel v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 64, 124, 823 A.2d 696 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The Court of Appeals has established a three-part test for admission of other bad acts. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>230 Md.App. 450, 458, 148 A.3d 95 (2016). The first step is to determine whether the evidence fits into one or more of the special relevancy exceptions, which include motive, intent, absence of mistake, a common scheme or plan, identity, opportunity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>preparation, or knowledge. <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 634, 552 A.2d 896 (1989). The second step is to determine whether the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the court must carefully weigh the necessity for and the probative value of the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence against any undue prejudice likely to result from admission. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 552 A.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Smith asserts that the circuit court engaged in only a \u201ccursory analysis\u201d of the evidence and failed to conduct the second prong of the three-part test. However, Smith fails to recognize that if an act is part of the alleged offense, the act does not constitute an \u201cother\u201d act to which the rule applies. <em>See Dixon v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 325, 330, 755 A.2d 560 (2000), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>364 Md. 209, 772 A.2d 283 (2001). In <em>Odum v. State, </em>412 Md. 593, 989 A.2d 232 (2010), the Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s admittance of evidence of the defendant\u2019s \u201cother\u201d conduct in a kidnapping prosecution. The Court held that the trial court properly allowed the jury to consider evidence of the robberies, carjacking, and murders that surrounded the kidnapping for which the defendant on trial, because these acts took place \u201cduring the criminal episode.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 989 A.2d 232. Thus, the prohibition against \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence does not apply to evidence of wrongs \u201cthat arise during the same transaction and are intrinsic to the charged crime[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 989 A.2d 232. The <em>Odum </em>Court defined \u201cintrinsic\u201d in this context to mean, at a minimum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">other crimes that are so connected or blended in point of time or circumstances with the crime or crimes charged that they form a single transaction, and the crime or crimes charged cannot be fully shown or explained without evidence of the other crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Therefore, before turning to the merits of Smith\u2019s assertion that the circuit court did not property apply the three-prong test, we must first determine whether the spitting occurred during \u201cthe criminal episode,\u201d and we hold that it did. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Smith\u2019s spitting at Caron was sufficiently connected with the orally communicated threats to form a \u201csingle transaction\u201d as identified by the <em>Odum </em>Court. The entire interview lasted only approximately half an hour. No events intervened between the communications to Caron and the spitting. The oral communications and the spitting all occurred in the same geographic location. For these reasons, we agree that the spitting was sufficiently connected to the single episode so as to be offered for context to the act, not as an \u201cother\u201d act under Md. Rule 5-404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Moreover, the purpose of the rule would not be served by excluding this testimony. The purpose of the rule is to keep a jury from assuming the commission of one crime based on the commission of another crime or act. Here, Smith\u2019s conduct is undisputed. Rather, it was the significance of the conduct that mattered. Therefore, the spitting did not unfairly suggest that Smith committed the act, but rather, appropriately provided context for the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony, and we need not turn to the merits of the argument regarding the application of the <em>Faulkner </em>three-prong test.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED.
