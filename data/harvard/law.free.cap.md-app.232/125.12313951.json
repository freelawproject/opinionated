The State\u2019s witnesses included Edna Lobell, the victim, who was 98 years old at the time of the crimes. The following evidence was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Ms. Lobell moved into her row house in Rogers Forge in 1963. She still lives there. On April 26, 2014, she was at home when, in the early afternoon, Howard knocked on her back door. Ms. Lobell did not know Howard and had never met him.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Ms. Lobell answered the door, and Howard told her that her next-door neighbor, Linda Lang, had hired him to make some repairs to her roof. He offered to make repairs to her roof as well. In fact, Ms. Lang had not hired Howard to fix her roof or to do anything and had never met him. Ms. Lobell allowed Howard to come in and eventually agreed for him to prepare an estimate for the repair work. Howard insisted on being paid in advance for the estimate and for some materials. Ms. Lobell said she only had $30 in cash. He told her that was not enough. She gave him the $30 and wrote him a check for $40 on her State Employees Credit Union (\u201cSECU\u201d) checking account. He gave her his name to use to make the check out to him. He then left, saying he was going to get some materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">At around 6:00 p.m. the same day, Howard again knocked on Ms. Lobell\u2019s back door. She answered, and he said something to the effect of \u201cRemember me? ... Didn\u2019t expect me to come back so soon, did you?\u201d Ms. Lobell let him in, and he proceeded to sit in a chair in her dining room. He had no materials with him that she could see. He remained in her house for at least an hour and a half. He asked her for more money. She said she didn\u2019t have any. At some point, he went upstairs to her bedroom. She kept some money hidden in envelopes behind pictures hanging on her bedroom walls. He found one such envelope, took the money from it, and left the envelope on the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">When Howard returned to the dining room, Ms. Lobell asked him to leave because it was time for her to eat dinner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>He became upset and violent, grabbing her by the arms, \u201cpropel[ing]\u201d her from the dining room into the living room, throwing her to the floor, and choking her. Having previously broken her right hip, Ms. Lobell knew when she hit the floor that her left hip had broken. Howard announced that he was going to return the next day and take her to the bank to withdraw $20,000 for him. He pushed his finger down her throat, cutting her lip and causing her dentures to come out. He got on top of her and attempted to have sex with her, but his penis was \u201climp.\u201d Ms. Lobell bit him hard on the finger, drawing blood. He got up, turned up the volume on the television, and went into the kitchen, where he pulled the telephone base out of the wall and threw a white box that was the electronic connecting device for a medical alert system down the stairs into the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As she lay on the living room floor, Ms. Lobell managed to press her medical alert button, which she wore on a device that looked like an ordinary watch. Howard returned to the living room with a bottle of liquor. As he was starting to get on top of Ms. Lobell again, Lieutenant Byron Welker, accompanied by other members of the Baltimore County Fire Department (\u201cBCFD\u201d), arrived at the front door and knocked. Howard jumped up and ran out the back door. When there was no response to the knock, Lieutenant Welker gained entry and found Ms. Lobell on the living room floor with her pants pulled down around her ankles. She told him a man had tried to rape her and that he had run out the back door. Lieutenant Welker saw a liquor bottle on the floor near Ms. Lobell. The base of a phone, which appeared to have been pulled from the wall, was on the floor. The back door to the house was ajar. Lieutenant Welker contacted the police and called for an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Officer Richard Tabaka of the Baltimore County Police Department (\u201cBCPD\u201d) quickly responded to the scene. Ms. Lobell was still on the living room floor, awaiting medical transport. She gave him a basic description of her assailant. Officer Tabaka secured the scene, taking note of several items on the floor near Ms. Lobell: \u201ca bottle of what appeared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>an alcoholic beverage, a tan shirt, a bag of what appeared to be jewelry,\u201d \u201cseveral spots of what appeared to be blood,\u201d and a phone base that had been removed from the kitchen wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">BCPD forensic examiner Sarah Kersse \u201cphotographed] the residence as is without disturbing anything.\u201d She took 113 pictures, almost all of the interior of the house, photographing \u201ceach room of interest.\u201d These included the kitchen, dining room, living room, and Ms. Lobell\u2019s bedroom. The photographs of the bedroom showed that containers on Ms. Lobell\u2019s dresser in which she kept jewelry were open, even though she always left them closed. They also showed an empty envelope on the dresser. There was no blood on the items in the bedroom, suggesting that Howard had touched them before Ms. Lobell bit him. By contrast, the photographs of the living room and kitchen showed blood on several objects. Ms. Kersse processed the scene \u201cfor prints on different surfaces that appeared] to be involved in the incident[,]\u201d submitted the fingerprints to the BCPD Latent Print Unit for examination, and collected physical evidence, including \u201cswabs of different areas of possible blood that were present on the living room floor.\u201d She recovered the t-shirt found on the floor near Ms. Lobell and submitted it for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Ms. Lobell was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured left hip. Forensic nurse examiner Lisa Krueger performed a modified Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (\u201cSAFE Exam\u201d). (A complete exam could not be performed due to Ms. Lobell\u2019s hip fracture.) Nurse Krueger \u201ccollected swabs from the bridge of [Ms. Lobell\u2019s] nose and from her upper and bottom lip\u201d and \u201cphotographed pictures of a sore that she had in her mouth[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Detective Ryan Anderson of the BCPD Special Victims Team served as the lead investigator on the case. While the crime scene was being processed, he noticed a \u201ccontrol module for [Ms. Lobefl\u2019s] alert medical bracelet\u201d on the basement floor. It was emitting a beeping sound. Later, Detective Anderson determined that the module functioned as the conduit from Ms. Lobell\u2019s medical alert bracelet to the BCFD.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>On the day of the attack, Barbara Gillin and her husband were staying at their daughter\u2019s house in Rogers Forge, near Ms. Lobell\u2019s house. As they were walking their dogs in the afternoon, they were approached by a man who appeared \u201cagitated and aggressive.\u201d He was holding a check for $40 and wanted to know where the closest SECU branch was located. The next day, Detective Anderson interviewed Ms. Lobell\u2019s neighbors, including Ms. Gillin, and she told him about the man with the check. Detective Anderson found Ms. Lobell\u2019s SECU checkbook in her house and saw that it contained a carbon copy of the check written to Howard. The memo line read \u201cchimney repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Timothy Fitzgerald had lived in the Rogers Forge vicinity for decades and knew Ms. Lobell. Sometime in the \u201clate afternoon\u201d on the day in question, he was socializing with his neighbors in a common area behind the row houses that included Ms. Lobell\u2019s residence when he saw a man walk down an alley and approach a gate to Ms. Lang\u2019s backyard. The man could not open the gate. He then turned and walked to Ms. Lobell\u2019s back door. Mr. Fitzgerald saw the man approach Ms. Lobell\u2019s back door and \u201csa[y] something into the house.\u201d From a photo array, Mr. Fitzgerald identified Howard as the man he had seen approach Ms. Lobell\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Howard was arrested on April 30, 2014. Detective Anderson collected buccal swabs from him and submitted them to the BCPD crime lab for testing. Rebecca Schlisserman, a forensic biologist with the crime lab, processed the items recovered by Ms. Kersse. She forwarded select samples of those items, the DNA sample taken from the bridge of Ms. Lobell\u2019s nose during the SAFE Exam, and the buccal swabs taken from Howard to a private DNA testing laboratory. Testing revealed that samples taken from the t-shirt recovered from Ms. Lo-bell\u2019s living room floor and blood stains from her living room carpet matched Howard\u2019s DNA. The State presented evidence showing that Howard\u2019s fingerprint was on the empty envelope on the dresser in Ms. Lobell\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"AzA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The defense rested without putting on any evidence. Defense counsel did not dispute that Howard was present in Ms. Lobell\u2019s house on the day in question, but took the position that the State\u2019s evidence did not prove the elements of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"AvW\">We shall include additional facts as pertinent to the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AOq\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AKn\">H-1</p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">After spending several days in the hospital and a month in a rehabilitation facility, Ms. Lobell moved back to her house in Rogers Forge (\u201cthe House\u201d). She was living there, on her own, in April 2015, when the case against Howard went to trial. By then she was 99 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"A8r\">Before trial, on November 11, 2014, Howard\u2019s lawyers asked the prosecutor assigned to the case to allow them to inspect the interior of the House. The prosecutor responded that Ms. Lobell and her son, whose name was on the title to the House, would not agree to such an inspection. On January 9, 2015, defense counsel filed a \u201cMotion To Visit The Crime Scene[,]\u201d arguing that \u201c[t]he scene of the alleged crime is ... a part of discovery\u201d under Rule 4-263. They sought an order directing \u201cthe Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and the homeowner of [the House]\u201d to provide a date and time for defense counsel to visit the house for inspection. They asserted that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cSAO\u201d) was obligated under Rule 4-263 to make the House available for inspection and that it would violate Howard\u2019s right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment not to be allowed, through counsel, to inspect the place where the crimes were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJkV\">At a hearing on the motion, Howard\u2019s lawyers repeated these arguments, asserting that there might be \u201cexculpatory things ... that the State did not provide us within their photos\u201d and because the State\u2019s photographs \u201care just one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>point of view\u201d and were taken \u201cfor the benefit of the State\u2019s ease[.]\u201d Also, the photographs did not give \u201cdimension or geography or measurements or anything like that that can help in the Defense\u2019s case.\u201d Defense counsel asserted that evidence they might find by inspecting the House might be used to \u201cchallenge [Ms. Lobell\u2019s] credibility[.]\u201d They acknowledged that \u201cthere are privacy issues, that [Ms. Lobell] has a right to the privacy of her home[,]\u201d but maintained that the inspection they had proposed \u201cwould be so limited in time and so little that [the need to inspect] outweighs [Ms. Lobell\u2019s] privacy for the probative value that [defense counsel] can get out of it.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without elaborating, defense counsel argued that the Maryland Rules, the Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel and to confront witnesses, and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process all entitled Howard to inspect the interior of the House, as the crime scene location, even though it was not in the possession or control of the SAO.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The State responded that the court lacked authority to order the requested inspection. It argued that the discovery obligations established in Rule 4-268 do not encompass an inspection of a crime scene location that is in the possession or control of a third party, and defense counsel provided nothing to support their contention that the court had the authority to require the State to provide the defense with such an inspection. The State maintained that the photographs produced in discovery adequately depicted the crime scene and urged the court to reject, as \u201cincredibly speculative[,]\u201d the argument that there might be exculpatory evidence at the House.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In rebuttal, defense counsel acknowledged that he \u201ccould find no authority that said that we have the right to enter [Ms. Lobell\u2019s] home[,]\u201d but suggested, somewhat inconsistently, that regardless of what the rules provide the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>discretion to order the inspection because the house was \u201ca part of the discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The court framed the issue before it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">The issue is whether I have the authority to order this relief, and I\u2014if you look at our civil discovery rules as a kind of a comparison, I know they don\u2019t apply, but 2-422 does permit the entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of a party upon whom the request is served, and there\u2019s an annotation that I just looked at that says non-parties may not be compelled to submit to an inspection of their property. The case cited is <em>Webb </em>[v.] <em>Joyce Real Estate, Inc., </em>108 Md.App. 512, 672 A.2d 660 [ (1996) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">Forget about people\u2019s motivations. The issue is whether I can take all or any part of the Maryland authorities on discovery in criminal cases and interpret any of that to mean that I can compel some\u2014a property owner in this case\u2014it\u2019s slightly even more interesting cause it\u2019s apparently not the victim\u2019s, it\u2019s her\u2014her son that owns the property\u2014to\u2014to give access to their property for the purpose of an inspection in advance of trial. So\u2014so I think the issue really is narrowly\u2014it\u2019s not motivations, it\u2019s just authority. Do I have\u2014do I have the power to do it. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The court took the matter under advisement, giving the parties an opportunity to supplement their arguments with authority from other jurisdictions. Neither party did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">In an order entered on January 27, 2015, the court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">Maryland law does not authorize the Court to order a non-party in a criminal action to permit entry upon designated land for the purpose of inspection of that land. While the Maryland Rules are clear that a court may order a property owner to submit to a property inspection in a civil action, no such authority exits in Maryland\u2019s criminal jurisprudence, and in this case, the alleged victim and her family object to granting access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Howard contends the circuit court erred in ruling that it lacked authority to grant the motion to inspect the House, and this error caused the court to further err by failing to exercise any discretion to decide whether an inspection should be permitted. He no longer argues that Rule 4-263 authorizes a circuit court to order either the SAO or a third party in possession or control of real property to make the property available for inspection by the defendant before trial. Indeed, he makes no mention of that rule in his brief. Rather, he takes the position that because \u201cnothing in Maryland law <em>precludes </em>a trial court from issuing an order permitting defense counsel to enter private property over objection of the property owner\u201d (emphasis in original), the court has the inherent authority to do so, without any authority by rule or statute. Beyond that, he argues that the right to \u201c \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986)), as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, entitles him to inspect the crime scene before trial. He asserts that the circuit court should have exercised its discretion to decide \u201cwhether [his] constitutional rights trumped the property rights of Ms. Lobell\u2019s family.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The State maintains that Rule 4-263 has no application because the SAO\u2019s discovery obligations only pertain to property in its possession or control, and the House is private property in the sole possession and control of Ms. Lobell and her son.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It further argues that the constitutional rights to confrontation and due process do not apply to pre-trial discovery, except in limited situations not present here. It argues that because there is no statute, rule, or constitutional provision that gives a Maryland circuit court the power, in a criminal case, to order a third party in possession or control of real property that was the scene of the crime to make that property available for inspection by the defense before trial, the circuit court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. In the alternative, the State argues that even if the circuit court had the power to grant Howard\u2019s motion with respect to Ms. Lobell and her son, it correctly denied the motion because Howard failed to \u201cmake a sufficient showing of need.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Rule 4-263 \u201cgoverns discovery and inspection in a circuit court\u201d criminal case. The State\u2019s required discovery disclosures are listed in subsection (d) of the rule. The SAO must disclose \u201cmaterial and information\u201d required by subsection (d) that is in the SAO\u2019s \u201cpossession or control,\u201d including in the possession or control of the \u201cattorney, members of the attorneys staff, or any other person who either reports regularly to the attorney\u2019s office or has reported to the attorney\u2019s office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in regard to the particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 (c)(1) and (c)(2), respectively. The required discovery disclosures include \u201c[e]vidence for use at trial.\u201d Md. Rule 4-263(d)(9). That subsection provides that the SAO must give the defense \u201c[t]he opportunity to inspect, copy, and photograph all documents, computer-generated evidence ... recordings, photographs, <em>or other tangible things </em>that the [SAO] intends to use at a hearing or at trial[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">It is undisputed that the SAO was not in possession or control of the House. For that reason alone, even if the House were a \u201ctangible thing\u201d within the meaning of subsection (d)(9), the State would not be obligated to produce it for inspection. Given the clarity of the rule respecting the scope of the parties\u2019 discovery obligations, it is not surprising that Howard no longer argues that Rule 4-263 authorized the circuit court to issue an order compelling the State to make the House available for inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Relatedly, Rule 4-263 pertains only to the parties to a circuit court criminal case. Ms. Lobell and her son are not parties. Rule 4-264, which was not invoked and is not mentioned by either party in their briefs, governs production and inspection by non-parties prior to trial. Under that rule, on motion of a party, the court may order that a subpoena be issued \u201ccommanding <em>a person </em>to produce for inspection and copying at a specified time and place <em>before trial </em>designated documents, recordings, photographs, <em>or other tangible things, </em>not privileged, which may constitute or contain evidence relevant to the action.\u201d Md. Rule 4-264 (emphasis added). If the House were a \u201ctangible thing,\u201d Ms. Lobell and her son could have been compelled to produce it for inspection by the defense, had the court exercised its discretion to do so. The House is not a \u201ctangible thing,\u201d however.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The phrase \u201cother tangible things\u201d appears in Rule 4-264 and, as noted, in Rule 4-263. It stands in contrast to the language of Rule 2-422, which permits party discovery of \u201cdocuments, electronically stored information, and property\u201d in civil cases. In that rule, in addition to allowing each party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>serve a request for production of \u201cdesignated tangible things[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at (a)(1), each party may serve a request <em>\u201cto permit entry upon designated land </em>... in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection [and other purposes that are specified].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (a)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, Rule 2-422(a) draws a distinction between \u201ctangible things\u201d and \u201cland.\u201d The language in Rule 4-263(d)(9) also stands in contrast to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, which in some circumstances requires the government to permit the defendant to inspect \u201cdocuments and objects,\u201d and specifies that \u201cdocuments and objects\u201d include \u201ctangible objects\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cbuildings or places[.]\u201d Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(E). This language also draws a distinction between tangible things and buildings. The phrase \u201cother tangible things\u201d in Rule 4-263(d)(9) and in Rule 4-264 cannot reasonably be read to include \u201cbuildings\u201d or \u201cland.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">As mentioned above, Howard takes the position that because there is no statute or rule that <em>precludes </em>the circuit court from issuing an order permitting an accused to inspect a building where the crime took place, the court has the inherent power to do so, regardless of who has possession or control of the building. In other words, the court has the inherent power to grant pre-trial discovery to a defendant in a criminal case so long as that power is not expressly negated by statute or rule. This argument is at odds with long-established Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In <em>Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 651 A.2d 866 (1995),.a defendant charged with child sexual abuse sought, under Rule 4-264, to obtain pre-trial discovery of the victim\u2019s psychotherapy records. The circuit court denied the motion on the ground that the records were privileged, and Rule 4-264 excludes privileged documents. The case reached the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Appeals, which explained at the outset of its analysis that, \u201c[a]t common law, a criminal defendant had no right to pretrial discovery.\u201d 337 Md. at 121, 651 A.2d 866 (citing <em>State v. Haas, </em>188 Md. 63, 69, 51 A.2d 647 (1947), <em>overruled on other grounds, In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 305, 539 A.2d 664 (1988)). \u201c \u2018American courts, relying on the English precedent, adopted a common law rule holding that the judiciary lacked any inherent authority to order pretrial discovery in criminal cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing and quoting Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Jerold H. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 20.1 at 836 (2d ed. 1992)). The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">Over time, we have expanded the common law and given the trial courts some authority to either require or permit discovery. Nevertheless, the right to pre-trial discovery is strictly limited to that which is permitted by statute or court rule or mandated by constitutional guarantees.

As no statute governed the request, the Court considered whether the defendant had any constitutional right to obtain, pre-trial, psychological records of the victim. After reviewing pertinent case law, it concluded that \u201c[njeither due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>process, compulsory process nor the right to confront adverse witnesses establishes a pre-trial right of a defendant to discovery review of a potential witness\u2019s privileged psychotherapy records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 651 A.2d 866. \u201cThus, we find no common law, court rule, statutory or constitutional requirement that a defendant be permitted pre-trial discovery of privileged records held by a third party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">For purposes of this portion of our discussion, the significance of <em>Goldsmith </em>is that it makes clear that in a criminal case, the circuit court does <em>not </em>have inherent authority to grant pre-trial discovery so long as it is not precluded. Contrary to the argument Howard advances, in a criminal case discovery only may be obtained when permitted by the common law, by statute, or by court rule, or when it is constitutionally necessary. <em>See also Cole v.

Franklin, </em>223 Md.App. 273, 115 A.3d 752 (2015), and <em>Stokes v. 835 N. Washington Street, LLC, </em>141 Md.App. 214, 784 A.2d 1142 (2001), we held that a circuit court may grant an equitable bill of discovery to compel the present owner of a building to make it accessible to the plaintiff in a lead paint case against the former owner of the building to perform non-destructive tests for the presence of lead paint. Recognizing that there is no civil discovery rule authorizing a court to compel a third party to open his real property for inspection, <em>see Webb v. Joyce Real Estate, Inc., </em>108 Md.App. 512, 672 A.2d 660 (1996), we explained that the circuit court has inherent authority to do so through an equitable bill of discovery \u201cwhen it is in the interest of justice[.]\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 223, 784 A.2d 1142. To obtain an equitable bill of discovery, a party must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the information the party is seeking to discover is material and necessary; that the party has no other adequate means to obtain that information; that the party\u2019s right of access to the premises outweighs the privacy right of the owners and the occupants of the property; and that issuance of an equitable bill of discovery will not impose an unreasonable hardship upon the owner or any occupant of the premises. <em>Johnson, </em>223 Md.App. at 288, 115 A.3d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">An equitable bill of discovery is \u201c \u2018a procedural tool in use for centuries\u2019 \u201d that \u201callows a litigant to obtain information that is in the exclusive possession of another person and is necessary to the establishment of the litigant\u2019s case.\u201d 223 Md.App. at 281, 115 A.3d 752 (quoting <em>Estate of Bochicchio v. Quinn, </em>136 Conn.App. 359, 46 A.3d 239 (2012). Long before discovery rules were adopted for civil cases, the equitable bill of discovery served as a remedy that, \u201c \u201cwhen used as an auxiliary process in aid of trials at law,\u2019 \u201d allowed a litigant to gather evidence necessary to prove his cause of action. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>(quoting <em>Pottetti v. Clifford, </em>146 Conn. 252, 258, 150 A.2d 207 (1959)). Thus, as we explained in <em>Stokes, </em>the equitable bill of discovery still exists for use in civil cases because in those cases the circuit court has inherent authority to order discovery, beyond what is permitted by the discovery rules. 141 Md.App. at 226, 784 A.2d 1142. This stands in direct contrast to discovery in criminal cases, where the common law did not provide for discovery at all, and there is no inherent authority on the part of the court to order discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In the case at bar, there is no statute or rule, and nothing in the common law, that authorized the circuit court to issue an order directing Ms. Lobell and her son to make the House available to Howard\u2019s lawyers for inspection before trial. That leaves Howard with the sole argument that such an order was necessary to protect his constitutional rights. The argument he makes is meager, to say the least. He identifies the constitutional right at stake as that to \u201c 'a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8 (quoting <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986) (in turn quoting <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984))). He quotes <em>Crane </em>as observing that such a right is guaranteed to a criminal defendant, \u201c[w]hether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment!).]\u201d 476 U.S. at 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142 (internal citations omitted). That is the sum and substance of his constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Courts in a number of other states have faced the question whether a trial court has authority to allow a defendant in a criminal case to inspect the location of the crime when it is a private residence that is not in the possession or control of the State. In one of the earlier cases to address the issue, <em>Henshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 338, 451 S.E.2d 415 (1994), the defendant, charged with voluntary manslaughter, moved to inspect the house in which the crime was perpetrated, which was in the possession and control of a third party. The motion was denied on the ground that the court lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>authority to grant it, as no statute or rule allowed for such discovery. The Virginia Court of Appeals held that the trial court has authority to grant such a motion to protect a defendant\u2019s right to due process under Virginia\u2019s constitution, so long as the defendant shows a substantial basis for the inspection and provided the owner or possessor of the property has not rebutted that showing with a showing that his constitutional right to privacy outweighs the accused\u2019s right to view or inspect. The court did not reverse the conviction, however, because it concluded that the trial court\u2019s error in denying the motion was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Matis, </em>446 Mass. 632, 915 N.E.2d 212 (2006), the defendant was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl in the early morning hours, in the living room of her parents\u2019 very small house, when six or seven other people were present. His defense was that the crime did not happen and that others in the house would have been aware if it had. Before trial, the defense moved to inspect the house in order to measure and photograph the rooms. The court granted the motion, and the Commonwealth noted an interlocutory appeal. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts broadly interpreted one of its discovery rules to allow a trial court to order an inspection of a private residence that was the location of the crime so as to protect the defendant\u2019s rights, under the Sixth Amendment and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, to obtain relevant evidence bearing on guilt or innocence or otherwise helpful to the defense. It was implicit in the court\u2019s decision that the defense had made a satisfactory threshold showing of need. The court vacated the trial court\u2019s order, however, because the owners of the house had not been given an opportunity to be heard. The case was remanded for a hearing in which they could participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">More recently, in a case factually similar to <em>Matis, </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a pretrial motion by a juvenile respondent to inspect the private residence where the alleged wrongful act had been committed. In <em>State in Interest of A.B., </em>219 N.J. 542, 99 A.3d 782 (2014), the 17 year old juvenile was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>charged with sexually abusing his six year old cousin, at the home of her parents (the juvenile\u2019s aunt and uncle). The abuse was alleged to have taken place on the Fourth of July, when there was a gathering of people at the house for a cookout. Counsel for the juvenile moved for a pre-trial inspection of the aunt and uncle\u2019s house, on the ground that it was essential to the juvenile\u2019s defense for counsel to have a \u201cspatial understanding of the layout of the rooms and an opportunity to take photographs[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 99 A.3d 782. The trial court granted the motion, and the State noted an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The case reached the Supreme Court of New Jersey, which did not have to wrestle with the question whether the trial court had the authority to grant the motion, but only with the standard to be applied by the court in exercising its discretion to do so. Unlike in Maryland, it is established law in New Jersey that a trial court has \u201cthe inherent power to order discovery when justice requires[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 99 A.3d 782. The court explained that when a defendant in a criminal case seeks discovery beyond that provided by the automatic discovery rule, he bears the burden of establishing need. Specifically, with respect to a motion \u201cto inspect the crime scene that is an alleged victim\u2019s home[,]\u201d the defendant must \u201carticulat[e] a reasonable basis to believe the inspection will lead to relevant evidence on a material issue[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 99 A.3d 782. If he does so, \u201cthen, subject to appropriate time, place, and manner restrictions intended to protect the privacy interests of the alleged victim and her family, the discovery should be granted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in assessing the need for the inspection and imposing restrictions that would protect the privacy interests of the victim\u2019s family. The inspection was necessary to advance the juvenile\u2019s defense that \u201cit was not possible for the acts alleged by [the victim] to have occurred undetected by any of the five adults\u201d present at the relevant time. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 99 A.3d 782. The State had provided photographs, but they did not show the proximity of the victim\u2019s bedroom, where the sexual act was alleged to have been perpetrated, to the kitchen and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>patio and pool area, where other people were gathered. The inspection was to be limited to 30 minutes, the victim was not required to be present or to know of it, only the victim\u2019s bedroom and the juvenile\u2019s sleeping area were to be inspected, the juvenile\u2019s parents were barred from participating, and a representative of the prosecutor\u2019s office was to be present. The court concluded that these restrictions protected the rights of the victim and her family and thus struck a fair balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">By contrast, even more recently, the Supreme Court of Colorado held that the trial courts in that state do not have any authority to grant discovery in criminal cases beyond that which is expressly permitted by statute or rule and that no constitutional right entitles a defendant in such a case to inspect a crime location that is a private residence not in the possession or control of the State. In <em>People in the Interest of E.G., </em>368 P.3d 946 (Colo. 2016), a juvenile was charged with offenses arising out of the sexual abuse of his younger twin cousins. The abuse was alleged to have taken place in the basement of their mutual grandmother\u2019s house. Before trial, defense counsel filed a motion seeking an order directing the grandmother to make her house available for inspection and photographing. The court denied the motion on the ground that it had no authority to grant it. The juvenile was convicted of two counts of sexual assault on a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">On appeal, the juvenile challenged the lower court\u2019s denial of the motion for inspection. The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cconcepts of fundamental fairness and due process\u201d authorized the trial court to grant such a request, but affirmed the convictions because the juvenile had failed to demonstrate that \u201chis inspection of the crime scene would yield relevant material evidence necessary to present his defense[.]\u201d <em>People in Interest of E.G., </em>371 P.3d 693, 697 (Colo. App. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The Supreme Court of Colorado took the case and affirmed, but on the ground that the trial court correctly ruled that it had no authority to order the grandmother to open her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>residence for inspection by the defense. The court observed that \u201cColorado remains one of the few states that has never deviated from the traditional doctrine\u201d against trial courts having \u201cfreestanding authority to grant discovery in criminal cases beyond what is authorized by the Constitution, the rules, or by statute[.]\u201d <em>E.G., </em>368 P.3d at 949-50 (footnote omitted). It concluded that Colorado\u2019s general discovery rule, which requires the State to make available to the defense, without request, evidence favorable to the defense that is in the possession or control of the State, comports with the due process requirements established in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), but does not grant the trial court \u201cauthority to order access to a private home that is not subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>E.G., </em>368 P.3d at 950. Likewise, to the extent Colorado\u2019s compulsory process rule, which allows a defendant to obtain a subpoena commanding a witness to attend and give testimony and \u201c \u2018may also command the person ... to produce ... books, papers, documents, photographs, or other objectsf,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 951 (quoting Colorado Criminal Procedure 17(a)(c)), permits the defense to obtain such materials pretrial, it does not permit access to a private home, which is not an \u201cobject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The court went on to address and reject the constitutional arguments made by the juvenile. It reasoned that the Compulsory Process and Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment embody trial rights, not pretrial discovery rights, and that due process of law does not give a criminal defendant the \u201cconstitutional right to force a third party to open her private home for an investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 954. The court held that under no circumstance could a third party owner/possessor of residential property\u2019s Fourth Amendment \u201cright to be free from an unreasonable search of her home conducted by the defense\u201d be outweighed by the accused\u2019s right to present a defense upon the state action of a court order. <em>Id. </em>at 949. The court emphasized that the due process right of access to favorable evidence only pertains to evidence in the possession or control of the State. It concluded that the Due Process Clause does not grant a right to discovery in criminal matters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>see Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977) (under federal law, \u201c[t]here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case\u201d), including a right to use court-provided \u201c \u2018investigative tools.\u2019 \u201d <em>E.G., </em>368 P.3d at 952 (quoting <em>People v. </em>Baltazar, 241 P.3d 941, 943-44 (Colo. 2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">A concurring judge wrote that, in his view, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth amendments safeguards a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, which encompasses the right to pretrial access to evidence important to his defense. Relying upon the reasoning of the Virginia Court of Appeals in <em>Henshaw, </em>he concluded that if a defendant shows that the proposed inspection of private property that was the location of the crime will produce evidence that is relevant and material to his defense, so as to allow him to \u201cmeaningfully defend\u201d against the charges,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">then he or she would be entitled to access the crime scene, subject to such reasonable limitations and restrictions as the court deemed necessary, unless the private citizen\u2019s constitutional right to privacy outweighed the defendant\u2019s right to view or inspect the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Several courts have assumed without deciding that to protect a criminal defendant\u2019s due process right to access evidence relevant and material to his defense, a trial court has the authority to order a third party to open his home for inspection by a criminal defendant, when the home was the crime scene location, but have held that the defendant did not make a threshold showing of need that would justify the court\u2019s exercise of that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">In <em>Bullen v. Superior Court, </em>204 Cal.App.3d 22, 251 Cal. Rptr. 32 (1988), for example, the victim was murdered in the house in which he lived with his wife. Investigating police officers took sixty-one photographs of the crime scene. These, along with four detailed diagrams of the house and fifteen pages of reports about the police investigation of the crime scene, were provided to the defense. The defense moved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>court for an order compelling the victim\u2019s widow to open her house to defense counsel for further investigation. She opposed the motion on the ground that the order \u201cwould constitute \u2018a profound personal violation and an intimidating invasion of [her] privacy[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 251 Cal.Rptr. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The trial court issued a pretrial order directing the widow to open her house for inspection by defense counsel. The widow took an interlocutory appeal, seeking to have the order vacated. The appellate court noted that it did not have to address whether the trial court had jurisdiction to order an inspection of the widow\u2019s house, because even assuming it did, the defendant had not made an adequate showing of need for the inspection. To support the request for inspection, defense counsel had stated that it was \u201c \u2018necessary to view the scene of the crime, observe spatial distance, investigate possible defense theories and to generally prepare examination and cross-examination of key witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 251 CaLRptr. 32. Finding that this request was \u201cconclusional and thus inadequate to support judicially compelled access to [the widow\u2019s] home with the resulting deprivation of her right to privacy in and freedom from unwanted intrusion into her home[,]\u201d the appellate court directed the trial court to vacate its order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Likewise, in <em>People v. Poole, </em>123 Ill.App.3d 375, 78 Ill.Dec. 691, 462 N.E.2d 810 (1984), the court found it unnecessary to decide whether the trial court had authority to enter an order compelling the owner of a house where a burglary was committed to open it for inspection by the defense. The burglary was perpetrated in the early morning hours, in a one story house when the four family members were asleep in bed. The intruder entered the bedroom of a ten year old girl and rubbed her arm, waking her. When he attempted to place a towel around her head, she kicked him and ran from the room screaming. The other family members awoke but the burglar was able to escape without being seen. The girl described the intruder to the police and identified him in a photo array. Family members described the size and layout of the rooms in the house and that the girl\u2019s bedroom \u201cpicked up light from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the fluorescent lighting in the bathroom across the hall and from an outside streetlight and parking lot vapor light.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 78 Ill.Dec. 691, 462 N.E.2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Before trial, the defendant sought an order compelling access to the daughter\u2019s bedroom in order to take photographs at night. Defense counsel argued that \u201cthe express reason he wanted the photographs was so the jury could make the determination of whether there was sufficient lighting in order for a witness to make an identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 78 Ill.Dec. 691, 462 N.E.2d 810. The prosecutor responded that it would be nearly impossible to replicate the lighting conditions that existed at the time of the burglary, and therefore any photographs would be misleading. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that it lacked authority to order a third party to make his residence available for inspection. The defendant was convicted and appealed, challenging this ruling. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the defense did not make a showing that a photograph could be taken that would depict the nighttime lighting conditions at the time of the burglary, and any photograph that did not accurately depict those conditions would be misleading and therefore not admissible. Thus, even if the trial court had the authority to compel the family to make its house available for inspection, the defendant did not make a threshold showing of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Finally, in <em>State v. Muscari, </em>174 Vt. 101, 807 A.2d 407 (2002), the defendant was charged with crimes stemming from a violent attack on his ex-girlfriend, in her home. When the police were called, they took extensive photographs of the interior of the house. The defendant filed a pretrial motion to inspect and photograph the house, arguing that because the police were permitted to photograph it, he should be too. By the time the motion came on for a hearing, the ex-girlfriend had moved and the house was occupied by another third party. The trial court denied the motion. The defendant was convicted and appealed, arguing among other things that the trial court\u2019s ruling was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Without addressing whether the trial court had authority to order a third party to open her home for inspection by a defendant charged with crimes committed there, and simply assuming that it did, the court commented that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s need for access to a crime scene controlled by a private third party must be balanced against the property occupant\u2019s right to privacy[,]\u201d and that that balance ordinarily is struck by first \u201crequiring a defendant to make some showing that the requested intrusion is relevant and material to the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 807 A.2d 407. The court concluded that the defendant had not satisfied that burden, as he \u201coffered no reason or justification why the court should order the occupants to allow him to enter their home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, even on appeal, counsel for the defendant \u201cha[d] not indicated what information [the defense] hoped to gain from access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 807 A.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We return to the case at bar. As we have explained, Maryland has no rule or statute in criminal cases authorizing a circuit court to order a third party in possession or control of real property that was the location of a crime to open the property for inspection by the defendant before trial. The Sixth Amendment Compulsory Process and Confrontation clauses, mentioned in passing in Howard\u2019s brief, are trial rights, not pretrial discovery rights. <em>See Goldsmith, </em>337 Md. at 123-27, 651 A.2d 866 (that the Confrontation Clause, and the related right of Compulsory Process, do not establish a right to pre-trial discovery) (citing <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 67 n.6, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992)). Whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment entitles a criminal defendant to obtain, pre-trial, evidence relevant and material to his defense that is not in the possession or control of the SAO is a complex issue that, like the others, Howard mentions but does not argue with any substance. Fortunately, we need not decide it. We agree with those courts that have held that, assuming without deciding that the Due Process Clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right to obtain such evidence before trial, the right nevertheless is predicated on a showing of need. Thus, before a trial court may exercise discretion to compel a third party in possession or control of real property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to make it available for inspection pre-trial by the defense in a criminal case, the defendant must show that he needs to make such an inspection to obtain material relevant and material to his defense. And, once that showing of need is made, the court must balance that need against the privacy interests of the third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">In this case, it is clear that even if the trial court could compel Ms. Lobell and her son to make the House available for inspection by Howard\u2019s counsel, in order to protect Howard\u2019s due process rights, Howard did not make a basic threshold showing that he needed to inspect the House to obtain relevant and material evidence in his defense. Defense counsel\u2019s motion to inspect the House and their oral argument on the motion gave three reasons in support. First, the \u201cevidence\u201d from an inspection \u201ccould be ... exculpatory in nature, and useful for impeachment purposes[,] especially in light or [sic] the discovery of inconsistent statements by Ms. Lobell.\u201d This is conclusory. It says nothing about why an inspection of the House months after the crime was committed would be expected to produce exculpatory evidence and, most significantly, what that exculpatory evidence might be. Nor does it describe the supposedly inconsistent statements by Ms. Lo-bell, or explain how they relate to anything that would be learned from an inspection of the House at all, or that the existing crime scene photographs do not show anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Second, defense counsel asserted that the 113 crime scene photographs were \u201cnot enough\u201d because they do not \u201callow a viewer a proper sense of dimensions, or space, or distance, or geography.\u201d This also is conclusory. How are the crime scene photographs inadequate? What do they not show that is important for the defense to see? What might the defense expect to learn about the dimensions of the rooms and their spatial relationships to each other that the crime scene photographs do not show and that is significant and would tend to support Howard\u2019s defense? In <em>Matis </em>and <em>A.B., </em>the layout of the home in which the crime was alleged to have been committed was integral to the defense that the crime was not perpetrated at all, because it could not have been committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>without being heard or seen by others. By contrast, here, the layout of the House is not material to any defense Howard offered. Indeed, Howard\u2019s only defense was that the State did not adequately prove the elements of the crimes. He did not maintain that the layout of the House in some way showed that the crimes could not have been perpetrated by him, or at all, or as described by Ms. Lobell or that the crimes would have been witnessed or heard by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Third, and last, defense counsel complained of inherent bias in the mere fact that the BCPD, not people assisting the defense, gathered the evidence at the crime scene and took the crime scene photographs. They argued that those photographs were taken \u201cwith the sole intent to help the State in preparing their case, not the Defendant\u2019s case[,]\u201d and that Howard needs photographs taken from a \u201cpoint of view\u201d that will assist in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">This argument lacks substance and borders on the nonsensical. Crime scene photographs always are taken by first responders, and here, when they were taken, right after the police arrived at the House, Howard was not even a known suspect. Howard does not say what it is about the crime scene photographs that leads him to believe they were taken from a \u201cpoint of view\u201d that would advance the prosecution and detract from his defense. He ignores the fact that when defense counsel moved to inspect the House, six months had passed since the crime and Ms. Lobell had moved back in. Obviously, by then the crime scene no longer existed. The House existed as a crime location but not as a crime scene. To the extent defense counsel were unhappy with the way the evidence was photographed by the police\u2014and they have given nothing to justify such a reaction\u2014the evidence could not be re-photographed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Howard failed to make a threshold showing of a need to inspect the House to obtain evidence that was relevant and material to his defense. Accordingly, even if the trial court had authority to order Ms. Lobell and her son to make the House available for inspection by the defense before trial, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>would have abused its discretion by exercising that authority to issue such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"alh-dedup-0\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"A48\">The prosecutor planned to call BCPD Officer Denise Wallace, an expert in the field of latent fingerprint examination, to testify that she had examined a fingerprint lifted from an envelope in Ms. Lobell\u2019s bedroom, had compared it to Howard\u2019s fingerprint in the BCPD database, and had confirmed that the fingerprints matched.</p>\n<p id=\"Az8\">The day before Officer Wallace was scheduled to testify, defense counsel moved to preclude her from making mention of the \u201cknown prints\u201d in the BCPD database. They argued that any reference to \u201cknown prints\u201d would signal to the jury that Howard had a criminal history. In response, the prosecutor offered to have Officer Wallace roll Howard\u2019s fingerprints in court, outside the presence of the jury, and then compare those fingerprints to the fingerprint lifted from the envelope in Ms. Lobell\u2019s bedroom. Defense counsel agreed. Howard\u2019s fingerprints were rolled in court. The court directed the prosecutor to instruct Officer Wallace \u201cthat there\u2019s to be no overt or even indirect references to prior arrests [or] the genesis of these known prints[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ak--dedup-0\">The next day, Officer Wallace\u2019s testimony went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAE\">[THE STATE]: So the latent ... print card, the known prints that you had of [Howard] that you compared it to, did you have an opportunity to actually see [Howard\u2019s] prints be rolled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY-\">[WALLACE]: Not at the time, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYR\">[THE STATE]: Not at the time. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apu\">The\u2014at that time, the card that you had, then you were just told that it belonged to [Howard], is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1h\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A30\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aca\">[WALLACE]: The card that I received, <em>I received it from an archive file that we </em>have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">[THE STATE]: Okay.

And did you also have an opportunity to observe those prints and identify\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. Your Honor, may we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">[THE STATE]: \u2014observe [Howard] being printed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">[THE COURT]: Yes.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">At the bench, defense counsel moved for a mistrial or to strike Officer Wallace\u2019s testimony about the \u201carchive file.\u201d The court denied both motions, finding that \u201cthere [was no] impermissible suggestion that the archived file was a consequence of a prior arrest or conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Howard contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial or to strike Officer Wallace\u2019s testimony about the \u201carchive file.\u201d He asserts that \u201c[Officer] Wallace\u2019s reference to [his] \u2018archive file\u2019 very likely led the jury to infer that [Howard] had a prior criminal record\u2014a fact both irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial,]\u201d thereby denying him a fair trial. He argues that even if a mistrial were not warranted, the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion to strike because the reference to an \u201carchive file\u201d violated the prohibition against inadmissible other crimes evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">The State responds that the court did not abuse its discretion because Officer Wallace\u2019s reference to the \u201carchive file\u201d \u201cdid not suggest that the fingerprints that [Officer Wallace] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>used for comparison were obtained in connection with a criminal case[,]\u201d and Officer Wallace\u2019s testimony was admissible and relevant to show that Howard was present at the crime scene. Moreover, any prejudice was diminished by the overwhelming evidence that he was present at the crime scene. The State argues that because Officer Wallace\u2019s testimony was relevant and not unfairly prejudicial, \u201cthere was no basis to grant either a motion for mistrial or a motion to strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201cA mistrial is an extreme remedy and it is well established that the decision whether to grant it is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Walls v. State, </em>228 Md.App. 646, 668, 142 A.3d 631 (2016) (citing <em>Carter v. State, </em>366 Md. 574, 589, 785 A.2d 348 (2001)). \u201c \u2018In the environment of the trial the trial court is peculiarly in a superior position to judge the effect of any ... alleged improper remarks.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simmons v. State, </em>436 Md. 202, 212, 81 A.3d 383 (2013) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 429, 326 A.2d 707 (1974)). \u201c[T]he key question for the appellate court is whether the defendant was so prejudiced by the improper reference that he was deprived of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 474, 494, 985 A.2d 72 (2009) (citing <em>Kosmas v. State, </em>316 Md. 587, 594, 560 A.2d 1137 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Officer Wallace complied with the trial court\u2019s directive that she not make any \u201covert or even indirect reference[] to prior arrests [or] the genesis of the[] known prints[.]\u201d Her reference to an \u201carchive file\u201d was ambiguous at best, and would not have suggested to the jury that Howard had a prior criminal record. Indeed, as we noted in <em>Edmonds v. State,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">[s]ince fingerprinting is used in numerous branches of business and civil and military service, ... the fact of fingerprinting cannot, of itself, be deemed a badge of crime or connote the existence of a criminal record, nor would the introduction of such evidence for the limited purpose of comparison with latent fingerprints of an accused found at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>crime scene <em>per se </em>constitute prejudice or deny the accused his constitutional right to a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">5 Md.App. 132, 139, 245 A.2d 618 (1976) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion by denying Howard\u2019s motion to strike Officer Wallace\u2019s testimony. Her reference to the \u201carchive file\u201d is not the same as evidence of \u201can activity or conduct, not necessarily criminal, that tends to impugn or reflect adversely upon one\u2019s character, taking into consideration the facts of the underlying lawsuit.\u201d <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 549, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999). Because an \u201carchived\u201d fingerprint could come from any number of sources, and Officer Wallace\u2019s reference would not have been a clear indication that Howard had engaged in past criminal conduct, the trial court acted within its discretion in denying both the motion for mistrial and the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Howard was charged with the felony of first-degree burglary, in violation of Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol., 2014 Supp.), section 6-202 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d). That statute states that \u201c[a] person may not break and enter the dwelling of another with the intent to commit theft\u201d or \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction for first-degree burglary includes the following with respect to a \u201cbreaking\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">Breaking means the creation or enlargement of an opening, such as breaking or opening a window or pushing open a door. [Breaking includes gaining entry by fraud, trick, or force.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">MPJI-Cr 4:06. In the discussion among the court and counsel about instructions, the prosecutor asked the court to elaborate slightly on the definition of \u201cbreaking\u201d in the pattern instruction, to explain that there are two types of breaking and to include the parenthetical above. The trial court agreed, and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>There are two types of breaking: actual breaking and constructive breaking. Actual breaking means the creation of an enlargement or an opening, such as breaking or opening a window or pushing ... open a door. Constructive breaking means gaining entry by fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, trick or force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Howard contends the trial court abused its discretion by giving this modified instruction about \u201cbreaking.\u201d He argues that the modification \u201cimpermissibly amplified the State\u2019s theory of guilt\u201d and \u201ceffectively tilted the scales in the State\u2019s favor.\u201d The State responds that the instruction was a correct statement of the law that was generated by the evidence and that \u201cwhere the instruction was correct, a few sentences that depart from [MPJI-Cr 4:06] in a way that clarifies, rather than confuses, the applicable law can hardly generate error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>Hall v. State, </em>437 Md. 534, 539, 87 A.3d 1287 (2014). \u201c[A] trial court must give a requested jury instruction where \u2018(1) the instruction is a correct statement of law; (2) the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in instructions actually given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vielot v. State, </em>225 Md.App. 492, 505, 126 A.3d 143 (2015) (quoting <em>Dickey v. State, </em>404 Md. 187, 197-98, 946 A.2d 444 (2008)). \u201c[I]f, taken as a whole, [the court\u2019s instructions] correctly state the law, are not misleading, and cover adequately the issues raised by the evidence, the defendant has not been prejudiced and reversal is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Fleming v. State, </em>373 Md. 426, 433, 818 A.2d 1117 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The modified instruction was a correct statement of the law. In <em>Hobby v. State, </em>436 Md. 526, 556, 83 A.3d 794 (2014), the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c[a]ctual breaking\u201d is the \u201c \u2018unloosing, removing or displacing any covering or fastening of the premises\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[constructive breaking\u201d is the \u201c \u2018entry gained by artifice, fraud, conspiracy or threat.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>395 Md. 97, 119, 909 A.2d 650 (2006)). Howard complains, however, that without modification the pattern jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>instruction would have adequately explained the \u201cbreaking\u201d element of first degree burglary; but as modified, the instruction \u201ccreated a State-friendly instruction when there was absolutely no need to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Howard cites no authority for the proposition that a trial court abuses its discretion by providing a more comprehensive jury instruction than the pattern instruction when the instruction accurately recites the law. The only cases he cites are inapposite. In <em>Brogden v. State, </em>384 Md. 631, 644, 866 A.2d 129 (2005), the Court held that the trial court committed reversible error by giving a jury instruction that shifted the burden of proof to the defendant; and in <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 214, 522 A.2d 1338 (1987), the Court held that the trial court committed reversible error by giving an instruction that improperly suggested the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support a conviction. The modified instruction at issue in this case did neither such thing. It accurately described actual and constructive \u201cbreaking\u201d in a way that would be most understandable to the jurors. <em>See Sydnor v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 173, 184, 754 A.2d 1064 (2000) (observing that trial courts should seek \u201cto give the jury the most accurate recitation of the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The modified instruction also was generated by the evidence. The State\u2019s theory of prosecution was that Howard fraudulently misrepresented himself as a licensed repairman so as to gain entry to Ms. Lobell\u2019s house in order to steal from her and commit crimes of violence against her. Ms. Lobell testified that Howard told her that Ms. Lang had hired him to repair her roof, and that he entered her home on the pretext of doing repair work on her house as well. Detective Anderson testified that he verified with the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation that Howard was not a licensed \u201csalesmen, subcontractor or contractor with the Maryland Home Improvement Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Finally, the instruction was not fairly covered by any other instruction given.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The trial court did not abuse its discretion by giving the modified instruction on breaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The State designated Shannon Weitz, a forensic biologist and DNA analyst with Bode Technology, a \u201cprivate DNA testing laboratory[,]\u201d as an expert witness in the field of DNA analysis. Ms. Weitz examined DNA samples submitted by the BCPD crime lab, including samples taken from a stain from the t-shirt recovered from Ms. Lobell\u2019s living room floor, blood on the living room carpet, and Howard\u2019s buccal swab. She created a DNA profile for each sample, compared the profiles, and concluded to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that all three were a match.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Ms. Weitz\u2019s findings were documented in a report the SAO provided to defense counsel in discovery, at least six months before trial. The report includes the following \u201cNotes\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">1. Testing performed for this case is in compliance with accredited procedures under the laboratory\u2019s ISO/IE C 17025 accreditation issued by ASCLD/LAB and ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board/FQS. Refer to certificates and scopes of accreditation for certificate numbers ALI-231-T and AT-1672, respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">2. The DNA profiles reported in this case were determined by procedures that have been validated according to the standards established in the FBI\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">On the second day of trial, moments before Ms. Weitz was to testify, defense counsel moved to exclude her \u201cDNA report\u201d from evidence, arguing that the report\u2019s certification did not comport with standards required by Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.), section 10-915 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, counsel asserted that the DNA profiles created from the t-shirt, blood stain, and How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ard\u2019s buccal swab were not validated according to standards established by the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (\u201cTWGDAM\u201d) or the DNA Advisory Board of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d). Defense counsel asked the court to \u201cexclude the report because it is not in compliance with the admissibility standards that [are] required by the statute\u201d and to exclude Ms. Weitz\u2019s testimony in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The prosecutor countered that CJP section 10-915 is designed \u201cto remove the necessity for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing\u201d and is not meant to automatically bar the admissibility of DNA profiles validated according to alternative standards.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He asserted that the report had been produced by the State in its initial discovery and defense counsel had not raised the issue of admissibility or requested a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing. The prosecutor stated that the DNA analysis performed by Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Weitz \u201cis generally accepted within the scientific community as a reliable testing procedure,\u201d but he was \u201cperfectly willing to have a <em>Frye-Reed, </em>hearing\u201d if defense counsel desired. Defense counsel did not request a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion to exclude Ms. Weitz\u2019s report and testimony, finding it \u201cutterly and completely groundless.\u201d Ms. Weitz was permitted to opine about her DNA analysis and scientific conclusions. Her report was not offered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Howard contends the trial court erred by not holding a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine whether the analysis Ms. Weitz performed, which was the basis for her opinion that his DNA matched the DNA recovered from the t-shirt and carpet sample, was generally accepted by the relevant scientific community and therefore was admissible. The State counters preliminarily that this issue is not preserved for review. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In his reply brief, Howard all but concedes that he failed to request a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing. He asserts, however, that because \u201cthe State itself broached the subject when the court considered the defense motion\u201d and \u201cthe trial court made clear that in all respects it considered the defense motion to be \u2018utterly and completely groundless!,]\u2019 \u201d the issue was \u201c \u2018decided by the trial court\u2019 and therefore preserved.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue [other than jurisdiction] unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The record is clear that the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the court hold a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing was made in passing and did not eliminate Howard\u2019s obligation to request such a hearing himself. The prosecutor explained that he had learned about the defense motion moments before it was made and focused his opposition on certification grounds. He briefly stated that the State was \u201cwilling to have a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing if [the defense] want[ed]\u201d but asserted that nobody could \u201cwith a straight face challenge that the DNA analysis is [not] general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ly accepted within the scientific community as a reliable testing procedure.\u201d The burden was on the defense to request a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing. Having failed to do so, Howard cannot complain on appeal that the trial court erred by not holding such a hearing. <em>See Addison v. State, </em>188 Md.App. 165, 181, 981 A.2d 698 (2009).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">False imprisonment, a common law crime, is the \u201c \u2018unlawful detention of a person against his will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Street v.

State, </em>440 Md. 450, 455, 103 A.3d 586 (2014) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Hobby, </em>436 Md. at 538, 83 A.3d 794).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">The evidence most favorable to the verdict showed that Howard threw Ms. Lobell from her dining room to her living room floor, breaking her hip and leaving her immobile; held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>her down on the floor; removed her phone from its mounted position on the wall so she could not use it to call for help; threw the medical alert control module down the basement stairs in an (ultimately failed) effort to keep her from contacting help; and searched her home while she was lying on the floor immobile. Under the circumstances, a reasonable juror could conclude that Howard\u2019s separate acts of holding Ms. Lobell down and preventing her from contacting help established that she was confined by force and against her will on her living room floor and those acts were legally sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that Howard was guilty of false imprisonment beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">At sentencing, Howard argued that his convictions for first-degree assault and false imprisonment should merge. Defense counsel pointed out that in closing argument, the prosecutor stated that the \u201cpropelling, and picking up [the victim] and the\u2014the throwing her\u2014her on the ground and breaking of her hip ... creates the detention and then the confinement of her inability to move that creates the false imprisonment^]\u201d Howard argued that because the false imprisonment and assault were \u201cpart of the same acts,\u201d \u201cthe elements of the false imprisonment were the same and included in the elements of the first-degree assault.\u201d Therefore, under the required evidence test, the sentences must merge. <em>See Brooks v. State, </em>439 Md. 698, 98 A.3d 236 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The State responded that sentences only merge under the required evidence test when the elements of one crime are identical to the elements of another, and one crime (the greater offense) carries an additional element not contained in the other. The elements of false imprisonment and assault are not the same, and therefore merger was not required. The State further argued that the separate acts of holding the victim down, keeping her confined in the living room for hours, and removing the telephone from the wall were \u201c[c]learly distinct from the first-degree assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>[T]he false imprisonment conviction in this case was based on distinct acts that occurred sequentially in the\u2014in the timeline here. After the original first-degree assault, there were independent acts and independent time that elapsed while this\u2014the victim in this case was being detained against her will. And I find also that the two offenses are distinct from the standpoint\u2014elementally and they\u2014and there\u2019s certainly no argument\u2014no legitimate argument here that these are lesser included offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">So I will sentence the [defendant independently with regard to the first-degree assault charge ... and the false imprisonment charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On appeal, Howard does not renew his argument that his sentence for false imprisonment should have merged under the required evidence test. Instead, he argues that his sentence was illegal and should have merged under the rule of lenity and considerations of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Howard\u2019s rule of lenity argument lacks merit. The rule of lenity is one of statutory construction that applies to merger of two statutory crimes, or one statutory crime and one common law crime. <em>Khalifa v. </em>State, 382 Md. 400, 434, 855 A.2d 1175 (2004). It does not apply to two common law crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">False imprisonment is a common law crime. In <em>Pair v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 617, 642, 33 A.3d 1024 (2011), we held that the rule of lenity did <em>not </em>apply to merger of sentences for false imprisonment and first-degree assault because \u201c[a]ssault, whatever its degree or statutorily prescribed punishment, remains a common law crime.\u201d When the General Assembly codified assault into degrees and prescribed punishments, it did not create a crime or crimes; the common law crime of assault remained. <em>Id. </em>at 642-43, 33 A.3d 1024. Accordingly, the rule of lenity has no application here because false imprisonment and assault in any degree, including first-degree assault, are common law crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Howard\u2019s fundamental fairness argument also lacks merit. \u201c[T]he principle of fundamental fairness. ... is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>defense that, by itself, rarely is successful in the context of merger.\u201d <em>Latray v. State, </em>221 Md.App. 544, 558, 109 A.3d 1265 (2015) (citations omitted). In <em>Carroll v. State, </em>428 Md. 679, 694-95, 53 A.3d 1159 (2012), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Fundamental fairness is \u201c[o]ne of the most basic considerations in all our decisions ... in meting out punishment for a crime.\u201d <em>Monoker [v. State], </em>321 Md. [214,] 223, 582 A.2d 525 [ (1990) ]; <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 434, 855 A.2d 1175, (2004) (observing that additional reasons for merger include \u201chistorical treatment, judicial decisions which generally hold that offenses merge, and fairness\u201d) (quoting <em>McGrath [v. State][,] </em>356 Md. [20] [at] 25, 736 A.2d 1067). In deciding whether fundamental fairness requires merger, we have looked to whether the two crimes are \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of one another, such that one crime is \u201can integral component\u201d of the other. <em>Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 223-24, 582 A.2d 525. This inquiry is \u201cfact-driven\u201d because it depends on considering the circumstances surrounding a defendant\u2019s convictions, not solely the mere elements of the crimes. <em>Pair[,] </em>202 Md.App. [at] 645, 33 A.3d 1024[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">(Footnote and parallel citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Howard maintains his sentences must merge because the acts forming the basis for his false imprisonment conviction were \u201cincidental to\u201d the acts supporting his conviction for first-degree assault. He relies on <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 82, 366 A.2d 421 (1976). In that case we held that the trial court erred by not merging the defendant\u2019s convictions for rape and false imprisonment, where the false imprisonment conviction was based on an unlawful confinement committed only to enable the defendant to rape the victim. Merger was required because \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would be to hold that in every case of rape, a conviction for false imprisonment would also be proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 366 A.2d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\"><em>Hawkins </em>is distinguishable. Here, Howard did not falsely imprison the victim long enough to assault her; to the contrary, the assault occurred first in time, followed by the false imprisonment. Indeed, Howard does not contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>assault conviction should have merged into his conviction for false imprisonment, but the other way around. As noted in <em>Hawkins, </em>\u201cconfinement after or before\u201d an assault \u201cis committed would preclude the merger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the subsequent detention had no bearing on the initial assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Moreover, the acts supporting Howard\u2019s conviction for false imprisonment were not \u201cpart and parcel\u201d or \u201can integral component\u201d of those forming the basis for his conviction for first-degree assault. After the initial <em>assault\u2014ie., </em>Howard\u2019s \u201cpropelling\u201d Ms. Lobell to the floor\u2014he proceeded to hold her down and later left her lying on the floor with a broken hip, unable to move. Most significantly, he disabled her telephone and tried to disable the medical alert module in an attempt to prevent her from contacting assistance and thus escape confinement. These acts were separate from those supporting the first-degree assault charge. <em>See Carroll, </em>428 Md. at 697, 53 A.3d 1159 (\u201cOne of the principal reasons for rejecting a claim that fundamental fairness requires merger in a given case is that the crimes punish separate wrongdoing.\u201d (Citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Howard argues that the basis for his false imprisonment conviction is, at the least, ambiguous because the jury could have reached its verdict based solely on the acts stemming from the first-degree assault; therefore merger is required. He supports this argument by pointing to the prosecutor\u2019s statements in summation, where she argued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">[a]nd really the false imprisonment in this particular case is ... that once h[e] grabs her, once he throws her on the ground, she said, I know immediately my hip is broken. I know it. I\u2019ve had one before, I know it. And she can\u2019t move. She is now immobile. She can\u2019t do anything. And she is helpless. She is detained, she is confined, it is against her will and it was through force. That is all you have to find for false imprisonment. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Howard ignores the State\u2019s rebuttal closing, in which the prosecutor asserted that \u201cthrowing [the victim] to the floor and then getting on top of her confines and detains\u201d her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>that he \u201cdetain[ed] her further by taking away her avenue of help\u201d by \u201cripp[ing] the phone out of the wall[.]\u201d The argument advanced on rebuttal clearly distinguishes the acts supporting separate convictions for assault and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">At any rate, any ambiguity was resolved by the court\u2019s instructions. The court properly instructed the jury on the elements of false imprisonment, which require a finding that Howard \u201cconfined or detained\u201d the victim; that she was detained \u201cagainst her will\u201d; and \u201cthat the confinement or detention\u201d was \u201caccomplished by force or threat of force or deception.\u201d Indeed, \u201cwe presume that juries follow the instructions of trial judges.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 444, 459, 768 A.2d 761 (2001) (citing <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 570, 276 A.2d 214 (1971)) (additional citations omitted). Thus, to convict Howard for false imprisonment, the jury had to find that Ms. Lobell was detained through \u201cforce or threat of force\u201d separate from the initial assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">VIL</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Alternatively, Howard contends his 35-year consecutive sentence for false imprisonment must be vacated because it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[ejxcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.\u201d Similarly, Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides \u201c[t]hat excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted, by the Courts of Law.\u201d Finally, Article 16 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides \u201c[t]hat sanguinary Laws ought to be avoided as far as is consistent with the safety of the State; and no Law to inflict cruel and unusual pains and penalties ought to be made in any case, or at any time, hereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\"><em>State v.

Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 997, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring). In other words, a trial court abuses its discretion when a sentence is \u201ctruly egregious.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>333 Md. at 97, 634 A.2d 1. The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">In considering a proportionality challenge, a reviewing court must first determine whether the sentence appears to be grossly disproportionate. In so doing, the court should look to the seriousness of the conduct involved, the seriousness of any relevant past conduct as in the recidivist cases, any articulated purpose supporting the sentence, and the importance of deferring to the legislature and to the sentencing court. <em>See [State v.] Davis, </em>310 Md. [611,] 631-32, 530 A.2d 1223 [ (1987) ] and <em>Minor [v. State], </em>313 Md. [573,] 583-84, 546 A.2d 1028, [ (1988) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">If these considerations do not lead to a suggestion of gross disproportionality, the review is at an end. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>sentence does appear to be grossly disproportionate, the court should engage in a more detailed ... analysis. It may conduct an intra- and inter-jurisdictional analysis as a vehicle for comparison and as a source of objective standards; it must, however, remember that under principles of federalism, a state legislature may choose to impose a more severe penalty than other states consider appropriate. In order to be unconstitutional, a punishment must be more than very' harsh; it must be grossly disproportionate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Howard has not satisfied the preliminary threshold established in <em>Thomas. </em>His conduct plainly was serious in nature. He gained access to the home of a 98-year old woman by misrepresenting that he could fix her roof; became violent when she asked him to leave, forcing her to the floor and fracturing her hip; held her there against her will and attempted to prevent her from calling for help by dismantling both her phone and medical alert module; went through her personal effects, as evidenced by his fingerprint in an envelope recovered from her bedroom; and threatened to return the next day. As the trial court noted, the victim was \u201cexceedingly vulnerable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Moreover, the court considered Howard\u2019s lengthy criminal record in fashioning an appropriate sentence. Beginning in 1983, Howard had a series of convictions for crimes, including disorderly conduct, malicious destruction of property, theft, and several charges of first-degree burglary, one of which, the State proffered, was perpetrated against a 93-year-old victim. (The charges in that case were dropped because the victim died before trial.) The court concluded that Howard \u201cmust be punished more harshly because of the vulnerability of this victim and because of his dreadful criminal record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Furthermore, the court articulated several reasons for imposing its sentence. The court found that \u201cthe concept of rehabilitation plays absolutely no role in my thinking in this case[,]\u201d because Howard\u2019s expression of remorse was not \u201csincere or legitimate!)]\u201d It further noted that \u201cdeterrence] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and punishment are terribly important\u201d and considered the \u201cspecial vulnerability of [the victim.]\u201d And, we give great deference to the sentencing court, which \u201cis virtually always better informed of the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>333 Md. at 97, 634 A.2d 1. In the absence of a threshold showing that Howard\u2019s sentence for false imprisonment was \u201cgrossly disproportionate,\u201d he has failed to launch a viable Eighth Amendment challenge to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-16\">. Specifically, Howard was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for first-degree assault, 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for first-degree burglary, 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for theft under $1,000, and 35 years' imprisonment for false imprisonment, all to be served consecutively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. Defense counsel stated that their inspection of the House would take one-half hour, that they would bring an investigator to take photographs, and that they would want to inspect the kitchen, living room, and dining room, and perhaps the upstairs and downstairs, <em>i.e., </em>the basement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b163-5\">. Howard also argues that because the court has authority to permit a jury view of the crime scene, it must have authority to permit a defendant to inspect the crime scene before trial. Maryland follows \" 'the general rule ... that the granting or refusing of a request to allow the jury to view the premises where a crime is alleged to have been committed is within the discretion of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waddell v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 606, 611, 501 A.2d 865 (1985) (quoting <em>Corens v. State, </em>185 Md. 561, 573, 45 A.2d 340 (1946)); <em>see also 2 McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 219 (7th ed. 2013) (\"[E]ven without express statutory authorization there is an inherent power in the trial judge to order a view by the jury[.]\u201d); 4 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1163 (1972) (stating a trial \u201ccourt is empowered to order such a view, in consequence of its ordinary common law function, and <em>irrespective of statutes </em>conferring express power\u201d (emphasis in original)). An inspection of a crime scene before trial and a jury view of a crime scene during trial are not comparable, because a jury view is not an aspect of discovery or pre-trial procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. In the State's view, subsection (g)(1)(b) of Rule 4-263 creates a \"catch-all\u201d entitlement to discovery not otherwise covered by the rule, when constitutionally required and upon a showing of an adequate need. Whether the language can be read that way is highly questionable but does not matter because the subsection does not apply here as the rule as a whole does not apply to non-parties such as Ms. Lobell and her son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. The State also argues that if the court erred its error was harmless, and if not harmless the appropriate remedy is a limited remand to allow the trial court to balance Howard's right to mount a defense against Ms. Lobell\u2019s privacy interests. Because we hold that the court did not err, we need not reach those arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(e) requires that the item be \"within the government\u2019s possession, custody, or control\u201d and that it be either \"material to preparing the defense[,]\u201d an item the government intends to use in its case-in-chief, or an item that was \"obtained from or belongs to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. Maryland first permitted pretrial discovery in criminal cases in July 1951, when the Court of Appeals adopted the Maryland Criminal Rules of Practice and Procedure. Rule 5 of those rules, the predecessor to Rule 4-263, stated in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">Discovery and Inspection. Upon motion of a defendant, the court, in any case pending before it, may order the State\u2019s Attorney to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph designated books, papers, documents, or tangible objects, including written statements by the defendant, obtained from or belonging to the defendant or obtained from others by seizure or by process upon a showing that the items sought may be material to the preparation of his defense and that the request is reasonable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">. There was a time when the \"Criminal Rules of Practice and Procedure\u201d made reference to an inherent authority of the court with respect to discovery. In 1956, Rule 5 was reorganized and moved to Chapter 700 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, as Rule 728. Effective January 1, 1962, the section in which Rule 728 was included was \"completely rewritten\u201d and the rule was revised. <em>Jennings v. State, </em>303 Md. 72, 80, 492 A.2d 295 (1985). As revised, Rule 728 included section (c), entitled \"Common Law Discovery Preserved^]\u201d which stated, \"Nothing in this Rule shall limit the inherent common law power of the court to require or permit discovery.\u201d A later version of that rule changed the title of section (c) to \"Inherent Power of Court Preserved\u201d and removed the phrase \"common law.\u201d In mid-1975, the Maryland Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedures (\"Rules Committee\u201d) recommended in its Fifty-Third Report to the Court of Appeals an expanded version of Rule 728, to be renumbered Rule 741, that no longer contained section (c). The Court of Appeals adopted that revision, which went into effect on July 1, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b182-14\">.
