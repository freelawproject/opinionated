The relevant facts in this case surround Coomes\u2019s \u201cvoluntary surrender\u201d of her Virginia producer\u2019s license and whether this \u201csurrender\u201d constitutes an \u201cadverse action\u201d requiring Coomes to report the surrender to the MIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">On appeal, Coomes presents five issues for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>1. Whether the Commissioner erred as a matter of-law by finding that Coomes\u2019s voluntary surrender of her Virginia insurance producer\u2019s license was an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d requiring her to report it to the Maryland Insurance Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">2.

Whether Double Jeopardy applies to shield Coomes from having her Maryland producer\u2019s license revoked after previously voluntarily surrendering her Virginia producer\u2019s license based on the same underlying set of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">4. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion under Md. Code (1984, 2014 Repl.

That same year, the State of Maryland issued a producer\u2019s license to Coomes as a nonresident producer. In September of 2011, the Virginia Department of Insurance (\u201cVDI\u201d) began investigating Coomes for alleged acts of misappropriating two checks sent to her in error by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virginia (\u201cAnthem\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Prior to September 2011, Anthem mistakenly sent two checks totaling approximately $20,000 to Coomes\u2019s agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>home office in Leesburg, Virginia. Both checks were made out to \u201cEBCA\u201d (Employee Benefit Corporation of America). Coomes, or a member of her staff, deposited the checks into her agency\u2019s operating account. EBCA and Anthem notified Coomes that the checks were sent to her agency in error on or around August 18, 2011, and they requested the return of the money since the checks were deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Coomes testified at the hearing before the Commissioner that the agency routinely received commission checks from Anthem and other insurers, and that by the time Anthem demanded repayment for the checks sent in error, she had already spent the money on various business expenses. She further testified that after she informed Anthem that she was not able to repay the money in one lump sum, Anthem refused to take the money out of her future commission payments. Thereafter, she and Anthem came to an agreement for Coomes to repay Anthem immediately with approximately $6,000 to $10,000 cash on hand, and the remainder with a small personal loan. A few days later, however, Anthem filed a complaint with VDI and Coomes did not repay the money immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The VDI began investigating Coomes\u2019s conduct in September of 2011 based on allegations that Coomes had misappropriated money through acts of fraud, deception, or dishonesty. The investigation by the VDI addressed Anthem\u2019s accusations that Coomes had committed fraud, conversion and had forged endorsements on the checks. Thereafter, Coomes repaid all but $2,000 of the money owed with a series of three checks sent in February and March of 2012. Coomes, however, refused to repay the remaining $2,000, averring that Anthem owed her the money for unrelated advertising co-op costs under her contract with Anthem.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The VDI\u2019s investigation ultimately was resolved without a hearing when Coomes agreed to a \u201cvoluntary surrender\u201d of her Virginia producer\u2019s license. Coomes executed the voluntary surrender agreement with the VDI on or around December 10, 2012, to be effective March 11, 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ment, Coomes acknowledged that she voluntarily surrendered her Virginia producer\u2019s license <em>\u201cin lieu of a hearing </em>before the State Corporation Commission, which [Coomes] understand^] may result in revocation or suspension of [Coomes\u2019s] authority as an insurance agent or consultant, as well as possible monetary penalty.\u201d (Emphasis added). Coomes voluntarily surrendered \u201call authority ... to conduct the business of insurance or insurance consulting in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d The agreement further provided that \u201c[i]n consideration of the Commission\u2019s acceptance of [the] voluntary surrender of [her] license authority in lieu of a hearing before the Commission ...\u201d Coomes agreed not to apply to \u201ctransact the business of insurance in Virginia for a period of one year\u201d from the date of the agreement, and only after she had resolved all of her \u201cfinancial obligations resulting from [her] insurance activities.\u201d Further, the language of the agreement refers to the agreement as an <em>\u201caction </em>... taken of [Coomes\u2019s] own volition.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Finally, Coomes acknowledged that she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-2\">understood] that notification of this matter, which may include personal information about [Coomes] including, but not limited to [Coomes\u2019s] name, residence address, social security number ..., date of birth, license and appointment status, and investigation or disciplinary action summary data, may be reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to other state insurance regulatory authorities or other interested parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Thereafter, in March of 2013, Coomes requested through a letter to the MIA that her residential address be updated and that her Maryland license be changed from nonresident producer to resident producer. In the letter, Coomes stated \u201cI have notified the Virginia Insurance Bureau of my address change and have requested a voluntary surrender of my Virginia resident license.\u201d Coomes did not include in the letter any indication of an investigation by the VDI into her mishan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>dling of money, nor did Coomes disclose that she had agreed to voluntarily surrender her license in lieu of facing a hearing to contest the allegations arising from Anthem\u2019s complaint. Coomes testified that she did not understand the voluntary surrender to be an \u201cadverse violation\u201d and did not know that there was a requirement that she inform the MIA of the VDI\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Pursuant to a revised order issued June 30, 2014,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Maryland Insurance Commissioner (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) issued an order finding the voluntary surrender agreement constituted an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d that was taken against Coomes. The Commissioner found Coomes to be in violation of I.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10\u2014126(a)(1), (6), (12), (13), and (f), and therefore, subject to discipline. The Commissioner revoked Coomes\u2019s license to act as an insurance producer in the State of Maryland and ordered her to pay an administrative penalty of $1,250.00 within 30 days. The pertinent provisions of I.A. \u00a7 10-126 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">(a) The Commissioner may deny a license to an applicant under \u00a7\u00a7 2-210 through 2-214 of this article, or suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew or reinstate a license after notice and opportunity for hearing under \u00a7\u00a7 2-210 through 2-214 of this article if the applicant or holder of the license:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">(1) has willfully violated this article or another law of the State that relates to insurance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAhc\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">(6) has committed fraudulent or dishonest practices in the insurance business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA3W\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>(12) has failed or refused to pay over on demand money that belongs to an insurer, insurance producer, or other person entitled to the money;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAWM\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">(13) has otherwise shown a lack of trustworthiness or competence to act as an insurance producer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA0K\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">(f)(1) Within 30 days after the final disposition of the matter, an insurance producer shall report to the Commissioner <em>any adverse administrative action </em>taken against the insurance producer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\"><em>(i) in another jurisdiction', </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">(ii) by another governmental unit in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">(2) The report shall include a copy of the order, consent order, and <em>any other relevant legal documents.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(l), (6), (12), (13) and (f) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">Coomes requested a hearing on the Commissioner\u2019s order, pursuant to I.A. \u00a7 2-210 and COMAR 31.02.01.03. Coomes appeared before a Commissioner on November 5, 2014 on the MIA\u2019s Motion for Summary Disposition, during which Coomes testified but did not call any other witnesses. On December 9, 2014, the Commissioner issued a revised final order granting the MIA\u2019s Motion for Summary Disposition, and finding that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-126(a)(l), (6), (12), (13), and (f). The Commissioner ordered that Coomes\u2019s license be revoked and that she pay an administrative penalty of $1,250.00 within forty-five days of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">On January 7, 2015, Coomes filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. A hearing was held before the circuit court on November 9, 2015, and on November 30, 2015, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the MIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">I.

In reviewing administrative adjudicatory decisions, our task</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\">is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAGE\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">[A] court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.

In this case, there were no issues of material fact in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">II. The Commissioner Did Not Err as a Matter of Law by Finding that Coomes\u2019s Voluntary Surrender of her Producer\u2019s License was an \u201cAdverse Administrative Action\u201d and Failure to Report the Action Violated I.A. \u00a7 10~126(a)(13) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The Commissioner found that Coomes \u201cfailed to report to the Commissioner [an] adverse administrative action taken against\u201d her when she did not report her agreement to voluntarily surrender her license in lieu of a hearing before the State Corporation Commission within 30 days. As a result, Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7 10-126(f). By failing to report the administrative action to the MIA, the Commission found that Coomes also violated I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13), which provides that a license may be revoked if the license holder \u201chas otherwise shown a lack of trustworthiness or competence to act as an insurance producer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>In this appeal, Coomes raises several arguments. The question we must answer, however, is whether the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that Coomes failed to report an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d in violation of I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f) was based on an erroneous conclusion of law. In other words, we examine whether the VDI\u2019s investigation and Coomes\u2019s acceptance of the voluntary surrender agreement in lieu of a hearing constitutes an \u201cadverse action\u201d for purposes of I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f). If so, she was required to report the action and submit relevant legal documents; therefore, a failure to do so would constitute a violation of I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">For the reasons explained herein, the investigation and subsequent voluntary surrender agreement in Virginia constitutes an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d such that Coomes was required to report it, as well as submit a copy of the voluntary surrender agreement to the MIA. Further, substantial evidence of Coomes\u2019s actions leading to the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7 10-126(f) also supported the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Coomes had violated I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(a)(13)\u2014i.e., that Coomes \u201cotherwise show[ed] a lack of trustworthiness or competence to act as an insurance producer.\u201d I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">A. The Voluntary Surrender Agreement with the Virginia Department of Insurance Constituted an \u201cAdverse Administrative Action\u201d under I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In the Final Revised Order, the Commissioner concluded that there was \u201cno genuine dispute as to the material facts relating to whether [Coomes] failed to report the Virginia Bureau action to the Commissioner as required by \u00a7 10-126(f).\u201d As the Commissioner aptly framed the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">[Tjhere is no factual dispute regarding whether [Coomes] reported the Virginia action to the Commissioner at any time; she did not. Thus, the question is whether the Virginia action was an adverse administrative action such that Respondent had an obligation to comply with \u00a7 10\u2014126(f), which is a question of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Coomes\u2019s arguments that her voluntary surrender of her producer\u2019s license in Virginia was not an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d revolve around two main points: (1) The plain language of the statute indicates that an evidentiary proceeding is required to constitute an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d; and (2) the structure of I.A. \u00a7 10-126 and \u201cthe context of procedural due process jurisprudence\u201d in which these terms are situated require a formal evidentiary proceeding to constitute an \u201cadverse administrative action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Coomes maintains that, based on the plain language, \u201cwhere the revocation of an insurance producer\u2019s license is involved, only a formal or informal proceeding that includes fact-finding and dispute resolution and results in an Order\u201d constitutes an adverse action. Thus, because \u201c[a] voluntary surrender of a license does not involve either fact-finding or dispute resolution,\u201d it must not be an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d such that Coomes was required to report it. Coomes provides no authority, however, to support her contention that the terms \u201cadverse\u201d and \u201caction\u201d imply a fact-finding, evidentiary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">When the General Assembly does not define precisely \u201ca particular statutory term, we first look to the plain meaning of the term, and give that language its \u2018ordinary and natural meaning [without] resort to subtle or forced interpretations\u2019 ....\u201d <em>Bennett v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>143 Md.App. 356, 368, 795 A.2d 124 (2001) (citing <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>110 Md.App. 677, 689, 678 A.2d 602 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>348 Md. 2, 702 A.2d 690 (1997)) (alterations in original). Our interpretation of statutes often requires that we consider \u201cthe consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Bennett, supra, </em>143 Md.App. at 369, 795 A.2d 124 (quoting <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v. Anne Arundel Cnty. Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 135, 747 A.2d 625 (2000)). The ordinary meaning of the term \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>would encompass the facts of this case, namely Coomes\u2019s agreement with the VDI to voluntarily surrender her producer\u2019s license to end the investigation into her conduct and avoid a hearing that could result in the revocation of her license and other penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Even assuming the term \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d is ambiguous, we interpret the statute as a whole in a way that \u201cavoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 795 A.2d 124. The Commissioner rejected Coomes\u2019s interpretation of I.A. \u00a7 10-126(f) in holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">On a practical note, under Respondent\u2019s theory, a producer with a Maryland license could always avoid regulatory oversight in Maryland for improper activities done in every other state by voluntarily giving up her license in that other state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Coomes\u2019s agreement to voluntarily surrender her producer\u2019s license in lieu of a hearing for a minimum of one year and until she had repaid the money to Anthem clearly falls within the meaning of \u201cadverse\u201d as the word is used in the statute. The Commissioner highlighted a similar point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">Applying the ordinary, popular understanding of the English language word \u201cadverse,\u201d [Coomes] giving up her producer\u2019s license, a key requirement in her employment, for a year was adverse to her interests, and the Voluntary Surrender Agreement with the Virginia Bureau was a relevant legal document relating to that transaction under \u00a7 10-126(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Notably, Coomes agreed to voluntarily surrender her license <em>in lieu of a hearing, </em>which could have resulted in the revocation of her Virginia license in addition to Coomes incurring fines. Within the agreement, Coomes acknowledged that, as a result of the surrender of her license, the VDI or others could notify \u201cthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners and other state insurance regulatory authorities or other interested parties\u201d of the \u201cinvestigation or disciplinary action summary data.\u201d The reasonable interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>terms of the agreement as a whole is that it was adverse in nature. The agreement benefitted Coomes by allowing her to avoid hearings on her conduct, which could have resulted in the revocation of her license, rather than her agreement not to reapply for one year, as well as other fines and penalties. The Commissioner, therefore, found that Coomes \u201cwas required to report the matter to the Commissioner within 30 days of its final disposition under \u00a7 10\u2014126(f).\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Coomes\u2019s additional reasons supporting her contention that the facts in the instant case did not constitute an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d are equally unavailing. Coomes asserts that \u201cthe structure and context of Section \u00a7 10-126 supports the conclusion that the General Assembly intended to require the licensee to report only adjudicated \u2018adverse administrative actions\u2019 that include fact-finding and dispute resolution and result in an Order.\u201d In the same vein, Coomes argues that the phrase \u201c \u2018adverse administrative action\u2019 arises in the context of procedural due process jurisprudence\u201d and therefore requires an evidentiary proceeding. Again, however, Coomes points to no legal authority for this contention, whether in the context of administrative proceedings or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Coomes does cite to a myriad of United States Supreme Court and out-of-state court eases in an attempt to support her contention that \u201cthe more significant the private interest involved, such as loss of livelihood, the more likely only a pre-deprivation, evidentiary hearing incorporating dispute resolution and [fact-finding] will be required to satisfy procedural due process .... \u201d Further, Coomes adds, \u201cthe failure to provide the requisite standard of procedural due process results in the invalidation of the administrative action revoking the license.\u201d She continues, \u201c[bjalancing the due process factors, it would appear that Petitioner\u2019s interest in her livelihood is a paramount ... consideration ..., warranting not only a hearing prior to deprivation but also an adjudicatory hearing prior to deprivation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">As much emphasis as Coomes places on the importance of an evidentiary hearing, it is unclear whether Coomes is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>cerned with the lack of an evidentiary hearing in the instant case below, or rather, as a result of Coomes\u2019s agreement to voluntarily surrender her license in Virginia, which Maryland\u2019s statute required Coomes to report to the MIA. Regarding the Virginia events, after the investigation began, Coomes was given the option to voluntarily surrender her license for a minimum of one year in lieu of a hearing on charges that the VDI could otherwise bring against her. Coomes, therefore, cannot now argue that because Coomes chose to bypass an evidentiary hearing in Virginia, \u201cthe administrative action revoking the license\u201d is now \u201cinvalid.\u201d Moreover, to the extent that Coomes, in this appeal, refers to the Commissioner\u2019s revocation of Coomes\u2019s Maryland license upon Summary Disposition in this case, Coomes had the opportunity and did participate in an evidentiary hearing before the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Assuming Coomes is concerned with the lack of an eviden-tiary hearing in Virginia, her contention is that, because Coomes opted to voluntarily surrender her license, the action was not an \u201cadverse action\u201d such that she was not required report it. Simply put, Coomes\u2019s argument requires us to read more into the statute than is evident by its plain, ordinary meaning. <em>See Stickley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>431 Md. 347, 359, 65 A.3d 141 (2013) (\u201cIn construing the plain language, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d) (quoting <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613, 937 A.2d 242 (2007)). Nowhere in the language of the statute does it explicitly or implicitly require that a hearing and final order occur alongside an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d in order for the action to constitute one that the license-holder must report. Critically, Coomes provides no authority to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">No dispute of material fact exists with regard to Coomes\u2019s failure to report the voluntary surrender agreement to the MIA. Coomes, herself, admits that she did not report the investigation or her agreement to surrender her Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>producer\u2019s license as a result of her handling of the two checks sent to her in error. The Commissioner did not err in finding that the voluntary surrender of Coomes\u2019s license in Virginia constitutes an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d under I.A. 10-126(f). Substantial evidence within the record supports the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that Coomes failed to report \u201can adverse administrative action\u201d within 30 days and failed to include with the report a copy of the voluntary surrender agreement as a \u201crelevant legal document.\u201d I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">To be sure, the MIA could clarify its standards for determining whether a particular event is an \u201cadverse action\u201d such that it must be reported under I.A. \u00a7 10-126(f). As Coomes points out, counsel for the agency noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">[i]n Virginia, a licensee whose license is <em>not under investigation </em>by the Bureau may simply withdraw from the business of insurance ... Such an action is not adverse to the licensee .... However, because her license was under investigation, Ms. Coomes was not given the option of license withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In her reply, Coomes presents us with a Maryland case in which the Commissioner found that a withdrawal was, in fact, an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d such that the producer in that case was required to report the withdrawal. Although it is unclear why the MIA maintains two different positions regarding the effect of how a termination of a license is titled for purposes of reporting adverse administrative actions, that is not a question we must answer. Instead, we focus on whether the facts of this case constitute an adverse administrative action. That task involves taking into account the language of the statute as a whole as well as the specific facts of this case, including the language and practical effect of the voluntary surrender agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Regardless of how the termination of Coomes\u2019s license was entitled, the language and consequences of the voluntary surrender agreement demonstrate that Coomes agreed to the surrender as a way to avoid further investigation into her conduct and avoid even greater consequences if she were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>pursue a hearing. Nevertheless, the agreement had a detrimental impact on her Maryland license authority. The Commissioner, therefore, did not err in his interpretation and application of the term \u201cadverse administrative action,\u201d nor in his finding that Coomes was required to report the Virginia action under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">B. Substantial Evidence Supports the Commissioner\u2019s Finding that Appellant Failed to Report the \u201cAdverse Administrative Action\u201d and Submit \u201cRelevant Legal Documents\u201d in Violation of I.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-126(a)(13) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">It is undisputed that Coomes did not notify the MIA of the voluntary surrender agreement within 30 days, and that she did not submit a copy of the voluntary surrender agreement to the MIA. To the extent Coomes argues that she notified the MIA of the adverse administrative action through her letter requesting to update her status from nonresident producer in Maryland to resident producer, we are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Coomes\u2019s letter, which she sent to the MIA on March 27, 2013, requested that her business address and residential addresses be updated and that her Maryland producer license\u2019s status be updated to resident producer. Within the letter, however, Coomes stated, \u201cI have notified the Virginia Insurance Bureau of my address change and have requested a voluntary surrender of my Virginia resident license.\u201d Coomes did not otherwise report any other aspect of the administrative action against her within 30 days of signing the voluntary surrender agreement. She further did not report the administrative action within 30 days of the initial effective date of the agreement (March 11, 2013), or within 30 days of the final effective date (April 1, 2013). Further, Coomes did not provide a copy of the voluntary surrender agreement, which may have communicated the adverse nature of the surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">As the Commissioner notes, we affirmed the MIA\u2019s decision to revoke an insurance producer\u2019s license for violating I.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u00a7 10\u2014126(f) where the attorney/insurance producer had informed the MIA that an attorney misconduct investigation was underway, merely directed the MIA to the Attorney Grievance Commission for further details, and failed to update the MIA on the disposition of the case. <em>See Culver v. Md. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>175 Md.App. 645, 931 A.2d 537, 541 (2007). The Commissioner explained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">[Coomes] ... was even less forthcoming than the producer in the <em>Culver </em>case. There, the producer at least mentioned the body that was investigating him. Here, Ms. Coomes downplayed the information about the voluntary surrender of her Virginia license by slipping that information [in] the middle of a letter primarily about changing her addresses, with no reference to the Virginia Bureau. That did not meet the standard of a report to the Commissioner about an adverse administrative action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In this appeal, Coomes reasons, \u201c[i]f a \u2018voluntary surrender\u2019 is such an obvious \u2018adverse administrative action\u2019 as is evidently believed, then the regulator surely should have recognized the implication of the information that was being conveyed.\u201d In this case, however, the language and terms of the voluntary surrender agreement would have indicated the adverse nature of the \u201cvoluntary surrender,\u201d even if the title of the administrative action would not make its adverse nature apparent in all circumstances. This is particularly so because the adverse administrative action occurred in another state. Coomes gave no indication that she surrendered her license in Virginia in lieu of a hearing, that she would not be able to reapply for a license in Virginia for a minimum of one year or until she had repaid money to an insurer, or that she was reporting an \u201cadverse administrative action\u201d pursuant to I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f). We, therefore, agree with the Commissioner\u2019s finding that \u201c[Coomes\u2019s] cryptic mention of the voluntary surrender of her Virginia license did not satisfy the requirements of I.A. \u00a7 10-126(f).\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s decision was therefore supported by substantial evidence in the record that Coomes violated I .A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>In addition to finding that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f), the Commissioner found that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13), which permits revocation if the license holder \u201chas otherwise shown a lack of trustworthiness or competence to act as an insurance producer.\u201d I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13). There is no dispute as to the facts the Commissioner relied upon to reach this conclusion\u2014Coomes did not report the investigation or voluntary surrender agreement to the MIA or submit the required documents as required. Indeed, the Commissioner suggested that Coomes may have attempted to lessen the significance of the voluntary surrender agreement by mentioning its existence in the context of requesting to update her residential and business addresses and her status as a resident producer in Maryland. Further, the Commissioner noted that not only did Coomes fail to submit a copy of the voluntary surrender agreement with notice of the adverse administrative action within 30 days, she also failed to produce a copy of the agreement even after the MIA requested relevant documents from the Virginia action. The Commissioner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqPU\">Respondent\u2019s failure to report the Virginia Bureau matter to the Commissioner in violation of \u00a7 10\u2014126(a)(f) and her attempt to downplay the Virginia action by disclosing the surrender of her Virginia license in the middle of an otherwise unrelated letter show a lack of trustworthiness to act as an insurance producer, or at least a lack of competence. Further, Respondent\u2019s failure or refusal to provide a copy of the Voluntary Surrender Agreement when asked by the MIA for documents related to the Virginia action also shows untrustworthiness or incompetence. The Respondent\u2019s uncontested actions and inactions support the MIA\u2019s finding that she lacks trustworthiness and/or competence to act as an insurance producer in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The Commissioner pointed to evidence in the record such as \u201c[Coomes\u2019s] own words in her Affidavit, testimony and correspondence with regulators and with Anthem.\u201d Certainly, substantial evidence supported the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13) based on her failure to notify the MIA of the adverse nature of her voluntary surrender and to submit relevant legal documents associated with it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>There were no material facts in dispute regarding the Commissioner\u2019s findings that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-126(a)(13) and (f), and the MIA was entitled to summary disposition as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">C. Coomes\u2019s Intent and Subjective Belief were Immaterial Regarding I.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-126(a)(13) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Coomes makes several arguments that her subjective intent was a necessary element for a finding that a violation occurred. With respect to I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(f), nothing in the statute requires that the license holder hold the subjective belief that the action in another jurisdiction was \u201cadverse\u201d\u2014i.e., that the action must be reported to the MIA. The Commissioner explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">In her defense, [Coomes] argues that she did not believe that the Virginia Bureau matter involved an adverse administrative action .... However, [Coomes] presented no legal argument supporting the theory that her subjective belief as to the nature of the Virginia matter excuses her from complying with \u00a7 10\u2014126(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Additionally, pursuant to I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13), the Commissioner did not have to find that Coomes intended to deceive the MIA by withholding information regarding the adverse administrative action. As the Commissioner pointed out, in <em>Culver, </em>the former insurance producer also argued that I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13) requires a showing of willful or intentional misconduct. <em>See Culver, </em>175 Md.App. at 661, 931 A.2d 537. There, we explained that \u201cthe adverb \u2018willfully\u2019 applies only to Section 10-126(a)(l) and not to the remainder of the section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we also reasoned that \u201cit would be nonsensical to require a showing of a \u2018willful\u2019 lack of competence as a basis for revocation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">III. The Commissioner\u2019s Finding that Coomes Violated I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(l), (6) and (12) is supported by Substantial Evidence in the Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The Commissioner\u2019s finding that, in addition to I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(13) and (f), Coomes\u2019s license could also be revoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>under I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(l), (6), and (12), was based on evidence presented in the instant case relating to Coomes\u2019s conduct in Virginia. All three subsections are implicated by the same set of facts, namely Coomes\u2019s handling of Anthem\u2019s checks, which she deposited in error, failed to immediately return, and for which she ultimately surrendered her Virginia producer\u2019s license. First, I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(12) provides that the Commissioner may revoke a license after notice and the opportunity for a hearing if the license holder \u201chas failed or refused to pay over on demand money that belongs to an insurer ... or other person entitled to the money.\u201d Next, subsection (a)(6) allows revocation where the license holder \u201chas committed fraudulent or dishonest practices in the insurance business.\u201d I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(6). Finally, subsection (a)(1) allows revocation when the license holder \u201chas willingly violated [the Insurance Article] or another law of the State that relates to insurance.\u201d I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The underlying facts support the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Coomes\u2019s license was liable for revocation on all three additional grounds. Moreover, the Commissioner summarized the evidence relied upon as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">Ms. Coomes\u2019[s] own words in her Affidavit, testimony and correspondence show that the money belonged to EBCA and/or Anthem and not to Ms. Coomes or her agency. She further concedes that Anthem demanded the immediate payment of the money and that she failed to pay the money back on demand. In fact, she admits that she withheld $2000, contending that Anthem otherwise owed her that amount (Coomes Aff., \u00b6 13.), and averred to the MIA that she will never pay Anthem $900 that it seeks from her. (MIA Exh. 5.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Clearly, the evidence is sufficient to establish that Coomes \u201cfailed [and] refused to pay over on demand money that belongs to an insurer ... or other person entitled to the money.\u201d I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(12). The statute provides no exceptions for the license holder\u2019s state of mind, subjective belief, or for disputes over who is the rightful owner of the money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>There is no question as to whether the money from the two checks sent to Coomes in error belonged to Anthem, that Coomes or one of her employees deposited the checks in error, and that Coomes was not able to immediately return the money when Anthem demanded its return. Coomes took six months to repay most of the money and kept approximately $2,000 as money she believed to be owed to her in an independent matter. Even in a light most favorable to Coomes, based only on these facts, the Commissioner had the authority to revoke Coomes\u2019s producer\u2019s license pursuant to I.A, \u00a7 10-126(a)(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In addition to I.A, \u00a7 10-126(a)(12), these same facts provided the Commissioner with a basis to revoke Coomes\u2019s license under subsections (1) and (6), as well. The Commissioner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">Even after acknowledging that the funds rightfully belonged to Anthem, Ms. Coomes purposefully kept some of it because she felt that Anthem owed it to her for an unrelated reason. That undisputed fact supports the MIA\u2019s findings that Ms. Coomes willfully violated the Maryland Insurance Article in violation of \u00a7 10\u2014126(a)(1) and that she committed a fraudulent or dishonest practice in the insurance business in violation of \u00a7 10-126(a)(6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Coomes asserts, inaccurately, that \u201cnearly all of the paragraphs or sub-paragraphs of Section 10-126(a) require some finding of \u2018willfulness\u2019 or \u2018intentionality,\u2019 \u201d and lists as examples subsections \u201c10-126(a)(l) (\u2018[w]illfully\u2019); (2) (\u2018intentionally5); (5) \u201cwillfully ...\u2019); (7) (\u2018with actual intent ...\u2019) ... etc.\u201d \u201cThus,\u201d as Coomes contends, \u201cthe licensee\u2019s subjective intent or understanding that she was violating the law is made relevant by the statute itself,\u201d and even for \u201cparagraphs (a)(1), (6), (12) and (13) the subjective intent or knowledge of the licensee that she was committing an act that was in intentional disobedience to the law is a required finding to revoke the licensee\u2019s license.\u201d Again, Coomes provides no legal authority in support of this contention. Indeed, Coomes\u2019s efforts to highlight the inclusion of explicit intent requirements in some paragraphs of the statute (most of which are not relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>this case)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> merely demonstrates that, had the General Assembly wanted to include an intent requirement in the other provisions, it could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">IV. The Law of Double Jeopardy Does Not Apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Although Coomes can point to no administrative case in Maryland in which a court applied the law of double jeopardy to the revocation of a professional license,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Coomes avers that the Commissioner should have applied the law of double jeopardy to this case. Coomes argues, \u201c[i]f the Virginia Voluntary Surrender Agreement was an adverse administrative action (punishment)[,] Appellant cannot be punished twice for the same alleged offense.\u201d As the Commissioner notes, \u201c[a]ny action in Virginia related to asserted violation(s) of that state\u2019s insurance laws\u201d whereas \u201cthe violations at issue involve [Coomes\u2019s] failure to comply with Maryland insurance law required as a holder of a Maryland insurance license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Moreover, Coomes was never put in jeopardy of life or limb, and neither the loss of her Virginia license, and here, her Maryland license, was a \u201ccriminal\u201d punishment. In <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States provided some clarity on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no \u201cperson [shall] be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d We have long recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of all additional sanctions that could, \u201cin common parlance,\u201d be described as punishment. <em>[United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 549, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943)] ...

The Circuit Court Did Not Err in Denying Coomes\u2019s Motion for Leave to Offer Additional Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The final question we must answer is whether the circuit court erred when it denied Coomes\u2019s motion for leave to offer additional evidence. The evidence Coomes sought to have entered was an affidavit from a former insurance producer who testified that she was allowed to surrender her license and wait five years to reapply for licensure. She also described her impression of whether her voluntary surrender was treated as an \u201cadverse administrative action.\u201d The circuit court found that even \u201cassumfing] there are good reasons for failure to ... offer the evidence in the proceeding below .... the evidence ... is not material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Subsection 10-222(f) of the State Government Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">(1) Judicial review of disputed issues of fact shall be confined to the record for judicial review supplemented by additional evidence taken pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">(2) The court <em>may order </em>the presiding officer to take additional evidence on terms that the court considers proper if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">(i) before the hearing date in court, a party applies for leave to offer additional evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">(ii) the court is satisfied that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">1. <em>the evidence is material; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">2. there were good reasons for the failure to offer the evidence in the proceeding before the presiding officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">S.G. \u00a7 10-222 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">The statute clearly leaves within the discretion of the trial judge the decision whether to order the presiding officer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>take additional evidence that was not offered in the proceedings below. The statute provides that the court <em>\u201cmay </em>order the presiding officer to take additional evidence,\u201d and only when certain conditions are met. S.G. \u00a7 10\u2014222(f)(2)(ii). Those conditions are that \u201cthe evidence is material\u201d and \u201cthere were good reasons for the failure to offer the evidence in the proceeding before the presiding officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circuit court announced its reasoning for denying the request\u2014that the court was not satisfied that the evidence was material. Under these circumstances, we do not find that the trial judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">For all of these reasons, we hold that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissioner\u2019s findings that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(l), (6), (12), (13) and (f). We further hold that Coomes failed to demonstrate that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was premised on an erroneous conclusion of law. We, therefore, affirm the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Did the Hearing Officer violate petitioner\u2019s procedural rights and thus commit reversible error when she granted the Agency's Motion for Summary Disposition and summarily affirmed the Agency\u2019s Amended Order summarily revoking Petitioner\u2019s Maryland producer license, finding that Petitioner had committed fraud or other dishonest conduct, where the Commissioner made that finding without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Petitioner had the requisite intent to commit the fraud or dishonest conduct alleged by the Administration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">3.

The Commissioner issued the original order on November 25, 2013, which revoked Coomes\u2019s license and assessed an administrative penalty of $500.00. In the original order, the Commissioner found that Coomes violated I.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-126(a)(13) and 10\u2014126(f). The June 30, 2014 Order added I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(l), (6) and (12).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">. One subpart of I.A. \u00a7 10-126 that the Commissioner relied on in revoking Coomes\u2019s license includes a specific intent requirement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10\u2014126(a)(1) (giving the Commissioner authority to revoke a license if the licensee \"has <em>willfully </em>violated this article ..It was established in the record, through Coomes's own testimony, that Coomes willfully withheld money owed to Anthem even after she was aware of the error, in direct violation of \u00a7 10-126(a)(12). There is substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissioner's finding of Coomes\u2019s violation of \u00a7 10-126(1) based on the facts supporting her violation of \u00a7 10-126(a)(12)(giving the Commissioner authority to revoke a license if the licensee \"has failed or refused to pay over on demand money that belongs to an insurer ... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">. Based upon our review of Maryland caselaw, we were not able to find a single case in which a petitioner was able to demonstrate that his or her professional license suspension or revocation constituted a \"criminal punishment\u201d such that the law of Double Jeopardy applied to shield the proponent from subsequent proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">. On a related note, Coomes's contention that \"the Commissioner lacked jurisdiction because the violations charged in sections 10-126(a)(1), (6) and (12) did not occur in Maryland\u201d is without merit. Again, Coomes provides no legal authority for this contention. Pursuant to I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a), \"[t]he Commissioner may ... revoke, or refuse to renew or reinstate a license after notice and opportunity for hearing under \u00a7 2-210 through 2-214 of [the Insurance Article] if the ... holder of the license\u201d violates any of the provisions listed under I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a)(l)-(23). I.A. \u00a7 10-126(a). Additionally, I.A. \u00a7 10-126(c) provides that \"[ijnstead of or in addition to ... revoking the license, the Commissioner may impose on the holder of the license a penalty of not less than $100 but not exceeding $500 for each violation of this article.\u201d I.A. \u00a7 10\u2014126(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b335-15\">.
