Patchen, 164 Pa. 51; Cooper\u2019s Est., 206 Pa. 628; Scott\u2019s Est., 37 Pa. Superior Ct. 198. There is no positive direction to sell in the will under consideration. A power only is given to the executors to be exercised at their discretion. Nor can it be successfully contended that an absolute necessity to sell is apparent from the terms of the will. If the testator\u2019s daughter had left issue over the age of twenty-one years the provisions of the will would have been fully executed without any necessity for the sale of the real estate, and certainly the occurrence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>this contingency could not have been in the testator\u2019s mind as a fact inducing him to contemplate a conversion in any event. If the will provided a scheme of distribution which necessarily involved the sale of the real estate, there would be force in the appellant\u2019s argument. Vanuxem\u2019s Est., 212 Pa. 315, would be an authority in support of it. But it is only because a conversion of real estate into money without any conditions or contingencies was necessary to carry out the provisions of the will that the conclusion was reached in that case. The court held that the testator must have foreseen the necessity for the sale of his real estate to carry out his scheme in dividing his estate by bestowing the pecuniary legacies. But here the legacies might never become payable, in which case there need be no sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Lands subject to a power of sale pass to the devisee until the power is exercised, pending which exercise the devisee is entitled to the rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The conclusion of the orphans\u2019 court is in harmony with the adjudicated cases and the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
