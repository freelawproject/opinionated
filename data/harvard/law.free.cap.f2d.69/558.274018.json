Woodward.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">The alleged invention relates to improvements in an \u201cinterpolating receiving system,\u201d which restores or interpolates attenuated short signal impulses.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">The issues involved are such that a more detailed explanation of the invention is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">There is but one count (count 3) involved in the interference. It reads: \u201c3. In a telegraph system as set forth in claim 8, said distributor being arranged to actuate the receiving magnets during substantially 50% of a unit signal impulse period while permitting the transmission of impulses to the printer magnets for any desired <em>percentage </em>of the unit signal impulse period up to 100%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">Count 3 was originally count 1, the only count involved in interference No. 58,662, declared July 31, 3929, between appellant\u2019s application, serial No. 362,783, filed May 13, 1929, referred to in the record as appellant\u2019s \u201cCase B,\u201d and appellee\u2019s patent, No. 1,699,-438, issued January 15, 192-9, on an application filed May 10, 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-19\">Appellee, in his preliminary statement, alleged conception of the invention \u201cin March, 1927.\u201d He stated that he did not reduce the invention to practice prior to the filing* of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-20\">In his preliminary statement, appellant claimed conception of the invention on December 27, 1926, and reduction to practice on. or about January 26, 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-21\">In view of the fact that there were pending in the Patent Office two other interferences, Nos. 58,661 and 58,663, between an application of appellant, serial No. 253,239, filed February 10, 1928, referred to in the record as appellant\u2019s \u201cCase A,\u201d and appel-lee\u2019s patent, hereinbefore referred to, the Examiner of Interferences, on February 1,1930, consolidated interferences Nos. 58,662 and 58,663 with interference No. 58,661. The consolidated interference, No. 58,661, involved two applications of appellant, and ap-pellee\u2019s patent. All told, there were fifteen counts inyolved, Nos. 3 to 15, inclusive. The subject-matter of count 3, which was originally count 1 of interference No. 58,662, was not claimed in appellant\u2019s first application, \u201cCase A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-22\">Appellant submitted evidence relative to his conception and reduction to practice, and relied upon substantially the same evidence in support of his claim of priority of invention of the subject-matter defined in each of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-23\">Appellee submitted no evidence, but relied upon his filing date for conception and reduction of the invention to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-24\">Appellant\u2019s first application, serial No. 253,239, filed February 10, 1928, \u201cCase A,\u201d was pending at the time the patent to appel-lee issued; whereas appellant\u2019s second application, No. 362,781, filed May 13, 1929, \u201cCase B,\u201d was filed approximately four months subsequent to the issuance of appel-lee\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-25\">So far as count 3 was concerned, appellant had the burden of establishing priority of invention beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-26\">The tribunals below concurred in holding* that appellant was entitled to an award of priority as to the subject-matter of all of the counts, except count 3 claimed only in appellant\u2019s later application \u201cCase B.\u201d As to that count it was held that, although appellant was the first to conceive and the first to reduce the invention to practice, ha had suppressed and concealed it, and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>was not entitled to an award of priority. Accordingly, priority of invention was awarded to .appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"A7Df\">In view of the fact that the evidence in-trodueed 'by appellant was directed to the subject-matter of each of the counts involved in the consolidated interference, No. 58,661, we think the issues as to count 3 may be somewhat clarified by quoting from the decision of the Examiner of Interferences relative to the other counts involved, although the question of priority of those counts is not before us for determination. With reference thereto, we quote from the Examiner\u2019s deei-gj</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arn-dedup-1\">i ttt i In view of the fact that the party W ood- , , \u2022 t.. , \u2022 j, - ... , / \u2022 . ward has m his brief admitted and in fact urged that the invention in issue was eon-bodied in a complete apparatus and operated on January 26, 1927, by the party Knoop, it is deemed unnecessary to here consider- in detail the testimony of these corroborating witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5kF\">\u201cIt is however urged by the party Woodward that although Knoop had conceived the invention, constructed a device embodying said invention, and successfully operated it by January 26, 1927, he has taken no steps to bring the device to the notice of the pub-lie until after the issuance of the patent to Woodward. It is therefore urged that Knoop has suppressed and concealed the invention and is not entitled to an award of priority under the doctrine of Mason v. Hepburn, 1898 C. D. 510, and Hambuechen v. Schorger, 1926 C. D. 204 [56 App. D. C. 141, <em>10 </em>F. (2d) 10061].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANO4\">F , . ,. ...

Knoop s position with respect to his ease A will he considered first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APP\">\u201cIt is to be noted that from the date of the early test by Knoop, on January 26, 1927, until the filing date of his case A, February 10, 1928, there is a lapse of a period slightly over one year. <em>With respect to the activity by the party Knoop during this period, it is to be noted that his Exhibits 1 amd 2 present documentary evidence of prac-tieally continued activity relative to the invention in issue, as represented by the counts found in case A, with various changes thereof </em>and <em>improvements thereon throughout the entire period. </em>Knoop testifies in considerable detail as to his continuous activity as recorded in these Exhibits 1 and 2. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6SI\">\u201cThis testimony on behalf of the party Knoop clearly establishes that there was no suppression or concealment of the invention as disclosed in Knoop\u2019s cas\u00ae A. On the eon<em>trary, </em>it shows that the invention was not only conceived and reduced to practice but it was continually and repeatedly tested for a considerable period of time to determine its possibilities, up until the time the applieati-011 f\u00b0r patent (case A) was filed. It further shows^ that the Knoop application (case -A-) was being prepared prior to the date the Woodward patent issued.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuIm\">_ , , Relative to count 3 and the issues relat-big thereto, the Examiner of Interferences, ,, ,, . . <em>3 </em>among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A52s\">\u00abAs before stated&gt; g^g B was not filed until after the patent to Woodward had issued; it being ffled approximately four thereafter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abl-dedup-0\"><em>\u201cThat the invention of this count was conceived a/nd reduced to practice ^ by the P^rty Knoop on January 26, 1927, it is not disputed by Woodward. </em>It is,^ however, to n\u00b0ted that the Knoop application (case B) embodying this, particular embodiment of the generic invention made on January 26, ^927, was not filed until approximately one year <em>&amp;n&amp; </em>three months after the filing of Kmiop\u2019s application (ease A) which is based on a <em>subsequent development </em>of Knoop s in''renfi\u00b0rL which was ipade during March of 1937- <em>Jt \u00fc furthermore to be noted that all the experiments on the general subject matter here m issue ceased about January of 1929 (Record, p: 39, Q. 25). </em>While in com- . . , \u201e L , . ,, , panion interference 57,318, involving the pat- ^ , , Tt- &gt; ,. ,. <em>, </em>eat to Foster and Knoop\u2019s application (case . N . f , K.1 \u201e ,, v , A), it was shown on behalf of the party <em>\u201e \u2019 </em>,, . .. . A . Knoop that the said case A was filed during , .. . <em>b </em>*;be time tests were being made on the \u00ednvention there involved and that the said case A was j:n proeess of preparation by the Patent Department of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., prior to the issuance of the Foster Patent, <em>there has been no evidence whatever that there were any experiments being conducted by the party Knoop when his application case B was filed or turned over to the Patent Department. </em>In fact, Knoop\u2019s evidence clearly shows experiments had entirely ceased prior to the time his case B was filed. There is likewise no evidenee that the Knoop case B was being prepared by the Patent Department of said Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. prior to the date that the Woodward patent issued. <em>The fact that the Knoop case B which discloses Knoop\u2019s earliest embodiment of the broad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>invention here in issue was filed over a year subsequent to the date on which his case A hiere in issue teas filed, whvi.ch, case A is based upon a later development of the broad invention here in issue, indicates that it uias the intention of Knoop to patent only the embodiment of his invention as illustrated in his case A until he was aware, that Woodward was claiming the particular feature of the invention now disclosed only in case B as illustrated by count 3. </em>(With the exception of the words \u2018subsequent development\u2019 and \u2018subsequent.\u2019)\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In his decision denying appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing, the Examiner of Interferences stated that count 3 was \u201cfound only-in Knoop\u2019s Case B,\u201d and that, \u201cApparently Case A has never been offered as a basis for count 3 nor was notice ever given under rule 154 (e) that Knoop Case A was to be relied upon to support said count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Board of Appeals was of opinion tlwt the question of priority of the subject-matter of count 3 was not before it for determination, and, therefore, dismissed appellant Knoop\u2019s appeal as to that count. We quote from the decision of the board: \u201cThe party Knoop has not raised any question as to the correctness of the examiner\u2019s ruling that he is not entitled to receive a patent based on the later filed application. The only matter urged before us by this partv is his right to an award of priority a.s to the subject matter of count 3 based upon the evidence and the first application. This matter has never been decided by the Examiner of Interferences and if it was not before him it is therefore not before us for consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Thereafter, appellant filed a petition with the Commissioner of Patents requesting that the. Commissioner exercise his supervisory authority and remand the interference, so far as count 3 was concerned, to the Examiner of Interferences with instructions to render a decision in accordance with the evidence in the case, or, in the alternative, that the Board of Appeals he instructed to render a decision on the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The Commissioner of Patents held that it was the duty of the Board of Appeals to consider the question of priority on its merits, and either affirm or reverse the decision of the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Thereafter, on February 29, 1932, the Board of Appeals rendered a decision modifying its original decision. It held that the Examiner of Interferences was right in holding that appellant was not entitled to rely on his first application, \u201cCase A,\u201d in support of count 3; that appellant had suppressed and concealed the invention defined by that count; and that, therefore, appellee was entitled to an award of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\"> At the time of the oral argument, in this court, counsel for appellee, in open court, conceded that the invention defined in count 3 was disclosed in appellant\u2019s first appliealion, serial No.'253,2-39, filed February 10, 1928, appellant\u2019s \u201cCase A.\u201d It is not claimed by counsel for appellee that appellant was not the first to conceive and the first to reduce the invention to practice. It is contended, however, that appellant deliberately discarded it in favor of the later invention, referred to in the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, which, it is claimed, appellant considered of more value; that he concealed and suppressed the involved invention; and that he was prompted to file his application for a patent solely because of the issuance of a patent for the invention to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">It appears from the evidence of record, as held by the Examiner of Interferences, that appellant was actively engaged from the time he reduced the involved invention to pr*act,ice, in January or February, 1927, to about January, 1929, in making changes and improvements in the general subject-matter involved in the interference, and that the application here involved was filed approximately three and one-half months after such activities were discontinued, about one year and three months after the filing of his first application, \u201cCase A,\u201d for a patent \u201con a subsequent development of Knoop\u2019s invention which was made during March of 1927,\u201d and about, four months after appellee\u2019s patent issued. Those findings are clearly sustained by the, evidence. It was upon those facts that the tribunals below concluded that appellant abandoned., suppressed, and concealed the involved invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Although in interference cases the, first inventor may, by concealing and suppressing his invention, be estopped \u201cfrom claiming to be, in the eyes of the law, the first inventor,\u201d and although long, unreasonable, and unexplained delay may warrant the application of a doctrine akin to estoppel, such concealment and suppression will not be inferred because of mere failure to file promptly an application for a patent. Rudolf Wietzel v. Burrit Samuel Lacy, 39 F.(2d) 672, 17 C. C. P. A. 943; Hathaway v. Field, 48 App. D. C. 369; Donald A. Miller v. Eber J. Hayman, 46 F.(2d) 188, 18 C. C. P. A. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">In view of the fact that it is conceded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and properly so we think, that the invention defined in the involved count was disclosed by appellant in his application first filed, \u201cCase A,\u201d it is obvious that there was no intention on the part of appellant to conceal or suppress that invention. Why it was not claimed in the first application does not appear from the record, nor is it a matter of any great concern here. It might have been claimed in a divisional application. The fact that it was not, and that appellant chose to file a new application therefor, does not warrant a finding that he abandoned, concealed, and suppressed the invention. Nor do we find any other evidence of record to sustain such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We are of opinion, therefore, that as appellant is the first inventor, he is entitled to an award of priority, and such will be our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">GARRETT, Associate Judge, did not participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
