S. v. Williams, 278 U. S. 255, 49 S. Ct. 97, 98, 73 L. Ed. 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">While that case sought final payment of a certificate and not a loan thereon, the Supreme Court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cUnder the provisions of the act, and in the light of the section just quoted, we are of opinion that exclusive authority is vested in the Director of the Bureau to entertain and pass upon all claims for payment of these certificates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cIt is evident that, when a certificate is presented to the Director by one claiming to be the beneficiary, that officer must, as a necessary prerequisite to the payment, ascertain and determine that the veteran is dead, that the person claiming payment is in fact the beneficiary, and any other matter of fact or law which may affect the right of the claimant in any given case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201cWe may assume that the Director performed that duty here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">\u201cThe record does not disclose the basis for his action; but, whatever it may have been, his decision is final, at least unless it be wholly without evidential support or wholly dependent upon a question of law or clearly arbitrary or capricious. Silberschein v. U. S., 266 U. S. 221, 225, 45 S. Ct. 69, 69 L. Ed. 256.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>property of the corporation now in the hands of the receiver appointed by the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Without deciding what justification this decision, and section 310 of the statute as amended, furnish the Administrator for the making of the first loan, consideration of those statements together with the loan section of the statute, and the law and practice governing the writ of mandamus, convinces us that the petitioner is not entitled to\u25a0 that writ to require the making of a second loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Por the loan section does not direct, but merely authorizes, the Administrator to make loans in eases where prior to the amendment the banks were authorized to make loans, and it is scarcely conceivable that the loosest of our loose banks would make such a duplicate loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">And the writ of mandamus is always an extraordinary remedy, resting in the grace and discretion of the court, when the act demanded to be done is ministerial by nature, and the obligation to do it is clear, peremptory, and indisputable.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">Before the writ may issue the law must not only authorize, but require, the act to be done as demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">We are, of course, not called upon to consider the possibility of another conclusion in some other proceeding based upon the same certificate, but are of opinion that the petitioner makes out no sufficient case here for a mandamus requiring the respondent to make him a further loan, and the judgment denying it is therefore affirmed.
