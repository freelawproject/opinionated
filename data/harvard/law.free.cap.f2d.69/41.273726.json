Kennedy, Jr., J. Lester Fieman, and Frederick S. Robinson are respectively chairmen, and such fees and disbursements of their respective counsel, including counsel for the Manufacturers\u2019 Trust Company, in such amounts as the court may fix or approve,\u201d eliminated from such offer and with modification of the terms of the agreement, if any, which the bankrupt may propose. The other appellants have been awarded compensation for services and expenses by the referee under a stipulation contained in the composition proposed, reading: \u201cThe Company agrees to pay all expenses of administration and of the composition, together with such compensation and expenses\u201d of the three bondholders\u2019 committees \u201cand such fees and disbursements of their respective counsel including counsel for the Manufacturers\u2019 Trust Company, in such amounts as the Court may fix or approve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The court held that, since the composition allowances, by the referee in bankruptcy, to such committees and their counsel, including the attorneys for the Manufacturers\u2019 Trust Company, trustee under an indenture, could not be approved, the remainder of the composition could not be confirmed, at least without the approval thereof by the creditors. The court stated: \u201cSo far as appears in this matter, what was done was done in the open and there was no concealment, and from a careful examination of the offer, and knowledge of the losses which would be attendant upon a liquidation of the very large quantity of the assets of the bankrupt, consisting of first and second mortgages, from a financial standpoint, it seems to me that the offer is in the best interest of the creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On November 8,1933, the composition offer was accepted by a majority in number of all creditors whose claims have been allowed and this constituted a majority in amount of such claims. Holders of about $70,000 of bonds voted against the offer. The indebtedness of the corporation was $12,800,206-, of which all but $3,500 was based on bonds held by over 3,0-00-bondholders. A sufficient deposit was made with the clerk of the court as required by section 12 of the act (11 USCA \u00a7 30). A full hearing was granted to objecting creditors. A group of creditors filed specifications of objections. The composition agreement leaves the fixing of costs, expenses, and counsel fees to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The referee in bankruptcy after full hearing recommended the allowance of about $75,-000 to the committees above referred to and their counsel, and, as stated, this the court declined to confirm. The record does not disclose that there were three kinds of bonds or the need for three committees of bondholders nor does it appear that the bondholders\u2019 committees were helpful in assisting the receiver in collecting assets \u00f3r managing the estate or that the receiver in any way contracted for their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The Bankruptcy Act carefully regulates the compensation and expenses which may he allowed in bankruptcy. Section 62 (11 US CA \u00a7 102.) allows actual and necessary expenses of officers when reported under oatb and approved by the court. Section 64b (11 USCA \u00a7 104 (b) gives priority to- actual and necessary cost of preserving the estate and to cost of administration including one reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for petitioning creditors and for the bankrupt in a limited class of eases. Matter of Evenod Perfumer, Inc., 67 F.(2d) 878 (C. C. A. 2). No provision is made in bankruptcy for payment of compensation or expenses to creditors or creditors\u2019 committees or their counsel in instances of ordinary bankruptcy administration. In composition formerly even creditors who defeated a composition were not allowed expenses. In re Kinnane\u2019s Co. Estate, 242 F. 769 (C. C. A. 6). But section 64b was amended in 1926-, by adding two new subdivisions. Subdivision (4), 11 USCA \u00a7 104 (b) (4), allows reasonable expenses, in the court\u2019s discretion, to creditors successfully opposing a composition. Compare Remington on Bankruptcy, \u00a7 3138, and Colin, \u201c1926 Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act,\u201d 26 Columbia Law Review, 788, 803. Section 72 (11 USCA \u00a7 112) provides that neither referee, receiver, marshal, nor trustee shall be allowed, in any form or guise, any compensation other than prescribed in the act. There is no provision for compensation to creditors-or attorneys favoring a composition found in the Bankruptcy Act or Supreme Court General Orders. There is a provision, section 77 (c) (8), 11 USCA \u00a7 205 (c) (8), applicable to interstate railroads, providing that the court may, within a maximum fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, allow reasonable compensation for services rendered by creditors\u2019 committees and their attorneys. But section 74 (11 USCA \u00a7 202) applicable to persons other than corporations, contains a provision, section 74 (g) (4), 11 USCA \u00a7 202 (g) (4) similar to the general provision, section 12d (3), 11 USCA 30(d) (3). Nothing in the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ments, \u00a7\u00a7 74, 77 (11 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 202, 205) suggests authority to allow such compensation under the generally applicable provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"> The general policy of the act denies compensation unless expressly provided. Nisonoff v. Irving Trust Co., 68 F.(2d) 32 (C. C. A. 2). This, together with the absence of any provision for compensation to creditors supporting a composition, and strong inference against them to be drawn from section 64b (4), 11 USCA \u00a7 104 (b) (4), granting expenses to creditors opposing composition, requires a denial of compensation unless under the act and the decisions of the courts composition is different from ordinary administration in bankruptcy and a different policy should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Compositions and their affirmances are regulated completely by section 12 of the act. Section 12b, 11 USCA \u00a7 30 (b), requires the consideration to be paid the creditors and the money necessary to pay all debts which have priority and the cost of the proceedings to he deposited as the court shall require. It does not state what are these debts and costs. Generally such debts are taxes, and similar claims and costs are the statutory fees as in the ordinary administration. Remington, \u00a7\u00a7 3086, 3091, 3137, 3139. But there is no authority in the act supporting tho allowance made here as prior debts or costs within section 12b, 11 USCA \u00a7 30 (b). While, in some respects, composition and ordinary bankruptcy administrations differ [Myers v. International Trust Co., 273 U. S. 380, 47 S. Ct. 372, 71 L. Ed. 692; Nassau Smelting Works v. Brightwood Co., 265 U. S. 269, 44 S. Ct. 506, 68 L. Ed. 1013; Cumberland Glass Co. v. De Witt, 237 U. S. 447, 35 S. Ct. 636, 59 L. Ed. 1042; Zavelo v. Reeves, 227 U. S. 625, 33 S. Ct. 305, 57 L. Ed. 676, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 664; In re Hollis Lumber Co., 55 F.(2d) 898 (C. C. A. 2); In re Mirsky &amp; Co., 32 F.(2d) 676 (C. C. A. 2); In re Batterman Co., 231 F. 699 (C. C. A. 2)], still composition is a settlement of the bankrupt with his creditors. Where there is an adjudication, the theory of composition is different from the ordinary administration where the bankrupt estate is distributed to creditors after payment of prior debts under section 64 of the act (11 USCA \u00a7 104). In composition there is distributed not the bankrupt\u2019s \u201cestate,\u201d but a fund required by section 12 consisting of the consideration for creditors and the money necessary to pay prior debts and costs. Nassau Smelting Works v. Bright-wood Co., 265 U. S. 239, 273, 44 S. Ct. 506, 68 L. Ed. 1013. The rights of each creditor are fixed by the terms of the debtor\u2019s offer subject only to its affirmance and the judge\u2019s order of distribution. In practice the amount of the fund is determined by the amount of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, but, instead of the assets of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, the fund may consist of cash or other property borrowed on the security of the estate or on tho credit of the bankrupt. Zavelo v. Reeves, 227 U. S. 625, 632, 33 S. Ct. 365, 57 L. Ed. 676, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 664. If the composition fails, the fund is returned. In re Bryer, 287 F. 123 (C. C. A. 2). In the instant case, 85 per cent, of the consideration for creditors consisted of modified bonds of the bankrupt. There is nothing in the theory of a composition, which must be confirmed under section 12, which would take it out of the general policy of the act, either as to counsel fees or compensation of committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">General Order 41 of the Supreme Court (11 USCA \u00a7 53) provides that, before confirmation of the composition, the court shall require an affidavit that the bankrupt has not \u201cdirectly or indirectly paid or promised any consideration to any attorney, trustee, receiver, creditor, or other person in connection with tho proceedings except as set forth in such affidavit or in tho offer of composition or extension, and that he has no knowledge of any such payment or promise by any other parly,\u201d and indicates that the court shall be fully informed to\u2019 the end that there shall be equality of payment among creditors. The courts are solicitous to guard such equality. Bankruptcy Rule 11 of the Eastern District of Now York contains a similar provision. In order that all creditors may judge the merits of an offer without possibility of secret preferences, these rules require full disclosure of tho plan of composition, and from them we cannot infer authority to approve such allowances as were made here under the composition agreement proposed. The rules tell the procedure to be followed, and, where the court has authority to confirm compositions, it must do so in accordance with the rules of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Tho authorities do not support the appellant\u2019s claim for granting the allowances made here. A reasonable attorney\u2019s fee agreed to be paid by the bankrupt to his attorney may not be reduced by the court in some circumstances as where composition has been confirmed and no creditor objects to the fee and where it appears that it is not being paid out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. In re Hollis Lumber Co., 55 F. (2d) 898, 899 (C. C. A. 2). There we relied upon the analogy from the rule in ordinary bankruptcy administration where the courts refuse to undertake the task of fixing the charges for bankrupt\u2019s attorneys for services not in aid of the administration of the estate and not to be paid out of the estate. We said: \u201cIf the amount is too large, the court may require an amended offer to the extent that it is excessive, with the thought that the excessive amount be distributed to creditors.\u201d No creditor objected, the composition had been affirmed, and there was no apparent reason to interfere. In the case of In re Siegel, 256 F. 226 (C. C. A. 2), we determined that, if an offer including such an allowance is confirmed, the bankruptcy court loses jurisdiction and cannot thereafter disallow the compensation. But nothing said there justifies allowances such as are made here to committees and their counsel. To permit these allowances to be paid out of the composition fund or by the bankrupt would improperly favor some creditors and pro tan-to defeat the act\u2019s and the court\u2019s purpose of equality. In re Siegel (D. C.) 252 F. 197; In re M. &amp; H. Gordon (D. C.) 245 F. 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Finding no authority in the act to make an allowance to any of the committees or their counsel, who have appealed in the instant ease, the court was required to remit the composition for the further consideration of the creditors. If the composition was now approved, without the allowances, the creditors might well say that they were obliged to pay for their legal services for which the bankrupt had promised compensation and that thereby inequalities were practiced upon them. Moreover, the amount allowed, whether in the bankrupt\u2019s possession or to be taken out of its funds, might, well be used in increasing the cash offer. In re Hollis Lumber Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Were it within the court\u2019s power to eon-firm this composition, first striking out the allowances, these inequalities would prevail if such a course were followed. The sum of all the allowances, which must be disallowed, would be returned to the bankrupt if the composition as modified be approved. The court below properly remitted the proceeding to the referee in bankruptcy for further consideration by the creditors. The creditors will be advised that none of the allowances and expenses allowed by the referee to the respective appellants will be approved as lawful payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
