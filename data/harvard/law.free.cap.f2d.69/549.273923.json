Appellant, before the Patent Office, canceled all other elaiins of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">Said claim 5 reads as follows: \u201c5. That process of preserving juice of the citrus fruit which comprises the stops of expressing the fruit to obtain juice, adding to the juice thus obtained glycerine approximating one-eighth part of such juice, refrigerating the mixture of juice and glycerine for approximately twenty-four hours, adding approximately one-quarter part of sugar to the glycerine and juice and thoroughly mixing, and continuing the refrigeration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">The references cited are: Douglas et al., 228,881, June 15, 1889; \u201cNon-Intoxicants,\u201d by Nowak, published by C. A. Nowak, Chemical Building, St. Louis, Mo., 1922, page 61, \u201cGlycerine\u201d; \u201cCommercial Fruit &amp; Vegetable Products,\u201d by Cruess, published by Mc-Graw-Hill Book Co., New York, 1924, pp. 206, 214, 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">As will he observed from said claim, the alleged invention rebates to a method of preserving fruit juiees, and particularly the juice of citrus fruits. Appellant contends that the method described in the claim preserves the taste of the juice and prevents decomposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">The patent to Douglas relates to the preparation of lime juice and discloses a mixture, in proportions set forth in the specification, of sugar, glycerine, water, lime juice, and sulphuric acid. The specification states as follows: \u201cThe compound is useful for making lemonade, and for family and bar-room use, being designed to take the place of limes or lemons. It is agreeable to the taste, will not decompose with age, and is always ready for use. It is put up in bottles, of convenient size, and has the appearance of ordinary lime-juice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-21\">The pages from the publication by Cruess relate to the treatment of fruit juiees, including oranges, and among other things it is therein stated: \u201cPreservation by Low Temperatures. \u2014 When stored at 32\u00b0 F. (0\u00b0 C.), the temperature ordinarily employed in the eold storage of fruits, fruit juices either become moldy or undergo fermentation and in order to prevent the growth of micro-organisms it is necessary to use temperatures below 25\u00b0 F.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-22\">Appellant in his brief also quotes from, the Cruess publication, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-23\">\u201c * * * The Examiner overlooked the fact that where the methods of the prior art were used the fresh taste of the juice disappeared and its place was taken by a stale flavor. In the reference cited in the Patent Office, Cruess, the following is found under the heading \u2018Citrus Juices,\u2019 at page 282:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-25\">\u201cMany attempts have been made to produce orange juice, lemon juice, pomelo juice and lime juice commercially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-26\">\u201cIn no case, known to the writer, has a thoroughly satisfactory beverage been produced. The principal difficulty is found in the tendency of all of these juices to develop a disagreeable \u2018stale\u2019 or \u2018musty\u2019 flavor and odor and to lose their fresh fruit flavor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-27\">This portion of the Cruess publication, however, does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-28\">It was the view of both tribunals of the Patent Office that any worker in the art would be able to carry out the process of appellant from the teaching of Douglas et al., without resorting to any act of invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-29\">While the proportions of ingredients in appellant\u2019s process are not the same as those shown by Douglas, the Board of Appeals and the Examiner hold that such proportions were not shown to be critical or vital to the success of appellant\u2019s process.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>While Douglas shows a different order of mixing the ingredients, it does not appear that appellant\u2019s order of mixing produces any new and useful result. Douglas employs heat in mixing his compound, but to what extent is not disclosed, nor is it disclosed that heat is an essential element of his process. Douglas does not show refrigeration as a part of his process, hut it is obvious that, in view of the reference Cruess, the adding of refrigeration would not constitute invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">With respect to taste preservation, we agree with the statement of the Examiner that: \u201c * * * If as a matter of fact applicant\u2019s process does preserve the taste the same taste preserving properties would be inherent in the prior art methods whether or not they mention this specific phase of preservation. \u2666 <em>\u00bb # \u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">With respect to the statement in the Cruess publication relied upon by appellant that \u201cin no ease, known to the writer, has \u00e1 thoroughly satisfactory beverage been produced,\u201d which statement was made prior to appellant\u2019s alleged invention, we think it is sufficient to say that it does not appear that Cruess knew of the use of glycerine, as shown by Douglas, for glycerine is not mentioned in the Cruess publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Patent Office tribunals have concurred .in finding that the claim on appeal presents nothing of a patentable nature in view of the cited prior art, and we are not convinced that they are in error. In accordance with the well-established rule in such eases, the decision of the Board of Appeals, rejecting said claim, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, did not participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
