The Board held that the petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof that the Navigation Company bonds were held for investment. The petitioner complains that our opinion goes beyond an af-firmance of this finding'as to burden of proof and makes an affirmative finding of fact that the Navigation bonds were held for investment. Our discussion of this subject closed with the sentence: \u201cWe conclude, therefore, that the Navigation bonds were held by Union Pacific for investment; hence no loss can, be \u2018recognized\u2019 on the exchange.\u201d It was not our purpose to make any modification in the fact findings of the Board. Consequently our opinion will be modified by deleting the above-quoted sentence and substituting therefor the following: \u201cWe conclude, therefore, that the Board correctly held that the petitioner had not sustained the burden of proving that the Navigation bonds were not held by it for investment; hence no loss can be \u2018recognized\u2019 on the exchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-18\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
