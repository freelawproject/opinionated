The assessments were made upon income derived from contracts for the sale of real estate providing for payment of a part of the purchase price in cash and of the balance in installments. Petitioner during the taxable year involved was a member of a partnership which was engaged in the business of purchasing'tracts of unimproved land, subdividing the land, and selling it in small units. All the contracts here involved were on the same printed form, by the terms of which the vendor acknowledged receipt of an initial\u2019payment and-agreed to convey good title upon receipt of all deferred payments, which were evidenced by the purchaser\u2019s notes. The purchaser on his part agreed to purchase the property at the price and on the terms stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-23\">The Revenue Act of 1921, under which the assessments were made, provides in section 20-2 (a),that the basis for ascertaining the gain derived from the \u201csale or other disposition\u201d of real property shall be the cost thereof; and in subdivision (f) of the same section, that \u201cnothing in this section shall be construed to prevent (in the ease of property sold under contract providing for payment in installments) the taxation of that portion of any installment payment representing gain or profit in the year in which such payment is received.\u201d 42 Stat. 2-29, 231. With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner was authorized to make all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the provisions of the act. 42 Stat. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-24\">The Revenue Act of 1926 contains similar provisions. 26 USCA \u00a7 932 (a) and (e). It further provides in section 212 (d) that in the case of a \u201csale or other casual disposition\u201d of real property by a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of it on the installment plan, if the initial payments do not exceed one-fourth of the purchase price, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>tho income therefrom in any taxable year may, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, be returned in that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the total profit realized or to be realized when the payments are completed bears to tho total contract price. Initial payments are defined to be such as are received during the taxable year in which thq sale or other disposition is made. 26 USCA \u00a7 953 (d). Section 212 (d) was made retroactive so as to include income tax returns for the taxable year in question. 26 USCA \u00a7 953 (a). The Commissioner prescribed regulations under each act providing for income tax returns on the installment basis where the initial payments did not exceed one-fourth of the purchase price, and under the later act on the deferred payment plan where the initial payments were in excess of one-fonrth of the purchase price. Regulations 62 and 69, arts. 44, 45, and 46. The petitioner himself for the taxable year in question made all his returns upon the installment plan; but, as appears from the deficiency assessments, the Commissioner adjusted the returns in accordance with the regulations, with the result that additional taxes were assessed on account of sales where the initial payments exceeded one-fourth of the contract price. On appeal to it the Board considered tho case as though the evidence failed to show that there were any transactions involving initial payments of more than one-fourth of the purchase price, or, if there were, how the Commissioner had treated them; and held that the petitioner, having made his returns on the installment basis, was estopped to resort to any other. The Board\u2019s erroneous view of the evidence as to the Commissioner\u2019s findings on the question whether a particular contract was on the installment or deferred payment plan is, as wo think, immaterial; for petitioner does not contend that tho assessments against him were not made in accordance with the Commissioner\u2019s regulations. Petitioner\u2019s contention at last is that he owed no income tax unless and until all payments provided for by a contract of sale\u2019had been made and a conveyance of the land had been executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">It is argued that under the Louisiana law there is no sale of land until passage of title. In Louisiana, as elsewhere, specific performance of a valid contract of sale may be enforced. Civ. Code, art. 2462. In Barfield v. Saunders, 116 La. 136, 40 So. 593, 595, it is said that: \u201cWhen a promise to sell has been accepted it has an effect analogous to a sale. Tho buyer acquires a real right and ho has claim upon the property.\u201d And in McCain v. Hicks, 150 La. 43, 90 So. 506, the court said: \u201cThe moment that a part of the purchase price, in addition to the earnest money, is paid, the promise to sell becomes merged into a contract of sale, and the privilege of withdrawing is at an end. The acceptance of the sale by payment of part of the purchase price perfects the contract, and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto become fixed under tho law applicable to sales.\u201d But if it be assumed that petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the Louisiana law is correct, effect must none the less be given to the federal income tax laws, which are designed to apply uniformly in all tlio states, irrespective of local laws. Weiss v. Wiener, 279 U. S. 333, 49 S. Ct. 337, 73 L. Ed. 720 ; Palmer v. Bender, 287 U. S. 551, 53 S. Ct. 225, 77 L. Ed. 489. Tlie Revenue Act under consideration speaks of income derived not only from the sale, but also from \u201cother disposition\u201d of real property, and applies to transactions where such property is sold under contracts providing for payment in installments. It therefore applies, in our opinion, to just such transactions as are involved in this case. Lucas v. North Texas Co., 281 U. S. 11, 50 S. Ct. 184, 74 L. Ed. 668, and Baird v. United States (C. C. A.) 66 E.(2d) 911, relied on by tho petitioner, are not in point. There was no question of installment sales in either of those cases; and in each it was held that the sale was not completed and the purchaser unconditionally bound during tho taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
