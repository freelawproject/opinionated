Goldsmith, a passenger in an airplane, died as the result of a crash of the plane in which he was riding. He had two life policies in the New York Life Insurance Company, one for $25,-000 and the other for $5,000, which provided double indemnity for accidental death, both being payable to the company as trustee for the benefit of the appellant, the insured\u2019s wife, in accordance with the terms of trust agreements entered into by the insured' and the company in December, 1925. The company admitted liability for the face of the policies, but denied liability under the double indemnity clause, and this suit was brought to require the company to pay itself, as trustee, double the face of the policies. The bill of complaint set up the policies, the death of the insured, the furnishing of due proofs of death, and the company\u2019s denial of liability for double indemnity. The company moved to dismiss for want of equity. Erom a decree dismissing the bill, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">The bill shows that, by the terms of the policies, double indemnity was not payable if the insured\u2019s death resulted \u201cfrom engaging, as a passenger or otherwise, in submarine or aeronautic operations.\u201d The court below was of the opinion that this language excluded from double indemnity eover\u00e1ge accidental death resulting from riding in an airplane as a passenger. The appellant contends that the accidental death of the insured was covered by the double indemnity elause. So far as we are advised, in no reported ease have the courts construed the identical language used in these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The appellant\u2019s contention is that at best it is doubtful whether it was intended,, by the language used, to exclude from double indemnity benefits the accidental death of a casual passenger traveling in an airplane engaged in transporting passengers for hire, and that, under the familiar rule that the language of a policy, if ambiguous, will be construed against the insurer, the company should be required to pay double indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">We shall review briefly some of the cases for the purpose of indicating what the attitude of the courts has been with reference to clauses limiting coverage in case of death resulting from airplane accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">Bew v. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co. (1921) 95 N. J. Law, 533, 112 A. 859, 14 A. L. R. 983. The policy excluded \u201cinjuries ' * * * sustained * * <em>&lt;f </em>while participating in or in consequence of having participated in aeronautics.\u201d The insured was a passenger in an airplane when killed. His death was held to be excluded from the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">Pittman et al. v. Lamar Life Ins. Co. (C. C. A. 5, 1927) 17 F.(2d) 370, certiorari denied 274 U. S. 750, 47 S. Ct. 764, 71 L. Ed. 1331. The policy excluded death \u201cwhile participating or as a result of participation in any submarine or aeronautic expedition or activity, either as a passenger or otherwise.\u201d The insured, who was the part owner of an airplane, was killed by the moving propeller blade as he passed near the front of the plane after landing. He had just returned from a flight during which his partner operated the plane. It was held that he was killed while \u201cparticipating in an aeronautic activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">Benefit Ass\u2019n of Railway Employees v. Hayden (1927) 175 Ark. 565, 299 S. W. 995, 57 A. L. R. 622. The policy excluded from coverage fatal injury \u201cwhile engaged in aeronautics or under-water navigation.\u201d The insured was killed while a passenger in an airplane. It was held that his death was covered by the policy; that the word \u201cengaged\u201d in its ordinary sense means something more than taking a trip as a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">Masonic Acc. Ins. Co. v. Jackson (1929) 200 Ind. 472, 164 N. E. 628, 61 A. L. R. 840. The policy excluded death \u201cwhile engaged in aviation or ballooning.\u201d The insured was killed while a passenger in an airplane. The court followed the Hayden Case and held that the insured\u2019s death while a passenger was covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Peters v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America (1929), 133 Misc. 780, 233 N. Y. S. 500. The policy excluded death \u201cfrom having been ' engaged in aviation or submarine operations or military or naval service in time of war.\u201d The insured was killed while a passenger in an airplane. The language was held to be ambiguous because it might mean aviation in time of war, and, further, because the words \u201cengaged in aviation\u201d convey \u201csomething more than occasional participation\u201d in aviation. Therefore the insured\u2019s death was held to be covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Gits v. New York Life Ins. Co. (C. C. A. 7, 1929) 32 F.(2d) 7, 9. The policy excluded from double indemnity death \u201cfrom engaging in submarine or aeronautic operations.\u201d The insured was a passenger in an airplane when killed. The court followed Masonic Acc. Ins. Co. v. Jackson, supra, saying [page 10 of 32 F. (2d) ] : \u201c * * * The intent and scope of the clause is ambiguous and involved in doubt. The ambiguity and doubt are emphasized by the facility with which the insurer could have included passengers within the exception, were it so intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Gibbs v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of United States (1931) 256 N. Y. 208, 176 N. E. 141. The policy excluded from double indemnity benefits death resulting from \u201cengaging as a passenger or otherwise in submarine or aeronautic expeditions.\u201d The insured was killed while a passenger in a common carrier airplane. It was contended that he was not engaged in an aeronautic expedition, and that his death called for double indemnity The court held that the policy, which was issued in 1924, must be construed in the light of conditions then prevailing, and that it was intended to exclude from double indemnity death from riding in an airplane as a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Head et al. v. New York Life Ins. Co. (C. C. A. 10, 1930) 43 F.(2d) 517. The policy excluded from double indemnity \u201cdeath * * * from participation as a passenger or otherwise in aviation or aeronautics.\u201d It was held that a passenger in an airplane flying in the air participates in aeronautics. The court discusses the difference in meaning of the words \u201cparticipate\u201d and \u201cengage\u201d and reaches the conclusion that the double indemnity clause of the policy did not cover the death of the insured while a passenger in the plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">First Nat. Bank of Chattanooga v. Pheonix Mut. Life Ins. Co. (C. C. A. 6, 1933) 62 F.(2d) 681. The policy excluded from double indemnity benefits death \u201cfrom participation in aeronautic * * * operations.\u201d The insured was president of an airplane company engaged in operating planes at Chattanooga, Tenn., and was actively engaged in managing its affairs. He had a permit to become a student aviator. In making a trip in one of his company\u2019s planes to Florida to visit his wife, accompanied by a pilot, the plane crashed, and he was killed. Although not acting as pilot on the trip, he was more than a passive participant in the venture. It was held that his beneficiary could not recover double indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">From the foregoing cases, at least two fairly definite conclusions can be drawn:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">(1) The words, \u201cparticipating as a passenger or otherwise in aeronautics or aviation,\u201d \u201cparticipating as a passenger or otherwise in aeronautic activity,\u201d or \u201cparticipating as a passenger or otherwise in aeronautic expeditions,\u201d cover a passenger in an airplane.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">(2) The words, \u201cengaged in aviation or aeronautics,\u201d \u201cengaged in aeronautic operations,\u201d \u201cengaged in aeronautic activity,\u201d or \u201cengaged in aeronautic expeditions,\u201d do not cover the ordinary passenger in an airplane.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">While both the word \u201cparticipate\u201d and the word \u201cengage\u201d mean, among other things, to take part in, it is held that \u201cengage\u201d is ordinarily understood to refer to an occupation or employment or continued activity, so that, in reading a policy which denied coverage to one engaged in aeronautics, it might properly he construed as not excluding a mere casual passenger in an airplane, but as referring to one who made aeronautics his vocation or took some active part in the operation of the plane. It cannot be denied, however, that one may temporarily engage in taking a short trip or in writing a letter or in casual conversation, so that the meaning or scope of the word \u201cengaged\u201d may be made entirely clear by its association with other words.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\"> The decision in the case of Gibbs v. Equitable Life Assur. Society of United States, supra, sustains the conclusion of the lower court in this case. The language in the policy there was \u201cengaging as a passenger or otherwise in submarine or aeronautic expeditions.\u201d Here it is, \u201cengaging, as a passenger or otherwise, in submarine or aeronautic operations.\u201d The policies in that case were written in 1924, and, while we are not advised as to when the policies with which we are concerned were written, we know it was prior to December, 1925. It is not conceivable that the court which decided the Gibbs Case would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>have held differently if the word \u201coperations\u201d had been substituted for- the word \u201cexpeditions.\u201d In fact, the word \u201coperation\u201d seems more descriptive of the flying of a plane in regular passenger service than the word \u201cexpedition.\u201d The court in the Gibbs Case was of the opinion that in the early stages of the operation of passenger planes, those who were engaged in such operations, as passengers or otherwise, were regarded as engaging in expeditions. Certainly if a passenger in a plane is taking part in aviation or aeronautics, as held in Head et al. v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra, or in an aeronautic expedition, as held in the Gibbs Case, he is also taking part in an aeronautic operation. The word \u201coperation\u201d is defined as \u201caction or activity.\u201d The operation of a plane is an aeronautic activity, and one who goes in it as a passenger is participating or engaging to some extent in that activity. Pittman et al. v. Lamar Life Ins. Co., supra. While without the words, \u201cas a passenger or otherwise,\u201d there would be room for doubt as to the meaning and scope of the expression, \u201cengaging in aeronautic operations,\u201d the addition of those words does away with any ambiguity and shows that the phrase, \u201cengaging as a passenger or otherwise in aeronautic operations,\u201d is intended to cover one who is temporarily occupied in being a passenger in a plane as well as one who takes an active part in the operation or makes aeronautics his business. We think no one can properly misunderstand what is meant. The double indemnity clause, in our opinion, excludes from coverage death resulting from engaging in a single trip in an airplane as a passenger. It will be noted that in Gits v. New York Life Ins. Co. (C. C. A. 7), supra, where the language was \u201cengaging in submarine or aeronautic operations,\u201d the court pointed out that \u201cthe ambiguity and doubt are emphasized by the facility with which the insurer could have included passengers within the exception, were it so intended.\u201d In the case before us, the insurer did include passengers within the exception. That the intent of the parties might have been better expressed is of no importance. It is ambiguity, and not awkwardness of language, which opens the door for construction. If the meaning of language is clear, there is no room for construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b304-5\">STONE, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">I am constrained to dissent from the able opinion of Judge SANBORN for the reasons hereinafter stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">If one were to say that a person was \u201cengaging * * * in * * * aeronautic operations,\u201d every one would understand that he was occupied with some phase of operation of airplanes. In ordinary parlance, \u201cengaging * * \u2022 in * * * aeronautic operations\u201d means activity in the field of aeronautics. Usually, \u201cengaging\u201d would convey the idea of continued or repeated action as opposed to a single instance of activity [First Nat. Bank v. Phoenix L. Ins. Co., 62 F.(2d) 681, 682 (C. C. A. 6); Head v. N. Y. Life Ins. Co., 43 F.(2d) 517 (C. C. A. 10); Gits v. N. Y. Life Ins. Co., 32 F.(2d) 7, 9 (C. C. A. 7); Peters v. Prudential Ins. Co., 133 Misc. 780, 233 N. Y. S. 500; Price v. Prudential Ins. Co., 98 Fla. 1044, 124 So. 817, 820; People v. Bright, 203 N. Y. 73, 96 N. E. 362, 364, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 771; White v. Sikes, 129 Ga. 508, 59 S. E. 228, 229, 121 Am. St. Rep. 228; State v. Roberson, 136 N. C. 587, 48 S. E. 595, 596; Guiltinan v. Met. L. Ins. Co., 69 Vt. 469, 38 A. 315], although it might refer to active participation ' in a single operation. Certain ly, a prime requisite of <em>\u201cengaging </em>in\u201d anything is a participation therein in some way and to some degree. Benham v. Am. Central L. Ins. Co., 140 Ark. 612, 617, 217 S. W. 462. A person who has no connection with aeronautics except to ride in- a plane as a passenger does not actively participate in the operation of that plane and has no connection with any other aeronautic operations. If he is \u201cengaged\u201d in anything, it is in riding in the plane. A railroad passenger is in no way engaged in. railroad operations in any usual sense of such words, and they would never carry that meaning in ordinary communication. But the policy in regard to this \u201cengaging\u201d states \u201cas passenger or otherwise\u201d; therefore, the final problem of construction is whether the additional words \u201cas passenger or otherwise\u201d would make it entire-' ly clear that \u201cengaging * * * in * * * aeronautic operations\u201d was intended to apply to a mere passenger who had no further connection with such operations than to ride in a plane. Obviously, the policy intended to exclude passengers engaging in aeronautic operations. Are all passengers so engaged, are any so engaged, or are only some so engaged? Appellant argues that all of the language of the policy provision is given full effect in accordance with its ordinary meaning if it be applied (as to passengers) to such as are occupied with airplane operations, whether they have anything to do with operation of the particular plane or not \u2014 such as executive officers of plane companies or others. The reason suggested by appellant why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the insurance company might wish to except this class of passengers from ordinary passengers is that such would probably make frequent use of airplanes while the ordinary person would rarely do so, and the insurer might be willing to take the risk of a very rare airplane trip when it would he unwilling to chance the frequent airplane traveler. It seems to me this argument is entirely plausible. It has been judicially recognized as such in Gits v. N. Y. Life Ins. Co., 32 F.(2d) 7, 9 (C. C. A. 7). The words used are, without any explanation, incapable of construction aciiording to the ordinary meaning of all of them. They must either be explained or some of them must he warped from ordinary meaning if significance is to be given to all. In such a situation the expression is ambiguous. When this situation is clarified by a showing that there is a sensible meaning relating to the risk which will give full effect to every word used, the insured is re-enforced in his position that such must be the meaning intended. I must conclude, from the above, that the judgment should be reversed and the case remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
