He executed in her favor two notes, each payable \u201cThirty days after demand,\u201d one for $17,700, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent., and one for $8,000, with interest at the rate of 6% per cent., and he deposited with her as collateral security certificates for 400 shares of corporation stock in the Torrenee-Marshall &amp; Co. In 1922, while the son and debtor was ill, he sold his stock in this company and requested the respondent to release the collateral, which she did, and no other security was substituted instead. No demand for payment was made and no part of the indebtedness was ever paid, nor did the debtor repudiate the notes. On April 20, 1923 decedent gave to the respondent a statement in his own handwriting which was in pencil but not subscribed by him. This memorandum purported to report the debtor\u2019s investment of the proceeds of the collateral sold with certain information requested- \u2014 his cash balance at the bank and other financial information which a creditor might naturally desire to have. The top margin of this sheet bore the caption \u201cWhere the Proceeds Went,\u201d and at the bottom, following the body of the report above indicated, was an addendum note which read, \u201cNow have no notes payable except to you &amp; ac. Broadway building.\u201d After the qualification as executor, the decedent\u2019s. former secretary, who likewise had been secretary for respondent, made up a statement from Mr. Wheeler\u2019s books and memoranda of the purported assets and liabilities of the estate. This statement which was used by the executor in the administration of the estate was dated October 31, 1923, and in the schedule of liabilities, under the caption \u201cNotes Payable,\u201d were carried the decedent\u2019s two notes for $17,700 and $8,000 respectively, as unpaid obligations of the estate. The debtor\u2019s estate was valued in excess of $200,000. Early in 1924 a claim for payment of the notes was presented to the executor, and allowance and payment were refused on the ground that the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. The respondent then, considering the notes to be worthless, charged them off and took deduction therefor in her income tax return for the year 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The Commissioner disallowed the deductions and asserted the existence of a deficiency in respondent\u2019s income tax for said year. Upon appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, the Commissioner\u2019s ruling was reversed. This petition to review that decision of the board was taken by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The sole question involved is whether the indebtedness represented by these notes should have been written off in 1923, the year in which the maker died, or in 1924 when claim for payment was rejected by the executor; tho collection of the notes coneed-edly being barred by the California statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Subdivision (7) of section 214 (a) of tho Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 253, 26 USCA \u00a7 955 (a) (7) provides that there shall be allowed as deductions \u201cdebts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year.\u201d The Board of Tax Appeals held that it is not the year during which a debt actually becomes worthless that marks the period for which it may be allowed as a deduction but the year during which the worthlessness of the debt is actually ascertained by the taxpayer seeking the deduction. It held that the respondent did not realize that her claim against her son\u2019s estate was actually worthless until it was rejected by tho executor in 1924, and that therefore the debt was deductible in that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The petitioner takes the position that, sinee the debt actually became worthless upon the death of the debtor in 1923, the respondent will be conclusively presumed to have ascertained that fact when it occurred, and that therefore the debt was deductible in 1923 only.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The Commissioner asserts that it is well settled.that a taxpayer will not be permitted to close his eyes to the obvious, carry worthless amounts on his books, and then deduct them in a year subsequent to that in which they actually became worthless. This statement assumes the bad faith of the taxpayer in carrying the bad debt. Such a contention finds no support in the findings in this case. The Board of Tax Appeals as a finding of fact determined that the taxpayer did iiot ascertain the worthlessness of the debt until the payment was refused by tho executor in 1924. This court is bound by the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals whore the evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. Phillips v. Comm\u2019r, 283 U. S. 589, 51 S. Ct. 608, 75 L. Ed. 1289; Redder v. Comm\u2019r (C. C. A.) 60 F.(2d) 866. And the duty of weighing evidence rests with the Board. Matern v. Comm\u2019r (C. C. A.) 61 F.(2d) 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\"> The law requires only that the debt bo written off in the taxable year in which its worthlessness is ascertained. Avery v. Comm\u2019r (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 6, 9, 55 A. L. R. 1277; Duffin v. Lucas (C. C. A.) 55 F.(2d) 786. \u201cAscertain\u201d means \u201cto learn with certainty about.\u201d Can it be said that this taxpayer knew with certainty in 1923 that this debt would not bo paid? True, it was barred by the California statute of limitations (sections 335, 337, Cal. Code of Civil Proc.) but the taxpayer had a memorandum written by tho son in 1923, acknowledging tho debt, which she believed to be a valid and binding extension of the statute of 'limitations. The executor carried the notes as existing obligations of the estate and until the rejection of the claim the taxpayer believed that tho notes would be paid. The estate was in excess of $200,000, and there would be nothing to prevent the heirs respecting decedent\u2019s evident intention to validate the notes and themselves making payment. Under these circumstances, she would not have been justified in writing off the claim as worthless in 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">In the Avery Case, supra, it was said: \u201cHonesty of belief in the taxpayer is not conclusive, nor binding on the board,\u201d but it rested tho establishment of the fact with the determination of the Board, and, continuing, the opinion said: \u201cIt is the province of the board to determine, on a review of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular debt sought to be deducted, whether the taxpayer knew or ought to have known its worthlessness in a year prior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Acting in accordance with the decisions and exercising its proper power, the Board of Tax Appeals has conclusively determined the fact against the contention of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Both petitioner and respondent cited the case of Duffin v. Lucas, Comm\u2019r (C. C. A.) 55 F.(2d) 786, 795, upon the point under discussion. The opinion in that case sustains the position of respondent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">\u201c * * * We can see no absolute duty on the taxpayer\u2019s part to ascertain worthlessness, at his peril, during this same year when the debt becomes uncollectible by law. We think there must be, in many cases, a reasonable discretion on the part of the taxpayer, even though he knows that he cannot collect by law at that time to treat it as not entirely worthless, relying upon the good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>faith and good intentions of the debtor and hoping for better results next year. There is difficulty in saying * * * that the mere lapse of time * * * raises the inference that the account became worthless at the end of the last year of that period. The statute may not have run on account of absence, minority, etc. There may have been a new promise. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u2019 In California Jurisprudence, vol. 11, p. 750, it is stated that: \u201cAnd though a claim is apparently barred, the judge, when it is presented for allowance, may from legal evidence determine that the maker was absent from the state for such length of time or that such other facts existed as to prevent the bar of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">See Kohn v. Rupley, 54 Cal. App. 565, 567, 202 P. 163, and Bancroft\u2019s Probate Practice, vol. 3, p. 1481, says: \u201cThe face of the claim is accordingly not conclusive. Whether or not the claim is actually barred is a question of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
