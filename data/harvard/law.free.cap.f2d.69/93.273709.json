Each'board is the judge of the weight to be given to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-20\">The father of the applicant, who should know, denied on two occasions that he was married: Once in 1908 on his return to this country from China, and again at the time of his registration under the Selective Draft Act, when he stated that he was single and mentioned only a father as a dependent. His explanation, which may not have satisfied the members of the boards, was that he did not at the time the questions were asked understand English very well; and that, when he denied on his return to this country in 1908 that he was married, he understood that he was asked if he was married in Mexico. While it appeared that he entered this country through Mexico, it did not appear that country was mentioned in connection with the question as to his marriage. He also at that time gave his name as Woo Chew, and stated he had \u201cno other name,\u201d indicating he was unmarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-21\">Other discrepancies appear in the testimony of the applicant and his witnesses, though of themselves 'of less importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-22\">We think it cannot be said that the hearings accorded the applicant were so manifestly unfair or that the finding of the boards that the applicant had failed to sustain the burden of proof that he was the son of a citizen of this country was so plainly the result of bias or prejudice as to justify a ruling by this court that the order of deportation was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-23\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
