Calhoun failed to enter into such a bond with surety, and in default thereof was committed to the WasMngton Asylum and Jail for six months, unless before that time he should give such bond and be discharged according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-18\">It may be noted again that the bond required of Calhoun in 1919 as part of the original judgment of the court was to be \u201cwithout surety,\u201d whereas the bond required by the order of 1933 for the payment of the arrears was to be \u201cwith surety.\u201d On April 5, 1933, while Calhoun was in the custody of the Washington Asylum and Jail under the fore-' going commitment, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, claiming, among other tMngs, that his detention was illegal upon the ground that the juvenile eourt had lost jurisdiction of the ease when the child reached the age of 14 years, and that the eourt was then without power to make the order for a bond with surety, or to issue the writ of commitment. The superintendent of the Washington Asylum and Jail filed an answer to the petition relying solely upon the commitment issued by the juvenile eourt. The case was heard by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and an order was entered sustaining the petition, and releasing Calhoun from the custody of the superintendent, whereupon the present appeal was taken. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-19\">We agree with the decision of the lower court. The juvenile court is a eourt of limited jurisdiction, and its powers are strictly prescribed by statute. Moreover, a proceeding in bastardy is of quasi criminal character, and the statutes controlling it should not be enlarged by construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">It is provided by the statute as \u2018 aforesaid that in ease of the failure of the accused to enter into the bond required by the eourt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>the court shall commit him to the Washington Asylum and Jail, there to remain until he shall give such bond, or pay the total amount of the sum adjudged against him. This is the only provision in the act authorizing the imprisonment of the accused by the juvenile court after judgment. The act does not authorize the court to commit the accused solely because of his failure to pay the sums adjudged against him. In this instance, moreover, the accused was not committed because of his failure to give bond without surety as required by the order which was entered by the court at the time when the case was heard and decided. But after the child had passed the age of 14 years, and at a time more than 14 years subsequent to the entry of the court\u2019s original order, the court passed the second order requiring the accused to give a bond with surety for the payment of the arrearage. It was because of the failure of tho accused to comply with this order that he was committed to his present imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">We are of the opinion that the juvenile court had fully exercised its jurisdiction in the ease by its first order, and that the second order, under the circumstances, was ultra vires and void. It amounted in effect to a requirement for a bond with surety for the payment of a past indebtedness, and the incarceration of the accused for failure to comply with such order amounted to imprisonment for debt. We therefore affirm the order of the lower court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
