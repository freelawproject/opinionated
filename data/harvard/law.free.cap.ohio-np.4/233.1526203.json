D. &amp; M. R. R. Co., 24 Ohio St., 83.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b240-8\">Gustav R. Werner, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AMZ\">Von Seggern, Phares <em>&amp; </em>Dewald, contr. a</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It is also true that in a proper case, the court may take from the jury the evidence given by the plaintiff and render judgment for the defendant, or may attain the same end by submitting the case to the jmy with instructions to return a verdict for the defendant. Kelly v. Howell, 41 Ohio St., 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The case of Greiwe v. The Consolidated Fire Works Co., 12 C. C. R., 20, was one where damages resulted from an explosion by fire-works. The court there held that in an action for damages for injury caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, the evidence, in order to submit the cause to the jury, must tend to show that the negligence complained of, actually brought about the injury,and the court should withdraw the case from the jury and order a verdict for the defendant when the proof as to the cause of the injury was mere speculation. If the evidence, however, is appropriate to the issue, although it may be slight and not sufficient in the opinion of the court to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, still the jury should be permitted to pass upon it and it would be wrong in the court to decide a non-suit \u201d This is the scintilla case as defined in Dik v. The Railroad Company, 38 Ohio St., 389</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The case below did not authorize a recovery because there is no evidence tending to show that the defendant was guilty of any actionable negligence. Indeed the record does not show any negligence whatever on the part of the defendant. There is no testimony that oil was thrown into the catch basin, nor does the testimony tend to show that the defendant knew that oil or gasoline or an inflammable substance was thrown into the vault. There is no testimony to disclose what caused the explosion ; in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover, there must be some evidence tending to support the issue, and that the negligence complained of, brought aoout the injury. If there is no evidence tending to show this fact, the court could properly withdraw the case from the jury. There is no prejudicial error in the record, and the judgment of the court in special term will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
