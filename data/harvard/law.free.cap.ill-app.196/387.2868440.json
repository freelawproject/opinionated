On a writ of error the Appellate Court can only consider the errors discussed by appellant in his brief, although he declares he relies on all the errors assigned, including some not so discussed, since an appellant must abide by the case made by his opening brief, and if no case is made thereby, the judgment reviewed will be affirmed.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
