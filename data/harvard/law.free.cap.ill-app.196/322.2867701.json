From a judgment for plaintiff for $5,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\" pgmap=\"371\">Plaintiff was at the time of the accident a married woman about thirty-five years old. There is no question that she fell upon the sidewalk striking her back and head and was rendered unconscious, and continued in bed for several weeks, and afterwards a fistula formed which was removed. Two operations are said to have been undergone since the accident, one for fistula and one for removal of the womb. It is not claimed by plaintiff that the conditions necessitating those operations are proven to be attributable to the shock and injury received from the accident, and it is said that any opinion on the subject is purely speculative, but that the severe shock and serious injury she received must have had as much or more to do with bringing about these conditions as anything else. Plaintiff said an operation for fistula was performed by Dr. Hanna September 19,1910, two years after the accident, and she said another operation was performed by Dr. Meloy in January, 1914. As to the operation of September 19, 1910, Dr. Hanna testified that on that date he operated upon appellee, removing her appendix, both Fallopian tubes, the right ovary, amputated the neck of the womb, fixed up a bad vaginal outlet, and opened a fistula in connection with the anus; that in his opinion the condition which made the operation necessary was due to infection of the tubes and could not be produced by an accidental injury. He also testified that a fall from a car would not tend to produce prolapsus of the womb. Two other physicians testified to the effect that the conditions making necessary these operations could not have resulted from the injury received at the time of the accident. The medical testimony seems to agree that the cause of the condition which made the operation of September 19, 1910, necessary was an infection, perhaps, though not necessarily, of gonorrheal origin.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\" pgmap=\"371(17) 372(93)\">The claim of each party was supported by clear and direct evidence, plaintiff\u2019s evidence making a clear case of due care on her part and of negligence on the part of defendant, and defendant\u2019s evidence making an equally clear case of due care on its part and of contributory negligence by plaintiff. There was evidence that after the accident plaintiff went to a hospital and received treatment there, and of a bill for the services of a physician which had been incurred by plaintiff, in connection with her injuries, to the amount of $200, but no competent evidence as to the amount paid for treatment at the hospital.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-9\" pgmap=\"372\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-10\" pgmap=\"372\">1.
