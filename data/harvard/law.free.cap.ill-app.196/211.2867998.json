That opinion, reversing and remanding the cause, was based upon the refusal of the court to give instruction No. 17, requested by appellant, which would have told the jury that, before the plaintiff could recover, she must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that misrepresentations relative to the land in question were made by the defendant, that such misrepresentations were false and known by the defendant to be false when made, that the plaintiff was deceived thereby, and that she had been injured because of them. This instruction was given upon the second trial, which also resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, below, followed by a judgment, from which the defendant below has taken this appeal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-6\" pgmap=\"260\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-7\" pgmap=\"260\">1.
