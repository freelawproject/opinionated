From a judgment for plaintiff for $1,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\" pgmap=\"90\">The alleged assault occurred on April 21,1911. Defendant introduced in evidence a paper purporting to be a general release under seal, executed by plaintiff for $36, on May 2, 1911, and also introduced a draft, of the same date, payable to the order of plaintiff for $36, which draft on its face recites: \u201cFor personal injuries received at Chicago, Illinois, on April 21, 1911.\u201d The alleged release recites that plaintiff released defendant from all. liability, for all claims for injuries, etc., plaintiff acknowledging therein full satisfaction.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-7\" pgmap=\"90\">The plaintiff contended that he was induced, by agents of the defendant, by trick or fraud, to sign said release under the belief that it was a receipt for money in payment of wages due him at the time of the happening of the injuries complained of. The plaintiff at the time of the said assault was in the employ of the defendant as a car cleaner.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-8\" pgmap=\"90(122) 91(89)\">The plaintiff testified that he could not read English; that the paper constituting the purported release was presented to him by two agents of the company at the hospital, but was not read to him before he signed it; that \u201cMr. Shaw (one of the defendant\u2019s agents) took a pencil and say \u2018Sign your name on the paper,\u2019 and I signed that, and he has a check for me and he gave me that check, and the two men put the paper in their pocket. He said that is a good thing, you get wages in pay for it, don\u2019t lose that. * * * The paper (the check) they gave me I kept it one day, and then * * * I gave it to my wife. * * * I do not know what a release is. * * * At the time I signed the release I thought it was for wages I had coming. * * * At the time I was injured I had twenty-one days coming, and I thought that the check that Emmick gave me was for that money. After while I got the money I had coming for the twenty-one days * * * .\u201d The plaintiff, in part, testified through an interpreter.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-4\" pgmap=\"91\">Within a few days following the execution by plaintiff of said release and before he cashed said draft, he admitted that he was informed by Dr. Schultze, of the hospital, that he had signed a release \u201cfor his injuries. \u2019 \u2019 He subsequently was paid by defendant the amount due him as wages for said twenty-one days. The check or draft given him May 2, 1911, when he signed such release, charged plaintiff with notice that it was given to and accepted by him in settlement of his claim. The draft is on a printed form with the following words legibly written on its face: \u201cFor personal injuries received at Chicago, April 21, 1911,\u201d and was not cashed until May 10, 1911. The proceeds of such draft were retained by him, and no offer was ever made by plaintiff to return, to the defendant, the money thus received.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\" pgmap=\"91\">It appeared that defendant\u2019s agent visited plaintiff at the hospital where plaintiff was taken after receiving the injuries sought to be recovered for, where the release was signed and the draft in question delivered. It did not appear that plaintiff was informed by the agent that the release was a receipt for money due plaintiff for wages.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-6\" pgmap=\"91\">M.
