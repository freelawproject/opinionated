Prom a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\" pgmap=\"461\">This is one of six suits brought by six railroads against the appellee, Woolner Distilling Company, for demurrage. Two of the suits have before reached this court, and are reported as Woolner Distilling Co. v. Peoria &amp; E. Ry. Co., 136 Ill. App. 479, and Chicago, P. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. v. Woolner Distilling Co., 160 Ill. App. 192. The present case, with four of the others, was referred to a referee by an order of court, to find and report, the facts, and with power to take evidence, which should be reported with conclusions of fact therefrom. The referee reported in accordance with the order, in part based on evidence heard and in part on an agreement of the parties, in which report was included a finding as follows: \u201cI further find from the evidence that the defendant detained cars on which plaintiff is entitled to claim demurrage as set out in \u2018Schedule A,\u2019 and made a part hereof, the total number of days\u2019 detention being 2,985 days.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\" pgmap=\"461\">\u201cI further find from the evidence that the total number of cars for the Woolner Distilling Company standing each day in the Kickapoo Tracks waiting unloading from March 30,1904, to March 23,1905, are as set out in \u2018 Schedule B \u2019 hereto attached and made a part of this report, the data for Schedule \u2018 B \u2019 being said \u2018Exhibit 39B.\u2019 \u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\" pgmap=\"461(53) 462(345)\">The court overruled exceptions to the report, and the cause was tried by jury, in which uncontroverted evidence was introduced by the plaintiff that there was a customary and usual charge for holding cars longer than \u201cfree time\u201d of one dollar a day excluding holidays and Sundays. Then the plaintiff offered the referee\u2019s report with the schedules made a part of it, as showing the amount of time of delay on each of the cars, and the number of days that the cars in question were detained by the defendant. The defendant objected on the ground that the report is a part of the pleadings in the case, and that the findings of the referee are not proof of the acts in the cas\u00e9. The court sustained the objection, stating as a reason: \u201cIt is conceded by both plaintiff and defendant in this case and statements in open court to the jury were made, both on behalf of the plaintiff as well as the defendant, that there would -be no dispute as to the time of shipment of the various cars carrying coal from Springfield and elsewhere to Wesley City or the City of Peoria the time of the arrival of the cars carrying coal either to Wesley City or Kickapoo Yards in the City- of Peoria, or the time the cars were, in fact, delivered to the defendant company at its plant at Peoria.\u201d Then plaintiff introduced in evidence a schedule that was part of the report and suggested that the heading of the page reading \u201cTime for which plaintiff is entitled to charge demurrage\u201d be eliminated, and defendant\u2019s counsel said they would not object and stated that they would agree that Exhibit 39B is a true history of the cars as disclosed by the books of the railroad company, and by the defendant\u2019s books. Then other schedules and parts of the report were offered separately by the plaintiff, and the court sustained objections to their introduction on the ground that it was not a matter for the jury to pass upon. The plaintiff introduced evidence of admissions by the manager of the defendant that there was something due the plaintiff for demurrage charges, and rested. The defendant then offered evidence tending to account for the delay in unloading cars, attributing such delay to the nonaction and misconduct of the plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\" pgmap=\"462\">The jury found for defendant and the court overruled a motion by plaintiff for a new trial.</p><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b463-7\" pgmap=\"463\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b463-8\" pgmap=\"463\">1.
