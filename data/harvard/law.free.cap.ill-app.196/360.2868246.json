DeWolfe, plaintiff, against Harlan W.- Pierce et al., defendants, in the Circuit Court of Stark county, to recover for personal injuries sustained by falling through a hole in the floor of defendants\u2019 store building. From a judgment for plaintiff for two hundred and fifty dollars, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-9\" pgmap=\"408\">It appeared that defendants were conducting a hardware store and tin shop in the City of Toulon in a building (or two adjoining buildings) having two entrances from the street. One entrance was to the general store room where smaller articles were kept. That room was kept heated and was the usual place for customers to enter. The other was to a room that defendants call a warehouse, but in which was kept for sale stoves and heavier articles. This room was not kept heated, and the entrance was by means of a sliding door. Back of this room was a tin shop where one of the brothers worked. There was a door from each of the rooms into this tin shop. Before the time in question defendant\u2019s customers, desiring to purchase some of the larger articles, or having business in the tin shop, sometimes used the doorway into the so-called warehouse.'</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\" pgmap=\"408(41) 409(89)\">A short time before the accident a drayman in unloading a stove had broken a hole in the floor just back of this sliding door, and defendants had placed a stove over the broken board so that customers entering in that way would not fall in the opening made. On the day of the accident the stove was removed and one of the defendants was engaged in repairing the floor. He had removed the stove and gone out of the room for a short time to get something needed in the repair, leaving the sliding door partly open, and while he was gone plaintiff, entering the store, stepped in the hole, receiving a quite serious injury. The defense was that plaintiff was a licensee on defendant\u2019s premises when injured.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-8\" pgmap=\"409\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-9\" pgmap=\"409\">1.
