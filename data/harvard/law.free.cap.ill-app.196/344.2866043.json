In an action where the finding made depended largely on the opportunity which the court and jury had of judging of the credibility of the witness, such finding will not be disturbed on review in the absence of substantial error of law found in the record.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b393-12\" pgmap=\"393\">3.

Although a question is leading and suggestive, the failure of the court to- exclude the question will not be deemed to be substantial error, where an examination of the testimony shows that defendant was not prejudiced by the ruling of the trial court in permitting the question to be answered.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b393-13\" pgmap=\"393(48) 394(54)\">4.

In a bill for separate maintenance, where defendant\u2019s pleadings did not charge complainant with adultery, and where defendant as a witness expressly disclaimed such charge, an instruction informing the jury of the evidence necessary to establish such charge and the effect of a con-donation of the offense, held proper where the attention of the jury was directed to the question whether complainant had been guilty of adultery by defendant\u2019s introduction of \u2022 evidence tending to show that he had grounds for being jealous of complainant</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\" pgmap=\"393\">The answer denied and explained the charges, and accused complainant of much wrongdoing.

Since in a separate maintenance proceeding the verdict of a jury is merely advisory, which the court may disregard and enter such decree as in his judgment equity demands, questions of errors of law, in rulings on evidence, and in instructions are of less importance than in a common law or divorce proceeding, where a jury trial is a matter of right.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
