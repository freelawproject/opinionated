It did not appear that he tendered to defendant a warranty deed or $250, nor that he had that sum ready to pay to her.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-8\" pgmap=\"234\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-9\" pgmap=\"234\">1. Contracts, \u00a7 339<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when action for breach of contract for exchange of realty not maintainable. An action cannot be maintained before time for plaintiff\u2019s performance to recover for the breach of a contract to exchange realty, where it does not appear that plaintiff offered or was ready to perform his part nor that he was excused from performance by the language and conduct of the other party acting personally or through an agent.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-10\" pgmap=\"234\">2.

In an action for the breach of a contract for the exchange of realty, brought before the time plaintiff was to have performed his part of the contract, where there was no proof of any tender or readiness of performance by plaintiff, the question whether performance by him had been excused by defendant\u2019s language or conduct is for the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-11\" pgmap=\"234\">3.

In an action to recover for the breach of a contract for the exchange of realty, where there is no proof from which the jury can estimate the excess in value, at the time of the breach, of the property which plaintiff was to receive over the property which he was to convey, it is error to authorize the jury, if they find for plaintiff, to assess such damages as they believe from the evidence plaintiff had sustained.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-5\" pgmap=\"234\">John Gr.
