Elliott, plaintiff, against Herman Haves, defendant, in the Circuit Court of Edwards county, to recover a broker\u2019s commission for bringing about a contract between defendant and one Naylor, whereby defendant traded his store building and stock of goods for sixty-five acres of land. From a judgment for plaintiff after trial by jury, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-9\" pgmap=\"653(179) 654(126)\">The proofs showed that defendant h^d a store at Browns, Hlinois, and that plaintiff was in the real estate business at Albion, Illinois. Sometime in February following, defendant went to Albion, where he met plaintiff, who testified that at that time defendant asked him to try to effect a trade with Naylor, who had visited the property with Elbert Epler. Plaintiff testified that Epler was induced by him to take Naylor to see the property. Defendant denied that he had the conversation with plaintiff at Albion, but it appeared that immediately after it is claimed to have taken place, plaintiff went with Naylor to an attorney\u2019s office and then went out and got defendant and Epler and returned with them to the office; that the terms of the trade were then agreed upon and the attorney instructed to draw up an agreement, which was done, and that while the contract was being drawn, an alteration was made in it for defendant\u2019s benefit at the suggestion of plaintiff and the contract was then signed. In regard to the contract between defendant and plaintiff concerning the agency for the sale of the land, there was some conflict in the testimony. Plaintiff testified that he contracted with defendant to act as his agent in selling the property and was to receive for his services a commission of two and a half per cent, of the selling or trading price. Defendant testified that his statement to plaintiff was \u201cthe party that brings me a deal gets a commission but I reserve the right to make the deal myself provided I can,\u201d and claimed to have made the deal himself. A witness, Lovellette, who was present at the time of the making of the oral contract between defendant and plaintiff, corroborated the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-5\" pgmap=\"654\">The court modified the following instructions by inserting the word \u201cmay\u201d instead of the word \u201cshould\u201d therein:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-6\" pgmap=\"654\">No. 1. \u201cThe jury are instructed that if, after considering all the evidence in the case together, you believe that the evidence is equally balanced on both sides, then you may find your verdict for the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-7\" pgmap=\"654\">No. 2. \u201cThe Court instructs the jury that if you believe from the evidence that Charles Naylor was not induced by the plaintiff to purchase or trade for the property in question by the efforts of the plaintiff, then the plaintiff is not entitled to his commission and you may find your verdict for the defendant.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-8\" pgmap=\"654\">No. 4. \u201cThe Court instructs the jury that unless you believe from a preponderance or greater weight of the evidence in this case that the plaintiff contracted with the defendant to procure a purchase or trade for the property in question, and while acting under said contract procured a purchaser or trader willing and able and ready to purchase or trade for said property, that you may find for the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-9\" pgmap=\"654(36) 655(83)\">No. 5. \u201cYou are further instructed that before the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this case he must prove by a preponderance or greater weight of the evidence that the defendant employed him to procure a purchase or trade for th,e property in question, and that the plaintiff in pursuance of said employment found a person and sent him to the defendant, and that said person either purchased or traded for said property, or was willing, ready and able to purchase or trade for said property according to the terms under which the plaintiff was employed to obtain, and unless you so believe from the greater weight of the evidence then you may find for the defendant.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b655-8\" pgmap=\"655\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b655-9\" pgmap=\"655\">1.
