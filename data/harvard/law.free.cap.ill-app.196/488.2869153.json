Appeal and error, \u00a7 126<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when appeal from decree sustaining will raises question of freehold. Adi appeal from a decree sustaining a will raises a question of freehold where the will devises real estate to the widow of testator which such widow could not have taken as heir at law, and makes other devises of real estate and annuities charged on real estate to persons not heirs at law, since if the will had been set aside all such interests in the real estate would have been defeated, and the real estate so devised would have in part passed to heirs at law who took nothing under the will.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b536-6\" pgmap=\"536\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Will county; the Hon.
