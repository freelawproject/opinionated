Evidence, \u00a7 476<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when number of witnesses may be considered in weighing evidence. The number of witnesses testifying on each side in the trial of an action is a proper but not an absolutely controlling element to be considered by the jury in weighing the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b73-11\" pgmap=\"73\">2.

Unless the verdict of a jury is clearly and manifestly against the weight of the evidence, such verdict will not be disturbed on review.</headnotes><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-4\" pgmap=\"73\">The principal issue was whether or not there were sufficient grounds justifying the discharge of the plaintiff before the expiration of the year for which he had been employed. On this issue there was only one witness for the plaintiff and that was the plaintiff himself* who testified that during the time he was working under said contract he in every respect complied with the terms thereof; that on the 20th day of August, 1913, he was discharged by the president of defendant, without cause; that thereafter he sought employment elsewhere during the remainder of the term of the contract, but without success.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\" pgmap=\"73\">Defendant, by three witnesses, offered testimony tending to show that plaintiff had repeatedly failed to comply with directions given him by his superiors as to the manner in which to perform his work, wherefore he was discharged. Plaintiff, however, denied ever having received any such directions, save at the time he was discharged.</p><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-6\" pgmap=\"73\">West &amp; Eckhart, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-7\" pgmap=\"73\">No appearance for appellee.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b73-13\" pgmap=\"73\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

A motion for a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence must be supported by the affidavits of the witnesses by whom it is proposed to prove the matters relied upon, or an excuse shown for not producing such affidavits.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b74-6\" pgmap=\"74\">5. New trial, \u00a7 102<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when affidavit supporting motion for new trial on ground of newly-discovered evidence insufficient. On a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, an affidavit that the witness by whom the party seeking the new trial proposed to prove the matters relied upon as newly-discovered evidence is beyond the reach of the affiant, and further alleging that affiant made \u201cearnest efforts\u201d to secure an affidavit from such witness, is insufficient in that such affidavit does not state specific facts sufficient to enable the court to determine what efforts were made by affiant to secure such affidavit before the witness\u2019 departure.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b74-7\" pgmap=\"74\">6. New trial, \u00a7 102<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when affidavit supporting motion for new trial on ground of newly-discovered evidence insufficient. On a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, an affidavit that prior to and during the trial affiant made \u201cdiligent efforts * * * to discover evidence\u201d of the character relied on as newly-discovered evidence, is insufficient in that its allegations are mere conclusions of the affiant and give the court no information from which it can determine whether or not affiant was diligent.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b74-8\" pgmap=\"74\">7.

In an action to recover on a contract whereby defendant agreed to employ plaintiff at a stated rate of compensation for a named period, in which the defense was that the contract was somewhat modified with the assent of plaintiff, a verdict whereby the jury found that plaintiff never assented to such modification of the contract, held not manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
