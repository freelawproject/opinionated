He sent appellee specifications that had been prepared for plumbing and heating, and after-wards there was a conference between the parties having these specifications before them, and appellee prepared, signed and handed to appellant a paper writing in which he proposed to do the plumbing work described in detail, and differing somewhat from the description in the specifications, for $310, one-half payable on arrival of material, and one-half when the job should be completed.
