The court instructed the jury not to allow anything for injury to her person and that element is not in the case. There was a verdict and a judgment for plaintiff for five hundred dollars and defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\" pgmap=\"235\">The suit was begun June 4, 1918, and the inquiry was limited to the five years next preceding that date.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-10\" pgmap=\"235(51) 236(162)\">Plaintiff and defendant introduced evidence showing that plaintiff\u2019s husband was an habitual drunkard during all of said five years. Plaintiff proved without contradiction that a part of his intoxication was produced by wine which he bought either of defendant or of some of his children at defendant\u2019s home, and which said husband paid for. Defendant contended that only five such sales were proved in the five years. It was proved that during the first nine months of said five years he was drunk at least twelve times, or about once every three weeks, upon defendant\u2019s wine, and that these drunken spells lasted from three days to a week each, during all of which time he was entirely incapacitated for work. There was proof that at later times he was frequently intoxicated on wine of appellant. On cross-examination of the witnesses by whom this'was proved, their statement that the husband told them he got the wine from appellant was excluded, but two of these witnesses also testified that they saw the wine which he had and upon which he became intoxicated from time to time, and that they knew defendant\u2019s wine from other wine and that this was defendant\u2019s wine. There was no contradiction of any of this evidence.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\" pgmap=\"236(175) 237(17)\">There was proof of the extreme poverty of plaintiff and her husband and of his failure to supply her most ordinary wants, and that his habitual drunkenness was the cause thereof. The evidence showed that when any money was earned on the land they worked, it was because plaintiff and her minor children worked in the fields. Married daughters furnished the clothing for herself and her minor children. Defendant was permitted to prove that others contributed to the habitual intoxication of George Moore; that he was seen lying drunk on the river bank in Momence with whisky bottles in his pocket; that he was seen drinking whisky in saloons; but the court did not permit proof of the names of the saloon keepers. There was evidence that plaintiff was present in a buggy or wagon perhaps three times when her husband bought this wine at defendant\u2019s farm and did not protest then against it. It was also shown that she took steps to have appellant notified by a lawyer not to sell liquor to her husband, but she was unable to show that the notice had in fact been, given.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\" pgmap=\"237\">Complaint was made of the ninth instruction, given for plaintiff, which after submitting to the jury the question whether Moore during said five years became an habitual drunkard and whether within said five years appellant sold and delivered him intoxicating liquor, and whether he drank the same and whether the drinking thereof contributed to his becoming an habitual drunkard, and whether by reason of such habitual drunkenness the plaintiff was injured in her means of support, then told the jury that if they further believed from the evidence that during said period other persons sold and delivered intoxicating liquors to Moore and that he drank the same and that the drinking thereof contributed to his becoming an habitual drunkard, yet under the law appellant would be liable for the acts of all other persons who contributed to such habitual intoxication by selling and delivering intoxicating liquors to Moore.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\" pgmap=\"237(150) 238(19)\">The court refused four instructions requested by defendant. The first was to the effect that if Moore became intoxicated by intoxicating liquors obtained from others and by reason thereof plaintiff was injured in person, property or means of support, and if defendant sold intoxicating liquors to Moore and he thereby became intoxicated, then before defendant could recover, she must prove that the intoxication caused by defendant contributed to the injury to her person, property or means of support. The second refused instruction was on the basis that the wine sold by defendant was not intoxicating and that Moore mixed said wine with other liquors and thereby became intoxicated. The third refused instruction was intended to cause the jury to consider the proof that Moore became intoxicated by liquors sold him by others in mitigation of damages. The fourth refused instruction assumed that there was evidence that plaintiff purchased from defendant intoxicating liquors for her husband and that such fact might be considered in mitigation of damages.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b238-8\" pgmap=\"238\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b238-9\" pgmap=\"238\">1.
