A trial before a justice of the peace resulted in a verdict by the jury for defendant. The justice\u2019s docket did not show that he entered judgment on this verdict. On appeal to the County Court after denying a motion to dismiss the appeal, the court rendered judgment for plaintiff.

Justices of the peace, \u00a7 170<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when right to appeal exists.

Justices of the peace, \u00a7 171<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when statute confers no right of appeal from mere verdict. Hurd\u2019s Rev. St., ch. 79, sec. 115 (J. &amp; A. \u00b6 6976), provides only for appeals from the judgments of justices of the peace, and not for appeals from the verdicts of juries in actions tried before such justices.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b618-7\" pgmap=\"618\">5.
