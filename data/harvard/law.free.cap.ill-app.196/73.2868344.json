Lyons, defendant, in the Circuit Court of Livingston county. To reverse a decree dismissing the bill and ordering costs to be paid by both parties, defendant prosecutes this writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-10\" pgmap=\"121\">It appears that the plaintiff in error filed a bill for separate maintenance November 19,1912, in which she alleged among other things:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-11\" pgmap=\"121\">That she is and has been for many years last past been a resident of the said County of Livingston, State of Illinois; and charged as grounds for relief extreme and repeated cruelty, setting out in detail in support of the charge acts of the husband which if proven would entitle her to a decree of divorce if the prayer of the bill asked that relief. Defendant in error filed an answer January 16,1913, in which he \u201c admits that the said complainant, Mary Frances Lyons, has been a resident of the said County of Livingston, in the State of Illinois for many years last past,\u201d and denies all charges of cruelty.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-12\" pgmap=\"121\">Afterwards, January 21,1914, plaintiff in error filed an amended bill praying for a divorce instead of separate maintenance, otherwise not differing materially from her former bill. Defendant in error answered, February 29,1914, with the same admissions and denials as in his former answer.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-13\" pgmap=\"121(18) 122(34)\">The record showed no trial except as contained in the decree, which, after reciting the appearance of parties and a hearing on the pleadings and evidence, finds that the court had jurisdiction, that the equities are with defendant, and further finds affirmatively that defendant was not guilty of cruelty as alleged.</p><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-8\" pgmap=\"122\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-9\" pgmap=\"122\">1. Divorce, \u00a7 33<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when answer construed as admitting residence of complainant in county for statutory period. In a bill for divorce an answer which admits that complainant \u201chas been a resident\u201d of the county wherein the bill was filed \u201cfor many years last past\u201d is not open to the objection that.it does not exclude the possibility that complainant might not have been a resident of this State for more than one year prior to the filing of the bill as required by the statute in order to give jurisdiction of the action.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-10\" pgmap=\"122\">2. Divorce, \u00a7 77<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when general finding of trial court as to jurisdiction not conclusive on appeal. In a bill for divorce, where the objection of want of jurisdiction is made on the ground of want of residence as required by the statute, it is not a sufficient answer to the objection that the trial court made a general finding that it had jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter of the action.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-11\" pgmap=\"122\">3. Divorce, \u00a7 70<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when defendant estopped to object to want of jurisdiction on appeal. In a bill for divorce, a proper allegation of residence in the bill, if admitted by the answer, will be sufficient on review to estop either party from making the objection of want of jurisdiction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-12\" pgmap=\"122\">4. Divorce, \u00a7 77<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when decree reversed on appeal for laclo of jurisdiction. A decree in a bill for divorce, which on review is not supported by a certificate of evidence or finding of facts showing the residence of complainant to have been as required by the statute in order to give jurisdiction of the action, will be reversed on writ of error or appeal, .although such a decree would\" be good as against a collateral attack, for the reason that in such case the question of residence goes to the jurisdiction and may be raised for the first time on review.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">Michael F.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 725<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when not necessary ore revieio that decree be supported by findings of fact or certificate of evidence.

Divorce, \u00a7 53*\u2014what constitutes dismissal of bill for want of equity.

In a bill for divorce, a finding of the residence of complainant for such time as required by the statute to give jurisdiction, held not necessary in order to enable the court to enter a decree, where the record showed a sufficient averment of such residence in the bill, complainant being estopped by such averment from assigning as prejudicial error the failure of the trial court to include such a finding'in its decree.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
