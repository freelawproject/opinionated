The term which was from March 1, 1914, to February 28, 1915, and which contained a provision by which the defendant reserved the privilege at any time to enter the property for certain purposes, and also the further stipulation that plaintiff should not hold the defendant liable for any damages as a result of the occupation of portions of the property by the defendant, for the purposes named.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-11\" pgmap=\"575(98) 576(28)\">The land in question, which was situated about two miles from the City of Ottawa, was known as sand land; and could also be used for pasture. There was a dwelling house on the land. The plaintiff from obtaining his lease from the defendant paid the first instalment of rent, and on the commencement of his term endeavored to take possession of the premises, but found another person in possession who claimed that he had a prior lease from the defendant, and refused to surrender possession. Plaintiff had come there with his household goods and effects, which he wanted to install upon the premises, and being thus prevented from entering was forced to rent other premises of a different kind and in a different locality.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b576-8\" pgmap=\"576\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b576-9\" pgmap=\"576\">1.
