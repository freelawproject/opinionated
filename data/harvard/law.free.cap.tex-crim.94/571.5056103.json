The indictment is an exact copy of the one in Tucker v. State, No. 7575. The Tucker case was affirmed at a former day of this term, and motion for rehearing overruled June 6th, 1923. The identical question is discussed at some length in the latter case and we refer thereto for our conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">A reversal becomes necessary because appellant was convicted of two separate and distinct felonies. In submitting the case to the jury the court not only submitted each count separately, but gave this additional charg\u00e9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201c Or if you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty under both counts in the indictment then you will find him guilty as charged under both counts in the indictment and assess his punishment at confinement in the penitentiary of this State for any term of years not less than one nor more than five, in your discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Following this instruction the jury returned a verdict finding appellant guilty under both 'counts and assessed his punishment at two years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary. The judgment follows the verdict and condemns him to be guilty of the offenses of both selling intoxicating liquor and with having same in his possession for the purpose of sale. We do not discuss the matter further than to refer to former opinions of this court holding that an accused cannot be convicted of two felonies upon one trial under one indictment. Banks v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 117, 246 S. W. Rep., 377; Knott v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 239, 247 S. W. Rep., 520: 522; Zilliox v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep., 301, 247 S. W. Rep., 523; Wimberley v. State, No. 7285, opinion March 21, 1923; Huffhines v. State, No. 7226, opinion May 2, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">For the error pointed out the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
