The State\u2019s evidence tends to support that averment. At that time, however, it was necessary, under Chap. 78, Acts of the thirty-sixth Legislature, 2nd Called Session; that the indictment negative the exceptions contained in the statute and in the Constitution. See Robert v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep. 134. The statute was subsequently amended rendering such averment unnecessary. The Assistant Attorney General concedes that the indictment in the instant case is defective in failing to make the necessary allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
