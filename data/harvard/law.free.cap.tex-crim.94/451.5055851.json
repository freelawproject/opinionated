Venga Ud \u00e1 mi casa, y le provar\u00e9 con cartas que ella es de la calle y no es virgen \u00f3 se\u00f1orita,\u2019 which said Spanish translated into -the English language is and means: \u2018 Carmen Nunez is not a virgin, she is a street walker, and belongs to the street. Come to my house and I will prove by letters that she is a street walker and not a virgin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">If we properly comprehend the evidence which was introduced by the State, it goes to show that- Carmen Nunez was an unmarried woman; that the appellant, while in the city of Juarez, Republic of Mexico, had a conversation with the- prosecuting witness in which there was language used imputing a want of chastity to Carmen Nunez. At the time the conversation took place, the witness and appellant and others were riding in an automobile. After the language was used they crossed the river and came to the City of El Paso, Texas, and while in El Paso, appellant requested the witness to go to her house in order that she might exhibit some letters, which would prove that Carmen Nunez was not a \u201cse\u00f1orita.\u201d The Spanish words used on the occasion are these: -\u201cPor le prover Carmen no es se\u00f1orita.\u201d The use of any defamatory language was denied by the appellant and other witnesses who were present. The testimony was given through an interpreter. There was a contention touching the meaning of the word \u201cse\u00f1orita\u201d as used in the Spanish words spoken in El Paso.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In our judgment, there was a fatal variance between the averment and proof. The offense can rest alone upon the language used in El Paso. That used in Juarez was admissible upon the issue of intent but not as a basis for the prosecution. The language used in Texas was that Carmen Nunez was not a \u201cse\u00f1orita.\u201d The meaning of this, it seems, is debatable. The Spanish words set out in the indictment differ materially from those proved to have been uttered in El Paso. Their English translation is different. As translated, the words mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cCarmen Nunez is not a virgin, she is a street walker, and belongs to the street. Come to my house and I will prove by letters that she is a street walker and not a virgin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">The words used in Texas, as translated, mean \u201cCarmen Nunez is not a virgin.\u201d ~_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">See Humbard v. State, 21 Texas Crim. App. 200; Barnett v. State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>35 Texas Crim. Rep. 280; Hasley v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep. 400; Woods v.

The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
