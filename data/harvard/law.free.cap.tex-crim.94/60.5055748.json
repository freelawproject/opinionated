The first complains of the action of the court in asking appellant in the presence of the jury what his name was. The indictment contained two counts, one charging an offense against Grover Williams and the other charging an offense against Eugene Williams, the State electing to prosecute under the second count. We cannot consider the bill of exceptions referred to. It is not approved by the trial court as is required of an ordinary bill of exceptions, nor is it here presented in accordance with well settled rules governing bystanders\u2019 bills. The two men who subscribed same as bystanders appear to have been sworn, and the jurat affixed shows it to be taken, by appellant\u2019s attorney. Garza v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 476, 145 S. W. Rep. 591; Hogan v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 50, 147 S. W. Rep., 871; Cuellar v. State, 69 Texas Crim. Rep., 155, 154 S. W. Rep. 228; Burnett v. State, 73 Texas Crim. Rep. 477; Maples v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep. 169, 131 S. W. Rep. 567. In addition to the above, the purported bill of exceptions violates the well known rules regarding bystanders\u2019 bills. In Osborne v. State, 56 S. W. Rep. 54, it is stated that a bill of exceptions signed by only two bystanders is not sufficient. The instant bill appears to be signed by only two persons. In Landrum v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep. 666, appears the statement that there must be other evidence of the refusal of the trial judge to sign and approve the bill, beside the statement of that fact by the bystanders who authenticate the bill. In Washington v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep. 345, appears approval of the well settled rule that before resort can be had to a bystanders\u2019 bill, the bill originally presented to the trial court must be marked refused by him and returned and filed. This is not true of the instant bill. For further authorities see Jones v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep. 6, 229 S. W. Rep. 865; Hunt v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 89, 229 S. W. Rep. 869; Anderson v. State, opinion rendered February 28, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Appellant\u2019s second bill of exeepions on file complains of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that whisky is spirituous liquor capable of producing intoxication. This presents no error as this court has often stated it has judicial knowledge of the fact that whisky is intoxicating spirituous liquor. See Banks v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep. 438, and authorities collated by Mr. Branch in his Annotated P. C., Sec. 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The remaining bill of exceptions complains of the fact that while appellant\u2019s counsel was arguing to the jury, he stated that appellant\u2019s name was charged in one count of the indictment as one, and in the other count, as another name, and that they did not know who they were trying. It is shown that at that juncture the court gave an addition to the charge which he had theretofore prepared and submitted to counsel, said additional charge being as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cGentlemen of the Jury: You are charged when the defendant is arraigned his name, as stated in the indictment, shall be distinctly called; and unless he suggest by himself or counsel that he is not indicted by his true name, it shall be taken that his name is truly set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The complaint at this charge that it was on the weight of evidence, does not seem tenable, and the further complaint that it was out of place and calculated to lead the jury to hold appellant responsible for a variance in his name as alleged in the two counts in the indictment, does not seem to be of material weight. Such an instruction might be necessary in' a given case to prevent confusion in the minds of the jury. There appears to have been no suggestion on the part of appellant of his true name. His counsel was arguing to the jury that they could not know who they were trying. There is no complaint setting forth that this charge was hot submitted to appellant\u2019s counsel, or that he was not given an opportunity to challenge the correctness of same. We do not deem the articles.of our Code in regard to charges to be so restrictive as to deprive the trial courts of the right or power to give additional charges or corrective charges when the necessity therefor arises after the main charge has been given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Believing no error to have been committed, and that appellant has had a fair trial, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\">On Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"ATz\">April 11, 1923.</p>\n<author id=\"b100-11\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Agz\">In a motion for rehearing by appellant it is urged that we did not consider the errors of the trial court in overruling appellant\u2019s application for a continuance; and in over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ruling his motion to quash the jury array. The record does not show any order of the court in either regard, nor is there any bill of exceptions presenting complaint thereof. Appellant insists 'that his exceptions as to both appear in the record and refers us to the judgment of the court below wherein we find it stated that the trial court had overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the jury array and defendant\u2019s motion for continuance, to which the defendant excepted. Further than as- just stated no other exception appears to the court\u2019s action upon either of said motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">We held in Caldwell v. State, 2 Texas Crim. App. 53; Wakefield v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App. 39, and Asbeek v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep. 225, 156 S. W. Rep. 925, that a recitation in the judgment that the accused excepted to the refusal to quash the venire, was not sufficient to take the place of a bill of exceptions. So also in Hollis v. State, 9 Texas Crim. App. 643; Gaston v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App. 143; Prator v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App. 363, and Wesley v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep. 299, we held that a recital in the judgment or minutes 'that a continuance was refused to which defendant excepted, would not supply the place of a bill of exceptions. We are unable to see any good reason for doubting the soundness of the rulings in each instance. A bill of exceptions presented to the trial court for approval brings the matters complained of before the lower court in a manner that appropriate explanation or qualification may be made if proper. For illustration, the absent witnesses may have appeared during the trial, and this fact being shown by the court\u2019s qualification, no error would appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Being unable to accept either contention of appellant, his motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
