This was before the amendment to the \u201cDean Liquor Law\u201d passed by the Thirty-seventh Legislature, page 233, 1st and 2d C. S. became effective. To charge an offense under the then existing law (Chapter 78, Sec. 31, C. S. 36th Legithlature,) it was necessary to negative the exceptions in the indictment. The pleader in the present case undertook to do so, , and alleged that appellant transported intoxicating liquor \u201cnot for medicinal, mechanical, scientific <em>and </em>sacramental purposes.\u201d The indictment is attacked on the ground that using the conjunction \u201cand\u201d forces appellant before his defense would be complete, to show the transportation for <em>all </em>of the excepted purposes, whereas the transportation for any <em>one </em>of them is a complete defense under the statute. Appellant\u2019s contention has been sustained in McNeil v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 198, 241 S. W. 1022, and O\u2019Neal v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 91, 242 S. W. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Appellant raises the question that \u2022 the witness Parker is an accomplice, and that by his testimony alone does the state undertake to connect appellant with the illegal transportation of whisky. On account of the necessary disposition of the case because of the defective indictment we do not discuss the other point mentioned. If there should be further prosecution, and the evidence on another trial raises the issue it will doubtless be properly cared for.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">The judgment must be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed under the present indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
