Appended to the motion is a copy of an affidavit in which the appellant makes oath that he was unable to pay the costs of appeal. In order to justify this court in granting such an application, it would be necessary that it appear that the affidavit was presented to the \u2022court. See Ex parte Fread, 83 Texas Crim. Rep. 467. No such action is revealed in the present case. The procedure pointed out in Article 845a, C. C. P., upon which the right to the statement of facts under the circumstances is based not having been followed, we have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>choice but to refuse to order the court stenographer to prepare a statement of facts.
