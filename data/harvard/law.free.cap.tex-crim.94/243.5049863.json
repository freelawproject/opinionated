He .apparently discovered them, went in the house but re-appeared almost immediately with something in his arms; the officers saw him go to some hen nests not over ten steps-from the door of his house and place something in the nests. They discovered in .the nests six pints of whisky. Upon these facts this conviction rests. Appellant testified that he had the liquor for medicinal purposes; that he had been suffering from rheumatism, and had used a tonic for many years composed of certain drugs in liquor for the relief of it. The court declined to present this defensive issue to the jury. Objection to his main charge for omitting the same was presented and a special charge requested. The case falls squarely within the principle announced in Mayo v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 624, 245 S. W. Rep., 241 and White v. State, 93 Texas Crim. Rep. 332, 247 S. W. Rep:, 557. The trial judge may not have given credence to the testimony raising this issue, but it was not for him to determine it. That was the exclusive province , of the jury under proper instructions. The state- concedes error. It occurs to us that the evidence does not show a violation of the law denouncing the transportation of intoxicating liquor. The undisputed evidence shows that the liquor was not removed from appellant\u2019s premises, but was changed\u25a0 from one location to another a distance estimated from five to ten steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">The judgment\u2019s is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">\n<em>Reversed, and remcmded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
