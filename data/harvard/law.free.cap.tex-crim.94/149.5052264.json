The term of court continued more than eight weeks, and the motion for new trial was overruled on the 29th of September. The court adjourned on the 30th of September. An order was made allowing appellant sixty days within which to prepare and file his bills of exceptions. According to the file mark, they were not filed' until December 20th. The State, through its Assistant Attorney General, objects to their consideration. The statute makes it imperative that this objection be sustained. See Code of Crim. Proe., Art. 845; Vernon's Tex. Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, p. 836, note 15, and cases listed; Griffin, v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">A recital of the evidence is deemed unnecessary.
