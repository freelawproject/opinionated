Appellant was compelled to answer the questions asked him over his objection as above stated: There was no issue of suspended sentence in the case. The matter inquired about was not in any sense res gestae of the transaction involved in the charge against appellant. The bill of exceptions is approved by the learned trial judge with the qualification that appellant had testified that he was at home at the time inquired about and said question was permitted for the purpose of showing .that he was at a different place than the one claimed by him. The date of the sale of intoxicating liquor charged against the appellant herein was alleged to be January 16, 1922. Appellant\u2019s trial took place in October 1922. We do not quite understand the qualification of the learned judge above referred to. If the State had asked appellant if he was at home a year prior to the trial on a certain date and he had testified that he was, and thereafter the State had' under taken to prove that he was drunk and in the calaboose on said date, for the purpose of showing that appellant had.testified falsely, this would, not have been permitted because the matter would have come within the rule forbidding impeachment on an immaterial matter. Many authorities upon this proposition are cited by Mr. Branch in Se\u201e. 165 of his Annotated P. C. In Sec. 169 of the same work many authorities are cited supporting the proposition that neither the defendant nor any other witness can be legally impeached by proof that he was arrested for or charged with or convicted of a misdemeanor that does not involve moral turpitude. In Powell v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep. 201, this court said that drunkenness is a public place was not an offense involving moral'turpitude. This court has often held that impeaching a material witness on an immaterial matter is reversible error, believing that to show the jury that one has testified falsely regarding an immaterial matter is likely to cause them to believe that he did falsely testify, in regard to material matters. Boatright v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep. 442; Golin v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep. 102; Jenkins v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\">For the error in the admission of the above testimony the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">\n<em>Reversed and \\remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
