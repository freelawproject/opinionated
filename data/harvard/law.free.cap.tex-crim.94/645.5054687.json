State, 101 S. W. Rep. 800; Coleburn v. State, 133 id., 882; Spiller v. State, 135 id., 549; Arseneaux v. State, 140 id., 776.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b683-16\"><em>R. G.

Tom Bunch was named as the owner. Bunch and Swearengen were partners in a mercantile establishment. In their place of business was a safe from which the appellant took the money. He was caught in the act by Bunch, who was alone in the store. Swearengen was in the city but not in the store. At the time of the theft, the store and the property therein was under the care, control and management of Bunch. Such was his testimony. In the statute it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-19\">\u201cWhere property is owned in common, or jointly, by two or more persons, the ownership may be alleged to be in all or either of them. \u2019 \u2019 (Code of Crim. Proc., Art. 457.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Upon these facts there was no variance growing out of the joint ownership. Lockett v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep. 531; Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C. Sec. 2434 and cases listed; also Palmer v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 640, 245 S. W. Rep. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\">The record is without bills of exception. Some special charges were refused but it does not appear that they were presented to the trial judge in the time required by statute, nor that exception was taken to their refusal. Therefore they cannot be considered. Barrios v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 548, 204 S. W. Rep. 326; Nichols v. State, 91 Texas Crim. Rep., 277, 238 S. W. Rep. 232; Bliphas Linder, No. 6558, recently decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
