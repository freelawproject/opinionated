The State\u2019s testimony shows an unjustifiable attack. Helton had left his wagon standing upon the street. Appellant, without warrant and without legal authority so far as the record shows, sought to put him under arrest, and upon Helton\u2019s protestation, struck him with a pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-18\">Appellant interposed the theory of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">We do not find ourselves in a position to pass upon the merits of the case as neither complaint, information nor indictment is found in the record. In the absence of any pleadings invoking the jurisdiction of the court and supporting the verdict, the judgment must be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed. Such is the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
