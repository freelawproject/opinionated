The courts have been careful even when restrictive legislation is aimed only at those unfortunate classes whose occupations are deemed so obnoxious to society and to community welfare as to permit proper legislative safeguards, \u2014 to not uphold such laws when their fair construction would include others than the class aimed at; and in many cases when even those classes legitimately included in such laws, have been limited beyond what would seem to be a fair exercise of police power, laws have been held unconstitutional. In Milliken v. City Council, 54 Texas, 388, our Supreme Court held unconstitutional an ordinance prohibiting renting house to any prostitute or lewd woman, on the broad ground that when such renting was not for the purpose of carrying on a vocation, it was not a proper exercise of the police power to forbid it; and that no matter how unfortunate or degraded, all human beings were entitled to the protection of the law and the right to hold and own property. In Ex parte McCarver, 39 Texas Crim. Rep. 448, a curfew ordinance forbidding persons under twenty-one years of age from being on the streets of the city of Graham after the ringing of the curfew bell, was held an unreasonable ordinance and an unwarranted invasion of the rights of - the citizen, it not only including those who might be out on evil bent but also those who for reasons might be out on business, pleasure or religious errands. In Hechinger v. City of Maysville, 57 S. W. Rep., 619, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held invalid an ordinance somewhat similar to the one now before us as unreasonable. In Ex parte Smith, 36 S. W. Rep. 628, the Supreme Court of Missouri held unconstitutional an ordinance forbidding association with persons known to be thieves, pickpockets, etc. From that opinion we quote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\u201cThis ordinance is now attacked on the ground of its unconstitutionality, in that it invades the right of personal liberty by assuming to forbid that any person should knowingly associate with those who have the reputation of being thieves, etc. And certainly it stands to reason that, if the legislature, either state or municipal, may forbid one to associate with certain classes of persons of unsavory or malodorous reputations, by the same token it may dictate who the associates of any one may be. But if the legislature may dictate who our assoeiatiates may be, then what becomes of the constitutional protection to personal liberty, which Blackstone says \u2018 consists in the power of locomotion, of changing situation, or moving one\u2019s person to what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>soever place one\u2019s inclination'may direct, without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law. \u2019 1 Bl. Comm. 134. Obviously, there is no difference in point of legal principle between a legislative or municipal act which forbids certain association, and one which commands certain association. \"We deny the power of any legislative body in this country to choose for our citizens whom their associates shall be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Turning for a moment to the subdivisions of See. 2 of the ordinance under consideration quoted above, we notice that many of said subdivisions if applied would make penal all male persons who without knowledge of their character gave transportation to any person who resided in a bawdy house; would also penalize the father, brother or near relative of such inmate who might visit her at such place, no matter how innocent such visit, or whether its purpose was to induce her to leave the place, or was caused by sickness or what not; would penalize the minister, salvation army or other rescue worker who might go to such place of woe with the purest purpose and best intent possible; would prevent all those male persons who\u00b0se wives and mother had negro washerwomen or servants from going to their residences on any kind of errand or mission, however, clean or lawful, unless such male person was a doctor, a deliveryman, a collector or a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The obvious purpose of the ordinance is wholesome, but its terms are too broad and many of its sections make penal acts and persons which and who by no construction could be held to be crimes or criminals. Many situations could be instanced where men might go to the house of ill-fame with the best possible motives, or be temporarily thrown with fallen women with or without knowledge of their character and totally without evil purpose, and of men from business, charitable or religious purposes might be led to be at said places or with said people. We would seriously doubt the validity of any law a reasonable construction of whose terms would make criminal those persons and things against whose inclusion as such reason and common sense would revolt. Further argument would seem needless.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The ordinance in question being unconstitutional, it would follow that the arrest and conviction of relator was without authority of law, and Ms discharge will be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\n<em>Relator discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
