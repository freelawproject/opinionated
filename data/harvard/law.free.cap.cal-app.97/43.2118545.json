Alleges that plaintiff paid $40 to Allen &amp; Company on account of the $375 promissory note; that Allen &amp; Company are not entitled to any commission; that plaintiff has suffered damages in the sum of $1,153.50 by reason of defendants\u2019 fraud; that the defendants hold the profits derived from the resale of the property in trust for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The defendants in their answer deny the allegations of the complaint, except it is admitted that on July 21, 1924, the plaintiff conveyed the property to O \u2019Brien, and that O \u2019Brien resold the property at a profit of $1,026.25, but that none of the profit was received by Allen &amp; Company. The answer admits that the plaintiff executed a promissory note for $375 as commission in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The court found that Allen &amp; Company was Firestone\u2019s agent for the sale of the property; that it was originally listed for $8,500; that O\u2019Brien was an employee of Allen &amp; Company; that Allen &amp; Company by its employee Hill, after persuading Firestone to lower his price, made an agreement with O\u2019Brien for the sale of the property; admits the receipt of the $250 as a deposit on account of the purchase price of $7,500; finds that the property was sold to O\u2019Brien by Allen &amp; Company as the agent for the owner Firestone; finds that \u201cThe relationship of O\u2019Brien as an employee of Allen &amp; Company was not disclosed to the plaintiff until after the sale, nor did plaintiff either directly or indirectly learn of that relationship until after the sale, but at the time the said Firestone signed the clause appearing on the reverse side of said deposit sale agreement . . . said Firestone observed the name of O\u2019Brien on a name-plate on the top of the desk at which he was seated in the office of Allen &amp; Company, indicating that O\u2019Brien was connected with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Allen &amp; Company, and at that time said Firestone realized there was some connection between O\u2019Brien and Allen &amp; Company, although he did not realize the significance of said connection as it might concern him. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Further findings may be summarized as follows: That Firestone had been advised by Allen &amp; Company that his property was sold; that a deposit had been accepted, and that plaintiff was led by defendants to believe that he was bound by said sale, previous to his signing of the formal sale agreement of July 8, 1924; did not at the time realize the significance of O\u2019Brien\u2019s relationship with Allen &amp; Company as indicated by O\u2019Brien\u2019s name-plate on the desk in the office of Allen &amp; Company, as it might concern said sale until subsequent to the signing of said formal sale agreement of July 8, 1924; that on the date of the sale there was a resale simultaneously by O\u2019Brien to certain parties by the name of Todts, and \u201cThat the defendants, particularly O\u2019Brien, derived a secret profit of $1,000.00 from said transaction, which he, O \u2019Brien, kept from plaintiff and for which he and his employer Allen &amp; Company refused to account to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">There was entered upon these findings a judgment: That plaintiff recover from the defendants $1,153.50 as damages; that the defendants account to the plaintiff for the profit realized upon the resale to the Todts; that the note for $375 be canceled; and that the $40 paid by plaintiff to Allen &amp; Company on account of this note be repaid to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The appellants contend, first, admitting that it is elementary that an agent to sell cannot sell to himself without disclosing the fact that he is buying to his principal, but contend this rule has no application to this case where the agent to sell did not sell to itself but to one of its employees ; second, the plaintiff at the time he entered into the agreement to sell the property to O\u2019Brien knew that O\u2019Brien was an employee of Allen &amp; Company, hence he cannot rescind the transaction and establish a constructive trust of the profits of the resale; third, even though this court holds that O\u2019Brien is liable, Allen &amp; Company, who did not receive any part of the profit realized upon the resale, is under no liability of any sort to the plaintiff; fourth, even though this court hold that both Allen &amp; Company and O\u2019Brien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>are liable, the judgment entered by the trial court is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We have summarized quite fully the pleadings, findings, and judgment in the case, as it seems quite necessary so to do for a full understanding of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The first proposition of appellants is that, conceding that a real estate firm cannot sell to itself, without disclosing the fact that it is buying to its principal, yet this rule has no application to a case where the agent did not sell to itself, but to one of its salesmen. We think that an examination of the authorities shows that the agent cannot sell to one of its salesmen or employees without first <em>disclosing </em>all the surrounding facts to the principal. One of the leading cases upon this subject is the case of <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Bows, </em>which was before our supreme court three times, and this particular phase of the ease was quite fully discussed in 92 Cal. 108 [28 Pac. 57], where the following language is found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201cIn Sugden on Vendors, p. 887, it is said: \u2018Any persons who, by being employed or concerned in the affairs of another, have acquired a knowledge of his property are incapable of purchasing such property themselves.\u2019 In <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>22 N. Y. 350 [78 Am. Dec. 192], \u2018The defendant Smith was the clerk, or assistant, of his principals. . . . Whatever disabilities they labored under equally attached to him. It would work an entire abrogation of this rule to hold the principal subject to the operation of the rule and exempt his clerks and agents from its effect. It would be opening the door to its evasion, so that it would lose all its vitality and virtue.\u2019 The decision goes on: \u2018I think this is the spirit of all the authorities, and that the honesty and fairness of transactions between principals and their agents demand a firm adherence to these rules, and to bring under their operation, not only the <em>agent </em>himself, but those in his <em>immediate employ, </em>and who are engaged in the transaction of his business, which is, necessarily, the business of the agent\u2019s principal.\u2019 \u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">These principles are cited with approval in the cases of <em>Newell-Murdoch Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Wiekman, </em>183 Cal. 39, at page 44 [190 Pac. 359], and <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Younger, </em>184 Cal. 783 [195 Pac. 682].</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The rule is to place the burden on the agent to make full <em>disclosure </em>promptly. See the case of <em>McCallum </em>v. <em>Grier, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>86 S. C. 162 [138 Am. St. Rep. 1037, 68 S. E. 466], in which the court said in part: \u201cA broker employed to sell goods for his principal cannot buy them for himself, nor can a broker employed to buy, buy his own goods unless the principal, <em>with full knowledge of the facts, assents to the transaction. </em>The decision states: \u2018It is immaterial that the broker acts in good faith. . . . The reason of the rule is that, if the broker were permitted to buy from or sell to himself, there would be combined in him the incompatible relation of purchaser and seller, and an interest adverse to that of his principal would be created such as would ordinarily lead to a violation of his duty as agent. \u2019 (4 Ency. of Law, 966; 19 Cyc. 207.) \u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In <em>Curry </em>v. <em>King, </em>6 Cal. App. 575 [92 Pac. 665], it is stated: \u201cTherefore, an agent will not be allowed to deal in his own behalf with his principal with reference to the subject matter of the agency, unless he makes <em>full, complete and honest disclosure of the truth </em>of the transaction. He is bound to treat with his principal concerning the property over which he has been vested with authority in the utmost good faith, and so religiously does equity require adherence to this rule that a transaction between them as to the property whereby the agent acquires the ownership thereof, is upon its face deemed by law to be fraudulent.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In the case of <em>McCallum </em>v. <em>Grier, supra, </em>it is stated: \u201cIt is the duty of an agent to <em>disclose </em>fully to his principal every step taken by him in the transaction of the principal\u2019s business. If it be the sale of real estate he should keep nothing concealed in his efforts to bring the owner and prospective purchaser together. The <em>identity </em>of the purchaser and the <em>true consideration </em>should be instantly <em>disclosed.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">We have examined the authorities cited by the appellants with much care, but we are unable to see wherein they in any way mitigate or in any way narrow the doctrine contended for by the respondent, which we feel is very clearly upheld by the great weight of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The second contention of the appellants to the effect that the plaintiff at the time he entered into the sales agreement knew that O\u2019Brien was a salesman of Allen &amp; Company, therefore he is not in a position to complain, is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>merit, for the reason that the evidence clearly shows that there was not a <em>disclosure </em>of all the facts as required by the authorities hereinbefore cited. It is true that the plaintiff saw the name of 0 \u2019Brien on the name-plate on a desk in the office of Allen &amp; Company, but that was not a full disclosure of all the facts surrounding the sale. Furthermore, the evidence shows, without conflict, that on the very day that the deed of the plaintiff to O\u2019Brien was in escrow with the escrow agent, 0 \u2019Brien himself secretly sold the said property to Todts by a deed to Todts through the same escrow company at a profit of $1,000. This clearly shows that all the facts and circumstances concerning which it is the duty of the agent and the agent\u2019s salesman to fully disclose to the principal, the plaintiff, was not done. The evidence sustains the findings of the trial court in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The contention of the appellants, that even though O\u2019Brien is liable, that Allen &amp; Company cannot be held responsible because the latter did not receive any of the profits realized from the resale, is without merit from what has heretofore been said. The authorities quoted clearly hold that Allen &amp; Company is legally liable and it is not necessary to further cite authorities sustaining this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">To recapitulate the case briefly: The plaintiff listed property with Allen &amp; Company for sale for not less than $8,500. A salesman in the employ of Allen &amp; Company by the name of Hill persuaded plaintiff to lower his price to $7,500 and the property was sold to O\u2019Brien, also a salesman in the employ of Allen &amp; Company; on the same day or practically the same day, the property was resold by O\u2019Brien to the Todts at a profit of $1,000 <em>the same escrow agency handling both transactions. </em>The evidence shows that Hill died before the trial and his testimony was not taken. The appellants earnestly argue that Allen &amp; Company received nothing from the profits and were ignorant of the transaction; that Allen &amp; Company are large real estate operators having many branch offices and employing many salesmen; that they have received no profit and they ought not to be held liable. We think that it is only fair to state that Allen &amp; Company, so far as the evidence shows, were uninformed as to the actions of their salesmen Hill and O\u2019Brien. Allen &amp; Company received a note covering the commission amounting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>$375, upon which the sum of $40 only was paid. Nevertheless, for the reasons which we have herein stated, Allen &amp; Company must he held legally responsible, however unfortunate it may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The judgment entered by the trial court in favor of the respondent and against the appellants O\u2019Brien and Allen &amp; Company was for the surrender and cancellation of the promissory note of $375; for the return of $40 paid by the plaintiff to Allen &amp; Company; for damages in the total amount of $1,153.50 against both appellants; and for an accounting as against both Allen &amp; Company and O\u2019Brien of all the profits in connection with the resale of plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">As the evidence conclusively shows that O\u2019Brien resold the property to the Todts simultaneously with the receipt of the deed from the plaintiff; that O\u2019Brien did not occupy the property or rent the same at all, it is clear that the only profit was that made upon the resale of the property, to wit, the sum of $1,000. Whether the $1,000 be denominated damages or profits would seem to be unimportant, because that sum, together with the cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s note of $375, and the return of the $40 paid thereon is all the relief 'that the plaintiff is entitled to recover under any theory of the ease. Therefore that portion of the judgment ordering an accounting is erroneous and should be modified by having the same stricken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The appellants also complain that the judgment for $1,153.50 is erroneous, and should be reduced to $1,000. But it is apparent, we think, that the $153.50 was intended as interest on the $1,000 resale profit made July 21, 1924, from such date and as this is less than the legal interest on such sums from July 21, 1924, to the date of judgment, it is harmless so far as appellants are concerned, and as plaintiff has not appealed we are warranted in permitting that part of the judgment to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">For the reasons stated that part of the judgment of the trial court which orders the appellants to account to respondent is stricken from the judgment, the judgment in all other particulars to stand, and the judgment so modified is affirmed. Respondent to recover his costs.,</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Tyler, P. J., and Cashin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on March 21, 1929, and a petition by appellants to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on April 18, 1929.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
