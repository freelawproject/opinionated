Bracewell, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-13\">The consent of the school trustees of each district affected is a condition precedent to the authority of the county board to effect an annexation of two districts under the Rural High School Act and this is true notwithstanding an election may have been carried in the district at large. Article 2922A, Revised Civil Statutes of 1925, as amended by the Acts of the 40th Legislature, First Called Session, page 206, and the articles following; W. B. Hale v. Wm. McMurry, 22 S. W. (2d) 499; County Board of Limestone County v. Wilson, 5 S. W. (2d) 805; County Board of Trustees v. Wilson, 15 S. W. (2d) 144; Terrell v. Clifton, 15 S. W. (2d) 508; Independent School District v. Low, 10 S. W. (2d) 743; County Board of Angelina County v. Homer Common School District, 291 S. W., 268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-14\">Since the Rural High School Act places rural school districts and the formation thereof under the control of the county board of education, where an election is called for annexing common school districts, the same must be called by the county board of education and an order of an election called by the county judge is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-15\">The school authorities in this case apparently assumed that the county judge had authority to call the same by virtue of the consolidation statute which is article 2806 of the Revised Civil Statutes. In all other authorized school elections for consolidation or dissolution the county judge is expressly authorized to call the election. We do not believe that it may be inferred from that that he is authorized to call an election for annexation under the Rurual High School Act. Under article 2947 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>he is directed to order \u201call other elections which under the law the <em>county </em>judge may be authorized to order.\u201d There is no inherent power in the county judge to order an election and we believe that upon a consideration of the Rural High School Act as a whole such election must be called by the county board of education. Article 2922A of the Revised Civil Statutes and following; Article 2947 of the Revised Civil Statutes; Williams v. Glover, 259 S. W., 957; Trustees v. Elbon, 223 S. W., 1039; Stevens v. Dodd, 243 S. W., 711.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">If the county judge has the authority to call an election under the Rural High School' Act, the time of such notice is hot provided by law and the general statute requiring thirty days notice of all special elections would control and less than thirty days notice having been given and it not being shown that a majority of the voters participated in such election, the same is void.

The following statutes are then cited and discussed: Rev. Civil Stats., arts. 2947, 2949, 2950, 2676, 2725, 2746, 2757, 2758, 2759, 2769, 2775, 2776, 2785, 2788, 2794, 2799, 2806; Williams v.

Especially so in every case where the election was authorized and voters had a right to pass upon the question submitted. We refer the court to the very early case of McKinney v. O\u2019Connor, 26 Texas, 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">Appellants say in their brief that, since the law conferred upon the county board of school trustees the control and management of the public free schools of the county, the order for the election for annexation in the instant case should have been made by said board of trustees. There is nothing in the law to indicate that the Legislature intended that the county board should order elections instead of the county judge. Notwithstanding the statute in so many places requires the latter office to call elections, we submit that the county board, in this instance, did not so construe the law, but passed a resolution that an election for annexation should be held, and called upon the county judge to order the election and give notice thereof, etc. If, by any construction, the law contemplated that the county board should order the election, then we say that the spirit and intent of the law has been fully met in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">We .respectfully submit, in all confidence and justice, that the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>lants\u2019 prayer for a temporary injunction be in all things denied, and that the election proceedings attacked herein be upheld.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-3\">Mr. Justice LEDDY</author>\n<p id=\"ADS\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The Court of Civil Appeals for the First Supreme Judicial District presents the following certificate and questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u201cThis appeal, which is now pending in this court on motion for rehearing, is from an order of the court below denying a temporary injunction in a suit for injunction brought by appellants against appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cThe suit is brought by the trustees of Common School District No. 2 of Walker County against the County Superintendent of Schools, the County Board of Education, and the County Commissioners Court, to restrain any declaration of the result of an election held in several school districts of the county adjoining the Huntsville Independent School District to determine the question of the annexation of the adjoining districts to the Huntsville District, and to restrain \u2018the entering of any order by virtue of said election which would purport in any manner to affect or impair the rights of Common School District No. 2\u2019, and to require defendants to continue to recognize plaintiffs as the lawful trustees of School District No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u201cThe election, the result of which is sought to be annulled, was held in pursuance of the following resolutions of the County Board of Education passed on August 5, 1929:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u201c \u2018WHEREAS, the County Board of School' Trustees of Walker County, Texas, has been for some months engaged in the task of grouping the Common School Districts of Walker County for rural high school purposes, and it appearing to the Board that it will be for the best interest of the Common School Districts adjacent to the Huntsville Independent School District, and particularly the districts hereinafter named, and that the pupils of said Common School Districts will have better high school privileges by annexing the territory in said Districts hereinafter set forth to the Huntsville Independent School District;</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u201c\u2018BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED by the County Board of School Trustees of Walker County, Texas, that the following School Districts, to-wit, Common School Districts No. Two, Nine, Twelve, and the Phelps Independent School District, should be annexed to the Huntsville Independent School District, as provided by Articles 2922a. and 2922c of the Revised Civil Statutes of 1925, as amended by the Acts of the Thirty-Ninth Legislature, Chapter 50, page 204, and by the Acts of the Fortieth Legislature, First Called Session, page 206, Chapter 78; and it further appearing to said County Board of Trustees that said territory, proposed to be annexed to the Huntsville Independent School District, aggregates more than one hundred (100) square miles, but does not contain more than seven (7) Common School Districts; and it further appearing to said Board that, in order to effect said annexation of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>School Districts, it will be necessary for an election to be held throughout the entire territory to be affected by such annexation, and that the County Judge of Walker County is authorized to and is the proper official to issue the Order for such an Election:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">\u201c \u2018IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the Hon.

At the other voting placed named in the \u25a0order the total number of votes \u2018for annexation\u2019 was 21, and \u2018against \u25a0annexation\u2019 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cIt appears from the record that the voting places named in the order are all the regular voting places of the voters in the territory embraced in the order. It is further shown that while the Phelps School District was created an independent district by an act of the legislature passed in 1917, it had not functioned as such for a number of years, but was organized and functioning as a common school district, and was so recognized by the commissioners\u2019 court and school authorities of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">\u201cEach of the districts involved in the creation of the proposed rural high school district has the scholastic population required by Article 2922a, before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u201cThe questions presented by this appeal are not wholly free from doubt, and because of this fact and of the obvious advantage to the public of having a final decision of these questions as early as possible, we deem it advisable to certify for your decision the questions hereinafter stated which arise upon the foregoing statement of the case, and are properly presented by appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u201cFirst: Was the election void under Articles 2922a and 2922c because the trustees of Common School District No. 2 did not consent to' the proposed annexation of that district to the Huntsville Independent School District for the purpose of forming, with the other districts named' in the order of election, a rural high school district ?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u201cSecond: Was the election void because not called by the authority empowered by the statute to make the call?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u201cThird: Was the published notice of the election for more than twenty-one days prior to the day on which the election was held sufficient ?'</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\u201cAfter due consideration we have answered the first two questions in the negative and the third in the affirmative, but upon motion for rehearing, for the reasons before stated, we have concluded the questions should' be certified for your decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">For the reasons given by the Court of Civil Appeals in its opinion, with which we are in accord, the first question certified is answered in the negative. The second and third questions we answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Appellants contend that the election was held without lawful authority and is void because it was called and the time and place fixed for its holding by the county judge instead of the county board of trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">Appellees insist that the county judge was the proper authority to call the election, but if not, then that such election was in effect called by the-county board of trustees because the county judge in ordering the election copied the order passed by such board.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">An election held at the time and place fixed by law is valid even though no order or call has been issued therefor, as the right to hold such; an election is derived from the law and not from any notice.

J., voL 20, sec. 79, p. 96. .</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>A failure to give notice of such an election does not render the same nugatory, as every person is required to take notice of what the statute prescribes. People v. Cowles, 13 N. Y., 350; People v. Hartwell, 12 Mich., 508, 86 Am. Dec., 70; Dishon v. Smith, 10 Iowa, 212; State v. Orvis, 20 Wis., 235; Mechem on Public Offices and Officers, sec. 174, R. C L., vol. 9, sec. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">But, where the election is a special one, to be called and the time and place fixed by some authority, it is essential to the validity thereof that it be called or ordered by the very authority designated by law and none other. Adsit v. Secretary of State, 84 Mich., 420, 48 N. W., 31; 11 L. R. A., 534; Stephens v. The People, 89 Ill., 337; State v. Langlie, 5 N. D., 594, 67 N. W., 958, 32 L. R. A., 732; Marsden v. Harlocker, 48 Ore., 90, 85 Pac., 328, 120 Am. St. Rep., 786, and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The validity of the election in question can only be sustained upon the theory that the county judge has been vested by law with authority to order the same. We are unable to find any provision of law which authorizes the county judge to call the election described in article 2922c, R. S., 1925, and counsel for appellee have not cited us to any statute which attempts to confer such authority. The county judge has been authorized in various statutes to order special elections provided for, but there is no statute conferring general power upon the county judge to order special elections. If such a statute existed it might be inferred that the Legislature in enacting article 2922c intended for the county judge to exercise the power conferred thereby to order the election in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Nor is there any provision in the rural high school act, of which article 2922c is a part, expressly conferring authority upon the county board of trustees to order the election provided for in said article, and if such power exists it must be held to be conferred by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The Legislature will be presumed to have known at the time of the passage of the rural high school act that there was no general statute placing the duty upon the county judge or any other officer or tribunal to order the character of election provided for in article 2922c, hence it must have contemplated that this authority was to be exercised by the-county board of trustees in whom was expressly vested the power to form-rural high school districts by grouping common or independent districts. In certain instances the county trustees are authorized to form such districts without the necessity of submitting the question to a determination of the electorate of the disricts involved. Art. 2922a, R. S., 1925, as-, amended by Acts 39th Leg. (1925), c. 59, and.Acts 40th Leg. (1927),. 1st Called Session, c. 78 (Vernon\u2019s Ann. Civ. St., art. 2922a). They are also directed to form rural high school districts under the conditions specified in section 2922c, but their authority in this respect is limited to there first being an approval of the majority of the qualified voters of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>proposed district at an election called for such purpose. Under these circumstances we think it may be reasonably and fairly inferred that it was within the contemplation of the law making body that the agency charged with the duty of forming such districts and of their supervision was clothed with power to call the election required, fix the time and place thereof, canvass the result, and thus determine whether the proposed district should be created. This construction is permissible under the rule that a statute should be so construed as to permit in the fullest manner the accomplishment of the apparent policy and object of the Legislature in enacting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\">It is immaterial that there was a full and fair expression of the voters of the proposed district, as there can be no valid election if the same has not been called by lawful authority. The rule on this question is thus stated in Cyc., vol. 15, p. 317: \u201cThere can be no valid election without some lawful authority behind it. The right to hold an election cannot exist or be lawfully exercised without express grant of power by the Constitution or Legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">If it had been shown that the entire electorate of the district to be affected had unanimously voted in favor of the question submitted in the election, it would not result in a legal annexation of the school districts to the Huntsville independent district, for. if the election was illegally called, the vote therein was without any legal effect whatever.

The People, 89 Ill., 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In the last cited case it was held that an election to authorize the issuance of county bonds called by the county court instead of the supervisors of the county as required by law was without authority of law and bonds issued in pursuance thereof were absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We are unable to assent to the correctness of the proposition announced \u25a0by the Court of Civil Appeals in its opinion in this case that because the \u2022county judge in ordering the election copied the resolution passed by the county board of trustees in his order the practical result was that the \u2022election was ordered by such trustees. The record shows that the trustees by resolution merely petitioned the county judge to order the election. They did not attempt to fix the time nor the place for holding \u25a0same. It is essential that the time and place for holding a special election \u2022must either- be fixed by law or appointed by the legally authorized officials. Town of Hendersonville v. Jordan, 150 N. C., 35, 63 S. E., 167; McCrary on Elections, sec. 141; Kenfield v. Irwin, 52 Cal., 164; State v. Young, 4 Iowa, 561; C. J., vol. 20, sec. 87,p. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">If the duty of calling the election in question devolved upon the county board of trustees, then that agency and it alone was authorized to fix the time and place for holding such election. It could not delegate the performance of this duty to the county judge of \u2022 the county. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>It also appears that the Legislature has failed to fix the length of time for giving notice of such an election. In the absence of such provision we think the law applies there must be a reasonable time. C. J., vol. 20, sec. 87, p. 101; Kenfield v. Irwin, 52 Cal., 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">Inasmuch as the Legislature has in a number of statutes calling for elections upon similar questions provided for twenty-one days notice thereof, we think it may be said as a matter of law that the giving of such notice for this length of time would constitute reasonable notice and it is for this reason we answer the third question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We recommend that the questions certified be answered as indicated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Opinion answering certified questions adopted and ordeerd certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">C.
