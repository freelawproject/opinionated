Delta\u2019s Standard Practices Manual Policy 1031.5 entitled \u201cPromotion Procedure\u201d provides that: \u201cIntradepartmental promotions are the responsibility of the department head\u201d and \u201cin each instance, all available sources of information are investigated to insure that every qualified employee is considered and the best qualified is selected.\u201d The policy further provides that: \u201cIt is not necessary to inform the company of your promotional ambitions as Delta considers this a basic desire of all employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">A vacancy in the Buyer position occurred in November, 1989. Following its Policy Manual, Delta considered the qualifications of 36 employees. This was reduced to 17 who were interviewed and the list was reduced to five from whom the selection was made. At that time, Fred Phillips, Mrs. Squires\u2019 supervisor, asked her if she was interested in the position. Her answer to this question is the subject of dispute between the parties. Delta contends that she merely stated that she was not interested. She contends that she was not interested in the position at that time because of her illness which, very shortly thereafter, caused her to take a 90-day unpaid leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">Since this dispute is the basis of our decision, we quote it in full as it was stated by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-18\">A Buyer\u2019s position opened in November, 1989. According to Fred Phillips (Mrs. Squires\u2019 supervisor) it had been over a year since such a position had opened so the purchasing department set in motion the promotion procedure described above. Phillips says he \u201capproached plaintiff and asked her if she was interested in being interviewed and considered for a Buyer position.... [and] she simply told me that she was not interested in being considered. She did not.mention that she was ill or state any reason why she was not interested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>being considered.... I was not aware that she had any illness at that time because [plaintiff] told me that she was not interested in being considered.... She was not considered or interviewed.\u201d Plaintiff testified to a somewhat contrasting scenario in her deposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">A. [Phillips] said that so-and-so would be leaving and would I be interested in the job or bidding for the job being interviewed however they put it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">Q. And what did you respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">A. I said: \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I said: \u201cI am so sick that I am not \u2014 shouldn\u2019t even be here.\u201d And I said: \u201cI can\u2019t handle it.\u201d And that was the beginning of a long illness that I had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">Q. And during that conversation you told Mr. Phillips you weren\u2019t interested because you were sick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">A. Yes. I did. I said: \u201cI can\u2019t handle that job right now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Mrs. Squires took a leave of absence on account of her illness from January 16, 1990 until April 16,1990. In the meantime, another vacancy in the Buyer position had occurred. Instead of following the Policy plan of interviewing all interested parties, Mr. Phillips considered only the group of four employees who had been in the five who were finalists for the November, 1989 promotion. Because Mrs. Squires was not on the 1989 list of four, she was not interviewed or notified of the April, 1990 vacancy and the position was awarded to a younger woman effective May 15, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Thus, after Mrs. Squires had returned to work in good health, she was not considered for the position because of a unilateral decision by Delta not to comply with its established procedure to consider all qualified employees. It considered only the four who had been selected for final competition for the vacancy that occurred in November, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The trial court granted summary judgment to Delta solely on the basis of her failure to make an application for the position. If the factfinder should believe Mrs. Squires\u2019 testimony in which she stated that she was unable to be interviewed for the vacancy in November only because of illness and that she said that this was because she was sick and that she said: \u201cI can\u2019t handle that job right now,\u201d the Court could then, by drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor conclude that she was an applicant for the position. This, then, clearly left open an issue of credibility. Thus, the grant of summary judgment on this issue was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">The judgment of dismissal is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
