Kennedy has appealed to this court and now seeks a stay of execution and a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-10\">The claim now asserted by Kennedy is that his sentencing jury was tainted by a constitutionally deficient instruction concerning the allegedly heinous aspect of the murders and that the Florida Supreme Court failed to cure that constitutional error by conducting a proper harmless error review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kennedy has failed to persuade us that the Florida Supreme Court improperly interposed a procedural bar. In any event, we conclude that the presentation of this claim constitutes an abuse of the writ. Kennedy did not raise this claim in his appeal to this court from the district court\u2019s denial of his first federal habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As to both the procedural bar and the abuse of the writ, we cannot conclude that Kennedy has demonstrated \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cprejudice\u201d or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Sawyer v. Whitley, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992); <em>McCleskey v. Zant, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991). We do not believe that this resolution is debatable among jurists of reason. <em>Barefoot v.
