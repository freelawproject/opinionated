La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 30:2190-91 (West 1989). The district court declared that these statutes are unconstitutional intrusions on Congress\u2019 dormant commerce power. <em>Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Templet, </em>770 F.Supp. 1142, 1153 (M.D.La.1991). The Supreme Court recently held that the Commerce Clause prohibits Alabama from exacting a greater hazardous-waste-disposal tax for hazardous materials generated outside Alabama than it does for those generated in state despite <em>Maine v. Taylor, </em>477 U.S. 131, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986), and the quarantine cases cited by Louisiana in its appeal of this case. <em>Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 2009, 2016-17, 119 L.Ed.2d 121 (1992). So we must affirm the district court\u2019s decision unless Louisiana presents an argument that was inapplicable to <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>facts and prevents operation of the dormant Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-19\">Louisiana argues that Congress, through the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6901 <em>et seq. </em>(RCRA), and the Environmental Protection Agency, authorized Louisiana\u2019s entire hazardous waste program as a satisfactory replacement for the federal minimum standards, thus rendering the challenged statutes an exercise of Congress\u2019 commerce power rather than an affront to it. But we may only find that Congress has permitted states to legislate in derogation of interstate commerce upon an \u201cunmistakably clear ... expression of approval by Congress.\u201d <em>South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke, </em>467 U.S. 82, 91-92, 104 S.Ct. 2237, 2242-43, 81 L.Ed.2d 71 (1984). The Fourth Circuit has held that South Carolina failed to present evidence \u201cindicatpng] an-unmistakably clear congressional intent to permit states to burden interstate commerce\u201d in the RCRA. <em>Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. South Carolina, </em>945 F.2d 781, 792 (4th Cir.1991). Nor does Louisiana present any such evidence in this case. In fact, the RCRA could be read to <em>prohibit </em>state hazardous-waste legislation that burdens interstate commerce. <em>See </em>RCRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6926(b) (state hazardous-waste programs must be \u201cconsistent with the Federal or State programs applicable in other States\u201d); H.R.Rep. No. 1491, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6238, 6268 (\u201cgeneral purpose of having federal minimum standards for hazardous waste disposal, with the option of state implementation of state programs equivalent to the federal program, is (1) it provides uniformity among the states as to how hazardous wastes are regulated ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
