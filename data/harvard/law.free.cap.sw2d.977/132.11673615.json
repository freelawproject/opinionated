The trial court sentenced Defendant, Kenneth Leath, to six (6) years incarceration in the Department of Correction as a Range II offender for his conviction of burglary in violation of Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-14-402. In a three (3) count indictment, the Defendant was originally charged with one (1) count of burglary, one (1) count of theft of property less than $500.00 value, and one (1) count of vandalism in an amount less than $500.00. The Defendant\u2019s guilty plea was entered on July 16, 1997. On that date, a document styled \u201cPlea of Guilty and Waiver of Jury Trial and Appeal\u201d was signed by the Defendant, his counsel, and the Assistant District Attorney. That document specifically states that the sentence to be imposed upon the negotiated plea agreement pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure, was an eight (8) year, Range II sentence in the Department of Correction. The theft and vandalism charges were to be dismissed. At the guilty plea hearing, the trial court agreed to allow the Defendant to plead guilty, but unilaterally reduced the length of sentence to six (6) years. We reverse and remand this ease to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">The pertinent portion of the guilty plea hearing is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">[ASSISTANT D.A.]: Your Honor please, Mr. Leath is pleading in 97-54 to burglary of a building, a Class E[sie] felony which carries a range of punishment of two to twelve years. Pursuant to our agreement, we\u2019re asking that the second count, theft of property, and the third count, which is vandalism, be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-17\">The State on a trial in this matter would show that on October the 3rd, 1996 in Madison County, the Defendant did unlawfully enter a building, to-wit, Sunbelt Screen Printers in Madison County, without the consent of the owner and with the intent to commit theft of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-18\">The State recommends upon a plea of guilty a sentence of eight years as a Range II offender. We recommend that there be no fine, and we recommend that this is to be served in the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ment of Corrections [sic] and to run consecutively to any prior convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">THE COURT: Mr. Leath, is that what you understood the recommendation to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">THE COURT: All right. I find your decision to plead guilty has been made freely, that you\u2019ve had the advice of a lawyer whom you say you\u2019re satisfied. [sic]. I\u2019ll accept the recommendation of the District Attorney with the exception I\u2019m going to make it six years rather than eight years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAJd\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">[ASSISTANT DA]: Your Honor, this was done pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C). Note the State\u2019s objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">THE COURT: Note the State\u2019s exception. You\u2019re now sentenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">[ASSISTANT DA]: For the record, the State withdraws its recommendation and would ask that it be set for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">THE COURT: The Court denies that. He\u2019s sentenced. You may take your appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAxL\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">[ASSISTANT DA]: Just for the record, I want to point out, it\u2019s done pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C), which the State\u2019s position is that the Court can either accept or reject the plea and cannot modify it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">THE COURT: All right, note your exception. Motion is overruled. Your exception is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">The Defendant initially challenges the right of the State to appeal pursuant to Rule 3 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure. Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-402 allows the State in a criminal case to appeal from the length, range, or manner of the service of a sentence imposed by the sentencing court. However, subsection (b) limits an appeal from a sentence under that code section to one or more of the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">(1) The court improperly sentenced the defendant to the wrong sentence range;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">(2) The court granted all or part of the sentence on probation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-17\">(3) The court ordered all or part of the sentences to run concurrently;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-18\">(4) The court improperly found the defendant to be an especially mitigated offender; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-19\">(5) The enhancement and mitigating factors were not weighed properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">Based upon a fair reading of Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-402, none of the conditions of an appeal by the State are applicable to the situation in this case. Under Rule 3(c) of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure, the State can appeal from an order of the trial court where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-21\">(1) The substantive effect of which results in dismissing an indictment, information, or complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-22\">(2) Setting aside a verdict of guilty and entering a judgment of acquittal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-23\">(3) Arresting judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-24\">(4) Granting or refusing to revoke probation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-25\">(5) Remanding a child to the juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-26\">Rule 3(e) of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure also provides that the State may appeal from a final judgment in a habe-as corpus, extradition, or post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-27\">The State diligently filed a notice of appeal on July 28, 1997, twelve (12) days after the trial court\u2019s action in the guilty plea hearing. While a judgment has been entered reflecting a sentence of six (6) years in the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ment of Correction, the judgment includes the following notation: \u201cThe court rejects the State\u2019s recommendation to the agreed sentence of 8 year\u2019s, Eg II and modifies the sentence to 6 yrs, Kg II, over the State\u2019s objection.\u201d The judgment was filed on July 28, 1997, the same date that the notice of appeal was filed by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">We agree with the Defendant that the State cannot appeal as of right pursuant to Eule 3 of the Tennessee Eules of Appellate Procedure from the trial court\u2019s disposition in this case. In addition, Eules 9 and 10 of the Tennessee Eules of Appellate Procedure pertain to interlocutory orders of the trial court and in this case a final judgment has been entered. However, we feel the State is not without a remedy. Tennessee Code Annotated section 27-8-101, commonly referred to as the \u201ccommon-law writ of certiorari\u201d provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">The writ of certiorari may be granted whenever authorized by law, and also in all cases where an inferior tribunal ... has exceeded the jurisdiction conferred, or is acting illegally, when, in the judgment of the court, there is no other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy. This section does not apply to actions governed by the Tennessee Eules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">As summarized by the Tennessee Court of Appeals,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">The writ of certiorari lies at common law to review and supervise the proceedings of inferior tribunals, but does not take the place of appeal or writ of error, and brings up the entire record to determine whether there has been an excess or absence of jurisdiction, <em>or failure to proceed according to the essential requirements of the law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\"><em>Clark v. Metro. Gov. of Nashville, </em>827 S.W.2d 312, 316 (Tenn.App.1991) (emphasis added) <em>(citing Conners v. City of Knoxville, </em>136 Tenn. 428, 189 S.W. 870 (1916)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Therefore, the proper procedure for the State to seek review of the trial court\u2019s disposition in this case would have been by writ of certiorari. However, we do not feel that it is in the interests of justice in this case to dismiss the appeal. Our supreme court has held that it has the authority to transform an appeal improperly filed under Eule 3 of the Tennessee Eules of Appellate Procedure into a proper appeal under Eule 10 of the Tennessee Eules of Appellate Procedure. <em>State v. Gallaher, </em>730 S.W.2d 622, 623 (Tenn.1987). Our court has also held that it has the same power over appeals filed in this court. <em>State v. James Doe, </em>No. 01C01-9102-CR-00046, 1992 WL 521516, Lexis 971, slip op. at 3, Davidson County (Tenn.Crim.App., Nashville, June 29, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Eule 36(a) of the Tennessee Eules of Appellate Procedure provides in part that the court of criminal appeals \u201cshall grant the relief on the law and facts to which the party is entitled or the proceeding otherwise requires and may grant any relief, including the giving of any judgment and making of any order....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Thus, we shall treat this matter as a petition for writ of certiorari by the State, and we proceed to determine the matter on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">The \u201cPlea of Guilty and Waiver of Jury Trial and Appeal\u201d form signed by the Defendant, his counsel, and the Assistant District Attorney unequivocally states that the negotiated guilty plea is entered pursuant to Eule 11(e)(1)(C) of the Tennessee Eules of Criminal Procedure. That rule specifically states that the parties \u201c[ajgree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">Our supreme court has held that \u201c[tjhere is no provision in Eule 11(e) [Tenn. K.Crim. P.] that permits the trial court to alter the agreement if the plea is being entered under subsection (1)(C).\u201d <em>State v. Grady Hargrove, No. </em>01S01-9203-CC-00035, 1993 WL 300759, slip op. at 3, Humphreys County (Tenn., Nashville, Aug. 9,1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">The Defendant argues that Eule 11(e)(4) of the Tennessee Eules of Criminal Procedure permits the trial court to reduce the length of the sentence in a negotiated plea agreement. That rule provides that the trial court must, if it rejects a plea agreement, advise the defendant that if he or she persists in a guilty plea the disposition of the case may be less favorable for the defendant than that contemplated by the plea agreement. In addition to the fact that the supreme court has implicitly rejected this argument in <em>Har-grove, </em>we further note that Eule 11(e)(4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>contemplates the trial court rejecting the entire plea agreement and by necessity the guilty plea of the defendant. The warning is for the defendant who might desire to proceed and enter a guilty plea notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s rejection of the entire plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court accepted all portions of the negotiated plea agreement except the length of the sentence. For unexplained reasons, the trial court unilaterally decided to reduce the length of the sentence which had been agreed upon by the parties pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We conclude that the trial court exceeded its authority by unilaterally reducing the sentence, thus\u2019failing to proceed with-the essential requirements of the law. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed and this case remanded to the trial court. If the trial court still rejects the negotiated agreement as set forth in the \u201cPlea of Guilty and Waiver of Jury Trial and Appeal\u201d signed on July 16, 1997 and filed of record on July 17, 1997, then the State shall be entitled to present proof at a sentencing hearing if the Defendant chooses to persist in a plea of guilty to all counts of the indictment without an agreed disposition. Of course, the parties can further negotiate for a different agreement if the trial court continues to reject the negotiated plea agreement previously entered into between the parties. If the trial court accepts the previously signed agreement upon remand, judgment shall be entered reflecting that Defendant is sentenced to serve eight (8) years in the Department of Correction as a Range II offender under the terms and conditions of the agreement signed on July 16,1997.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-7\">PEAY and SUMMERS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
