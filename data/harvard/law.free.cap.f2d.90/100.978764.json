On January 7, 1935, he filed his amended petition asking t\u00f3 be adjudged a bankrupt, pursuant to subsection (s) of section 75 (Frazier-Lemke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Act of June 28, 1934, c. 869, 48 Stat. 1289-1291), and, on the same day, the court made such order of adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">On May 27, 1935, the Supreme Court, in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U.S. 555, 55 S.Ct. 854, 79 L.Ed. 1593, 97 A.L.R. 1106, held that subsection (s) of section 75 (Frazier-Lemke Act of June 28, 1934) was unconstitutional. On August 28, 1935, subsection (s) of section 75 was amended by the new Frazier-Lemke Act, c. 792, \u00a7 6, 49 Stat. 943-945 (11 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 203 (s) (5). Paragraph 5 of subsection (s), as amended, provides : \u201cThis Act [title] [meaning, of course, the Bankruptcy Act, including section 75 and all subsections thereof and all amendments thereto, including the present amendment] shall be held to apply to all existing cases now pending in any Federal court, under this Act [title], as well as to future cases; and all cases that have been dismissed by any conciliation commissioner, referee, or court because of the. Supreme Court decision holding the former subsection (s) unconstitutional, shall be promptly reinstated, without any additional filing fees or charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On October 4, 1935, appellant moved the District Court to dismiss this proceeding, \u201cupon the ground that no composition or extension agreement can be had between [appellee] and his creditors.\u201d The District Court granted appellant\u2019s motion <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and dismissed the proceeding on October 14, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">On March 16, 1936, appellee petitioned the District Court for an order permitting appellee to file a new petition under section 75 and restraining appellant from interfering with appellee\u2019s possession of property described in the new petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, on March 16, 1936, the court entered such an order and, on the same day, appellee filed his new petition, thereby reinstating the proceeding which had been dismissed. Compare Diller v. Shoemaker (C.C.A.9) 90 F. (2d) 98. The restraining order was merely incidental to such reinstatement. Compare Meyer v. Kenmore Granville Hotel Co., 297 U.S. 160, 165, 56 S.Ct. 405, 80 L.Ed. 557; In re Harris (C.C.A.9) 78 F.(2d) 849; Holmes v. Davidson (C.C.A.9) 84 F.(2d) 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">On March 25, 1936, appellant moved the District Court to vacate and dissolve the restraining order. The District Court on March 30, 1936, made an order denying appellant\u2019s motion, \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d and thereafter, on April 8, 1936, made an order purporting to allow this appeal. Allowance by this court was not sought or obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">This being a bankruptcy proceeding, the orders here sought to be reviewed were not appealable under sections 128(b) and 129 of the Judicial Code, as amended by 43 Stat. 936, 937, \u00a7 1 [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 225(b), 227].<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sections 128(b) and 129 have no application to bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy appeals are governed by section 128(c) of the Judicial Code, as amended by 43 Stat. 936, \u00a7 1 [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 225(c)],<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and sections 24 and 25 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, 44 Stat. 664, 665 (11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 47, 48) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The orders here sought to be reviewed were not orders made in a \u201ccontroversy\u201d arising in bankruptcy and were, therefore, not appealable under section 24(a) of the Bankruptcy Act. They were made in a \u201cproceeding\u201d in bankruptcy, but were not \u201cjudgments\u201d appealable under section 25(a) of the Bankruptcy Act. They were not appealable at all, as of right. Section 24 (b) of the Bankruptcy Act empowers this court to review such orders, but provides that such power \u201cshall be exercised by appeal . . . to be allowed in the discretion of the appellate court.\u201d The District Court has no jurisdiction to allow such appeals.

Davidson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Since the\u2019 District Court h\u00e1d no jurisdiction to allow this appeal, and since there has been no allowance nor any request for allowance thereof by this court, and since the time within which an appeal might have been allowed<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> has long since expired, this appeal must be, and is hereby, dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-15\"> Section 75, comprising subsections (a) to (r), inclusive, was added to the Bankruptcy Act by the Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, \u00a7 1, 47 Stat. 1470-1473.
