He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of $500 and to be imprisoned for one year. Thereafter he filed a motion to set aside or modify the judgment and sentence and a motion for a new trial, both of which were denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Appellee has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was not taken within the time allowed by the rules of practice and procedure prescribed by the Supreme Court on May 7, 1934, pursuant to the Act of February 24, 1933, c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, 47 Stat. 904, as amended by the Act of March 8, 1934, c. 49, 48 Stat. 399 (28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 723a).

The motion for a new trial was filed on Friday, September 25, 1936, 'two days after expiration of the three-day period specified in subdivision (2) of rule 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The motion, therefore, could not and did not extend the time for taking an appeal. That time expired on Friday, September 25, 1936. This appeal was taken on Friday, October 2, 1936, just a week too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-21\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-32\">Not being upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, the motion did not come within subdivision (3) of rule 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
