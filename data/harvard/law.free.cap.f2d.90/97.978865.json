These features enabled it to be expanded, snapped on the tire, and to hold itself in place, and this when inclosing^ different sizes of tires. These elements are not in the defendant\u2019s box-like cover, which, although having some flexibility, has no retractile power. Moreover, it is clamped into place by a toggle lock.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-26\">So regarding, we affirm, on the opinion of the court below, its decree that the first patent was not infringed and the second was invalid for lack of -invention.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
