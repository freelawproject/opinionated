Thereafter the Companies brought this suit against the Board and its individual members, the trial examiner designated to conduct such hearing, and George Pratt, attorney for the Board, seeking a temporary and permanent injunction against the prosecution of the complaint and the enforcement of the National Labor Relations Act against the Companies.' Service was had only on Pratt and Lyons.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">The bill of complaint admitted that the scope and nature of the business carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>on by the Lead Company and the Mining Company were as specifically alleged in the Complaint of the Board but denied that the Companies were engaged in interstate commerce and alleged that each of their several operations were independent and were carried out wholly within the limits of a state.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">A hearing was had on the application- for a temporary injunction. The trial court found that the mining, smelting and manufacturing operations of the Companies do not constitute and do not affect interstate commerce and granted a temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">From the order granting the temporary injunction, Lyons, trial examiner and Pratt, attorney for the Board, have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The evidence at- the hearing showed that the production of raw materials, the processing and manufacture thereof and the sale and distribution of the finished products are carried on by the Companies as an integrated business enterprise; that the raw materials are mined or purchased and transported across state lines where they are processed and manufactured; that partially processed materials are transported across state lines to other plants where the processing and manufacture thereof is completed ; that the manufactured products are in part concentrated at a central warehouse at Chicago and that they are advertised, sold and distributed throughout the United States and foreign countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">It further established that the suspension of any one of the three principal operations, the mining, the smelting and refining, and the manufacturing, by industrial strife would greatly curtail, and probably force a suspension of the others and would have a serious effect upon the flow of interstate commerce between the points of the several operations and from the point where the finished product is produced, into the channels of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Since the decision of the trial court, the Supreme Court has construed the National Labor Relations Act and sustained its validity. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. -, National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Company, 57 S.Ct. 645, 81 L.Ed. - (decided April 12, 1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">We conclude that the Board was proceeding within its lawful powers and that the temporary injunction should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">We further conclude that the bill is witho'ut equity and that the Companies are not entitled to the relief sought. It follows, notwithstanding this is an appeal from an order granting a temporary injunction, that this court has power to consider the case on its merits and direct a dismissal of the bill. Boynton v. Fox West Coast Theatres Corporation (C.C.A.10) 60 F.(2d) 851, 855; Alexander v. Mid-Continent P. Corporation (C.C.A.10) 51 F.(2d) 735, 736; Consolidated Cement Corporation v. Pratt (C.C.A. 10) 47 F.(2d) 90, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The cause is remanded with instructions to vacate the temporary injunction and dismiss the bill at the cost of the complainants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-16\"> Act of July 5, 1935, <em>49 </em>Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 151-166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-17\"> Herein referred to collectively as the Companies and individually as the Lead Company and the Mining Company, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
