The District Court made such order of adjudication on September 28, 1935. On January 21, 1936, appellee, a creditor of appellant, moved to dismiss the proceeding, on the ground that subsection (s) of section 75, as amended by the Frazier-Lemke Act of August 28, 1935, was unconstitutional. On that ground alone the District Court on February 18, 1936, granted appellee\u2019s motion and dismissed the proceeding. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-20\">Since this appeal was heard, the Supreme Court has, in Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank, 57 S.Ct. 556, 81 L.Ed. -, decided March 29, 1937, held that subsection (s) of section 75, as amended by the Frazier-Lemke Act of August 28, 1935, is constitutional. Thus the ground on which the District Court dismissed this proceeding is now seen to be untenable. Compare Diller v. Shoemaker (C.C.A.9) 90 F.(2d) 98, this.day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-23\">Order reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A4H\"> Section 75, comprising subsections (a) to (r), inclusive, was added to the Bankruptcy Act by the Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, \u00a7 1, 47 Stat. 1470-147&amp; Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>sections (a) and (b) were amended by the Act of June 7, 1934, c. 424, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, 48 Stat. 925.
