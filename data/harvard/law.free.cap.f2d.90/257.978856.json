Jones, of Chicago, 111., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b312-9\">Before GRAHAM, Presiding Judge, and BLAND, HATFIELD, GARRETT, and LENROOT, Associate Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b312-10\">GARRETT, Associate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">This is a trade-mark opposition proceeding in which appellee (hereinafter referred to as opposer) opposes the application of appellant for registration of the word \u201cNeedleized\u201d as a trade-mark for cotton piece goods. It comes to us by appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents affirming the decision of the Examiner of Interferences sustaining the opposition and denying the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">In its notice of opposition opposer plead its ownership, registration, and use.of the word \u201cNeedle-Thrift\u201d for \u201ccotton piece goods \u2014 namely, muslin, cambric, long-cloth and nainsook.\u201d This registration (No. 149,-234) bears date of December 6, 1921, with use alleged \u201csince July 16, 1920.\u201d Appellant\u2019s application was filed April 23, 1934, with use alleged \u201csince about April 1, 1933.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">The goods of the respective parties are obviously identical. So, the ultimate question to be determined is whether the application of the marks \u201cNeedleized\u201d and \u201cNeedle-Thrift\u201d tq identical merchandise would be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers. However, certain collateral or subsidiary issues are raised and argued by appellant to which we give attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">The notice of opposition, which was sworn to, alleged ownership and continuous use by opposer of its mark \u201cNeedle-Thrift\u201d to identify its cotton piece goods; also, it alleged the spending of \u201csubstantial sums to advertise its said trade-mark for said goods.\u201d In connection with its certificate of registration, the notice averred: \u201cSaid registration is still in full force and effect.\u201d It contained the usual allegation of belief that it would be damaged by the grant of appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">In its answer (not sworn to) appellant, among other things, stated: \u201c * * * Applicant admits that opposer obtained from the United States Patent Office on December 6, 1921, a certificate of registration No. 149,234 covering the term \u201cNeedle-Thrift\u201d with respect to muslin, cambric, long cloth and nainsook cotton piece goods and that said registration is subsisting, but denies that opposer was entitled to obtain said registration and that the application therefor met the requirements of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">The answer alleged that opposer\u2019s use of its mark, \u201cif used in any manner,\u201d was not as a trade-mark \u201cbut merely as an indication of grade or quality.\u201d Also, appellant cited numerous registrations to other parties which included the word \u201cneedle\u201d in combination with different prefixes and suffixes and, in some instances, with other words, such registrations apparently being for goods similar to the goods of the respective parties here involved. It was alleged that all the registrations so cited were obtained subsequent to the date of opposer\u2019s registration. Further, appellant cited a registration to it of a composite mark, which included as one element the word \u201cNeedleized,\u201d granted September 26, 1933. By way of \u201caffirmative defense\u201d appellant recited the difference in the marks, denied that \u201cNeedleized\u201d and \u201cNeedle-Thrift\u201d are confusingly similar \u201cwithin the meaning of any clause or section of the Trade-Mark Act\u201d and also denied that its proposed mark \u201cis by it applied to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as such merchandise, if there be any, as may be sold by opposer under the notation \u2018Needle-Thrift\u2019.\u201d As has been already indicated, this latter denial is obviously futile, since the goods of the parties* are virtually identical, and this particular issue requires no further attention. The answer does not contain any denial of, or reference to, opposer\u2019s allegation as to damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Neither party took testimony in the case, but prior to the expiration of the time set for completing opposer\u2019s testimony in chief (such time having been extended by stipulation of counsel), counsel for opposer gave notice to counsel for appellant (such notice purporting to be under Patent Office Rule 154 (e) that opposer proposed to use \u201cas evidence\u201d certain described documents. One of those consisted of a copy of opposer\u2019s registration of \u201cNeedle-Thrift,\u201d No. 149,-234. The other items consisted of advertising matter, many of them alleged to have appeared in different of opposer\u2019s copyrighted catalogues.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Following receipt of the notice appellant filed motion that opposer be required to show cause why the opposition should not be dismissed. In this motion, which is of record, we do not find any objection made to the introduction by opposer of the documents described in the notice, nor do we find where objection was elsewhere made. The objection in the motion goes not to their introduction, but to their sufficiency to support the allegations of opposer as to use of the trade-mark, \u201cprobable injury * * * confusion in trade or other allegations in the notice of opposition contained.\u201d The gravamen of appellant\u2019s motion was that opposer should be required to substantiate its allegations by \u201ctestimony,\u201d and that it had failed so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The motion to show cause was granted, and opposer filed reply thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Upon the record so presented, the Examiner of Interferences rendered the decision which the Commissioner of Patents affirmed. It is not discernible from the decisions that the \u201cNotice under Rule 154 (E),\u201d to which appellant\u2019s counsel has devoted extensive attention before us, entered into the consideration of the case by either the Examiner of Interferences or the Commissioner. Neither decision makes any reference to it. Therefore, we are unable to see wherein any matter concerning it requires discussion or determination by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Already it has been recited that, in its answer, appellant, while denying that opposer owns the mark, admitted that op-poser obtained the registration and that such registration is \u201csubsisting.\u201d It is noted that appellant in the same paragraph of the answer also \u201cdenies that opposer was entitled to obtain said registration and that the application therefor met the requirements of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905.\u201d Upon what state of facts or theory of law this latter averment rests we are not informed. The denial of ownership is inconsistent with the admission of the obtaining and subsistence of the registration. Registration of a mark is prima facie evidence of its ownership. Section 16, Trade-Mark Act of 1905 (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96). The denial of the right of opposer to obtain the registration and the claim that opposer\u2019s application did not meet the requirements of the trade-mark registration act go to the question of the validity of opposer\u2019s mark. The validity of a registered mark may not be attacked in an opposition proceeding. In the case of American Fruit Growers, Inc., v. Michigan Fruit Growers, Inc., 38 F.(2d) 696, 698, 17 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 906, 910, we said: \u201cSo far as we are aware, appellant was entitled to the registration of its mark for irse on its products, * * * if it was inadvertently registered, those injured by such registration have a statutory remedy \u2014 application for cancellation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Upon the question of use by opposer of its mark as a trade-mark, which counsel for appellant insists is placed in issue by denial of such use in the answer, it need only be said, first, that ownership implies use and, second, that under the rule announced by this court in John Wood Manufacturing Co. v. Servel, Inc., 77 F.(2d) 946, 22 C.C. P.A. (Patents) 1370, one may oppose a registration upon showing merely a \u201cgrade-mark\u201d or \u201ctrade-name\u201d use when such use is analogous to a trade-mark use, and the answer of appellant in this case virtually admits a use of \u201cNeedle-Thrift\u201d by opposer to indicate \u201cgrade or quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Counsel for appellant seems aggrieved because counsel for opposer failed, or was not required by the Examiner of Interferences, to call officials of appellee company, or other witnesses, to the end that he might cross-examine them, and argues that there was not a compliance with the statement issued to the respective parties by the Examiner of Interferences, saying that \u201cthe practice of United States equity courts will be followed in pleading and procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">The brief on behalf of appellant, after pointing^ out the matters denied in the answer, says: \u201cWhy has the opposer, the validity of its registration being thus challenged, taken no testimony and adduced no proof on that or any other issue raised by \u25a0 the denials and averments of applicant\u2019s answer? The explanation seems obvious. No such proof was available. Had witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>been called in the attempt to make such proof, they would have been subjected to the test of cross-examination, but the opportunity to thus ascertain the truth of the matter has been denied applicant\u2019s counsel. Certainly it is not to be expected, under Federal equity practice, that applicant should go to the trouble of taking testimony when there has been an entire default in that respect by the complaining party, who carries the burden of proof, and we indulge the presumption that citations on this point are unnecessary to supplement the legal knowledge of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The foregoing indicates that counsel for appellant overlooked the effect of the statutory provision making a registration prima facie evidence of ownership, and overlooked also the universally applied maxim, \u201cEquity follows the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Upon the record and in view of the admission in appellant\u2019s answer, we do not think that the validity or the use of op-poser\u2019s mark was so challenged as to require the taking of testimony by opposer upon those questions, and we know of no authority lodged in the Examiner of Interferences to require opposer to call witnesses for the purpose of giving counsel for an applicant the opportunity to cross-examine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As for the registration to other parties of marks containing the word \u201cneedle\u201d and that to appellant containing as a part thereof the word \u201cNeedleized,\u201d the brief on behalf of appellant makes the concession that \u201cunder decisions of this Court, the several registrations referred to are not conclusive upon the question of applicant\u2019s right to registration,\u201d but it is claimed that they \u201cshould be viewed as establishing the fact that the opposer is not entitled to monopolize the prefix \u2018Needle\u2019 which is the only point of resemblance between its notation \u2018Needle-Thrift\u2019 and the notation \u2018Needleized\u2019 sought to be registered.\u201d Also \u201claches and acquiescence\u201d on the part of opposer is alleged, which it is claimed should estop opposer from opposing appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Under numerous decisions of this court in which we followed the rule established by other courts these contentions must be overruled. American Fruit Growers, Inc., v. Michigan Fruit Growers, Inc., supra; Skookum Packers\u2019 Association v. Pacific Northwest Canning Co., 45 F.(2d) 912, 18 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">From the record here presented, we think the case must be determined solely upon the question of the similarity of the marks. If they are so similar that confusion would likely result from their use, nothing which either party might do, or fail to do, by pleadings or by testimony, can alter that fundamental fact, and this constitutes a bar by the terms of the .statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Just what the words mean in the relation in which they are used as trademarks is not clear to us. So far as the record is concerned, we do not find any suggestion that they are merely descriptive of the character or quality of the goods. Were such the case, both marks should be barred from registration. So far as we can discern, the words have no particular meaning, as used, and, for the purposes of this case, we accept them as constituting arbitrary marks. So viewing them, we concur with the tribunals of the Patent Office in the holding that there is such a similarity between them that confusion would be likely from their use upon goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
