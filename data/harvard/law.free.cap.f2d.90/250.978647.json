Shinner &amp; Co., 82 F.(2d) 68. It was there shown that although no controversy existed between appellee and its employees, none of whom belonged to appellants\u2019 union, the latter sought to compel appellee to require of its employees that they join the union as a condition of their continued employment. We held on the authority of United Electric Coal Companies v. Rice (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 1, that the facts there present presented no labor dispute, hence the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101 et seq. was no bar to the right of the court to issue the temporary injunction, and under those facts there was no error in the issuance of such injunction. See, also, Scavenger Service Corp. v. Courtney (C.C.A.) 85 F.(2d) 825; Newton v. Laclede Steel Co. (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-21\">Appellants state that the issues here involved are practically identical with those of the former case, and challenge the correctness of this court\u2019s decision in that case. That decision was based on our interpretation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and our construction of the statute has become the \u201claw of the case,\u201d not to be changed unless it is clearly erroneous and unsound. Zurich General Accident &amp; Liability Ins. Co. v. O\u2019Keefe (C.C.A.) 64 F.(2d) 768; International Brotherhood v. Western Union Tel. Co. (C.C.A.) 46 F.(2d) 736; Radio Corp. v. DeForest Radio Co. (C.C.A.) 47 F.(2d) 606. We are not convinced that our holding in the former case was in error, hence cannot disturb the decree of the District Court based on that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-22\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
