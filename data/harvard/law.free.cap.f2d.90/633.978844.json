HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b687-25\">This is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment entered upon a directed verdict in an action to recover under a policy of fire insurance for loss on certain liquors. The property insured belonged to the plaintiff and its subsidiaries and was stored in a number of warehouses in various places; the loss occurred on April 28, 1934, in the warehouses of James E. Pepper Co. Inc. at Lexington, Kentucky. The policy was one of twenty-four on the same risk, the defendant\u2019s share being for five per cent; it ran from October 1, 1933, to October 1, 1934, though it was executed on January 17, 1934. The stock at each warehouse varied from time to time, as it was sold and replenished, and the policy was for a provisional sum of $950,000 \u20145% of $19,000,000, which was not fixed as a maximum. There was merely a maximum for each of seventeen specified \u201clocations,\u201d with a concluding general limit of $1,000,000 for all other \u201clocations.\u201d The maximum in the case of the Pepper Company \u2014 and in a number of other companies \u2014 was $2,000,000 on \u201cany one building,\u201d but without limit as to the number of buildings at Lexington, Kentucky; in effect there was therefore no maximum. In order to make the premium follow the changing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>values, the policy contained the following clause: \u201cPremium Adjustment Clause. The premium named in this policy is provisional only. The actual premium consideration for liability assumed hereunder shall be arrived at by the following method: A. It is a condition of this policy that the assured shall report to this company not later than- days after the last day of each month the exact location of all property covered hereunder, the total value of such property in each location, and any other insurance in force at each of such locations on the last day of each month.\u201d It was \u201ca condition of this policy that if at the time of any loss the insured has failed to file with this company reports as above required, the liability of this company shall be limited to the location and amounts included in the last report of value filed prior to the loss.\u201d The first defence \u2014 a partial one \u2014 is that the insured had violated this condition and became subject to this limit. The facts regarding this are as follows. The person who had conducted, the preliminary negotiations for the plaintiff testified that he had told the defendant\u2019s agent that he would not accept any date in the reporting clause, because the plaintiff\u2019s business was expanding so fast that the reports could not keep pace with it. The defendant\u2019s agent answered that he would \u201cgo along with what the other companies were doing,\u201d and was told that with one exception they had agreed to leave the date blank. The policy was then signed, and while the defendant\u2019s agent denied this talk, he admitted that he had noticed the blank at the time of execution. The judge found \u2014 upon a motion for verdict by both sides \u2014 that the failure to fill in the blank was deliberate, and indeed so much cannot be disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The plaintiff was extremely dilatory in making reports; that for the month of October was filed on December 29th, nearly a month late; that for November, on January 11, 1934, eleven days late; that for December, on February 21st, twenty-one days late; and that for January, 1934, on May 1, 1934, two months late and after the fire. Meanwhile the stocks in the warehouses at Lexington, had grown from $500,000 in October to about $700,000 in January and February; in March they were more than $2,200,000, and in April, about $2,600,000. The defendant argues that, if it is liable for anything at all, the limit is the values of the December report.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The second defence \u2014 a total one \u2014 arises from another clause in the policy. The coverage was upon \u201cgoods * * * the property of the assured, or held in trust, or on consignment, or for which the assured may be liable in the event of loss or damage,\u201d and the policy provided that it should be \u201cvoid if the insured has concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or the subject thereof, or in case of any fraud or false swearing by the insured touching any matter relating to this insurance or the subject thereof, whether before or after a loss.\u201d From October 1, 1933, forward, the Pepper Company held in its warehouses for storage about $250,000 of liquors, as bailee for others, only $86,000' of which was insured, and that by other underwriters. The plaintiff included none of these goods in its reports, and claimed nothing for their loss, not being liable to the bailors. The defendant\u2019s theory is that the policy covered them; that corresponding premiums should have been paid upon them; and that the insured had therefore concealed a fact material to the risk, and been guilty of a fraud; either one of whiich avoided the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Taking up first the partial defence, the policy, unless limited, covered all liquors, which were \u201cthe property of the assured * * * contained in * * * warehouses * * * within the limits of the United States excluding Texas\u201d; that language was general, and the limitation of $19,000,000 being only provisional, the only express limitation was $2,000,0(30 for any one warehouse which was not exceeded. The insurer depended for its protection upon the monthly reports; if the insured fell into default, the coverage was limited to the value in the last report. But if he did not, the insurer accepted any increase during the interval; there was no limit, so long as the insured was not in default. The insurer insists first that the omission to fill the blank could not in any event give the insured more than thirty days; the reports were to be \u201cmonthly.\u201d So they were, but they were hot necessarily to be filed within the next month; that depended upon how long a time the insurer was ready to assume the risk of unknown increases in stocks; it might be willing to do so for more\" than a month; indeed, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>gave ample evidence that it was. Next, the insurer argues that if the time was not so limited, at least it ought to be limited to a reasonable time. Perhaps that is true; clearly the insured had to file reports at some time. Even so, the insurer has not proved that the delay was unreasonable, considering the work to be done; we do not know anything about the conditions. Moreover, if we did, and if the insured, so judged, had been dilatory, the insurer was bound to protest; for there was really an implied contract that he should, at least so long as the insured was acting in good faith. The law does not regard a man\u2019s actual intent, but only what a reasonable person, placed like him, would have intended. Here we are to assume that the insured, though actually delaying unreasonably, did not suppose that it was. The trouble to the insurer was very slight of protesting that the delay was imperilling its own interests; the consequence to the insured of not doing so was very grave, when the stocks were increasing. Most insurers wotdd give such a warning; most insured would expect one; ordinarily both would understand that unless one was given the time to file ran on. Therefore it did run on. Finally, although legally it may be immaterial, the delay, even if thirty days were taken as the limit, did not prejudice the insurer. The last report due was for February and the stocks were substantially the same for February as for January. It was only in March that the great increase took place and the insurer would not have known of this on April 28, 1934. The partial defence is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The total defence depends upon whether the insured fell within the scope of the clause which avoided the policy if it \u201chas concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance.\u201d Even though we assume with the insurer that the words, \u201cheld in trust,\u201d covered the hailed goods, the insured <em>\"had </em>concealed\u201d nothing material at the date from which the policy spoke \u2014 October 1, 1933. And, if one insists that the actual date of execution, January 17, 1934, must be taken, or that the warranty is promissory, the same result follows. Article 10 prescribed that \u201cin case of loss the liability hereunder shall not exceed that proportion of such loss, which the last reported value * * * bears to the actual value of the property at that location at the time of such report.\u201d True, if the insured had misrepresented the value o\u00ed goods at any \u201clocation\u201d fraudulently, that would have voided the policy, for the clause so provides, and probably it was unnecessary anyway. But the insurer nowhere alleged any fraud, or proved any; the insured never meant to recover for the bailed goods. Fraud aside, the clause was merely another limitation of liability. The value of the goods in December was about $700,000, and the bailed goods were worth about $240,000; therefore, the clause would at most have cut the recovery to about three-quarters of the total loss, including the hailed liquors themselves. It is enough that no such partial defence was pleaded, proved or even argued, either in the trial court or here; and it is exceedingly doubtful, if it could have ever been made good if it had. The clause was in substance the usual \u201ccoinsurance clause,\u201d inserted in order to secure full valuation and thus to protect the instircr against the greater risks of partial losses. If it had appeared that the insured did not mean' to include the bailed goods at all and that the insurer knew it, the clause did not apply. We know that the insured did not mean to include them, and we cannot say that the Insurer would have been able to prove that it did not understand that the insured did not. Moreover, even if it had succeeded, at best the insured had merely mistaken the meaning of its policy; it is doubtful whether the clause extends to such situations. Atlantic Fruit Co. v.
