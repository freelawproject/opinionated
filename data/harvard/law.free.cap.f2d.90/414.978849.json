(defendant below), and secured by a chattel trust, and (2) from the order confirming the sale of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-25\">The material facts are substantially as follows: In 1931 appellant Ballard Company held a conditional sale lien on furniture located in the Hay-Adams House, a hotel in this District, which lien was superior to a chattel trust lien on the same furniture held by the Wardman Real Estate Properties, Inc. (hereinafter called the Real Estate Company). On May 2d of that year the two companies entered into a written agreement \u201cpertaining to disposition of liens\u201d held by the Ballard Company, and \u201cin order to adjust the difference and claims of the respective parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-26\">The \u201cagreed valuation of the furniture\u201d was fixed by the contract at $50,000, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>interest of the Ballard Company therein was determined to be 12 per cent., namely $6,000, which amount the Real Estate Company agreed to pay and did pay immediately. It was further agreed that the Real Estate Company should take such steps as it \u201cmay be advised to sell, repossess or otherwise dispose of the furniture,\u201d and that in the event the Real Estate Company \u201cshould sell or otherwise dispose of said furniture * * * by sale, public or private, release of liens or otherwise, so that the said furniture * * * shall be acquired by any person * * * for a sum in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars,\u201d the Real Estate Company would pay the Ballard Company \u201ca further sum equivalent to 12% of such sum in excess\u201d of $50,000, after deducting expenses; and that should the Real Estate Company \u201creceive any sum on account of the said obligation secured by the aforesaid liens in excess of\u201d $50,000, it would pay to the Ballard Company \"a further sum equivalent to 12% of such excess.\u201d Finally, it was agreed that the Ballard Company would \u201cexecute such assignment or assignments, release or releases\u201d of its \u201cliens under said conditional bills of sale as may. be necessary\u201d and as the Real Estate Company \u201cmay desire\u201d to perfect its right and title.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The maker of the chattel trust note held by the Real Estate Company assigned to that company the right to rent the furniture, the rental to be applied on the indebtedness represented by the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On July 28, 1931, appellees qualified in the court below as receivers for the Real Estate Company in equity cause No.. 53,-180, Compton v. Wardman Real Estate Properties, Inc., and on April 19, 1933, the Ballard Company filed its petition to intervene therein, setting out the terms of the contract of May 2, 1931, which petition was granted on May 19, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">On October 25, 1935, the receivers petitioned for authority to dispose of the receivership assets. Notice of this petition was not served on the intervener Ballard Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">On November 15, 1935, the court appointed appraisers to report on the value of the assets, including \u201cUnit 6. Lien of Receivers represented by note secured by chattel deed of trust on furniture and equipment in Hay-Adams House,\u201d and authorized the receivers, after the filing of the appraisers\u2019 report, to sell the units at public sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">On December 23, 1935, the appraisers filed their report, Unit 6 being appraised at $17,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Thereupon the receivers advertised the sale of the units at public auction to be held at 3 p. m. on January 23, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">On January 20, 1936, the Ballard Company \u201chad actual notice of the proposed sale,\u201d and on January 23d, at 2:15 p. m. it filed a petition averring that it had not been advised of any of the proceedings authorizing' the sale of the note; that its attention had been called to the matter \u201conly within the last day or two\u201d; that the sale of the note would be a direct violation of the contract of May 2, 1931; that \u201cthe receivers cannot realize a true value or the greatest amount from said furniture and equipment if they are permitted to sell the said note and not make any effort to dispose of the furniture and the equipment itself\u201d; and that it would be damaged thereby. The petition prayed for an order temporarily enjoining the sale of the note as well as a permanent injunction, and further prayed that the receivers be required to sell the furniture under the chattel deed of trust. The Ballard Company, however, did not press its prayer for a temporary restraining order by formally applying for such order in advance of the sale. The receivers proceeded with the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Thereafter, on January 31st, the receivers reported that on the sale of Unit 6 (the note here involved) \u201cthere was spirited bidding by four separate bidders at prices starting at $5,000 and ending at $16,100, the highest bid offered for said Unit. All of the units cried were sold to the highest bidder, subject, however, to confirmation by the court after Order Nisi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Following the sale, the receivers on February 11th, answered the petition for injunction; denied that the sale of the note would violate the contract, and averred that the rentals of the furniture aggregating $33,925 had been paid to the receivers; that the receivers had offered to appear in court on any request which the Ballard Company \u201cmight wish to make for restraining order prior to three o\u2019clock p. m., the time set for said sale; but counsel for the receivers were advised by counsel for the Walter M. Ballard Company that no application for a restraining order would be presented.\u201d The answer further averred that the receivers thereupon proceeded with the sale of the note \u201cin view of the fact that the sale of -said note had been advertised for more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>thirty days, and that there were, to the knowledge of the receivers, at least four separate bidders ready to compete for the purchase of said note by bidding at said sale.\u201d The answer also averred that in their opinion \u201cthe best net price for the interest of the receivers and of the petitioner in the furniture * * * can be obtained by a sale of the note * * * rather than by a foreclosure and sale of said furniture and equipment itself\u201d; that the receivers wished to realize \u201cthe highest possible price for the interest of the receivership estate in said equipment and furniture\u201d and to that end they had suggested to the Ballard Company that if dissatisfied with the price obtained for the note ($16,100), the Ballard Company should offer to the court a higher price for the note so that if the original sale price be deemed inadequate the sale might be set aside and the-note sold for a higher price to the Ballard Company or such other person as might bid therefor; that the Ballard Company declined to make any bid for the note and the receivers had been unable to obtain any bid therefor higher than $16,100 \u2014 the sum bid at the receivers\u2019 sale; that if the sale of the note be set aside and foreclosure ordered in lieu thereof, the net sum realized from the foreclosure sale may be substantially less than the sum already bid for <em>the note, </em>$16,100, which \u201cbears a fairly close relation to the appraised value of $17,600.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">On February 14th, an order nisi was entered confirming the sale unless cause to the contrary be shown before March 16, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">On February 17, 1936, the court, after hearing on the petition to enjoin the sale of the note and the answer thereto, denied the injunction and dismissed the petition, the order reciting: \u201cThe Walter M. Ballard Company having declined to make any bid for the said note above the sum of $16,100 heretofore offered therefor, and having declined to guarantee to the Receivers any minimum bid for said furniture and equipment in tile event the Receivers should be directed to foreclose and sell the same at public auction under the said deed of trust.\u201d The Ballard Company excepted to this ruling, and perfected its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Thereafter, on March 14th, the Ballard Company filed objections to the confirmation of the sale of Unit 6, alleging that under the contract the receivers were bound to sell the furniture and that the sale of the note did not comply with the contract; that $16,100, \u201cthe price offered and the subject of ratification\u201d by the court, \u201cis greatly inadequate\u201d; and that a new appraisal of the furniture and sale thereof is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">On March 20th the court overruled the objections and confirmed the sale, the order reciting: \u2014 the Ballard Company \u201chaving declined in open court to make any bid for the said note above the sum of $16,100 heretofore offered therefor, and having declined to guarantee the receivers any minimum bid for said furniture and equipment in the event the receivers should be directed to foreclose and sell the same at public auction under the said deed of trust.\u201d The Ballard Company excepted thereto and appealed. Supersedeas bond of $18,000 was not posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Appellant contends, first, that \u201cthe authority of the receivers to sell should have been revoked because of their failure to give notice in accordance with order' of Court\u201d; second, that \u201cthe court was without authority to impose conditions upon appellant outside of the contract in order that appellant may secure a direct sale of the furniture and equipment rather than a sale of the chattel deed of trust note;\u201d and, third, that \u201cthe sale of the chattel deed of trust note was not a compliance with the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">In Pewabic Mining Company v. Mason, 145 U.S. 349, 12 S.Ct. 887, 890, 36 L.Ed. 732, the question involved was whether a master\u2019s sale should stand, and the court quoted with approval from Smith v. Arnold, Fed.Cas. No. 13,004, 5 Mason, 414, 420, in which Judge Story said: \u201cIn sales directed by the court of chancery the whole business is transacted by a public officer, under the guidance and superintendence of the court Itself. Eveil after the sale is made, it is not final until a report is made to the court, and it is approved and confirmed.\u201d The court further observed that \u201cit may be stated generally that there is a measure of discretion in a court of equity, both as to the manner and conditions of such a sale, as well as to ordering or refusing a resale. The chancellor will always make such provisions for notice and other conditions as will, <em>in his </em>judgment, best protect the rights of all interested, and make the sale most profitable to all; and after a sale has once been made, he will, certainly before confirmation, see that no wrong has been accomplished in and by the manner in which it was conducted. Yet the purpose of the law is that the sale shall be final; and to insure reliance upon such sales, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>induce biddings, it is essential that no sale be set aside for trifling reasons, or. on account of matters which ought to have been attended\u2019.to by the complaining party prior thereto. And in this respect regard may properly be had to all that has transpired before, for the conduct of the parties, their acts and omissions, may largely interpret their action at the time of the sale. In order, therefore, to understand fully the merits of these present appeals, we must notice the course of the litigation and the conduct of the parties prior to the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In the light of the foregoing principles, we will consider the case here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">First. In our view appellant was not prejudiced by failure of the receivers to give it actual notice of their petition for authority to sell the note. On January 20th it had actual notice of the sale to be held on January 23d, at 3 p. m. At 2:45 p. m. on the day of the scheduled sale it filed its petition to enjoin, but did not avail itself of the receivers\u2019 offer to appear before the court prior to 3 p. m. to press its prayer for a temporary restraining order; on the contrary, it advised the receivers that no such application would be presented. Furthermore, after the order nisi, of which it had notice, it had a month within which to present objections to confirmation. It filed its objections within that period. Objections which it might have urged had it been given notice originally of the petition to sell could have been presented before confirmation. In our opinion appellant had full opportunity to protect its rights, and was not harmed by lack of actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Second. Under the facts of this case the sale of the note was equivalent to a sale of the furniture. It is clear that the parties to the contract contemplated that the Real Estate Company should have complete control over the disposition of. the furniture (appellant in its brief admits that \u201cthe Receivers had full and complete control of the property involved\u201d'). It is apparent that the parties also contemplated that the Real Estate Company would be under no restriction in its method of disposition of the furniture. Foreclosure by public sale under the deed of trust was not the only method of disposition agreed upon by the parties, for \u201csale, public or private,\u201d was specifically authorized. In addition, disposition of the furniture \u201cby release of liens or otherwise\u201d was authorized. The lien of the Real Estate Company was represented by the note. This lien was released by the sale of the note. Since equity looks at substance and not form, it is clear that the sale of the note was in effect a sale of the furniture. The contract fixed no minimum sum for which the furniture might be sold, and if sold for $50,000 or less the Ballard Company would receive nothing. The value of the furniture as of the date of the contract was $50,000. Appellant\u2019s interest of 12 per cent, was fully satisfied when it was paid $6,000. Its share in any sum in excess of $50,000 was wholly speculative, and in the nature of a bonus. If the Real Estate Company profited beyond $50,000, appellant would be entitled to participate in such profits. But the Real Estate Company has not profited beyond that amount. It received rentals amounting to $33,925 and the amount bid for the note, $16,100 \u2014 totaling $50,025, or approximately the amount of the \u201cagreed valuation of the furniture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Appellant objected to the confirmation on the ground that the price was \u201cgreatly inadequate.\u201d Appellant\u2019s petition to enjoin and its objections to confirmation do not allege bad faith, nor aver facts sufficient to show that the actual value of the furniture at the time of the sale of the note was greater than or out of proportion to the appraised value. In considering objections to confirmation of such a sale mere inadequacy of price is not sufficient to justify setting it aside, \u201cunless * * * so great as to shock the conscience.\u201d Graffam v. Burgess, 117 U.S. 180, 191, 6 S.Ct. 686, 692, 29 L.Ed. 839; Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, 145 U.S. 349, 367, 12 S.Ct. 887, 36 L.Ed. 732. Appellant made no such showing. Upon the whole record, we must conclude that the orders of the lower court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b472-12\">STEPHENS,</author>\n<p id=\"A6N\">Associate Justice, took no part i-n the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
