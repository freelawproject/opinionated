We find no merit in his arguments, and we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">{\u00b6 2} Evidence presented during a bench trial showed that Jeff Wetterer lived next door to a house that was unoccupied and was soon to be auctioned in a foreclosure sale. He saw someone \u201cslide into a window\u201d of the house from a ladder leaned against the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">{\u00b6 3} Wetterer originally thought the person was his former neighbor. But when he saw that the car in the driveway was not his neighbor\u2019s, he shouted into the window, \u201cWho\u2019s ever in here, you need to get out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">{\u00b6 4} Five minutes later, a man, later identified as Janson, came out of the house and asked Wetterer \u201cwhat his problem was.\u201d Wetterer told him, \u201cYou are my problem. I just saw you break into a house that\u2019s not yours.\u201d He told Janson three or four times to leave or he would call the police. Wetterer testified that Janson ignored him and went toward the back of house. So Wetterer called the Hamilton County Sheriffs Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">{\u00b6 5} John Priest, a Hamilton County Deputy Sheriff, responded to the call. When he arrived, he saw Janson standing against his car, which was parked in the driveway. Janson told Deputy Priest that he was a realtor and was looking at the house for a client. After repeated inquiry as to the identity of his client, Janson finally stated that the client was his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">{\u00b6 6} Deputy Priest testified that the property had been under foreclosure, and that the sheriffs office had intended to sell it at auction. To Deputy Priest\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>knowledge, Janson did not have permission to inspect the house. He did not have keys to get into the house, and no lock box had been placed there to provide keys for access to the house. Janson did not tell Deputy Priest that he had permission to be on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 7} Janson testified in his own defense. He explained that he was a realtor specializing in foreclosed properties. He said that on the date in question, his mother, whom he had been helping to purchase foreclosed property, had called him and told him about the property. He \u201cstopped by to look at it from the outside.\u201d He stated, \u201cI do not deny that. But I am perfectly within my right to do so. No one had ever told me not to do so in the State of Ohio.\u201d He testified that, as far as he knew, a person had to be \u201cverbally told not to go on a piece of property before you are trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 8} He stated that when he arrived to look at the property, he saw a ladder leaning against the house and climbed up it to look in an open window. He testified that the house was vacant and that he had known that it would be sold in foreclosure in two days. He stuck his head in the window, and when he heard the neighbor yelling, he came down the ladder. He told the neighbor that he was within his rights to be on the property. He indicated that he had not seen any signs barring trespassing. When the neighbor called the police, he waited for a police officer to come. He did acknowledge, though, that no one had given him permission to climb up the ladder to look in the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 9} In his pro se brief, Janson does not specifically delineate his assignments of error, as required by App.R. 16(A). However, in the interests of justice, we address what we construe his assignments of error to be.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We construe one assignment of error to be that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, and we find that it has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2911.21(A)(2) provides that \u201c[n]o person, without privilege to do so, shall * * * [k]nowingly enter or remain on the land or premises of another, the use of which is lawfully restricted to certain persons, purposes, modes, or hours, when the offender knows the offender is in violation of any such restriction or is reckless in that regard * * *.\u201d \u201cPrivilege\u201d means \u201can immunity, license, or right conferred by law, bestowed by express or implied grant, arising out of status, position, office, or relationship, or growing out of necessity.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 11} Janson argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction because the state failed to produce the actual owner of the property as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a witness. He argues that \u201c[t]he state without representation of the owner does not have the right to arrest, charge, and convict someone that the owner of the private property may have granted permission.\u201d This argument is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 12} First, the argument ignores that Janson admitted that he did not have permission to climb up the ladder and look in the window. Further, trespass is an invasion of the possessory interest in the property, not an invasion of title.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> R.C. 2911.21(E) states that \u201c \u2018land or premises\u2019 includes any land, building, structure, or place belonging to, controlled by, or in custody of another, and any separate enclosure or room, or portion thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, the state was not required to present the testimony of the actual owner. It had to prove that Janson had no privilege to be on the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> R.C. 2911.21(B) states that \u201c[i]t is no defense to a charge under this section that the land or premises involved was owned, controlled, or in the custody of a public agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, the evidence at trial showed that the Hamilton County Sheriffs Office had control of the property for the purpose of conducting the foreclosure sale and could restrict who could enter the property. The evidence also showed that the sheriffs office had not given Janson the right to enter the property. As a realtor who specialized in foreclosures, Janson could have arranged a legitimate viewing of the property without the necessity of climbing up a ladder and looking in a window without any kind of authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 15} Janson cites various civil cases for the proposition that being a realtor gave him a privilege to go onto the property. He argues that because no one had told him not to enter the property, no signs had been posted, and he had believed that he could be on the property, he should not have been convicted of criminal trespassing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 16} No requirement exists that \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs be posted on property, or that the person in control or possession of property notify everyone in the world that they are not welcome to come onto the property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a realtor, Janson might have been able to arrange an inspection of the property, but he did not. He simply went onto the property of his own accord and took it upon himself to climb up a ladder and enter the house through a window. Even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>were to accept Ms claim that he believed his actions were justified, such a belief does not create a privilege to engage in otherwise criminal conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 17} Our review of the record shows that a rational trier of fact, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of criminal trespassing under R.C. 2911.21(A)(2). Therefore the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 18} Janson\u2019s arguments could also be construed as an assignment of error that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The concepts of weight and sufficiency are different and involve different standards of review. The evidence is insufficient to support a conviction if a complete failure of proof by the prosecution occurs. But when the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court may still reverse the conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 19} After reviewing the evidence, we cannot conclude that the trier of fact lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that we must reverse Janson\u2019s conviction and order a new trial. Therefore, his conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 20} The dissent grossly mischaracterizes the evidence provided in the record when it states that \u201che stopped there and peeked in a window.\u201d He did not peek in anything. Janson physically went into the house and was in the house for approximately five minutes according to the testimony of Jeff Wetterer.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 21} The dissent is correct when it states, \u201cJanson was no burglar.\u201d He was charged with and convicted of criminal trespassing, not burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, if we were to follow the dissent\u2019s interpretation of the law and condone Janson\u2019s actions, after he admitted that he had no permission or privilege to go into the house, we would declare open season for any member of the public to enter or remain on property involved in the foreclosure process, at his whim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 23} To require as a matter of law personal notification that one is not allowed on certain property, as Janson urges, or to require \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs posted on real property where the owner does not want trespassers, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>inappropriate and nonsensical. Does the house for sale down the street from you have a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign on it? If the owner is not living there, is it legal to put a ladder up to a window and go inside? Of course not.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 24} Janson is guilty of the crime of criminal trespassing and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 25} We overrule Janson\u2019s assignments of error, as we construe them to be, and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-8\">SuNDERMANN, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b416-9\">Painter, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\">.

It was to be sold by the sheriff. The defaulting owners had vamoosed. Who knows if it were even possible to get permission to look at the house. So he stopped there and peeked in the window (according to his testimony), using a ladder that was leaning against the house. For this he was arrested, taken to the hoosegow, presumably in irons, and made to post bail. He was then made a convicted criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">{\u00b6 28} Janson was no burglar. When the neighbor called the law, he waited for the officer to arrive. Where was the crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">{\u00b6 29} Another problem with this case \u2014 in addition to the fact that it is preposterous \u2014 is that Janson is simply not guilty of what he was charged with.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">{\u00b6 30} The majority quotes R.C. 2911.21 correctly: \u201c(A) No person, without privilege to do so, shall do any of the following: * * * (2) Knowingly enter or remain on the land or premises of another, the use of which is lawfully restricted to certain persons, purposes, modes, or hours, when the offender knows the offender is in violation of any such restriction or is reckless in that regard * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">{\u00b6 31} This section \u201ccovers the situation in which the land or premises involved are subject to rules on access or use, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe he is in violation of the rules.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The section applies when property is sometimes open to the public \u2014 a park, a store \u2014 but also sometimes closed. That is why we see signs telling us when a park is closed. What were the \u201crules\u201d here? There were no signs or warnings. And \u201c[t]he duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>communicate restrictions on the use of land or a building is on the owner or occupier of the land or building.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This section simply does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 32} It would be more reasonable to assume that the owners of the house, having defaulted on the mortgage, would have been more than amenable to a realtor checking the house out with a view to bidding on it \u2014 the higher the bid, the less the defaulting owners owe. If necessary, I would hold that a licensed realtor has an implied privilege to look at vacant foreclosed property in the absence of any visible restriction. But that is not even necessary here, since the law in question doesn\u2019t prohibit what Janson did anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 33} The charging document, captioned \u201c2911.21(A)(2) Criminal Trespass\u201d actually charged Janson with trespassing on the property of the <em>Sheriff: </em>\u201cMichael Janson, on or about 5-21-08 in Hamilton County, State of Ohio, did, without privilege to do so, knowingly enter on the premises of Hamilton County Sheriffs Office, located at 6268 Salem Rd., the use of which is lawfully restricted to certain persons, purposes, modes, or hours, when Michael Janson knew he is in violation of such restriction or is reckless in that regard, contrary to and in violation of Section 2911.21 of the Revised Code of Ohio, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.\u201d The way the complaint reads, the sheriff is located at 6268 Salem Rd.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 34} The majority\u2019s assertion that the trial court \u201ccould have found that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of criminal trespassing under R.C. 2911.21(A)(2)\u201d is bizarre, in that Janson quite obviously was not on any land \u201cthe use of which [was] lawfully restricted to certain persons, purposes, modes, or hours.\u201d The majority completely ignores that Janson was charged with, and convicted of, the wrong section.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 35} Perhaps Janson\u2019s conduct could be shoehorned into another section of the prohibition against criminal trespass. Perhaps R.C. 2911.21(A)(1) might cover the situation \u2014 as if it need be covered. Even the eases cited by the majority as precedent involve <em>that </em>section, so they are of no value in this case. There are no cases where someone in Janson\u2019s position was convicted under <em>this </em>section, because there could, legally, be none.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 36} And the old \u201cwe would declare open season for any member of the public to enter or remain on property involved in the foreclosure process, at his whim,\u201d is not only untrue (how easy is it to put up a sign), but irrelevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>{\u00b6 37} This case involves a licensed realtor. Are we afraid of rogue realtors ranging about the county looking at property? So afraid that we convict \u2014 even under the wrong law \u2014 people who did nothing wrong?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 38} Maybe the neighbor \u2014 who testified that he had cut the grass on the vacant property without anyone\u2019s permission \u2014 should be prosecuted too? He \u201ctrespassed\u201d as much as Janson did.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 39} Someone should have had the common sense to dismiss this case before it came to trial. Failing that, the trial judge should have thrown it out. Failing that, this court should do the right thing. But all failed. And a 52-year-old law-abiding citizen is dragged through the court system and made a convict. Michael Janson must feel like Jean Valjean \u2014 except that Valjean actually committed a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 40} Janson is not guilty of a crime. His misfortune is that he lives in a county where he would be convicted anyway.</p>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b416-17\">.
