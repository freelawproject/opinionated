Following a bench trial, the trial court found Williams guilty of burglary and imposed an eight-year sentence of incarceration. His appointed counsel has filed a no-error brief. Because counsel failed to consult with, to seek the advice of, or to meaningfully notify Williams of his intent to file this no-error brief, Williams has been denied the right to effective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 2} In his appellate brief, appointed counsel submits that \u201c[a]fter reviewing the entire record, counsel can find no meritorious assignments of error to raise.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, counsel states, he has filed a no-error brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. </em>California<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its progeny.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He further states that \u201ca copy of this Brief will be sent to [Williams], and * * * appellate counsel respectfully requests that this Court give [Williams] an opportunity to raise any points he may choose.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The certificate of service at the end of the brief, however, indicates that it has been served upon another person, not upon Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 3} Appellate counsel has ultimately corrected this typographical error and has filed a document with this court confirming that he has served Williams with a copy of the appellate brief. Attached to that confirmation is the letter that counsel sent to Williams on the same day that the brief was filed. The body of the letter states, in its entirety, \u201cI am enclosing the Appellate brief filed on your behalf in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe State is to file its Appeal Brief in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI shall advise you of the outcome in due course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">{\u00b6 6} Appellate counsel has also moved this court for permission to withdraw as counsel and has further moved this court \u201cto permit [Williams] time to raise any points she [sic] may choose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">{\u00b6 7} The role of appointed appellate counsel becomes problematic when \u201ca conflict arises between an indigent\u2019s right to \u2018counsel who will vigorously and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>fairly advocate his rights on appeal\u2019 and \u2018the ethical strictures upon counsel generally to advance on behalf of a client only those issues which such counsel honestly believes fairly debatable under the law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>In re Booker, </em>we reviewed and summarized the obligations of appointed counsel when he or she is confronted with these unique circumstances. We held that <em>Anders, Freels v. Hills, </em>and our case law require appointed counsel to (1) advise the reviewing court of his conclusion that the appeal is frivolous and request permission to withdraw, (2) submit with his request to withdraw a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal, and (3) furnish his client with a copy of the brief and afford the client time to raise any points that he chooses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Freels, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit clarified the obligations of counsel. The court reviewed the federal district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief for an indigent defendant whose no-error appeal had been affirmed by this court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit held that appellate counsel\u2019s actions \u201cdenied [Freels] the right to effective assistance of appellate counsel\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when counsel had failed to move to withdraw or to consult with, seek the advice of, or notify his client of his intent to file an <em>Anders </em>brief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court also appends admonitions to each scheduling order sent to counsel. While the admonitions are merely advisory, they summarize this court\u2019s understanding of the dictates of <em>Anders </em>and its progeny. The admonitions to counsel in criminal cases provide that \u201c[c]ounsel * * * is directed to contact the appellant prior to filing the brief * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIn those cases where counsel files an <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel should append to said brief the issues, if any, raised by the appellant. Further counsel shall file an affidavit indicating that he/she has advised the appellant that an <em>Anders </em>brief has been or will be filed and counsel shall file a Motion to Withdraw, which will be considered with the merits of the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 10} The purpose behind these procedures is to \u201cafford[ ] adequate and effective appellate review for criminal indigents.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Requiring counsel to undertake these steps ensures that counsel, even when presented with the unique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>circumstances of a no-error brief, will continue to act \u201cin the role of an active advocate in behalf of his client, as opposed to that of <em>amicus </em>curiae.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 11} Only after counsel has fully performed these tasks does this court assume its sole obligation of conducting \u201ca full examination of all the proceedings} ] to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 12} Here, while Williams\u2019s appellate counsel has ultimately furnished his client with a copy of the no-error brief, he has failed to afford Williams the time or a meaningful opportunity to raise any points that he chooses in support of his appeal. Nothing in counsel\u2019s very brief letter to his client informed Williams that counsel was filing a no-error brief. Nothing in the letter, the brief, or the motion to withdraw sought Williams\u2019s advice on matters in support of his appeal. And nothing in any communication informed Williams that if he wished \u201cto raise any points,\u201d he had to inform counsel of that fact so that those issues, if any, could be appended to the appellate brief or could be added by motion to supplement an already filed brief. To the contrary, the brief and the motion to withdraw have both sought to place counsel\u2019s obligation to consult with and to solicit the advice of Williams upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 13} We hold that counsel\u2019s failure to adhere to the procedures identified in <em>Anders </em>and its progeny has deprived Williams of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal. \u201cThe remedy for such a deprivation must be fashioned to secure for the appellant \u2018that which he has been denied.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we grant appellate counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, strike Williams\u2019s brief, and appoint attorney Ravert J. Clark to serve as counsel for Williams. We order Clark to reexamine this case in light of this opinion and, if appropriate, to follow the procedures mandated by <em>Anders </em>and its progeny. We further order Clark to file a new brief on or before October 28, 2009, and the state to file a responsive brief on or before November 30, 2009. The case will then be set for reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-9\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-13\">.
