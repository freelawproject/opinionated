The charges arose from events that allegedly took place on March 24, 2007, when an unknown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>man broke into C.M.\u2019s apartment during the early morning hours and assaulted her. Defendant, who lived nearby, was taken into custody shortly after. C.M. identified defendant as the perpetrator in both a one-man show-up that night and from a photospread she was shown two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 2} Counsel appointed to represent defendant moved to suppress C.M.\u2019s identification of defendant. Defendant thereafter moved to represent himself. Following a hearing, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to represent himself. Defendant represented himself at the hearing on the motion to suppress, which the court denied. Defendant also represented himself at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 3} The jury returned verdicts finding defendant guilty of the charges on which he was indicted. The court imposed consecutive prison terms of eight years for burglary and eighteen months for gross sexual imposition. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to obtain a valid waiver of appellant\u2019s right to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 5} Crim.R. 44(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cWaiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>State v. Dyer </em>(1996), 117 Ohio App.3d 92, 95, 689 N.E.2d 1034, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cCourts are to indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of a fundamental constitutional right including the right to be represented by counsel. <em>In re East </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 221, 224, 663 N.E.2d 983, 985, quoting <em>Brewer v. Williams </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424; <em>Garfield Hts. v. Brewer </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 216, 217, 17 OBR 458, 459-460, 479 N.E.2d 309, 311-312. Therefore, a waiver may not be presumed from a silent record. <em>East </em>at 224, 663 N.E.2d at 985, citing <em>Carnley v. Cochran </em>(1962), 369 U.S. 506, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70. Rather, the waiver must affirmatively appear in the record. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State v. Haag </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App.2d 268, 3 O.O.3d 301, 360 N.E.2d 756, and <em>Cleveland v. Whipkey </em>(1972), 29 Ohio App.2d 79, 58 O.O.2d 86, 278 N.E.2d 374; <em>Brewer, </em>17 Ohio App.3d at 217, 17 OBR at 459-460, 479 N.E.2d at 311-312. The state bears the burden of overcoming presumptions against a valid waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 708, 723-724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cWe have said: \u2018The constitutional right of an accused to be represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of a trial court, in which the accused\u2014 whose life or liberty is at stake \u2014 is without counsel. This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.\u2019 <em>[Johnson v. Zerbst </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 458, 465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.] To discharge this duty properly in light of the strong presumption against waiver of the constitutional right to counsel, a judge must investigate as long and as thoroughly as the circumstances of the case before him demand. The fact that an accused may tell him that he is informed of his right to counsel and desires to waive this right does not automatically end the judge\u2019s responsibility. To be valid such waiver must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter. A judge can make certain that an accused\u2019s professed waiver of counsel is understandingly and wisely made only from a penetrating and comprehensive examination of all the circumstances under which such a plea is tendered.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 11} A hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to represent himself was held on May 4, 2007. A video transcript of the hearing was filed. A typed copy of that record is attached to the state\u2019s brief. App.R. 9(A). The court\u2019s entire colloquy with defendant regarding his motion, beginning with the court\u2019s comment, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe Court is cognizant of <em>Faretta v. California </em>[(1948), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562] which allows for a defendant to represent himself if he knowingly and intelligently waives, on the record, his right to counsel. And the Court has an obligation to make a determination about whether Defendant is, in fact, able to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMr. Engle, you filed your motion to represent yourself pro se and not utilize the services of Mr. Goraleski. Have you discussed this with Mr. Goraleski?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: And Mr. Goraleski is a senior lawyer in the Public Defender\u2019s Office, a very experienced lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cKnowing that, do you wish to proceed on your motion to represent yourself?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: True.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Engle, how old are you?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019ll be 53 this year, sir. .</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTHE COURT: How much schooling have you had?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019ve got about five years of college right now. So I\u2019ve got \u2014 I\u2019ve probably got 235 credit hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cTHE COURT: And have you ever represented yourself in any other proceeding other than this\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cTHE COURT: And what is that? When did you do that? What kind of case?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: It was, I\u2019m going to say in December of \u201993.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cTHE COURT: Here in Montgomery County?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Greene County.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cTHE COURT: In Greene County? Was it a criminal case?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Correct, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. And did the Court permit you to represent yourself in that case?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-19\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cTHE COURT: Did they? All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-20\">{\u00b6 35} \u2018Well, you\u2019ve been through, but \u2014 well, did that case go to trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-21\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, it did, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-22\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. And did you have stand-by counsel in that case?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-24\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. The \u2014 all right \u2014 do you feel that you have some knowledge of the Rules of Evidence that apply in criminal trials?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-25\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019d say really I probably got about 40,000 hours of studying criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-27\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-28\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cTHE COURT: So you feel you know the rules, the criminal rules, that apply in a case as well as the Rules of Evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>{\u00b6 44} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: True.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So in other words, my question is to decide whether you would be able to make objections and carry on the case as if you were represented by a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: True, I could.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cTHE COURT: You say you can?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cTHE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cAll right. Well, I want to make sure also that you understand the role of the Court \u2014 that I can\u2019t help you in your defense. But if you undertake to represent yourself in the case, the Court\u2019s obligation is to make rulings and to conduct the trial in a fair and impartial way. And I can\u2019t help one side or the other in the presentation of their case. Do you understand?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cThe \u2014 given your experience then and the fact that you\u2019ve been through this once before and it\u2019s your desire to do it in this case, I\u2019m going to then permit you to do it based on these answers that you\u2019ve given here today.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re welcome</p>\n<p id=\"b526-16\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cAnd \u2014 but I am going to have Mr. Goraleski sit with you as court counsel available to you should you have any questions or questions arise as a resource for you.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-17\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-18\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-19\">{\u00b6 59} Defendant signed a written waiver of his right, which was filed on May 16, 2007. The written waiver states:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cNow comes the Defendant, Raymond Engle, pursuant to Ohio Criminal Rule 44(C), and after having been fully advised of my right to have assigned counsel for the above captioned case, and after been fully advised by the Court of the nature of the charges against me, the statutory offenses within, the range of allowable punishments for each offense, possible defenses and mitigation do hereby make a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of my right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cI understand that I will represent myself at all future stages of the criminal prosecution. This would include any motions, hearings, and/or trials. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>No one has forced, threatened or promised me anything in order for me to waive my right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u201c_/\u00a7/_</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Raymond Engle \u2014 Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 62} The colloquy the court conducted with defendant fully probed his capacity to represent himself based on his education, age, and experience. However, the record is silent with respect to the <em>Von Moltke </em>requirement that a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel also must \u201cbe made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, [and] possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof.\u201d 332 U.S. at 723-724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309. Having made no mention at all of those matters to defendant in relation to the case against him, the court could not discharge the duty to investigate defendant\u2019s understanding of them, which <em>Von Moltke </em>instructs is necessary to rebut the strong presumption against waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 63} The state argues that the written waiver defendant signed is sufficient for that purpose. We do not agree. The several acknowledgments in that writing that defendant made are belied by the transcript of the hearing the court conducted. Furthermore, because Crim.R. 44 requires waivers to be made in open court and Crim.R. 22 requires them to be recorded, the transcript of the hearing necessarily governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 64} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cThe state failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the charged offense, and the jury\u2019s guilty verdict amounts to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThe show-up identification and photospread made of the defendant was unduly suggestive and prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cThe trial court erred by failing to adhere to statutory sentencing guidelines and appellant\u2019s sentence is inconsistent with sentences of similar offenders, a lesser sentence is commensurate with and would not demean the seriousness of the offense and impact of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>{\u00b6 68} The errors assigned pertain to the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and at his trial, during which defendant represented himself. Our ruling sustaining the first assignment of error renders these further assignments of error moot, and we therefore decline to decide them. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">{\u00b6 69} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-6\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
