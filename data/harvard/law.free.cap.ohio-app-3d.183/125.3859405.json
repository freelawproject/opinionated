Appellant advances two assignments of error for our review, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">First Assignment of Error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under R.C. 2323.51[(A)](2)(a)(ii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Second Assignment of Error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under R.C. 2323.51[(A)](2)(a)(iii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The following factual and procedural history is taken from the pleadings in the record, including the evidence attached to appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the memorandum contra filed by plaintiff-appellee, L &amp; N Partnership (\u201cappellee\u201d), and is undisputed unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">{\u00b6 3} This litigation arises out of a dispute over the use of a parcel of land in the Lakeside Forest planned unit development (\u201cthe subdivision\u201d), located in Westerville, Ohio. The parcel, known as Reserve D Lot No. 37 (\u201cLot 37\u201d), is part of an 11.889-acre tract developed in the 1980s by Northeast Co. Northeast Co. was the sole partner in Woodlake Colony, which originally owned the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">{\u00b6 4} By warranty deed (\u201cthe deed\u201d) recorded on February 5, 1981, Woodlake Colony conveyed the entire 11.889-acre tract, \u201c[w]ith the exception of the dwelling lots, the buildings and other improvements thereon and the easements, rights and appurtenances * * * which are part of the Development^]\u201d to appellant and its successors and assigns. The deed denominated the land being conveyed to appellant as the \u201cCommon Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">{\u00b6 5} The deed stated, \u201c \u2018Common Property\u2019 means those portions of the Development, and all improvements thereon and appurtenances thereto, which are owned by the Association and are not set aside or intended for further subdivision into one or several dwelling lots, or are otherwise intended for the mutual benefit, use and enjoyment of the occupants of the Development.\u201d The deed further stated that Woodlake Colony contemplated that certain reserves delineated on the recorded plat would be further subdivided without the filing of an amended or supplemental plat, but that such subdivisions would result in not more than a total of 61 separate buildable lots (\u201cdwelling lots\u201d) being created. The deed also imposed numerous deed restrictions upon the entire tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The tract was hilly and heavily wooded, and Northeast Co. desired to develop the tract by retaining as many of the existing trees and as much of the other natural vegetation as possible. For this reason, the development plan called for dwelling lots to be as small as possible, i.e., nearly identical to the footprint of each house, with the remainder of the tract retained as commonly owned property. As such, the precise location and dimensions of each dwelling lot were not delineated ahead of time. Instead, the plat contained 23 reserves (each of which was a separate tax parcel), which were then subdivided into dwelling lots. Each home was carefully placed among the trees and vegetation, after which a dwelling lot would be created by deed split; that is, the reserve having already been conveyed to the association, a very small lot, whose boundaries correspond to the exterior dimensions of the home\u2019s foundation, would be conveyed back to Woodlake Colony and then, ultimately, to the home\u2019s purchaser. In this way, the association operates in a manner functionally equivalent to that of a condominium association.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">{\u00b6 7} Due to this somewhat unique method of subdividing the tract, the Franklin County Auditor agreed to apply the following tax-assessment method until all 61 homes were built. The auditor appraised the improvements on the common property as a whole and then assigned a portion of that total value to each reserve, the size of each reserve\u2019s portion corresponding to the number of buildable lots that could potentially be created out of that reserve. By 1987, four unbuilt lots remained, including Lot 37. Because some surrounding homes had been built larger than originally anticipated, these remaining lots could not accommodate comparably sized homes. Additionally, in the case of Lot 37, a fire hydrant had been placed so as to affect development on the lot. Therefore, the association sought to have these four lots removed from the plat and requested that the Franklin County Auditor remove them from the 1988 tax duplicate. The lots were not officially removed until March 8, 1990, after a new plat was submitted and approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">{\u00b6 8} While this removal process was pending, Woodlake Colony went out of business and allowed the taxes on the four lots (which were still part of their respective reserves) to become delinquent. Eventually, the lots, including Lot 37, were declared delinquent lands, and the Franklin County Auditor commenced foreclosure proceedings under R.C. Chapter 5721. Appellee purchased Lot 37 at a sheriffs sale on February 4, 1997. Before the deed was delivered, the association indicated that it wished to redeem the lot, but needed more time in order to obtain approval from its membership. For this reason, the court of common pleas issued a five-day stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 9} When the association did not ultimately act to redeem the property by the expiration of the stay, the sheriff delivered to appellee an auditor\u2019s deed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Lot 37 on February 13, 1997. The auditor\u2019s deed stated, \u201cTogether with all improvements thereon and all exclusive and non-exclusive easements, rights and appurtenances thereto which have been heretofore conveyed to the Grantor or its predecessors in title and which benefit the above-described parcel.\u201d Additionally, R.C. 5723.12 provides, \u201c[T]he conveyance of the real estate by the auditor shall extinguish all previous title and invest the purchaser with a new and perfect title that is free from all liens and encumbrances, except * * * any easements and covenants running with the land that were created prior to the time the taxes or assessments, for the nonpayment of which the land was forfeited, became due and payable * *</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 10} Prior to appellee\u2019s purchase of Lot 37, Birchwood Lane and Beech Lane, paved roads within the subdivision, had been built and, according to appellee, had been constructed over a portion of Lot 37. Additionally, a home (later owned by defendants, John and Bridget Bhim-Rao, who are not a party to this appeal) had been built; appurtenant to it was a wooden deck that, appellee alleged, reached outside its small lot dimensions and onto Lot 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 11} On December 28, 2004, appellee filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas against appellant and the Bhim-Raos. Later, appellee dismissed the complaint and then timely refiled it. The complaint contained three causes of action denominated as follows: (1) encroachment, (2) interference with the sale of plaintiffs property, and (3) constructive fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 12} With respect to the first claim, appellee alleged that Birchwood Lane and Beech Lane, and the Bhim-Raos\u2019 deck, had been placed partially on appellee\u2019s property. With respect to the second claim, appellee alleged that appellant had interfered with the sale of Lot 37 by removing \u201cfor sale\u201d signs that appellee\u2019s realtor had placed on it. With respect to the third claim, appellee alleged that appellant had allowed Lot 37 to be forfeited and sold at sheriffs sale without redeeming it, then used improper means (the removal of signs) to keep it from being sold or developed, all in order to retain the benefit of the property without having to pay the taxes on it. Both appellant and the Bhim-Raos filed counterclaims seeking judgments declaring that the deed controls the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations with respect to Lot 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant and the Bhim-Raos filed a motion for summary judgment as to appellee\u2019s claims and as to their counterclaims. With respect to the \u201cencroachment\u201d claim, appellant characterized it as a claim for trespass (there being no recognized tort of \u201cencroachment\u201d). Appellant argued that there was no trespass because the deed gives every occupant the \u201cright and easement to use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Common Property * * * in accordance with the purposes for which [it is] intended.\u201d Lot 37, appellant contended, is part of the Common Property because it is no longer \u201cset aside or intended for further subdivision into one or several dwelling lots.\u201d Appellant also argued that the trespass claim was barred by the applicable six-year statute of limitation because the roads and the deck already existed at the time appellee purchased the property, which was more than six years prior to the initial filing of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">{\u00b6 14} With respect to the claim for interference with sale of property, appellant argued that assuming such a tort exists, appellee\u2019s claim fails because under the terms of paragraph 11 of the warranty deed, appellee was not permitted to place \u201cfor sale\u201d signs on Lot 37. Finally, as to the constructive fraud claim, appellant argued that the claim was time-barred and that appellee had failed to establish the elements of a cause of action for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant attached to its motion the affidavit of Joseph Cousins, who identified himself therein as a member of appellant\u2019s board of trustees. Cousins averred that appellant\u2019s 1987 pursuit of removal of Lot 37 (and three other buildable lots) from the tax duplicate resulted in those lots becoming nonbuildable and tax-exempt and, thus, common property of appellant. According to Cousins, the taxes became delinquent during the removal process. Cousins stated that by the time appellee purchased Lot 37, the lot had already been removed from the tax duplicate, though it had still been forfeited because of previously delinquent taxes. Cousins also averred that the blacktop for Birchwood and Beech Lanes was already in existence at the time of the sale, as was the deck on the Bhim-Rao property.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant attached to the Cousins affidavit a copy of the deed, which provides, at paragraph 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">Reserved Easements and Rights of the Developer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">Woodlake Colony hereby reserves, on behalf of itself and Northeast Company, and their respective successors and assigns, the following easements and rights which shall apply and be available during the period of sale of dwelling lots in Lakeside Forest and until either the last such dwelling lot is sold and conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value or the active sales program is terminated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8H\">(a) the right and easement to maintain reasonable and tasteful signs on the Property indicating lots for sale, identifying models and sales offices and providing other information which the Developer deems necessary or desirable in connection with the sale or other disposition of dwelling lots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Appellant also attached to the Cousins affidavit copies of various pieces of correspondence detailing appellant\u2019s actions with respect to the removal of Lot 37 from the tax duplicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In its memorandum contra, appellee did not dispute that its first claim was a claim for trespass and did not dispute that the applicable statute of limitation was six years. It argued that it was not aware of the \u201cencroachments\u201d onto Lot 37 until it surveyed the property in preparation to list the land for sale. This, appellee maintained, was when its cause of action accrued, so its claim was not time-barred. Appellee also argued that in order for Lot 37 to be subject to the terms of the deed, it had to be reconveyed by Woodlake Colony and, because appellee had purchased the property before such a reconveyance occurred, Lot 37 was not subject to the terms of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 18} As to the claim for interference with sale of property, appellee argued that because Lot 37 is not subject to the deed, appellee was not restricted from placing \u201cfor sale\u201d signs on the lot. It attached to its memorandum contra the affidavits of Frank R. Nutis and Joy Nutt, both of appellee, who averred that appellant\u2019s agent repeatedly removed \u201cfor sale\u201d signs from Lot 37 and that appellee\u2019s realtors have been unable to sell the property as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, as to the constructive fraud claim, appellee argued that it does not have to prove that appellant had any intent to defraud appellee because constructive fraud \u2014 unlike actual fraud \u2014 has no mens rea element. Rather, appellee maintained, the fraud is implied in law and arises from the circumstances of the transaction itself. Additionally, appellee argued that the constructive fraud claim is not time-barred because the cause of action did not accrue until appellee discovered the facts underlying the constructive fraud \u2014 that is, the interference with the sale. It was this interference that, appellee alleged, was the improper means by which appellant was receiving the benefit of use of Lot 37 without having paid any value for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 20} Appellee later filed a supplemental memorandum contra, in which it again argued that the restrictions contained in the deed do not apply to Lot 37 because the lot had never been reconveyed to appellant. Appellee relied for this proposition on a letter written to appellant from the assistant administrator of the Real Estate Division for the Franklin County Auditor, a copy of which had been attached to appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In the letter, the administrator opined, \u201cFor a reserve in your development to become common property the plat of Lakeside Forest requires that the developer (owner), once all the potential building sites have been sold, transfer the remaining reserve land to the homeowners association.\u201d Appellee also pointed to the Nutis affidavit attached to its original memorandum contra, in which Mr. Nutis states that \u201c[t]he developer of Lakeside Forest never transferred the remaining reserve land to the homeowner\u2019s association as required by the plat for the property to become Common Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Though it had previously appeared to concede that its \u201cencroachment\u201d claim was a claim for trespass, in its supplemental memorandum contra, appellee changed its theory and characterized this claim as one for conversion. It cited the case of <em>Kramer Consulting, Inc. v. McCarthy </em>(S.D.Ohio 2003), 284 F.Supp.2d 917, which set forth the elements of conversion as follows: (1) plaintiffs ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion, (2) defendant\u2019s conversion, by a wrongful act or disposition of plaintiffs property rights, and (3) damages. Appellee argued that the wrongful acts that appellant committed included the removal of \u201cfor sale\u201d signs from the property. It argued that its damages are to be measured by the value of Lot 37 at the time it was converted because appellee has been unable to sell the lot. Appellee also argued that the conversion claim was not time-barred. It pointed out that the statute of limitation for conversion claims is four years and argued that the discovery rule applies. Because, according to Mr. \u00d1ut\u00eds\u2019 and Ms. Nutt\u2019s affidavits, appellee did not discover the conversion until 2003 and 2004, when the \u201cfor sale\u201d signs were removed, the action was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 22} Appellee also changed its theory with respect to its \u201cinterference with sale of property\u201d claim, arguing in its supplemental memorandum contra that the claim was, in actuality, a claim for tortious interference with a business relationship. Citing <em>Bickley v. FMC Technologies, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio 2003), 282 F.Supp.2d 631, appellee set forth the elements of the tort of tortious interference with a business relationship, which are: (1) a business relationship, (2) the wrongdoer\u2019s knowledge thereof, (3) an intentional interference causing a break or termination of the relationship, and (4) damages resulting therefrom. Appellee argued that the factual basis for this claim consisted in the fact that \u201cRealtor Jill Rudler discontinued her representation of [appellee] because her efforts to sell the property resulted in harassment of agents of [appellant]\u201d and \u201cRealtor John Rosado was unable to sell the property because of interference by agents of [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, at the completion of summary judgment briefing, by appellee\u2019s characterizations, its claims had resolved to the following three claims: (1) a claim for conversion, (2) a claim for tortious interference with a business relationship, and (3) a claim for constructive fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 22, 2007, the trial court granted appellant\u2019s and the Bhim-Raos\u2019 motions for summary judgment on their counterclaims. It also granted appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to appellee\u2019s first claim, but analyzed it as a trespass claim instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>a conversion claim. The court denied summary judgment as to the tortiousinterference claim, finding that genuine issues of fact existed as to when appellant removed the signs and, thus, whether the claim was time-barred. The court also found that there were issues of fact as to whether the deed prohibited use of the signs. Finally, as to the constructive fraud claim, the court denied summary judgment, finding the existence of unspecified issues of material fact. Therefore, the claims that survived summary judgment were appellee\u2019s claims for tortious interference with business relations and constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">{\u00b6 24} The jury trial of the case between appellant and appellee began on January 14, 2008, before a visiting judge. The parties submitted proposed jury instructions prior to trial. Consistent with appellee\u2019s most recent filing and with the trial court\u2019s summary judgment decision, appellant submitted instructions for: (1) tortious interference with contractual or business relations and (2) fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 25} Appellee, on the other hand, submitted (1) instructions denominated as \u201cTortuous [sic] Interference With the Sale of the Property,\u201d but that were actually the elements of conversion, taken directly from the federal district court case that appellee had cited in its supplemental memorandum contra to appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and (2) instructions denominated as \u201cconstructive fraud\u201d but that were, without citation of authority therefor, comprised of \u201cWrongdoing by [appellant] that is particularly gross and egregious; * * * knowledge of the harm that might be caused * * * or actual malice; Damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">{\u00b6 26} The transcript of the jury trial does not reflect any pretrial discussion about jury instructions or about the nature of the specific causes of action being tried. Appellee began by making its opening statement. Therein, appellee mentioned no specific cause of action by name. Appellee\u2019s opening statement was, in toto, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">May it please the Court, members of the jury, opposing counsel Pergram, Mr. Cousins: This is a case about a partnership that bought a parcel of land at a county auditor\u2019s sale because it was forfeited for nonpayment of taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">The evidence will show that defendant, Lakeside Forest Association, could have redeemed this property for a few hundred dollars but failed or refused to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">The evidence will show that defendant, Lakeside Forest Association, filed a motion asking for more time saying it intended to redeem the property but then failed or refused to do so, even after a Franklin County Common Pleas Judge gave them more time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">Almost two years later, the evidence will show, after Lakeside Forest Association reneged on its stated intention to pay its taxes, the auditor\u2019s sale was finally held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Now, no one bid on the property at two sheriff sales. And Lakeside Forest Association gambled that no one would'bid at the auditor\u2019s sale. But the evidence will show my client did. My client did bid and was given a deed by the county auditor at the auditor\u2019s sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">The parcel remains undeveloped as green space in the community. After a few years, market conditions were good in the real estate market and L &amp; N Partnership decided to sell the parcel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">The evidence will show that the leaders of Lakeside Forest Association admitted to L &amp; N Partnership\u2019s administrative assistant, Joy Nutt, and to their real estate agent, Mr. Rosato, that Lakeside Forest Association interfered with the sale of L &amp; N Partnership\u2019s property damaging L &amp; N Partnership thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">The evidence will show a pattern of such activity by the board of the Association that we are going to argue to you amounted to constructive fraud. I will not be able to account for the hostility and malice of the defendant, Lakeside Forest Association, or why they sought to damage my client, L &amp; N Partnership. But that\u2019s why we have court\u2019s [sic] of law to provide recourse for civil wrongs and compensation for those who are damaged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">You are the triers of the facts and we\u2019re going to ask you to find that the claims that L <em>&amp; </em>N Partnership have brought in this lawsuit are valid and should be upheld, that my client should be made whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">And if you find that the elements add up to a claim for compensatory damages that also qualifies for the awarding of punitive damages, we\u2019re going to ask that you give those punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">Our position is that the evidence will show that Lakeside Forest Association knew exactly what they were doing. They tried to exercise control without any right to do so. They treated L &amp; N Partnership property as if it were common area while L &amp; N Partnership paid the taxes, paid the insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">They admitted, and the evidence will show this, they admitted that they took for sale signs off L &amp; N Partnership property and told L &amp; N\u2019s administrative assistant that they wouldn\u2019t allow the property to be sold. This is unacceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">After you hear all of the evidence, I will ask you to do your duty under your sworn oath, to make L &amp; N whole by awarding compensatory as well as punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">{\u00b6 27} Immediately following appellee\u2019s opening statement, appellant orally moved the court for a directed verdict, pursuant to Civ.R. 50(A)(1), arguing that, assuming the truth of each and every fact contained in appellee\u2019s opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>statement, it could not prevail on tortious interference with business relations or constructive fraud. Appellant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The first element of * * * tortious interference * * * requires the plaintiff to prove a contract or a business relationship. There was absolutely no mention by plaintiff in its opening statement of a contract or business relationship. All plaintiffs counsel said was that there was an interference with the sale. Doesn\u2019t say at [sic] that a realtor had a contract. We don\u2019t know if there was a contract with a realtor or that there was a business relationship. So that element was not even commented on [in the opening statement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Knowledge by Lakeside Forest, the second element of tortious interference * * *. Well, since no contract or business relationship was mentioned there obviously was no mention of Lakeside Forest having knowledge of the same. The next item, contract breach or business relationship terminated. * * * We\u2019ve not heard any allegation that a contract was breached by someone with L <em>&amp; </em>N nor had we heard about the business relationship terminated by someone who had a business relationship with L &amp; N.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">We also haven\u2019t heard that Lakeside Forest caused any such breach or business relationship termination, which is the fourth element.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">Lack of justification and damage caused by the unlawful act. Really been no damage even mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">The second claim remaining is that of constructive fraud. * * * [N]ow this isn\u2019t just good old fashioned fraud, this is constructive fraud, a very special type of fraud and the elements to this are very special.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">The first element is a fiduciary relationship or relation of trust. Absolutely no mention of that in the opening statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">The second element is a concealment of a material fact. Once again, absolutely no mention that Lakeside Forest concealed anything from anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">The fourth element, L &amp; N\u2019s justifiable reliance. Once again, absolutely no mention that L <em>&amp; </em>N justifiably relied on a concealment of a material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">{\u00b6 28} Appellee responded, and the trial court took the matter under advisement overnight. The next morning, the trial court asked appellee\u2019s counsel if he had anything to add regarding the motion for directed verdict, and counsel replied in the negative. Thereafter, the trial court granted the motion and discharged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">{\u00b6 29} Later, appellant timely filed a motion seeking attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 2323.51 and requested a bifurcated hearing, with the first hearing addressed solely to whether appellee and/or its attorney had engaged in frivolous conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>A party may seek an award of attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(B), which provides, \u201c[A]t any time not more than thirty days after the entry of final judgment in a civil action or appeal, any party adversely affected by frivolous conduct may file a motion for an award of court costs, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the civil action or appeal.\u201d R.C. 2323.51(B)(1). \u201cAn award made pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section may be made against a party, the party\u2019s counsel of record, or both.\u201d R.C. 2323.51(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">{\u00b6 30} In its motion, appellant argued that appellee and its attorney had asserted claims that were \u201cnot warranted under existing law, cannot be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, or cannot be supported by a good faith argument for the establishment of new law\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii), and/or consisted \u201cof allegations or other factual contentions that have no evidentiary support\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(iii). The motion related to appellee\u2019s claim for \u201cencroachment\u201d that was dismissed on summary judgment and to its claims for tortious interference and constructive fraud, upon which the trial court directed a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 31} On April 8, 2008, the trial court held a hearing on the issue whether L &amp; N and/or its attorney had engaged in frivolous conduct. The parties once again disagreed as to the precise nature of the claims that went to trial. Appellant argued that the only recognized claims that appellee could possibly have pursued at trial were tortious interference with contractual or business relations and constructive fraud. Contrarily, appellee argued that it had never alleged, in any of its papers or pleadings, the existence of a business relationship or contract and that it never advanced a claim for tortious interference with contractual or business relations. Rather, it maintained that it was pursuing a claim for \u201cinterference with the sale of the property.\u201d It did not cite a case or statute recognizing such a tort; rather, it argued, \u201cthe law of torts is concerned with the duty to respect the property of others and cause of action and tort may be predicated upon an unlawful interference with the enjoyment of his or her property. That\u2019s from Am.Jur.2nd, Tort Section 32. But we don\u2019t have to go for a hornbook definition here. It is a civil wrong for which the law provides a remedy. If we don\u2019t have that, it is a frivolous litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 32} The parties also disagreed as to whether the trial court\u2019s prior decisions in the case militated for or against granting appellant\u2019s motion with respect to two of appellee\u2019s three claims. Appellant argued that because appellee\u2019s opening statement, the purpose of which is to tell the jury what a party intends to show, contained no reference to several elements of its causes of action, and in light of the fact that the trial court granted a directed verdict as a result, it was obvious that appellee\u2019s pursuit of its claims was frivolous. On the other hand, appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>argued that the directed verdict is not, ipso facto, determinative of the question whether appellee had evidence to support its claims. Appellee urged the court to remember that it had denied summary judgment on these claims and contended that survival through summary judgment proceedings demonstrates that its claims were not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">{\u00b6 33} By entry journalized on September 11, 2008, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion. In its entry, the trial court found that the claims that had survived summary judgment were (1) tortious interference with contract or business relations and (2) constructive fraud. With respect to the first claim, the court went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">Plaintiffs opening statement complained of the resistance to the placing of the sign, but did not assert any right to do so, nor did it attribute any resultant damages or loss of contract due to this lack of permission to put up a sign on the lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">Looking at the elements of this tort, there was no contract. Any contract was inchoate at best. It was certainly not breached or terminated. And there was no allegation that defendants\u2019 acts were done with malice or with a lack of justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">{\u00b6 34} With respect to the second claim, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">[T]he court is of the opinion here that the plaintiff has confused fraud with constructive fraud. Constructive fraud requires some kind of fiduciary or trust relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">[TJhere assuredly can be no such relation here where the parties were not alleged to have been anything other than strangers. The plaintiff bought exactly just what he paid $700 for, a small tract of reserve property in a subdivision, one that could not be built upon at that time. There was no allegation that defendant misled, nor that plaintiff relied, when bidding on the property at the sheriffs auction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">The court is of the opinion that the plaintiff could not make its case to a court or jury if its case stood as given in the opening statement. The elements of fraud were in large part omitted and no contract nor specific breach nor resultant damages were stated with any specificity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">[RJecovery of damages appears tenuous and any causal connection between acts of defendants and damages to plaintiffs is remote * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">{\u00b6 35} Despite these findings, however, the trial court declined to find frivolous conduct, stating, \u201cThe court is also of the opinion that the purpose of R.C. 2323.51 is to impose upon the legal profession a measure of good faith in asserting claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>and defenses in the pleadings. * * * However, omissions made during the heat of trial resulting in the sanctions in this case are not the things intended to be regulated by this statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">{\u00b6 36} Having reviewed in detail the procedural history as it relates to the claims subject of the instant dispute, and observed the evolution of appellee\u2019s claims throughout the pendency of this litigation, we now turn to appellant\u2019s assignments of error, which we will discuss together because they both involve all three claims that appellee asserted during the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">{\u00b6 37} In its first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it refused to find that appellee had engaged in frivolous conduct in asserting claims that were not warranted under existing law, cannot be supported by a good-faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, or cannot be supported by a good-faith argument for the establishment of new law. Whether a claim is warranted under existing law or can be supported by a good-faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law is a question of law, and an appellate court is not bound by the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Tomb &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Wagner </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 363, 612 N.E.2d 468; <em>Patton v. Ditmyer, </em>4th Dist. No. 05CA12, 2006-Ohio-7107, 2006 WL 3896780, \u00b6 81. \u201c[T]he test is whether no reasonable lawyer would have brought the action in light of the existing law.\u201d <em>Stafford v. Columbus Bonding Ctr., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 799, 2008-Ohio-3948, 896 N.E.2d 191, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 38} In its second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to find that appellee had engaged in frivolous conduct in pursuing claims that had no evidentiary support. Ordinarily, whether a party\u2019s pursuit of claims lacked evidentiary support involves mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Wiltberger v. Davis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 46, 51, 673 N.E.2d 628. In this case, however, the only evidence in the record regarding any of appellee\u2019s claims is that adduced during the summary judgment motion practice. As to the interference and fraud claims, no additional evidence was presented at trial. \u201c[A]n opening statement is not evidence. Rather, it is intended to advise the jury of what counsel expects the evidence to show.\u201d <em>Columbus v. Rano, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-30, 2009-Ohio-578, 2009 WL 311434, \u00b6 24. Moreover, the trial court did not take evidence at the hearing on the frivolous conduct motion; it only heard arguments from counsel. What aids our inquiry, however, is that the evidence presented during the summary judgment motion practice is and always has been undisputed \u2014 the parties\u2019 dispute has always focused upon whether the evidence of record demonstrates the existence of any actionable claim, and if so, what type of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>{\u00b6 39} We begin with appellee\u2019s \u201cencroachment\u201d claim. Appellant argues that appellee\u2019s pursuit of this claim was not warranted under existing law and was unsupported by evidence because \u201c[a] reasonable attorney would know that when L <em>&amp; </em>N purchased the property at the Auditor\u2019s sale, for $700, it was taking the property with all of its benefits, as well as all of its burdens.\u201d Appellant points out that appellee\u2019s auditor\u2019s deed plainly states that appellee took the property subject to all pre-existing easements, rights, and appurtenances and that the deed conveying all of the 11.889-acre tract to appellant would have been plainly apparent upon a thorough title search. Appellant also directs our attention to the fact that appellee\u2019s counsel acknowledged that any appeal from the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this claim would have been frivolous, a tacit acknowledgment, according to appellant, that the claim was frivolous from the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">{\u00b6 40} In response, appellee argues that there are two reasons that its \u201cencroachment\u201d claim was not frivolous: (1) because it \u201cdid not become aware of the significant encroachments on its property until it prepared to put the property up for sale\u201d and (2) because \u201cit purchased the property subject only to the Auditor\u2019s deed, and * * * not subject to the Warranty Deed relied on by Lakeside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[T]he proper recording of those instruments referenced in R.C. 5301.25(A) serves as \u2018constructive\u2019 notice of that interest or encumbrance to all who claim through or under the grantor by whom such deed was executed. Such notice, in this statutory sense, is \u2018constructive\u2019 because the subsequent purchaser is deemed to have notice of the record whether he reviewed it or not.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Thames v. Asia\u2019s Janitorial Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 579, 587, 611 N.E.2d 948; see also <em>Morris v. Daniels </em>(1880), 35 Ohio St. 406, 416; <em>Blake v. Graham </em>(1856), 6 Ohio St. 580, 583-584.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">{\u00b6 42} Moreover, R.C. 5723.12(B) clearly provides that \u201cthe conveyance of the real estate by the auditor shall extinguish all previous title and invest the purchaser with a new and perfect title that is free from all liens and encumbrances, except * * * any easements and covenants running with the land that were created prior to the time the taxes or assessments, for the nonpayment of which the land was forfeited, became due and payable * * Thus, where the chain of title contains easements and covenants running with the land that were created prior to the time the property became forfeited land, the purchaser who acquires the land by auditor\u2019s deed is on constructive notice of such burdens, and takes subject thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 43} Here, the 1981 warranty deed, by which Woodlake Colony conveyed the entire 11.889-acre tract to appellant, was undisputedly in the chain of title. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>deed defined as \u201ccommon property\u201d belonging to appellant any portions of Lakeside Forest \u201cnot set aside or intended for further subdivision into one or several dwelling lots.\u201d Prior to appellee\u2019s purchase of it, Lot 37 had been removed as a planned dwelling lot by amended plat and had been thus removed from the tax duplicate. Being no longer \u201cset aside or intended for further subdivision into one or several dwelling lots,\u201d Lot 37 was already \u201ccommon property\u201d that had been conveyed to appellant and permitted to be used \u201cfor the mutual benefit, use and enjoyment of the occupants of the Development.\u201d All of this information was within appellee\u2019s constructive knowledge prior to the time of sale. Its receipt of the auditor\u2019s deed at the judicial sale did not alter that reality. On these undisputed facts, appellant\u2019s pursuit of an \u201cencroachment\u201d claim \u2014 whether treated as one for trespass or conversion, was not warranted by existing law and had no evidentiary support. As a matter of law, pursuit of this claim amounted to frivolous conduct within the meaning of R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 44} Next, we analyze appellant\u2019s assignments of error relating to appellee\u2019s claim for \u201cinterference with sale of property.\u201d Appellant argues that appellee\u2019s pursuit of this claim was frivolous for two reasons. First, there is no recognized tort of \u201cinterference with sale of property.\u201d Second, even after the trial court liberally construed this claim as being the recognized tort of \u201ctortious interference with contract or business relationship,\u201d appellee had no evidence of two essential elements of that tort, to wit: the existence of a contract or a business relationship, and damage thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 45} In response, appellee argues that its pursuit of this claim was not frivolous. However, its brief contains no citation of authority for the proposition that \u201cinterference with sale of property\u201d is a recognized tort, and we are not aware of any such authority. Removal of \u201cfor sale\u201d signs could be construed as a trespass, conversion, or (coupled with additional factual allegations) interference with contractual or business relations, but appellee does not argue that it was pursuing any of those torts. In fact, appellee vehemently insists that it was never pursuing a claim for tortious interference with contractual or business relations because \u201c[tjhere was no contract or business relationship.\u201d Appellee does not argue that it ever made an argument for the establishment of new law; rather, it argues that it was pursuing a valid cause of action, and the trial court unexpectedly chose to characterize its claim as a different valid cause of action. Appellee\u2019s argument resolves, then, to the notion that it was pursuing a claim for \u201cinterference with sale of property,\u201d but it should not be charged with having engaged in frivolous conduct because it did not know until the trial court granted a directed verdict that the trial court had \u201caccepted [appellant\u2019s] transformation of the Interference with Sale claim to a Tortuous [sic] Interference with Contract or Business Relationship claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>{\u00b6 46} However, that argument ignores the fact that \u201cinterference with sale of property\u201d is not a recognized tort in Ohio. Whether a claim is or is not warranted under existing law \u2014 that is, in this case, whether it is a recognized tort \u2014 is not dependent upon how a trial judge rules with respect to a motion for directed verdict; a tort either is, or is not, recognized. In this case, appellee pursued a claim that does not exist and failed or refused to adduce facts sufficient to make even a prima facie case for any tort that is recognized. Accordingly, pursuit of the claim for \u201cinterference with sale of property\u201d was frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii) and (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">{\u00b6 47} Finally, we analyze appellant\u2019s assignments of error relating to appellee\u2019s claim for constructive fraud. Appellant argues that one of the elements of a constructive fraud claim is the existence of a fiduciary duty or relationship of trust between appellant and appellee. Here, because the parties were strangers to one another, appellee could never have proven that such a relationship or duty existed. Therefore, appellant argues, pursuit of this claim was frivolous. Appellant maintains that this was not simply a matter of appellee\u2019s counsel inadvertently omitting to mention this element in his opening statement. Rather, appellant points out that while appellee\u2019s counsel and the trial court discussed the motion for directed verdict, appellee\u2019s counsel made it clear that appellee had never intended to present evidence of such a relationship because appellee\u2019s counsel did not believe that this was an essential element of a claim for constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 48} Appellee argues that it did indeed believe, and still maintains, that the existence of a special trust or fiduciary relationship is not an element of the tort of constructive fraud. Thus, it argues, \u201cwith no guidance available from Ohio Jury Instructions, the Constructive Fraud Claim would rise or fall based on which proposed instructions the Court accepted.\u201d For this reason, appellee argues, its pursuit of this claim was not unwarranted by existing law, nor was it unsupported by sufficient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cConstructive fraud is defined as \u2018a breach of a legal or equitable duty, which, irrespective of moral guilt of the fraud feasor, the law declares fraudulent, because of its tendency to deceive others, to violate public or private confidence, or to injure public interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cohen v. Estate of Cohen </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 90, 91, 23 OBR 218, 491 N.E.2d 698, quoting <em>Stanley v. Sewell Coal Co. </em>(1981), 169 W.Va. 72, 285 S.E.2d 679, 683; <em>In re Guardianship of Guzay, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-745, 2003-Ohio-5036, 2003 WL 22177106, \u00b621. \u201cConstructive fraud requires a confidential relationship. The law relating to constructive fraud assumes fraud to protect significant social interests when parties have a special fiduciary or confidential relationship which places one party in a position to take an unfair advantage over another.\u201d <em>Woodworth v. Hunting</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>ton Natl. Bank </em>(Dec. 7, 1995), 10th Dist. No. 95APE02-219, 1995 WL 723664, *4, citing <em>Perlberg v. Perlberg </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 55, 47 O.O.2d 167, 247 N.E.2d 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">{\u00b6 50} The foregoing authorities, all of which predate the filing of appellee\u2019s original complaint, establish that an essential element of a cause of action for constructive fraud is the existence of a public or private confidence, the violation of which breaches a legal or equitable duty, or, put another way, a special fiduciary or a confidential relationship that places one party in a position to take an unfair advantage over another. Appellee admits that it never had any evidence of this element and never intended to present any such evidence. Indeed, contrary to the above authorities, it did not believe that this was required in order to establish a prima facie case for constructive fraud. On this record, pursuit of appellee\u2019s claim for constructive fraud was frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii) and (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 51} For all of the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained. Sanctions for frivolous conduct may be imposed upon either a party or his attorney or both. R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a). \u201c[Sanctions may be imposed both jointly and severally upon both plaintiff and counsel, if the conduct so warrants.\u201d <em>Sain v. Roo </em>(Oct. 23, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 01AP-360, 2001 WL 1263665, *8. \u201c[Sjanctions should be imposed upon the person who is actually responsible for the frivolous conduct.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. Lauder </em>(Nov. 12, 1996), 4th Dist. No. 96CA5, 1996 WL 666658, *6. \u201cWhere a * * * court has found the existence of frivolous conduct, the decision to assess or not to assess a penalty lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Sain </em>at *3, citing <em>Wiltberger v. Davis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 46, 52, 673 N.E.2d 628. Accordingly, it is not within this court\u2019s province to decide, in the first instance, whether sanctions should be imposed. Therefore, this cause will be remanded for the trial court to engage in that inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 52} In summary, appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained, the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Judgment reversed cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-8\">McGrath and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. Appellee asserted its encroachment claim against the Bhim-Raos and appellant, while it asserted the remaining two claims against appellant only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">. Appellant claims that appellee's complaint also contained a frivolous Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (''RICO'') claim. However, even though the complaint contains a reference to Ohio criminal RICO statutes, it does not set forth a civil RICO claim, and appellee never pursued a civil RICO claim against appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
