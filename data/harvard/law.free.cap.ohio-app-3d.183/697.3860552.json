A.S.\u2019s biological father is also Amy\u2019s biological father, and the father is not a party to this appeal. A.S. was born as a result of an incestuous relationship between Amy and her father. On November 9, 2005, BCDJFS filed a complaint alleging A.S. to be dependent. In this complaint, BCDJFS alleges that it has had a lengthy history with this family dating back to 1990 over concerns of domestic violence and physical and sexual abuse, and that several of A.S.\u2019s siblings have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>previously been adjudicated dependent. The complaint further alleges that Amy was arrested for domestic violence against A.S.\u2019s sibling on October 29, 2005. After an ex parte hearing, the juvenile court awarded emergency temporary custody of A.S. to his adult sister, Tabitha M. In addition, a case plan to reunify A.S. with both Amy and Sheila was implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">{\u00b6 3} On February 8, 2006, the juvenile court adjudicated A.S. dependent. The court granted Amy and Sheila supervised visitation with A.S. at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">{\u00b6 4} On February 22, 2006, Sheila filed a motion requesting an emergency shelter care hearing, alleging that A.S. should be removed from Tabitha\u2019s home because there was a risk of immediate harm to A.S. After a hearing on March 29, 2006, the juvenile court terminated the order of temporary custody to Tabitha and placed A.S. in the temporary custody of BCDJFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">{\u00b6 5} On May 24, 2006, the juvenile court held a dispositional hearing. Amy failed to appear for the hearing, and Sheila attended the hearing and requested temporary custody of A.S. The juvenile court denied Sheila\u2019s request but permitted her to continue supervised visitation with A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 6} On January 16, 2007, the juvenile court held a review hearing and ordered that Sheila could transport A.S. to the home of Amanda Miller, who is A.S.\u2019s maternal aunt, in Kentucky for unsupervised visitations. However, on August 8, 2007, BCDJFS moved to change the visitation arrangements between Sheila and A.S. after A.S. reported being hurt by his mother, grandmother, siblings, and other relatives on multiple occasions. On that date, the juvenile court held an ex parte hearing and rescinded its previous order permitting unsupervised visitations between Sheila and A.S., and granted Sheila supervised visitations with A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 7} On August 22, 2007, BCDJFS moved to suspend visitation between Sheila and A.S., and on September 20, 2007 a juvenile court magistrate granted the motion. Sheila objected to the juvenile court magistrate\u2019s decision, and on November 28, 2007, the juvenile court sustained her objection in part. At that time, the juvenile court ordered that A.S. be moved to a different foster placement and that both Amy and Sheila could resume supervised visitations with A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">{\u00b6 8} On November 29, 2007, BCDJFS moved for permanent custody, stating that A.S. cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable time and should not be placed with either parent, that neither parent can provide adequate parental care for A.S., and that granting permanent custody of A.S. to BCDJFS is in the child\u2019s best interest. On April 8, 2008, Amy moved for legal custody of A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The juvenile court held a trial before a magistrate on the custody motions in several parts, from May 2008 to October 2008. On November 18, 2008, before the juvenile court magistrate issued a decision, Sheila moved for legal custody of A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">{\u00b6 10} On January 12, 2009, the magistrate issued a decision granting BGDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody. Both Amy and Sheila objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and on February 9, 2009, the juvenile court overruled all objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 11} Amy, Sheila, and A.S., through his attorney, separately appeal the juvenile court\u2019s decision. In their appeals, Amy raises one assignment of error, Sheila raises three assignments of error, and A.S. raises one assignment of error. Amy\u2019s sole assignment of error, Sheila\u2019s second and third assignments of error, and A.S.\u2019s assignment of error will be discussed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 12} Amy\u2019s Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by granting the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">{\u00b6 14} Sheila\u2019s Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe court erred as a matter of fact and law and abused its discretion when it found terminating the parental rights of the mother and not reunifying with appellant to be in the child\u2019s best interest because such was not the only means of obtaining a legally secure permanent placement for the child, such was not supported by clear and convincing evidence and/or [sic] because permanent custody was not in the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">{\u00b6 16} Sheila\u2019s Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe court\u2019s decision and order of permanent custody was against the manifest weight of the evidence, there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings and the evidence presented failed to meet the requisite clear and convincing standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">{\u00b6 18} A.S.\u2019s Assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe juvenile court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion when it found that terminating mother\u2019s parental rights was in the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-15\">{\u00b6 20} Initially, we note that Sheila, who is not a parent of this child, has presented several arguments under her assignments of error. While Sheila was considered as a potential custodian of the child, the juvenile court was not obligated to do so pursuant to her motion for <em>legal custody </em>filed on November 18, 2008. \u201cAny person who seeks an award of legal custody of a child must, in accordance with [R.C. 2151.353 and Juv.R. 34] file a motion, prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>dispositional hearing, requesting such custody.\u201d <em>In re L.R.T., </em>165 Ohio App.3d 77, 2006-Ohio-207, 844 N.E.2d 914, \u00b6 13. However, we will consider Sheila\u2019s arguments as they pertain to the juvenile court\u2019s decision granting BCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">{\u00b6 21} Before a natural parent\u2019s constitutionally protected liberty interest in the care and custody of his child may be terminated, the state is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory standards for permanent custody have been met. <em>Santosky v. Kramer </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 745, 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599. An appellate court\u2019s review of a juvenile court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody is limited to whether sufficient credible evidence exists to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination. <em>In re Starkey, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 612, 2002-Ohio-6892, 782 N.E.2d 665, \u00b6 16. A reviewing court will reverse a finding by the juvenile court that the evidence was clear and convincing only if there is a sufficient conflict in the evidence presented. <em>In re Rodgers </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 510, 520, 741 N.E.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 2151.414(B) requires the juvenile court to apply a two-part test when terminating parental rights and awarding permanent custody to a children services agency. Specifically, the court must find that (1) the grant of permanent custody to the agency is in the best interest of the child, utilizing, in part, the factors of R.C. 2151.414(D), and (2) any of the following apply: the child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with either parent; the child is abandoned; the child is orphaned; or the child has been in the temporary custody of the agency for at least 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d); <em>In re Schaefer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 498, 2006-Ohio-5513, 857 N.E.2d 532, \u00b6 1-36; <em>In re Ebenschweiger, </em>Butler App. No. CA2003-04-080, 2003-Ohio-5990, 2003 WL 22533124, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">{\u00b6 23} The juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence, and appellants do not dispute, that A.S. is dependent, has been in the temporary custody of BCDJFS for more than 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period as of the date BCDJFS filed the permanent-custody motion, and that A.S. is legally abandoned. However, appellants dispute the juvenile court\u2019s finding that granting permanent custody of A.S. to BCDJFS is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2151.414(D) provides that in considering the best interest of a child in a permanent-custody hearing, \u201cthe court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(1) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who may significantly affect the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>{\u00b6 26} \u201c(2) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(3) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18,1999;</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(4) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(5) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in relation to the parents and child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">{\u00b6 30} With respect to R.C. 2151.414(D)(1), the magistrate found that A.S. was initially removed from Sheila\u2019s custody due to domestic violence in her home. According to the record, BCDJFS has received at least 14 referrals regarding this family, including several instances of domestic violence where Sheila was alleged to have been the perpetrator. When the juvenile court liberalized Sheila\u2019s visitations with A.S. from supervised to unsupervised, A.S. was reported to have returned from weekend visitations with bruises, scratches, and other injuries. A.S. reported that on these visitations, A.S. was frequently slapped, scratched, and punched by his family members. After this series of incidents, A.S. and the child\u2019s therapist requested a change in visitation, and the juvenile court reinstated supervised visitations. Sheila has consistently attended visitations with A.S., but Amy did not attend visitations consistently until after BCDJFS moved for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">{\u00b6 31} During the time when visitations with A.S. were unsupervised, the child had contact with siblings and other relatives. However, A.S. reported abuse by these siblings and relatives and expressed that he does not wish to visit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">{\u00b6 32} A.S.\u2019s guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) reports that A.S. has resided with the same therapeutic foster home for 31 months and that he has expressed a desire to remain in this foster home. The juvenile court found that A.S. is very bonded to his foster mother and that his foster mother will consider adopting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">{\u00b6 33} With respect to R.C. 2151.414(D)(2), the juvenile court indicated that the GAL recommends granting permanent custody of the child to BCDJFS. Despite the fact that A.S., through his attorney, has joined in this appeal with Amy and Sheila, the child\u2019s GAL maintains that the juvenile court correctly granted BCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody. Further, the juvenile court stated that during an in camera interview with A.S., the child stated that he wished to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>remain in the custody of his foster mother but would like to continue to visit Amy and her newest child, who is A.S.\u2019s half-brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">{\u00b6 34} With respect to R.C. 2151.414(D)(3), the juvenile court found that at the time BCDJFS filed the complaint, Sheila had legal custody of A.S. based on a previous case involving this family. At that time, Amy was only 14 years old. After BCDJFS filed the complaint in this case, A.S. was placed with his maternal aunt, Tabitha M. A.S. was removed from this placement and placed in the temporary custody of BCDJFS on March 29, 2006 and remained in BCDJFS\u2019s custody until and after the filing of the permanent-custody motion on November 29, 2007. Accordingly, the juvenile court found that A.S. has been in BCDJFS\u2019s custody for more than 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period preceding the filing of the permanent-custody motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">{\u00b6 35} With respect to R.C. 2151.414(D)(4), the juvenile court found that A.S. is in need of a legally secure permanent placement as he has been in alternative care since November 2005 and that this need cannot be met without granting BCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody. The juvenile court found that despite Amy\u2019s claim that she has made progress in the case plan, it could not ignore the nearly two-year gap between her initial court appearances and her participation in any case-plan services. While Amy claims the reason for her lack of involvement in this case is that she was pregnant with another child, the record reveals that she was also incarcerated and had outstanding arrest warrants during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">{\u00b6 36} Additionally, the juvenile court expressed concern over Amy\u2019s lack of knowledge as to important areas of A.S.\u2019s life, including his academic performance, emotional adjustment, and daily activities, even after she became involved in this case. Dr. Joseph Lipari, the psychologist who evaluated Amy, stated that as a result of her own childhood abuse, Amy has a greatly diminished capacity to relate to others, and that it would be very difficult for Amy to provide the consistency and stability that a child with special needs requires. Dr. Lipari stated that Amy was not able to effectively interact and communicate with A.S. Dr. Lipari further stated that reunification with A.S. should not even be considered until Amy is willing to undergo long-term therapy. Amy has stated that she does not feel she needs therapy, but has begun counseling as required under the case plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">{\u00b6 37} Further, the juvenile court stated it is concerned about Amy\u2019s ability to support A.S. financially. Amy receives public assistance and works sporadically for her landlord, but has no full-time job, has no driver\u2019s license, and has expressed no clear plan as to how she can financially support A.S. in the long term. Also, the juvenile court noted that Amy still owes substantial court costs as a result of a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>{\u00b6 38} With respect to Sheila, the juvenile court noted that she has actively engaged in case-plan services and visitations. However, the juvenile court is concerned that Sheila does not fully comprehend how the abusive dynamics of her family have directly affected A.S. Several experts testified that the physical abuse A.S. has suffered while under Sheila\u2019s care has had a severe negative impact on his development. Further, Sheila has shown no ability to protect A.S. from abuse, nor has she demonstrated that she can provide a safe, stable environment for A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">{\u00b6 39} With respect to R.C. 2151.414(E)(10), the juvenile court found that A.S. has been abandoned. The juvenile court found that Amy failed to have contact with A.S. from August 22, 2007 until November 28, 2007. Further, the juvenile court noted that Amy did not have contact with the child from the time he was placed in foster care on March 29, 2006 until January 2007. R.C. 2151.011(C) provides that \u201c[f]or purposes of this chapter, a child shall be presumed abandoned when the parents of the child have failed to visit or maintain contact with the child for more than ninety days, regardless of whether the parents resume contact with the child after that period of ninety days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">{\u00b6 40} In addition, the juvenile court considered R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cFollowing the placement of the child outside his home and notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and repeatedly for a period of six months or more to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed outside his home. In determining whether the parents have substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and rehabilitative services and material resources that were made available to the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to resume and maintain parental duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">{\u00b6 42} Despite participating in case-plan services and being reunited with two of her own children, the juvenile court found that Sheila has failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions that led to A.S.\u2019s removal. As discussed above, A.S. was removed from Sheila\u2019s care due to allegations of domestic violence, and she has not demonstrated that she can consistently keep A.S. safe from abuse from family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">{\u00b6 43} While Amy began making progress with case-plan services after BCDJFS moved for permanent custody, she is not excused from abandoning A.S. and failing to comply with case-plan services for nearly two years. Based on Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Lipari\u2019s evaluation of Amy, she will not be in a position to parent A.S. until she undergoes long-term treatment. Further, as discussed above, Amy cannot financially support A.S. Accordingly, the juvenile court also found that Amy has failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions that led to A.S.\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">{\u00b6 44} The juvenile court also found R.C. 2151.414(E)(4) applicable, which provides that \u201c[t]he parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home for the child.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As discussed above, Amy demonstrated a lack of commitment toward A.S. by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with A.S. when able to do so for several periods of time while this case has been pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 45} With respect to appellants\u2019 argument that the appropriate disposition in this case would have been a planned permanent living arrangement (\u201cPPLA\u201d), we remind appellants that the juvenile court was without authority to place A.S. in a PPLA, as BCDJFS did not file a motion requesting such a disposition. <em>In re A.B., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 230, 2006-Ohio-4359, 852 N.E.2d 1187, \u00b6 37. Moreover, BCDJFS had no obligation to request such a disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 46} In finding that granting permanent custody of A.S. to BCDJFS is in the child\u2019s best interest, the juvenile court thoroughly analyzed the evidence and testimony from the permanent-custody hearings, and its findings are supported by sufficient clear and convincing evidence. As an appellate court reviewing a decision granting permanent custody, we neither weigh the evidence nor assess the credibility of the witnesses, but instead determine whether there is sufficient clear and convincing evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s decision. See <em>In re Dunn, </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2008AP030018, 2008-Ohio-3785, 2008 WL 2916371.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 47} Amy\u2019s assignment of error, Sheila\u2019s second and third assignments of error, and A.S.\u2019s assignment of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">{\u00b6 48} Sheila\u2019s Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThe trial court erred, appellant was denied her constitutional due process and confrontational rights, and the outcome was prejudiced when the court admitted and considered improper and/or irrelevant evidence at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>{\u00b6 50} In her first assignment of error, Sheila presents several arguments that the juvenile court erred in admitting and considering certain evidence at trial. First, she maintains that her psychological evaluation from 1999 was improperly admitted into evidence and that admission of therapy reports into evidence violates her constitutional due process and confrontational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 51} Initially, we note, as we stated in <em>In re K.E., </em>Butler App. No. CA2007-03-069, 2007-Ohio-3967, 2007 WL 2229573; and <em>In re House </em>(Feb. 24, 1992), Butler App. Nos. CA91-01-016, and CA91-02-022, 11, 1992 WL 35038:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe Sixth Amendment provides, in pertinent part, <em>\u2018[i]n all criminal prosecutions, </em>the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) The right of cross-examination is one of the primary interests secured by the Confrontation Clause. <em>Douglas v. Alabama </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076[, 13 L.Ed.2d 934]. However, proceedings instituted in a juvenile court are civil in nature and not criminal. <em>Cope v. Campbell </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 475[, 26 O.O.2d 88, 196 N.E.2d 457]. Since an action commenced in juvenile court is by definition noncriminal, the Sixth Amendment is inapplicable and the right to confrontation and cross-examination does not attach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 53} The admission or exclusion of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that has created material prejudice. <em>In re J.D., </em>Butler App. No. CA2005-09-375, 2006-Ohio-3468, 2006 WL 1840385, \u00b6 7. Therefore, we must determine whether the juvenile court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably in deciding the evidentiary issues. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 54} Hearsay is defined in the Rules of Evidence as a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Evid.R. 801(C); <em>In re J.J., </em>Butler App. No. CA2005-12-525, 2006-Ohio-2999, 2006 WL 1642150, \u00b6 18. Unless a valid exception applies, hearsay is inadmissible. Evid.R. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 55} At the permanent-custody trial, BCDJFS moved to admit into evidence Sheila\u2019s certified therapy records from Cumberland River Comprehensive Care Center and a psychological evaluation report of Sheila from 1999. Sheila objected to the admission of these documents, arguing that they are hearsay evidence and that BCDJFS failed to provide a proper foundation for admitting the records. The juvenile court overruled Sheila\u2019s objections and admitted the certified records and psychological report into evidence under an Evid.R. 804(B) exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>{\u00b6 56} The record does not indicate which Evid.R. 804(B) hearsay exception the juvenile court applied in admitting the certified documents. Evid.R. 804(B) creates hearsay exceptions for the following types of evidence: (1) former testimony, (2) statement under belief of impending death, (3) statement against interest, (4) statement against personal or family history, (5) statement by a deceased or incompetent person, and (6) forfeiture by wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 57} We find that the trial court erred in admitting the certified records and 1999 psychological report into evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B), as none of the hearsay exceptions under this rule applies to the records and report. However, we find this error to be harmless. While these documents may be admissible under other Rules of Evidence, there is nothing in the juvenile court\u2019s decision indicating that the juvenile court actually considered these records or otherwise relied on them in reaching its decision to grant BCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is ample admissible evidence in the record, as discussed above, that supports the juvenile court\u2019s decision granting BCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 58} Further, we find that a substantial portion of information contained in the 1999 psychological report is included in a more recent psychological evaluation of Sheila from 2006, which was properly admitted into evidence. An exhibit that is improperly admitted into evidence is not prejudicial where it contains a mere surplus of facts. See <em>State v. Lallathin, </em>Noble App. No. 299, 2003-Ohio-3478, 2003 WL 21500290, \u00b6 37. Accordingly, we find that admission of these records and report did not prejudice Sheila, nor did they violate her due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 59} Next, Sheila argues that the juvenile court magistrate erred in ordering a stay of the juvenile court\u2019s previous order to change A.S.\u2019s foster living arrangement. Sheila maintains that the magistrate abused its discretion in ordering this stay and in considering any evidence related to A.S.\u2019s foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">{\u00b6 60} On November 28, 2007, the juvenile court sustained in part Sheila\u2019s objections to the juvenile court magistrate\u2019s decision to terminate Sheila\u2019s visitation on August 29, 2007. Specifically, the juvenile court stated, \u201cThe child\u2019s foster placement shall be changed. This shall take place in a gradual manner with input from the attorney for the child * * * and the GAL. * * * Amy [S.] is hereby granted supervised visitation as a part of this order. Sheila [S.] is hereby granted supervised visitation as a part of this order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>{\u00b6 61} At a hearing on February 21, 2008 before the .magistrate, Amy notified the court that A.S.\u2019s GAL had a conflict because the GAL had served as Amy\u2019s GAL in a previous case. On April 1, 2008, A.S.\u2019s GAL was relieved of her duties and the magistrate ordered that a new GAL be appointed for the child. Because the juvenile court\u2019s previous order to change A.S.\u2019s foster-living arrangement required input from the child\u2019s original GAL, the magistrate stayed the juvenile court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b6 62} We find that based on these facts and circumstances, the magistrate was authorized to stay the order to change A.S.\u2019s foster placement. As BCDJFS correctly states, Civ.R. 53(D)(2)(a)(i) provides that \u201ca magistrate may enter orders without judicial approval if necessary to regulate the proceedings and if not dispositive of a claim or defense of a party.\u201d The magistrate did not \u201coverrule\u201d the juvenile court\u2019s previous order, as Sheila argues, but instead stayed the juvenile court\u2019s order until the issues presented could be resolved. This temporary stay was not \u201cdispositive of a claim or defense of a party.\u201d See Civ.R. 53(D)(2)(a)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">{\u00b6 63} Moreover, Civ.R. 53(C)(2), authorizes magistrates \u201cto regulate all proceedings as if by the court.\u201d Civ.R. 53(D)(2)(b) permits a party to file a motion with the court within ten days after the order is entered, asking that the magistrate\u2019s order be set aside. Sheila failed to file a motion to set aside the magistrate\u2019s order, and her failure to do so results in a forfeiture of this issue on appeal. See <em>Rayess v. Kaplan Edn. Ctr., </em>Greene App. No. 08-CA-29, 2009-Ohio-1962, 2009 WL 1125537, \u00b6 26; <em>Hayne v. </em>Hayne, Medina App. No. 07CA0100-M, 2008-Ohio-4296, 2008 WL 3892155, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">{\u00b6 64} Sheila\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">{\u00b6 65} The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b743-10\">Young, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b743-11\">Ringland, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\">.

We note that Sheila's therapy at Cumberland River was part of her case plan.

However, I find it troublesome that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s reading of R.C. 2151.353(A)(5) in <em>In re A.B., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 230, 2006-Ohio-4359, 852 N.E.2d 1187, limits the juvenile court\u2019s power to fulfill its statutory obligations. According to R.C. 2151.01(A), the Ohio General Assembly charged the juvenile courts with providing for \u201cthe care, protection, and mental and physical development of children subject to Chapter 2151 of the Revised Code.\u201d In doing so, determining a child\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>interests is the paramount responsibility of the juvenile court when considering custody issues and whether or not to terminate a parent\u2019s rights under R.C. 2151.414(B). Specifically, that section parcels out several factors a court is required to consider while determining the child\u2019s best interests. Although I agree with the majority that the juvenile court correctly considered these factors, I write separately to express my discontent that juvenile courts are not granted the discretion to order a planned permanent living arrangement (\u201cPPLA\u201d) absent a request for one from an involved children services agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">{\u00b6 67} As Justice Pfeifer noted in AS.\u2019s dissenting opinion, a major difference exists between an initial determination that a child is abused, dependent, or neglected and subsequent modifications of initial orders. During the preliminary adjudication phase, children service agencies play an important role and may be in a better position to determine the best placement option for the affected child. However, once the initial orders need modification or termination, the juvenile court is \u201cin the best position to determine whether a permanent placement is in the best interests of the child.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">{\u00b6 68} Nevertheless, because the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s current reading of R.C. 2151.353(A) prohibits a juvenile court from sua sponte ordering a PPLA, children service agencies have more authority and discretion than a juvenile court when determining what placement is best for a child. As one writer aptly stated, \u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AB. </em>emasculates the role of * * * the judge in child protection hearings in Ohio. The decision assumes that the agency is the sole (or best) arbiter of the child\u2019s best interests by giving broad authority to the state child welfare agency. * * * Only when the agency has first determined a PPLA placement to be the child\u2019s best interest may a judge determine that the placement is in fact in the child\u2019s best interest. This is, to put it mildly, an illogical result. Such a result ties the hands of judges and [guardian ad litems] who disagree with the agency\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interest, and it may even prevent the child\u2019s true best interests from being achieved.\u201d McGill, Agency Knows Best? Restricting Judges\u2019 Ability to Place Children in Aternative Planned Permanent Living Arrangements (2007), 58 Case W. Res.L.Rev. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 69} In addition to usurping the judge\u2019s role in determining the child\u2019s best interests, prohibiting a juvenile court from ordering a PPLA also leaves a children services agency\u2019s decision not to request one unreviewable. Unlike the juvenile court, whose decision is reviewed by higher courts (if not its electorate), agency decisions are not reviewable under the current reading of R.C. 2151.353(A)(5) because if children services refuses to request a PPLA, the juvenile court cannot even consider whether such a plan would be in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>{\u00b6 70} Because the ultimate responsibility of determining a child\u2019s best interests rests with the juvenile court, prohibiting it from ordering or considering that a PPLA may be in the child\u2019s best interest absent a request from a children services agency may be a violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 71} I realize that the parties to the case at bar did not raise this constitutional issue. However, I cannot ignore that the outcome of vesting discretion to implement a PPLA with an agency rather than the juvenile court (whether through neglect or design) is the \u201ctail wagging the dog\u201d and substantially curtails the juvenile court\u2019s ability to fulfill its statutory obligations. Therefore, and until the Ohio Supreme Court reconsiders its interpretation and vests discretion in juvenile courts to order PPLAs, I concur in judgment only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
