Murphy alleged that Lundy had moved with A.D.M. to Mesa, Arizona, on or about July 8, 2007. Murphy\u2019s motion was referred to a magistrate. The summary of docket and journal entries does not indicate that the magistrate ordered hearings on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">{\u00b6 4} The magistrate filed a decision on October 2, 2007. The decision states that the case \u201ccame before Magistrate G. Douglas Herdman administratively on September 24, 2007,\u201d and that the relief regarding support and custody that the motion requested was denied \u201cbecause this Court is no longer a preferred jurisdiction to hear matters involving the child\u2019s custody since he resides in another state with his custodial mother.\u201d - Parental testing was denied because Murphy had acknowledged paternity of A.D.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">{\u00b6 5} Murphy filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Murphy challenged the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusion that a court of another state, Arizona, is a more convenient forum and objected that the magistrate decided the issue of jurisdiction without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The trial court did not rule on Murphy\u2019s objections, but referred the matter to the magistrate \u201cfor further consideration of the jurisdiction of this Court to determine custody of said child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">{\u00b6 7} The magistrate conducted a proceeding with the parties present in person or by telephone on January 15, 2008. The magistrate took no evidence, but during a colloquy with Murphy\u2019s counsel the magistrate suggested that Lundy and A.D.M.\u2019s move to Arizona operated to deprive Ohio of jurisdiction to hear and determine the relief Murphy\u2019s motion requested, notwithstanding the juvenile court\u2019s 2006 child-support order. The magistrate filed a decision on January 31, 2008, so holding. The decision again denied Murphy\u2019s request for parental testing because he had acknowledged paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">{\u00b6 8} Murphy filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Murphy argued that Ohio has jurisdiction under R.C. 3127.15(A)(1) because A.D.M. was a resident of Ohio until July 2007, which was within six months prior to the filing of Murphy\u2019s motion on September 4, 2007. Murphy also objected to other matters. Murphy filed supplemental objections on the issue of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">{\u00b6 9} The juvenile court sustained Murphy\u2019s objection, finding that the court did not lack jurisdiction to grant the relief his motion requested. However, the court also adopted the decision of the magistrate (who found that the court lacked jurisdiction), concluding:</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe Court has considered the factors listed in R.C. 3127.21(B), and finds this Court is an inconvenient forum. The most persuasive factor in the Court\u2019s determination is that the location of the evidence necessary to resolve the pending litigation is in Arizona. Ms. Lundy currently resides in Arizona and her testimony as well as the testimony of the child is likely necessary to determine the pending custody litigation. Therefore, this Court will decline to exercise its jurisdiction after careful consideration of the factors listed in R.C. 3127.21(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cFurther, the Court denies Mr. Murphy\u2019s request to modify the current support order because there is not currently sufficient evidence in the available record, which would warrant this Court to modify the support order. However, if Mr. Murphy pursues custody or visitation with the Arizona Court he should further request modification of the support order, and provide proof of his necessary travel expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">{\u00b6 12} Murphy filed a notice of appeal from that final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe court erred in declining to accept jurisdiction because Ohio was an inconvenient forum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The trial court correctly found that it does not lack jurisdiction to hear and determine Murphy\u2019s motion. Ohio was A.D.M.\u2019s home state until July 2007, which was within six months before the motion was filed on September 4, 2007. R.C. 3721.15(A)(1). Furthermore, having ordered Murphy in 2006 to pay child support, the court has continuing jurisdiction regarding matters of support and custody. R.C. 2151.23(F)(1) and (2), 3109.04, 3109.05, and 3105.21; <em>Van Divort v. Van Divort </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 141, 59 O.O. 207, 134 N.E.2d 715; Civ.R. 75(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 3127.21(A) states: \u201cA court of this state that has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more convenient forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court\u2019s own motion, or at the request of another court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 3127.21(B) provides, \u201cBefore determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, <em>the court shall allow the parties to submit information </em>and shall consider all relevant factors, including the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(1) Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(2) The length of time the child has resided outside this state;</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(3) The distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(4) The relative financial circumstances of the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(5) Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(6) The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including the testimony of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(7) The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence;</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(8) The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">{\u00b6 25} The juvenile court could not consider the factors in R.C. 3127.21(B)(1) through (8) in order to find, on the magistrate\u2019s own motion, that the Arizona court is a more convenient forum without first \u201callowing] the parties to submit information\u201d concerning those factors that are relevant to that issue. Id. Because neither the magistrate nor the court allowed the parties to do that, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>juvenile court erred when it proceeded to find that the Arizona court is a more convenient forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">{\u00b6 26} Neither could the court deny Murphy\u2019s request to modify child support on a finding that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to grant that relief, never having afforded Murphy a hearing on the merits of the relief his motion requested. On remand, the court need not reach that issue if it properly finds that the Arizona court is a more convenient forum. If the court makes that finding, it is required to stay the proceedings on condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in Arizona. R.C. 3127.21(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 27} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cCourt erred when it engaged in ex parte communications with the respondent-appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe court erred in upholding the magistrate\u2019s recommendation which denied the petitioner-appellant\u2019s motion to cancel or reduce child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">{\u00b6 30} Our disposition of the first assignment of error renders the second and third assignments of error moot. Therefore, we need not decide them. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">{\u00b6 31} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b840-13\">Fain and Froelich, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
