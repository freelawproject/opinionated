(\u201cHidy\u201d), on Sheaffer and Sutton\u2019s counterclaims arising from their former employment by Hidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">{\u00b6 2} Hidy is an automobile dealership. Hidy hired Sheaffer to work as a car salesman in November 2005. At that time, Sheaffer was 67 years old. Hidy hired Sutton to work as a car salesman in January 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">{\u00b6 3} Sheaffer and Sutton each signed Hidy\u2019s employee noncompetition and confidentiality agreement when they were hired. The agreement prohibits employees from directly or indirectly competing with the business in which Hidy is engaged for two years following termination of their employment by Hidy. Matt Castrucci\u2019s Auto Mall in Dayton is specifically identified in the agreement as one of the businesses in competition with Hidy for which former employees cannot work.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">{\u00b6 4} Sheaffer quickly became one of Hidy\u2019s top salespersons. On March 15, 2006, Sheaffer quit his employment at Hidy and accepted a position as general sales manager at Joseph Airport Toyota. Sheaffer worked for Joseph Airport Toyota for approximately two months before he was terminated following a disagreement with company management. Tim Bell, Hidy\u2019s general sales manager, then contacted Sheaffer and offered him an opportunity to return to employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ment at Hidy as a new-car salesman, on terms the same as Sheaffer\u2019s prior employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">{\u00b6 5} Sheaffer accepted Bell\u2019s offer and returned to Hidy on May 5, 2006. Sheaffer did not sign Hidy\u2019s noncompetition agreement when he began this second period of employment. The pay structure was the same as his prior employment with Hidy, but Bell assigned Sheaffer to the least desirable sales desk in the showroom. Sheaffer also lost all of his seniority that would permit him to receive more-favorable job assignments at Hidy. Further, Sheaffer had to reapply and wait to requalify for all of his fringe benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 6} According to Sheaffer, Bell began harassing Sheaffer because of his age shortly after Sheaffer returned to Hidy, and he continued to do so until Sheaffer resigned almost a year later on April 30, 2007. Sheaffer contends that he resigned because of the age harassment. Hidy disagrees, and argues that Sheaffer resigned solely to seek what he believed to be a better sales opportunity at Matt Castrucci\u2019s Auto Mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 7} Sheaffer began working for Matt Castrucci\u2019s Auto Mall on May 1, 2007. Sutton also accepted a job with Matt Castrucci\u2019s Auto Mall. Joe Hidy, the dealership manager at Hidy, telephoned Matt Castrucci shortly thereafter and complained that Sheaffer and Sutton had signed noncompetition agreements with Hidy. As a result of that telephone conversation, Matt Castrucci fired both Sheaffer and Sutton.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 8} On May 7, 2007, Hidy filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that the two-year noncompetition agreements signed by Sheaffer in November 2005 and Sutton in January 2006 are enforceable and legally binding. Sheaffer filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging age harassment, negligent supervision and retention, tortious interference with his employment relationship with Matt Castrucci\u2019s Auto Mall, promissory estoppel, implied contract, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, and wage-and-hour violations of both federal and Ohio law. Sutton filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging tortious interference with employment, negligent supervision or retention, wage-and-hour violations, and fraud and intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 9} After depositions were taken, Sheaffer and Sutton filed motions for summary judgment on Hidy\u2019s complaint and on their counterclaims. Hidy filed motions for summary judgment on all of the counterclaims of Sheaffer and Sutton.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 10} On March 25, 2008, the trial court granted Hidy\u2019s summary-judgment motions in part and denied Sheaffer\u2019s and Sutton\u2019s motions for summary judgment in their entirety. The trial court granted summary judgment for Hidy on Sheaffer\u2019s counterclaims for age discrimination, tortious interference with em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ployment, negligent supervision or retention, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, and wage-and-hour violations. The court also granted summary judgment for Hidy on Sutton\u2019s counterclaims for tortious interference with employment, negligent supervision or retention, wage-and-hour violations, and fraud and intentional misrepresentation. The parties subsequently settled the counterclaims for promissory estoppel and implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 11} Sheaffer and Sutton filed a notice of appeal on April 16, 2008. While the appeal was pending, Hidy dismissed its complaint for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 12} Sheaffer and Sutton filed their appellate brief, to which three exhibits were attached. Hidy filed a motion to strike exhibits 2 and 3 because those exhibits are not included in the record of the trial court as certified by the clerk of courts under App.R. 9. We agree and sustain Hidy\u2019s motion to strike. Exhibits 2 and 3 attached to Sheaffer and Sutton\u2019s appellate brief will not be considered in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred by denying Sheaffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and by granting Hidy\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding Sheaffer\u2019s age-harassment claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 14} When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, an appellate court conducts a de novo review. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. \u201cDe Novo review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal Co. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision is not granted any deference by the reviewing appellate court. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe appropriateness of rendering a summary judgment hinges upon the tripartite demonstration: (1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Inc. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. See also Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 16} In Count I of his counterclaim, Sheaffer alleged that \u201cHidy Honda discriminated against Sheaffer on the basis of his age regarding the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, including, but not limited to, harassing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>him, constructively discharging him, and failing to pay him the sales commissions and bonuses he had earned, in violation of Ohio Revised Code 4112.02(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 4112.02(A) provides that it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cFor any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, military status, national origin, disability, age, or ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 19} The Ohio Supreme Court generally follows the analytic framework established by federal case law for use under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. 621 et seq., in interpreting and deciding age-discrimination claims brought under R.C. 4112.02. <em>Bullock v. Totes, Inc. </em>(Dec. 22, 2000), Hamilton App. No. C-000269, 2000 WL 1867400. The criteria for a prima facie claim of a hostile environment under the ADEA are that (1) the employee is 40 years or older, (2) the employee was subjected to harassment, either through words or actions, based on age, (3) the harassment had the effect of unreasonably interfering with the employee\u2019s work performance and creating an objectively intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, and (4) there exists some basis for liability on the part of the employer. <em>Crawford v. Medina Gen. Hosp. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 96 F.3d 830, 834-835.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court granted Hidy\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Sheaffer\u2019s R.C. 4112.02 claim on a finding that \u201c[t]he overwhelming hurdle [Sheaffer] cannot overcome is that despite what he alleges as abusive and unprofessional conduct, this Court cannot find any evidence that the employer\u2019s action made working conditions intolerable or in any way negatively affected the work opportunity of [Sheaffer] <em>based </em>upon age discrimination.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 21} In reviewing the trial court\u2019s judgment, we must keep in mind that \u201c[a] discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees\u2019 psychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees\u2019 job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>96 F.3d at 835. Further, \u201c[w]hether harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an abusive work environment is \u2018quintessentially a question of fact.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 835-836, quoting <em>Amirmokri v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(C.A.4, 1995), 60 F.3d 1126, 1130-1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 22} A court must consider all of the relevant circumstances in order to determine whether an environment is hostile or abusive. These circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cmay include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a merely offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance. The effect on the employee\u2019s psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. </em>(1993), 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 23} In response to Interrogatory No. 18 of Hidy\u2019s first set of interrogatories, Sheaffer set forth the following facts to support his age-harassment counterclaim:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cWhen [Hidy General Sales Manager Tim] Bell walked behind [Sheaf-fer], he would repeatedly say, \u2018come on old man, pick up your feet.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIn July or August, 2006 Bell humiliated [Sheaffer] in front of Vivian Bell after [Sheaffer] informed Bell that a couple wanted to go home and think about buying a car. Bell said, \u2018Come on old man, get your f* * * * * * head out of your f* * * * * * ass and go out there and slam them.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cIn January or February, 2007, Bell again humiliated [Sheaffer] this time in front of New Car Sales Manager Bob Coyle. After [Sheaffer] reported to Bell that another couple wanted to go home and think about buying a car, Bell told [Sheaffer] to go get Coyle and return to his office. When [Sheaffer] returned with Coyle, Bell told Coyle to go out and help the \u2018old man\u2019 close the deal. Bell told [Sheaffer] to introduce Coyle as his boss. All of the other salespersons referred to Coyle as the new-car sales manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cIn February 2007, Bell broke a promise to Mrs. Sparkland, a disabled customer who wanted to pay an additional $400 on a car she had purchased so that [Sheaffer] and another salesperson who had assisted her could each receive a $200 bonus that Bell assured her that he would take care of. After Mrs. Sparkland left the dealership, [Sheaffer] asked Bell when he would receive his bonus. In response, Bell stated that Hidy Honda would keep the extra $400 and that neither defendant nor the other salesperson would receive a bonus. Bell then stated that Mrs. Sparkland \u2018was crazy as a damn loon\u2019 and explained that he told her that he would take off the extra bonuses that she wanted paid \u2018just to get the deal.\u2019 Later that day, [Sheaffer] approached Bell and expressed his opinion that Bell\u2019s decision not to pay the bonuses was unfair. In response, Bell got angry and shouted at Defendant: \u2018old man, I don\u2019t give a f* * * what you think. That\u2019s the way it is going to be.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cIn April, 2007, a child spilled some water on the showroom floor. When [Sheaffer] pointed out the spill to Bell, he responded, \u2018I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>what happens when you get your age \u2014 you can\u2019t control yourself.\u2019 [Sheaffer] was so humiliated and angry about Bell\u2019s comment, he almost hit Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cBell did not subject any of the younger salespersons to the harassment he directed towards [Sheaffer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 30} Sheaffer laid out a number of instances in his deposition testimony and his answer to interrogatories in which Bell directed harsh and crude language at Sheaffer, accompanied by a reference to Sheaffer\u2019s advanced age. Also, Sheaffer described instances where Bell made comments that could be construed as humiliating, rather than merely offensive. Sheaffer stated that this treatment at work led to a severe loss of sleep over a period of time and affected his work performance. He explained that the comments by Bell angered him and humiliated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 31} We acknowledge that Sheaffer ultimately has an uphill battle to prove that he was constructively discharged as a result of being subjected to a hostile work environment. However, we believe that the testimony of Sheaffer, along with his answers to interrogatories, is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Hidy, through Bell, harassed and humiliated Sheaffer on account of his age, which created a hostile work environment and caused Sheaffer\u2019s constructive discharge from his employment at Hidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 32} The trial court reasoned that \u201cthe fact that Hidy chose to rehire [Sheaffer] after he left the first time belies any willful, reckless, or malicious intent on the part of Hidy to discriminate against [Sheaffer] based upon age. Clearly, had age been a problem for Hidy, [Sheaffer] would simply not have been reoffered a job at Hidy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 33} We agree that it defies logic that employers would hire or rehire an employee with the intent to later harass him. However, we do not agree that Hid/s decision to rehire Sheaffer necessarily precludes a finding that Sheaffer was thereafter subjected to age harassment. Age harassment is typically evidenced by a course of conduct that is illogical. Ultimately, the decision to hire or rehire an employee in no way guarantees that the employer will never engage in harassing behavior toward the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 34} Finally, the trial court stated that \u201cthe evidence indicates that [Sheaffer] was not the only person subject to abusive and unprofessional language inasmuch as other salespeople at Hidy were treated in the same manner generally from time to time.\u201d Though other employees of Hidy were subjected to crude language, we do not believe that that evidence necessarily precludes Sheaffer\u2019s age-harassment claim. Rather, Sheaffer identified a number of instances where offensive or crude language that was directed to him was accompanied by a reference to his advanced age. And unlike in <em>Crawford v. Medina Gen. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Hosp., </em>96 F.3d 830, those were not comments of other employees but were comments of a supervisor that were expressly work-related. Therefore, at the summary-judgment stage, we do not believe that Bell\u2019s conduct can be explained away simply as age-neutral motivational tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">{\u00b6 35} Because genuine issues of material fact exist, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Hidy on Sheaffer\u2019s age-harassment counterclaim but properly denied Sheaffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 36} The first assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe trial court erred by denying Sheaffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and by granting Hidy\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding Sheaffer\u2019s negligent supervision and retention claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 38} The elements of a claim for relief for negligent hiring or retention are (1) the existence of an employment relationship, (2) the employee\u2019s incompetence, (3) the employer\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of the incompetence, (4) the employee\u2019s act or omission causing the plaintiffs injuries, and (5) the employer\u2019s negligence in hiring or retaining the employee as the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries. <em>Harmon v. GZK, Inc. </em>(Feb. 8, 2002), Montgomery App. No. 18672, 2002 WL 191598, citing <em>Peterson v. Buckeye Steel Casings </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 715, 729, 729 N.E.2d 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 39} The trial court granted Hidy\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Sheaffer\u2019s claim for negligent supervision and retention because Bell\u2019s behavior did not constitute incompetence. But harassing behavior is per se incompetent behavior. <em>Harmon, </em>2002 WL 191598, at *16, citing <em>Kerans v. Porter Paint Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 486, 575 N.E.2d 428, and <em>Myers v. Goodwill Industries of Akron, Inc. </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 722, 721 N.E.2d 130. Because there remains a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Bell\u2019s behavior constituted age harassment, there remains a genuine issue of material fact whether Bell was incompetent for purposes of Sheaffer\u2019s claim for negligent supervision and retention. <em>Harmon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">{\u00b6 40} The trial court erred in granting Hidy\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Sheaffer\u2019s counterclaim for negligent supervision and retention, but properly denied Sheaffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this counterclaim. Therefore, the second assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial court erred by denying Sheaffer and Sutton\u2019s motions for summary judgment regarding Hidy\u2019s declaratory judgment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>{\u00b6 42} The basis for Sheaffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment was that the noncompetition agreement he signed during his initial period of employment with Hidy did not apply to his second period of employment with Hidy. As explained below in our resolution of the fourth assignment of error, we reject this argument with respect to Sheaffer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 43} Sutton\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Hidy\u2019s complaint argued that the noncompetition agreement was not enforceable based on the factors set forth in <em>Raimonde v. Van Vlerah </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 21, 71 O.O.2d 12, 325 N.E.2d 544. As explained below, the trial court erred in failing to address whether the covenant not to compete, as written, was enforceable. On this record, therefore, a genuine issue of material fact remains for determination regarding whether the noncompetition agreements were legally enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 44} The trial court did not err in denying Sheaffer and Sutton\u2019s motions for summary judgment on Hidy\u2019s complaint. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe trial court erred by denying Sheaffer and Sutton\u2019s motions for summary judgment and by granting Hidy\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding Sheaffer and Sutton\u2019s tortious interference claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 46} At oral argument, counsel for Sutton withdrew Sutton\u2019s assignment of error regarding the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment for Hidy on Sutton\u2019s tortious-interference claim. Therefore, this assignment of error is overruled with regard to Sutton.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 47} Sheaffer alleged that Hidy tortiously interfered with his contract of employment with Matt Castrucci when Joe Hidy complained to Matt Castrucci that Sheaffer was in violation of his noncompetition agreement with Hidy, which caused Castrucci to fire Sheaffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">{\u00b6 48} The elements of the tort of tortious interference with contract are (1) the existence of a contract, (2) the wrongdoer\u2019s knowledge of the contract, (3) the wrongdoer\u2019s intentional procurement of the contract\u2019s breach, (4) lack of justification, and (5) resulting damages. <em>Fred Siegel Co., L.P.A. v. Arter &amp; Hadden </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 171, 172, 707 N.E.2d 853, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">{\u00b6 49} Sheaffer signed a noncompetition agreement on November 7, 2005. The agreement, entitled \u201cHidy Honda Employee Non-Compete And Confidentiality Agreement,\u201d signed by Sheaffer, provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c[T]he undersigned hereby agrees not to directly or indirectly compete with the business of Hidy Honda during the period of two (2) years following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>termination of employment and regardless of the cause or reason for termination, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">(\u00b6 51} \u201cThe scope of the agreement not to compete shall mean that the Employee shall not own, manage, operate, consult or be an employee in any business substantially similar to or competitive with the present business of Hidy Honda or such other business activity in which Hidy Honda may substantially engage during the time of employment, unless the dealer principal of Hidy Honda shall agree to same in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cSuch businesses shall include all automobile dealerships, automobile repair shops, and automobile leasing companies located within three (3) miles of Hidy Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cSuch businesses shall also include any business operating as part of or in connection with Matt Castrucci\u2019s Auto Mall and its successors or assigns</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 54} The trial court granted summary judgment for Hidy on Sheaffer\u2019s counterclaim for tortious interference with a contract because \u201cHidy had in his possession a signed non-compete agreement which on its face was valid and he was therefore privileged to protect his legitimate business interest in contacting Matt Castrucci of the existence of this non-compete agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 55} Sheaffer argues that Hidy was not privileged to act as it did because Sheaffer had not signed a noncompetition agreement when he was rehired by Hidy on May 5, 2006, commencing his second period of employment by Hidy that ended on April 30, 2007, when Sheaffer quit to go to work for Matt Castrucci. That misses the point. Sheaffer signed the written noncompetition agreement when he was first hired by Hidy in November 2005. The agreement applies by its terms to any employment Sheaffer might have during a two-year period following Sheaffer\u2019s first resignation on March 15, 2006. Therefore, by its terms, the written agreement applied to Sheaffer\u2019s employment by Castrucci that commenced on May 1, 2007, from which Sheaffer was fired following Joe Hidy\u2019s telephone call. There is no claim that the call was made after the two-year period beginning on March 15, 2006, had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">{\u00b6 56} Although the telephone call was made within the two-year period provided for in the noncompetition agreement, our inquiry does not end there. For a covenant not to compete to be enforceable, its restrictions must be no greater than that which is required to protect the employer, it must not impose an undue hardship on the employee, and it cannot be injurious to the public. <em>Raimonde v. Van Vlerah </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 21, 25-26, 71 O.O.2d 12, 325 N.E.2d 544. \u201cCovenants not to compete are valid only when the competition they restrict is somehow unfair, not because it is unfair that the promisor fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>perform on the promise he made.\u201d <em>Busch v. Premier Integrated Med. Assocs., Ltd., </em>Montgomery App. No. 19364, 2003-Ohio-4709, 2003 WL 22060392, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cWe have held that factors to be considered in determining reasonableness of the restrictions a covenant imposes include \u2018(1) the existence of time and geographic limitations; (2) whether the employee represents the sole contact with the customer; (3) whether the employee possesses confidential information or trade secrets; (4) whether the covenant seeks to eliminate competition which would be unfair to the employer or merely seeks to eliminate ordinary competition; (5) whether the covenant seeks to stifle the inherent skill and experience of the employee; (6) whether the benefit to the employer is disproportional to the detriment to the employee; (7) whether the covenant operates as a bar to the employee\u2019s sole means of support; (8) whether the employee\u2019s talent which the employer seeks to restrict was actually developed during the period of employment; and (9) whether the forbidden employment is merely incidental to the main employment.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Pratt v. Grunenwald </em>(June 29, 1994), Montgomery App. No. 14160, 1994 WL 313050.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 58} If a court finds that a covenant not to compete imposes unreasonable restrictions upon an employee, then the court is empowered to modify or amend the employment agreement. <em>Raimonde, </em>42 Ohio St.2d at 26, 71 O.O.2d 12, 325 N.E.2d 544. A number of two-year covenants not to compete have been either reduced by courts to a one-year time limitation or declared unenforceable as a matter of law. <em>Facility Servs. &amp; Sys., Inc. v. Vaiden, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86904, 2006-Ohio-2895, 2006 WL 1572236, at \u00b6 41, 53-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 59} The trial court did not address whether the covenant not to compete, as written, was enforceable. Therefore, the trial court erred in assuming that the covenant not to compete could be relied on as the basis for Hidy\u2019s privilege defense to Sheaffer\u2019s tortious-interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 60} Hidy argues that summary judgment was correct, nevertheless, because there was no evidence that Hidy acted maliciously when Joe Hidy called Matt Castrucci to complain about the noncompetition agreement. \u201cActual malice in a tortious interference claim is not ill-will, spite, or hatred; rather, it denotes an unjustified or improper interference with the business relationship.\u201d <em>Chandler &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. America\u2019s Healthcare Alliance, Inc. </em>(1997), 125 Ohio App.3d 572, 583, 709 N.E.2d 190. Whether that standard is satisfied depends on whether the two-year agreement was enforceable when Joe Hidy\u2019s call was made, an issue that the trial court must determine on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 61} The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Hidy on Sheaffer\u2019s tortious-interference counterclaim, for the reason it did, absent a prior finding that the 2005 noncompetition agreement was enforceable at the time Joe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Hidy made his telephone call to Matt Castrucci. The trial court properly denied Sheaffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim. Therefore, the fourth assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part with regard to Sheaffer and is overruled with regard to Sutton.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">FIFTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cThe trial court erred by denying Sheaffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and by granting Hidy\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding Sheaffer\u2019s fraud or intentional misrepresentation claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 63} In paragraph 13 of his counterclaim, Sheaffer explained the basis for his fraud or intentional-misrepresentation claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cBell also broke a promise to Mrs. Sparkland, a disabled customer who wanted to pay an additional $400 on a car that she had just purchased so that Sheaffer and another salesman who had assisted her could each receive a $200 bonus. After Mrs. Sparkland left the dealership, Sheaffer asked Bell when he would receive his bonus. In response, Bell stated that Hidy Honda would keep the extra $400 and that neither Sheaffer or the other salesman would receive a bonus. Bell stated that Mrs. Sparkland \u2018was crazy as a damn loon\u2019 and that he told her that he would take care of the bonuses that she wanted paid \u2018just to get the deal\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cA claim of common-law fraud requires proof of the following elements: (a) a representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact, (b) which is material to the transaction at hand, (c) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred, (d) with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it, (e) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment, and (f) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.\u201d <em>Russ v. TRW, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 42, 49, 570 N.E.2d 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">{\u00b6 66} We agree that Sheaffer\u2019s fraud or intentional-misrepresentation claim against Hidy cannot succeed. On this record, Sheaffer was injured when Bell refused to pay him the $400 that Bell had falsely promised Sparkland he would pass on to Sheaffer. However, the alleged representation was made to Spark-land, not to Sheaffer, and the detrimental reliance on the misrepresentation alleged was on the part of Sparkland, not Sheaffer. Therefore, Sheaffer cannot show that he was injured as a proximate result of the misrepresentation alleged. Rather, Sheaffer\u2019s alleged injury proximately resulted from Bell\u2019s refusal to pay Sheaffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>{\u00b6 67} The fifth assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court is reversed in part and affirmed in part. The cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-5\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b365-6\">William H.
