American Electric Power, the Dayton Power and Light Company, Duke Energy Ohio, Inc., and Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, are a consortium of Ohio electric utilities (collectively, the \u201cutilities\u201d). The utilities challenged revised Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cOEPA\u201d) rules governing disposal of residual solid waste (\u201cRSW\u201d) and, in particular, coal-combustion waste produced by a flue-gas desulferization system or \u201cscrubber.\u201d The utilities appeal from a final order of the Environmental Review Appeals Commission (\u201cERAC\u201d) dated August 27, 2008, affirming promulgation of revised RSW rules by appellee, Chris Korleski, the Ohio director of environmental protection. Specifically, the utilities challenged whether the RSW siting criteria in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-30-06(H)(2)(d) and (H)(4)(d) were reasonable and lawful, and ERAC determined that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">{\u00b6 2} The OEPA has promulgated siting criteria for the placement of the RSW landfills at issue in this case. There are two specific siting requirements that are the subject of this appeal. First, \u201c[t]he residual solid waste landfill facility is not located above an unconsolidated aquifer system capable of sustaining a yield of one hundred gpm [gallons per minute] for a twenty-four-hour period to an existing or future water supply well located within one thousand feet of the limits of residual solid waste placement.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3745-30-06(H)(2)(d). Second, \u201c[t]he limits of solid waste placement are not located within two hundred feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of areas determined by Ohio EPA or the United States army corps of engineers to be a stream, lake, or wetland.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3745-30-06(H)(4)(d). A prior version of the rules had nearly identical prohibitions but contained an escape clause that read \u201cunless deemed acceptable by the director.\u201d Former Ohio Adm.Code 3745-27(B)(9) and (B)(14) (effective March 1, 1990). This additional language allowed an applicant to apply for a permit to install even if it did not meet all of the siting criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">{\u00b6 3} The OEPA revisited and subsequently revised its siting rules on August 4, 2003, in accordance with R.C. 119.032. That statute requires all state agencies to conduct periodic reviews to determine whether the rules needed to be revised, left unchanged, or rescinded. OEPA\u2019s new rules eliminated the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language from the siting criteria at issue here. The parties agreed that the OEPA correctly followed administrative procedure in the rulemaking process. The utilities participated extensively during the rules-review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">{\u00b6 4} The effective date of the new rules was August 15, 2003, and the utilities timely appealed from the director\u2019s final promulgation. The issue before ERAC was whether the new rules unreasonably and unlawfully applied siting criteria to RSW disposal facilities without a factual or technical basis for the application. ERAC conducted a de novo hearing on December 12 through 15, 2005, and it is from E RAC\u2019s August 27, 2008 findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final order (\u201cOrder\u201d) that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">{\u00b6 5} The following facts are germane to our discussion. In 1976, the OEPA set forth siting criteria for solid-waste landfills in order to protect Ohio\u2019s critical surface-water and ground-water resources. The early rules contained a procedure from which one could be granted a waiver from one or more of the siting criteria if the owner or operator could demonstrate that the facility would not cause water pollution, not create a nuisance or health hazard, and would not result in a violation under R.C. Chapter 3704.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">{\u00b6 6} Over the years, the OEPA made the solid-waste rules more stringent. During the rulemaking procedure that resulted in the 1990 revisions, the utilities expressed a desire for coal-combustion solid waste to receive more lenient requirements than other types of solid waste due to the relatively innocuous nature of the waste the utilities produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">{\u00b6 7} In 1992, the OEPA promulgated RSW rules codified at Ohio Adm.Code 3745-30-06 for low-toxicity, high-volume waste. Of the rules governing siting criteria, seven of the 15 siting criteria contained \u201cunless deemed acceptable by the director\u201d language enabling a waste facility to obtain a permit even if it did not meet all the siting criteria. In order to do so, the facility had to submit a proposal and justification as to why it was acceptable to receive a permit even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>though it did not meet all the siting criteria. The decision to approve such a proposal was discretionary with the director and not subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">{\u00b6 8} In addition to a request that the director deem an application acceptable, the rules contained a formal procedure by which an applicant could request a variance or an exemption from the siting criteria. The OEPA distinguishes between variances and exemptions in the following way: an applicant seeking to vary the requirements of a rule, such as asking for a 100-foot setback instead of a 200-foot setback, should apply for a variance; an applicant seeking to be exempt from a requirement, such as siting a landfill over an aquifer of 100 gpm or more, must apply for an exemption. Thus, if an applicant wants to vary from the provisions of the rule, an application for a variance is the proper mechanism. If an applicant wants to be completely relieved from complying with a particular rule, the applicant should seek an exemption. In using this procedure, ERAC has taken the position that an interested party may appeal from acceptance or denial of a variance but that inaction or denial of an exemption is not reviewable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the hearing before ERAC, the OEPA presented evidence that its analysis under the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language was the same as its analysis for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 9} On March 10, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency finalized interstate clean-air rules requiring the reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. To achieve compliance with the clean-air standards, the utilities determined that they needed to install additional scrubbers on their plants, which, in turn, would result in a significant increase in the quantity of scrubber sludge being produced. However, not all scrubber sludge disappears into landfills. There are some beneficial uses for scrubber sludge. For example, scrubber sludge is used in mine reclamation, wall board, feed lots for cattle, and road base. Nevertheless, excess scrubber sludge must be interred in an RSW landfill, and the utilities recognized the need for additional landfill space. The utilities expressed an interest in siting some of these landfills on the same grounds as the coal-burning power plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 10} At the de novo hearing, the utilities\u2019 expert witness offered an opinion on the following question: \u201cIs there any scientific or technical basis for prohibiting FGD [flue gas desulphurization] residual waste, Class III residual waste landfills from being sited over 100 gallon per minute aquifers or within 200 feet of streams?\u201d Order, at \u00b6 94. The expert concluded that \u201c[b]ased on standard landfill design, the predicted modeled concentration of leached Class III residual waste constituents that has the potential to enter an underlying aquifer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>adjacent river or stream is lower than drinking water and surface water quality standards.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 110. The utilities\u2019 witnesses also testified that there were certain ecological advantages to locating an RSW landfill close to a coal-burning plant. However, under the current siting rules it would be difficult, if not impossible, to locate an RSW facility close to a coal-burning power plant because those plants require large amounts of water to operate, and most are located near significant sources of water, including rivers, streams, and large aquifers.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 11} The OEPA presented no expert scientific testimony of its own. However, ERAC found a reasonable basis for the siting criteria based upon the considerable deference to be afforded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its statutory authority, public comments that were part of the record, OEPA witnesses who testified how the siting requirements fit in with the agency\u2019s broad overall strategy, a draft scoping report generated by the Siting Criteria Workgroup, and a 1986 draft strategy document outlining the state\u2019s plan for seeking to provide more stringent siting to protect its ground-water resources. ERAC found that according to a 1998 study by the OEPA, some fully lined solid-waste facilities have failed. The OEPA found this to be relevant to the rule that generally prohibits siting a facility over an unconsolidated 100 gpm aquifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{\u00b6 12} ERAC issued extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. ERAC determined that the challenged restrictions were reasonable and necessary in keeping with the overall strategy for protecting Ohio\u2019s ground-water and surface-water resources. ERAC further concluded that the director had an adequate basis for removing the phrase \u201cunless deemed acceptable by the director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">{\u00b6 13} The utilities appealed ERAC\u2019s final order assigning as error the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">1. The ERAC erred as a matter of fact because the record indicates that Ohio EPA had no reliable, probative, or substantial evidence to demonstrate that the siting criteria were necessary given the engineering controls required by the residual solid waste rules and the innocuous nature of the waste.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">2. The ERAC erred as a matter of law because the director\u2019s removal of the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language deprives the utilities of the procedural safeguard of reviewability of the director\u2019s failure to act on or his denial of an exemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">3. The ERAC erred as a matter of law because R.C. 119.032 permits a party to appeal an agency\u2019s rule each time Ohio EPA repromulgates a rule under notice and comment rulemaking regardless of whether that party previously challenged the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">4. The ERAC erred as a matter of fact because the record indicates that the director failed to provide an adequate explanation for removing the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language from the siting criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>5. The ERAC erred when it allowed the director to exceed its statutory-authority because the General Assembly did not grant the director the authority to prohibit siting locations under R.C. 3734.02(A) to ensure a sanitary facility that will be protective of human health and the environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 14} At the de novo hearing before ERAC, the utilities bore the burden of proof to demonstrate that there was no factual and legal basis upon which the director could promulgate the rules as he did. <em>Johnson\u2019s Island Property Owners\u2019 Assn. v. Schregardus </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 563, 568, 662 N. E.2d 878. Commissions such as ERAC were created \u201cto facilitate certain areas of the law by placing the administration of those areas before boards or commissions composed of individuals who possess special expertise.\u201d <em>Harmony Environmental Ltd. v. Morrow Cty. Dist. Bd. of Health, </em>10th Dist.

Accordingly, the ultimate factual issue to be determined by the board upon the <em>de novo </em>hearing is whether there is a valid factual foundation for the Director\u2019s action and not whether the Director\u2019s action is the best or most appropriate action, nor whether the board would have taken the same action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"><em>CLUB 3000 v. Jones, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-593, 2008-Ohio-5058, 2008 WL 4416663, \u00b6 28, quoting <em>Citizens Commt. v. Williams </em>(1977), 56 Ohio App.2d 61, 70, 10 O.O.3d 91, 381 N.E.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">{\u00b6 15} Where the evidence demonstrates that it is reasonably debatable as to whether the director should have promulgated the rules as he did, ERAC\u2019s duty is to affirm the director, rather than merely to substitute its judgment for his. Id. at 69-70, 10 O.O.3d 91, 381 N.E.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">{\u00b6 16} Pursuant to R.C. 3745.06, this court is to affirm the order of ERAC if we find that \u201cupon consideration of the entire record and such additional evidence as the court has admitted, that the order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d In the absence of such a finding, the court \u201cshall reverse, vacate or modify the order or make such other ruling as is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d Id. As a reviewing court, we are to accord considerable deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of rules and regulations. <em>Harmony, </em>2005-Ohio-3146, 2005 WL 1483998, at \u00b6 8; <em>Textileather Corp. v. Korleski, </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-955, 2007-Ohio-4129, 2007 WL 2306968, \u00b6 54 (\u201cUnless the agency\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable or conflicts with a statute covering the same subject matter, courts should follow that interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>{\u00b6 17} With these standards in mind, we turn to the utilities\u2019 assignments of error. In their first assignment of error, the utilities attack the factual basis for the siting rules at issue. The utilities contend that they presented valid expert testimony that RSW is an innocuous substance that presents no threat to human health or the environment given the present-day advancements in siting design and engineering. The utilities further argue that the EPA\u2019s evidence on the necessity for the siting rules should not be given any weight, because its witnesses failed to rebut the utilities\u2019 evidence and their testimony was speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 18} ERAC acknowledged the credibility of the expert witness testimony in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">At the outset, the Commission acknowledges that Mr. Hagen presented significant evidence to establish the relatively innocuous nature of coal combustion solid waste, the rigorous regulatory design components for RSW landfills, and the comparatively low risk to ground and surface waters associated with any unintended discharge from such a facility. Additionally, [other witnesses] offered persuasive testimony on behalf of the Utilities regarding the advantages to locating RSW landfills in close proximity to power plants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Order, at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 19} ERAC did not, however, find the EPA\u2019s evidence to be speculative. ERAC found that those particular siting criteria had been in effect since 1992 with only technical amendment and without substantive amendment, and it believed that \u201cthis conclusion dictates against a finding that the Director\u2019s action was unreasonable.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 20} ERAC took note of comments made during the rule-amendment process from individuals and organizations who wanted to strengthen the siting criteria by making them absolute prohibitions. ERAC stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">Ohio EPA must review these comments in the broad perspective and in balance with the Agency\u2019s many statutory obligations ranging from ORC 119.032 to establishing rules that are protective of human health and the environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgY\">(Emphasis sic.) Order, at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">{\u00b6 21} The implication in the order is that the OEPA has an overall mission to protect human health and the environment and that in crafting their rules, it should not rubberstamp either the utilities\u2019 desires or those of certain environmentalists but, rather, to the best of its ability, consider all positions in light of its overall responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">{\u00b6 22} ERAC also credited the testimony of OEPA officials who set forth the agency position on locating landfills. The policy is first to ensure that the landfill is located in a geologically sound location and then to enhance the geological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>protections with sound engineering. The OEPA is not in favor of placing landfills in a site that is vulnerable to ground-water contamination and then re-engineering the site to provide protection. ERAC concluded that the two siting criteria at issue are consistent with OEPA\u2019s overall strategy of protecting ground-water and surface-water resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">{\u00b6 23} ERAC further relied on a draft scoping report generated by the Siting Criteria Workgroup of the OEPA to conclude that the agency had conducted a thorough review and approached the amendment in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner. Finally, ERAC credited a draft \u201cOhio Groundwater Protection and Management Strategy\u201d dated October 1986. ERAC acknowledged that the document was a draft strategy composed over 20 years ago but nevertheless determined that the strategy continues to be used for guidance by the OEPA and provided a tangible factual foundation for the siting criterion regarding the 100 gpm aquifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 24} In weighing the evidence, ERAC acknowledged the scientific evidence presented by the utilities but ultimately decided to defer to the OEPA\u2019s interpretation of the regulations. In determining that OEPA\u2019s siting criteria were protective of human health and the environment, ERAC found the siting criteria lawful. In crediting OEPA testimony that appropriate siting with additional engineering protections was favored over using engineering to overcome poor siting, ERAC found a factual basis for deeming the siting criteria to be reasonable. In addition, the availability of variances and exemptions provided the necessary flexibility to address siting concerns throughout Ohio\u2019s diverse geological make-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 25} On appeal, we are loath to substitute our judgment regarding the credibility and persuasiveness of the evidence for that of the trier of fact. Our inquiry is limited to consideration of whether reliable, probative, and substantial evidence exists to support ERAC\u2019s final order. Based on our review of the transcript and evidence, we conclude that ERAC furnished an adequate basis for finding the criteria lawful and reasonable. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">{\u00b6 26} In the second assignment of error, the utilities argue that the director\u2019s removal of the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language deprives them of the procedural safeguard of reviewability when the director refuses to act or denies an exemption. OEPA, however, contends that the removal of the language did not change the review process or the likelihood of a deviation from the rules to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 27} OEPA\u2019s rationale for the director\u2019s removal of the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language from siting criteria was that the language was duplicative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>existing variance and exemption procedures in R.C. 3734.02(A) and (G). A witness for the OEPA testified that the standard of review in a \u201cdeemed acceptable\u201d request was the same as that for an exemption or a variance, the only difference being the manner in which the request is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 28} The utilities argue that they are deprived of a right of review if the director denies or declines to address a request for an exemption. However, nothing in the newly promulgated rules changes the possibility of that outcome from what it was under the 1992 rules. \u201cUnless deemed acceptable\u201d requests that were denied or not acted upon were also not reviewable. Other than requiring a more formal procedure, removal of the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language left the utilities in the same position they were in under the old rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 29} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 30} In the third assignment of error, the utilities claim that ERAC incorrectly concluded that the utilities had acquiesced to the siting criteria by failing to challenge the nearly identical regulations in the past. We have reviewed the record in which the utilities claim that ERAC reached this erroneous conclusion, but we can find no support for the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 31} It is true that OEPA raised this argument at the de novo hearing and in this appeal. However, ERAC merely noted that the 2003 revisions were more technical in nature than substantive and recognized that the siting criteria at issue have been in place since 1976. ERAC did not err in this regard, because it allowed the utilities to challenge all aspects of the revised rules and considered all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">{\u00b6 32} The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">{\u00b6 33} In the fourth assignment of error, the utilities argue that the director failed to provide an adequate explanation for changing its position to require RSW facilities to obtain exemptions in some cases. Early in the revision process, OEPA indicated that removing the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language was appropriate because it was essentially duplicative of the variance provision. Later, OEPA required that applicants in some cases seek an exemption and not a variance. For example, a request for relief from the 100 gpm restriction required an exemption rather than a variance. Requiring an exemption instead of a variance is significant to the utilities because denial of a variance is reviewable by ERAC but a failure to act or a denial of an exemption is not reviewable. Since applications for variances or exemptions were reviewed under the same standard used in analyzing waivers under the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language, there is no difference in the likelihood of a request being granted under either format. As discussed in connection with the second assignment of error, there has been no change in position for a utility that seeks an exemption, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>a variance, or an \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d waiver. Therefore, the utilities cannot show that they were harmed by the change in procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 34} In their fifth assignment of error, the utilities contend that removal of the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language results in an outright prohibition against siting an RSW facility over a 100 gpm aquifer or within 200 feet of surface water. Given that the standards for granting a variance or an exemption are the same as those for deviating from the siting criteria under the \u201cunless deemed acceptable\u201d language, we can find no merit to this assertion. R.C. 3734.02 explicitly allows for variances and exemptions, and the OEPA has granted both. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 35} The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 36} Based on the foregoing, the utilities\u2019 five assignments of error are overruled, and the final order of the Environmental Review Appeals Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-9\">Bryant and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">.
