Several trials later, Wilkins was found guilty of these offenses and sentenced to a total of 42 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">{\u00b6 2} In support of his appeal, Wilkins contends that the prosecutor violated Crim.R. 16 by disclosing his intention to call a witness only four days before trial. Wilkins next contends that the trial court should have ordered a mistrial after his right to self-representation, under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, was prejudiced by his collapse during trial. He also contends that the verdict is not supported by sufficient evidence and is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. Finally, Wilkins contends that under <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, the trial court was not permitted to impose an add-on sentence for a repeat-violent-offender specification. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">{\u00b6 3} On the evening of April 27, 2004, William Prigmore was driving around with his friend, Keison Wilkins. Wilkins had previously told Prigmore that Wilkins\u2019s friend, Chuck, had offered him $10,000 to kill a man named Reginald Brooks. Chuck believed that Brooks had had something to do with his (Chuck\u2019s) getting shot earlier that year. In addition to the money, Wilkins had his own reason for harming Brooks. In the early 90s, Wilkins and Brooks had been codefendants convicted of robbery and had been sent to prison, but Brooks received a lighter sentence. While Prigmore and Wilkins were driving, Wilkins\u2019s cell-phone rang. After he hung up, Wilkins told Prigmore that it was Chuck. Chuck, he said, had just told him that Brooks would be working on one of Brooks\u2019s houses the next day on Faulkner Avenue and driving a Lexus. \u201cI\u2019m going to get him tomorrow,\u201d Wilkins told Prigmore.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The shooting</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">{\u00b6 4} The next day, April 28, Brooks stopped by the house he owned at 730 Faulkner Avenue. He was remodeling it and wanted to check on the progress. Anita Steward, a friend of Brooks, brought some food to the house, which the two ate inside. When they were finished, Brooks and Steward left the house and crossed the street to Brooks\u2019s Lexus. A man dressed in black and carrying an assault rifle paused behind a truck parked on the street nearby and watched them. After they got into the car, the man pointed the rifle at the Lexus and pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">{\u00b6 5} Brooks and Steward were just about to pull away, when the first bullets hit. They ducked down, and Brooks reached under the floor mat and grabbed his gun. Keeping his head down, Brooks lifted the gun and began firing blindly in the direction of the shooter. At some point, he was briefly able to peer over the dashboard to get a look at the man. When the shooter stopped to reload, Brooks exited the bullet-ridden car. Brooks saw the shooter coming around the truck, and he raced across the street, firing as he ran. Brooks ran back inside the house, where Steward also had run, and Brooks called 911, telling the operator, \u201c730 Faulkner, black guy, hooded mask, his name is Keison Wilkins.\u201d Brooks had recognized Wilkins. When the police arrived, Brooks told them, too, that Wilkins had been the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">{\u00b6 6} That night, Prigmore received a call from Wilkins. Wilkins told him that he had not succeeded in killing Brooks, and he asked Prigmore to meet him at an apartment. Prigmore arrived in time to see Wilkins take off a black hoodie, black pants, and a bullet-proof vest. Then Chuck pulled up. Chuck was angry, and he and Wilkins started arguing about Wilkins\u2019s failure to do the job. Chuck told Wilkins that he was going to give him only $1,500. After further argument, Prigmore watched Chuck throw the money at Wilkins, and he heard Wilkins tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Chuck that his gun was under the couch. Prigmore then watched as Chuck pulled an assault rifle out from under the couch. After Chuck left, Wilkins described the events of the shooting to Prigmore. Prigmore expressed puzzlement as to how Wilkins missed at such close range. Wilkins replied, \u201cI don\u2019t [know] if you ever shot a[n] automatic weapon before but it\u2019s so hard to control it be flying everywhere. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t hit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">{\u00b6 7} A police investigation found numerous bullet holes in the car and spent casings from an SKS or AK-47 assault rifle on the sidewalk. Police also found a bullet hole in the spouting on a nearby residence along with a bullet divot in the brick of one of the home\u2019s porch supports. When police tried to arrest Wilkins on May 24, 2004, he fled into the apartment. When they finally captured him, Wilkins lied to the police about his name. Inside the apartment, police found the bullet-proof vest that Prigmore described seeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">{\u00b6 8} Wilkins was indicted on one count of having a weapon while under disability, accompanied by a three-year firearm specification; one count of improperly discharging a firearm at or into a habitation, accompanied by a three-year firearm specification; and two counts of felonious assault with a deadly weapon, each accompanied by a three-year firearm specification and a repeat-violent-offender specification. Wilkins was also indicted on charges related to a separate incident, which is not relevant here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The trials</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">{\u00b6 9} A jury trial commenced in December 2004 on the felonious-assault and improper-discharge-of-a-firearm charges, along with the accompanying firearm specifications. The charge of having a weapon under disability, its accompanying firearm specification, and the repeat-violent-offender specifications were tried to the judge. The jury was unable to reach a verdict, so the trial judge declared a mistrial on all the charges. A second trial was held in January 2005, which likewise divided the charges between judge and jury. At the conclusion, Wilkins was found guilty of all the charges and specifications \u2014 those before both the judge and jury. The trial court sentenced him to a total of 24 years in prison. We, however, finding that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>reversed his conviction and sentence and remanded the case. <em>State v. </em>Wilkins, Montgomery App. No. 21562, 2007-Ohio-2962, 2007 WL 1720476. In June 2008, Wilkins was tried a third time on the same charges. This time, despite the trial judge\u2019s repeated cautions, Wilkins exercised his right to represent himself. Just in case, the trial court appointed stand-by counsel to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The collapse</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">{\u00b6 10} Near the end of the trial, something unusual occurred during Wilkins\u2019s cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal witness. The court reporter recorded it this way:</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[Wilkins]: She never provided with you \u2014 excuse me, hold for a second. Your Honor, excuse me for a second, I need some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(Defendant falls to the floor.)\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">{\u00b6 13} The judge immediately excused the jury from the courtroom and went off the record. Upon returning, the judge said,</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe record will reflect that the jury is not present. The defendant is present and is feigning some medical condition. He has been checked out by the deputies who are medics, as well as a nurse, and it\u2019s my understanding Mr. Thompson [stand-by counsel] is also present. The defendant is present and acting rather uninterested in these proceedings. As I\u2019ve advised the defendant off the record, I am proceeding given that I\u2019ve been given medical information that there is nothing physically wrong with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cMr. Wilkins, if you persist in this behavior, sir, you will be removed and you will be waiving your right to give a closing statement. I understand that you choose not to respond to me, sir, but I know that you are hearing me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">{\u00b6 16} The court then permitted the prosecution to call witnesses to testify about Wilkins\u2019s medical condition. A registered nurse from the Montgomery County Jail, a deputy sheriff with some medical training, and an emergency medical technician all testified that they could find nothing physically wrong with Wilkins. For this reason, each said that based on his observations and examination, he did not see any medical reason why Wilkins could not continue to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">{\u00b6 17} After the prosecutor had finished his direct examination of each witness, the court asked Wilkins if he wanted to cross-examine. Wilkins never responded. Each time after receiving no response, the court gave stand-by counsel the same opportunity, and counsel did ask some questions of the first two witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>When the trial court asked stand-by counsel if he had any questions for the final witness, counsel replied, \u201cYes. My only question is, is the record reflecting what he\u2019[s] doing right now?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cTHE COURT: Record should reflect that the defendant is slouching over to the side and acts like he\u2019s sleeping. His breath appears to be quite normal, it doesn\u2019t appear to be labored in any way. Is that a fair assessment, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c * *</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(Deputy waives something under defendant\u2019s nose and defendant rouses)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE COURT: Oh, a remarkable change. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">{\u00b6 23} The court then asked Wilkins if he would like to call any witnesses to testify concerning the event. Wilkins did not respond. Stand-by counsel declined to call any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">{\u00b6 24} The court then addressed Wilkins and gave him the choice of whether to continue his self-representation:</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cAll right. Mr. Wilkins, as I advised you yesterday, sir, your disruptive behavior was challenging your ability to continue to represent yourself. You\u2019ve been checked out by trained deputies who are medics, you\u2019ve been checked out by a registered nurse, as well as an emergency medical technician, all of whom indicate that there is nothing physically wrong with you nor any reason why you couldn\u2019t continue here, sir. As I told you, sir, your Constitutional right to represent yourself is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom. Neither is it a license not to comply with the rules of procedure, the substantive rules, and it sounds like you\u2019re doing exactly what the witness indicated, Mr. Prigmore indicated you said you would do, which was to make some effort to cause a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cBut as I advised you sir, and as the case law is very clear about, your behavior will not cause a mistrial. It certainly may have an effect on the jury. Sir, in five minutes I\u2019m going to start again with or without you. And if it\u2019s without you it\u2019s because it\u2019s your choice, sir. I\u2019m going to be back in the courtroom in five minutes. You can let me know if it\u2019s your choice to continue to participate. Or if not sir, if you cannot comply with the basic rules of courtroom dignity, then you will be removed from the courtroom, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cI will advise the jury that it is your choice not to be present, that you are physically capable of being present, that you have been checked by medics who have indicated that there is nothing wrong with you or nothing that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>prohibit you from continuing and that this is your choice. And I will continue with closing arguments from the state and I will assume the, sir, that you have waived your right to a closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">{\u00b6 28} Five minutes later, asking Wilkins again if he will continue, and receiving no answer, the trial court terminated his right to represent himself and appointed stand-by counsel to continue:</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cOkay. Mr. Wilkins, I assume from your behavior that you continue to be of the opinion that you are not going to participate in these proceedings despite what the medical professionals have indicated. Is that correct, Mr. Wilkins? From your lack of response and the record should reflect that the defendant continues to be in the chair in the same position he was in earlier. It\u2019s my understanding, however, from the deputies that the defendant has been responsive to you, is that correct? When we were off the record, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cUNKNOWN: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. And Mr. Thompson [standby counsel] is also present. Mr. Thompson has advised me that he is prepared to go forward and complete the trial at this time. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cMr. Wilkins, do you want to participate in these proceedings? Do you wish to continue to represent yourself? There being no response I am going to find that the defendant, because of his serious and obstructionous misconduct, including what appears to be \u2014 what appears to amount to feigning some medical condition that all the medical professionals have indicated is not evident, I am going to terminate the defendant\u2019s right to represent himself because of his deliberately serious and obstructionous misconduct, sir, you will no longer be permitted to represent yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">{\u00b6 33} Finally, the trial court removed him from the courtroom:</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cMr. Wilkins, because of your behavior, I am going to have you removed from the courtroom, sir. Your behavior is highly inappropriate. It\u2019s obstructionist, it\u2019s nothing short of misconduct and in an effort to not only influence the jury but to create a mistrial. And as I advised you previously, your conduct will not do that, sir. So you\u2019re going to be removed to the jail where you will have an opportunity to observe the balance of the proceedings. And you will only be returned to the courtroom if I\u2019ve been given some indication that you intend to or can comply with the rules of decorum required of every person who enters this courtroom, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cI\u2019m going to find that your presence from the courtroom because of your behavior, sir, is excused. I\u2019m having you removed as a result of your behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>{\u00b6 36} After the deputies removed Wilkins, the court recessed for lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">{\u00b6 37} When the court was back in session, it heard from a deputy sheriff who was with Wilkins during the break. He testified that Wilkins was taken back to the jail and, though he remained uncommunicative, Wilkins was cooperative and responded to the deputy\u2019s and others\u2019 requests and commands. The deputy further told the court that Wilkins had been brought back to the court and was installed in the judge\u2019s staff attorney\u2019s office where he could see and hear the proceedings. The deputy said that Wilkins remained slumped over in his chair, as he had been earlier when he was removed from the courtroom. After explaining how the trial was going to proceed, the court took a break to allow counsel to confer with Wilkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">{\u00b6 38} When court resumed, counsel told the judge that Wilkins was \u201cnow lucid and is curious as to what is going on and what has gone on.\u201d Counsel further said that Wilkins told him that he passed out because of his blood-pressure medicine, which Wilkins claimed caused headaches and \u201cspots.\u201d A police lieutenant then testified about these claims. The lieutenant said that during the lunch break, he watched a nurse take Wilkins\u2019s blood pressure. It was 144 over 82, a reading that caused the nurse no concern for his safety or well-being. The lieutenant also said that he reviewed Wilkins\u2019s medical records with both a nurse and a medic. The records revealed that while he was supposed to be taking blood-pressure medication daily, he had refused to do so some days. The lieutenant testified that Wilkins did not take it on the morning of June 17 and refused to take it on the 18th and 19th. While he took it on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, Wilkins did not on the 23rd. Finally, on the 24th, 25th, and 26th, Wilkins again refused his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">{\u00b6 39} Hearing this testimony, the trial court again concluded that Wilkins\u2019s behavior was solely an effort to be disruptive. Counsel asked the court to grant a mistrial, but the court overruled the request. The jury was brought in, and the court cautioned them that Wilkins\u2019s guilt or innocence was to be determined by the evidence, not his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">{\u00b6 40} The jury found Wilkins guilty of all the charges \u2014 improper discharge of a firearm and felonious assault, along with their respective firearm specifications \u2014 and the trial court found him guilty of having a weapon while under disability, along with the accompanying firearm specification, and found that he was a repeat violent offender. The trial court sentenced Wilkins to 32 years in prison for the offenses and firearm specifications. The court also imposed a ten-year add-on sentence based on the repeat-violent-offender specification, bringing the total sentence to 42 consecutive years. Wilkins appeals from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by failing to exclude the testimony of William Prigmore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">{\u00b6 42} Wilkins contends that the prosecutor violated Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) by disclosing his intention to call Prigmore as a witness only four days before trial. The prosecutor then added insult to injury, Wilkins contends, by failing to disclose the breadth of Prigmore\u2019s testimony. The state responds that the prosecutor found out about Prigmore only six days before trial and made a good-faith effort to communicate quickly his intention. We find no discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">{\u00b6 43} Contrary to Wilkins\u2019s assertion, a prosecutor does not violate Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e) simply by disclosing his intention to call a witness only a few days before trial. According to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(e), upon request, a prosecutor must \u201cfurnish to the defendant a written list of the names and addresses of all witnesses whom the prosecuting attorney intends to call at trial.\u201d Crim.R. 16(D) converts this ostensible one-time disclosure into a continuing duty: whether \u201cprior to or during trial,\u201d when the prosecutor discovers additional witnesses that he intends to call, \u201che shall promptly make such matter available for discovery or inspection or notify the other party or his attorney or the court of the existence of the additional matter.\u201d Id. The discovery issue here, then, is whether the prosecutor failed to meet his continuing duty to disclose by failing to act promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">{\u00b6 44} On the first day of trial, June 23, in a brief colloquy, the prosecutor told the trial court that on June 18, a person called him and identified Prigmore, who was in prison with his friend Wilkins at the time, as a potential witness. Although the case had been tried several times before, the prosecutor said that he did not know about Prigmore until that day. The prosecutor filed an amended witness-list with the trial court on the same day. Wilkins\u2019s stand-by counsel picked up the amended list from the prosecutor on the 19th and gave it to Wilkins during a visit on the 20th. The prosecutor told the court that he (the prosecutor) did not in fact speak to Prigmore until the 20th. The prosecutor also said that he had made arrangements for Wilkins to question Prigmore. The trial court found that the prosecutor had acted in good faith in disclosing Prigmore and permitted him to testify the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">{\u00b6 45} The concern with violations of the continuing duty to disclose is that it will result in unfair \u201ctrial by ambush.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 99, 102, 30 OBR 356, 507 N.E.2d 1109. Here, there is no evidence that the prosecution was trying to conduct this type of trial. The prosecutor disclosed Prigmore in a reliable and expedient manner, to both the trial court and Wilkins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>and made him available for Wilkins to question. Thus, the prosecutor cannot be said to have failed to respond to Wilkins\u2019s discovery request, and therefore, he did not violate Crim.R. 16. We note also that Wilkins never asked the court to continue the trial to give him time to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">{\u00b6 46} The issue would be different if, as Wilkins asserts, the prosecutor had violated the discovery rules. Crim.R. 16(E)(3) gives a trial court discretion in fashioning a remedy for discovery violations. If there had been a violation, the issue now would be whether permitting Prigmore to testify nevertheless was an abuse of discretion. See <em>State v. Parson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 6 OBR 485, 453 N.E.2d 689. This was the issue in <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 269, 643 N.E.2d 524, which Wilkins suggests should control here. There, after the trial had already started, the prosecutor called a witness not on the witness list, and the trial court permitted the testimony. The court said that the prosecutor did violate Crim.R. 16 but that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the testimony nevertheless. <em>Scudder </em>is distinguishable, of course, because here, as we said, the prosecutor did not violate Crim.R. 16. The need for the trial court to fashion a discretionary remedy for a violation never arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">{\u00b6 47} Finally, Wilkins also contends that the prosecutor violated Crim.R. 16 by failing to disclose the expected breadth of Prigmore\u2019s testimony. During the colloquy, the prosecutor gave a general outline of the testimony he expected from Prigmore, though not all the testimony the prosecutor would later elicit. Wilkins does not point to the division of Crim.R. 16, or any other authority, that requires a prosecutor to provide a defendant with a summary of each witness\u2019s expected testimony. There is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">{\u00b6 48} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">{\u00b6 50} Wilkins next contends that the trial court should have granted his motion for a mistrial. His collapse, he argues, adversely affected his right to represent himself. Alternatively, Wilkins argues that the court should have granted a mistrial because he failed to represent himself properly. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">{\u00b6 51} Whether to grant a mistrial is a question left in the discretion of the trial court, and the court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a finding that the decision constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Locklin, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21224, 2006-Ohio-3855, 2006 WL 2105226, at \u00b6 11. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>abuse of discretion \u201cimplies an arbitrary, unreasonable, unconscionable attitude on the part of the court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. Alone, an irregularity during trial is generally not grounds for ordering a mistrial. The irregularity must have adversely affected a substantial right of the accused. <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1988), 49 Ohio App.3d 27, 33, 550 N.E.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">{\u00b6 52} Just before Wilkins was removed from the courtroom, the trial judge said that \u201cthe record should reflect the defendant is being videotaped now. So the court of appeals will be well aware of his conduct.\u201d We have watched the videotape, and it is apparent not only from the judge\u2019s words but also from her tone, that from the beginning, she believed that Wilkins was putting on a show. The judge had grounds for this belief, however. Earlier, Prigmore had testified that Wilkins told him that if he (Wilkins) thought that he was losing the trial, he \u201cwould try to do something to get a mistrial.\u201d The judge\u2019s belief no doubt grew firmer as she heard three medically trained professionals testify that, after examination, they could find nothing physically wrong with Wilkins. The judge heard that Wilkins was responsive to commands from officers. And she heard testimony from a police officer who watched Wilkins quickly recover when standby counsel walked into the room, though he had been slumped in his chair and uncommunicative since his collapse. Finally, the judge experienced Wilkins\u2019s refusal to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">{\u00b6 53} Wilkins contends that his collapse adversely affected only his right to represent himself. He argues that he was unable to finish his cross examination and unable to make a closing statement. The trial court, Wilkins argues, should have had him examined by a medical doctor and continued the trial until he was able to resume. In response, the state cites our decision in <em>State v. Greathouse, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21536, 2007-Ohio-2136, 2007 WL 1297181, in which we affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial. There, the defendant violently overturned the defense table and then moved for a mistrial. We said that the defendant should not be permitted to profit from his voluntary and physically disruptive behavior. Wilkins responds that <em>Greathouse </em>is distinguishable because, while in <em>Greathouse </em>the defendant\u2019s behavior was voluntary, Wilkins\u2019s collapse was the result of a medical condition. It was not Wilkins\u2019s collapse, however, that adversely affected his right to self-representation. While a defendant does have the constitutional right to represent himself, \u201cthe trial judge may terminate self-representation by a defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, fn. 46. \u201cThe right of self-representation,\u201d said the court, \u201cis not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom.\u201d Id. The transcript reveals that despite her belief that Wilkins\u2019s collapse was feigned, the trial judge was willing to allow him to continue his self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>representation. Moreover, the judge gave Wilkins numerous opportunities to speak, to explain what he believed his medical condition was, and to ask the court for time to be examined by a medical doctor. Wilkins chose simply not to respond. We note that even if it were a genuine medical condition that caused Wilkins to fall, the evidence shows that the condition struck him neither deaf nor dumb. What prejudiced Wilkins\u2019s right, then, was not his collapse, but his refusal to respond after the collapse. This behavior, though not physically disruptive like the defendant\u2019s behavior in <em>Greathouse, </em>was no less voluntary and no less disruptive. It was for this reason that the court terminated Wilkins\u2019s right to represent himself and refused to grant a mistrial. The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">{\u00b6 54} Wilkins alternatively argues that the trial court should have granted a mistrial because he failed to represent himself properly during his examination of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses. A defendant who exercises his right to appear pro se \u201ccannot thereafter complain that the quality of his own defense amounted to a denial of \u2018effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, fn. 46. Upon reviewing the transcript, we see that the trial court repeatedly warned Wilkins of the dangers of self-representation. The court appointed stand-by counsel and gave Wilkins numerous opportunities, even after the trial had begun, to withdraw and allow counsel to continue his defense. Yet Wilkins persisted, despite the court\u2019s frequent warnings. With rights come unseverable responsibilities. Wilkins, in choosing to exercise his right to self-representation, must accept responsibility for the consequences of his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">{\u00b6 55} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe trial court erred in convicting appellant as such convictions were not sufficiently supported by the evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">{\u00b6 57} Wilkins contends that the evidence is insufficient to prove that he was the shooter. He argues that the police never recovered a weapon or any other physical evidence that links him to the shooting. The prosecution\u2019s case, he argues, was based solely on Brooks\u2019s identification. Wilkins acknowledges Prig-more\u2019s testimony but says that Prigmore should not have been permitted to testify (a contention we rejected in the first assignment of error) and that the testimony he did give was unreliable. We conclude that the evidence is both sufficient for and consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">{\u00b6 58} Questions of sufficiency and weight are separate and distinct inquiries. The issue with respect to sufficiency is \u201c[wjhether the evidence is legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. \u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 259-260, 574 N.E.2d 492. By contrast, \u201c[wjeight of the evidence concerns the inclination of the <em>greater amount of credible evidence, </em>offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Thompkins, </em>at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. Under the weight-of-the-evidence standard, an appellate court \u201cmust review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider witness credibility, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact \u2018clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Adrian, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 300, 2006-Ohio-4143, 859 N.E.2d 1007, at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. Yet because the jury saw and heard the witnesses, the appellate court accords substantial deference to its determinations of weight and credibility. <em>State v. Lawson </em>(Aug. 22, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684. While remembering the analytical distinctions between these two inquires, we will discuss them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">{\u00b6 59} The primary inculpatory evidence comes from the testimony of Brooks and Prigmore. Wilkins offered the conflicting exculpatory testimony of one alibi witness. Brooks, who has known Wilkins for over a decade, saw Wilkins\u2019s face and consistently identified Wilkins as the shooter \u2014 he never suggested anyone else. Already in the 911 call Brooks made right after the shooting, he told the dispatcher that Wilkins was the shooter. Prigmore and Wilkins had been friends since 2001. Prigmore testified that Wilkins told him that he wanted to kill Brooks. He testified that Wilkins\u2019s friend Chuck had offered Wilkins $10,000 to kill Brooks. In the evening that followed the shooting, Prigmore said, Wilkins called him and told him that he had failed to kill Brooks. Prigmore heard the argument between Wilkins and Chuck and watched Chuck give Wilkins $1,500. Before Chuck left, Prigmore watched as Chuck pulled a gun out from under the couch \u2014 an assault rifle like the one used in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">{\u00b6 60} Wilkins presented the testimony of Syreeta Scruggs, a long-time friend, who testified that Wilkins had driven with her to Akron the day before the shooting and remained in Akron the next day. She admitted, however, that she was not actually with Wilkins on the day of the shooting because she drove back to Dayton for a meeting with her parole officer. Also, Prigmore testified that when he and Wilkins talked about trial strategy, Wilkins told him that Scruggs was going to lie and say that on the day of the shooting, he was in Akron.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>{\u00b6 61} To determine whether the evidence is sufficient to support the finding that Wilkins was the shooter, we must examine it in the light most favorable to the state. This means that we assume that the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses is true, rendering questions of credibility and weight irrelevant. Brooks\u2019s eyewitness identification of Wilkins as the shooter, if believed, is alone sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Wilkins is the \u201cperson\u201d who committed the offenses. Adding Prigmore\u2019s testimony only strengthens this conclusion. For the two reasons already identified, we do not think that the jury was wrong to reject Scruggs\u2019s conflicting alibi testimony. The remaining evidence all weighs in favor of the jury\u2019s finding that Wilkins was the shooter. Upon reviewing the evidence, we do not think that the jury lost its way and created a miscarriage of justice that demands reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">{\u00b6 62} The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cThe trial court erred in imposing an additional ten years to the sentence of the appellant on the repeat violent offender specification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">(\u00b6 64} Wilkins contends that <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, eliminated sentences for repeat violent offenders by excising former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2) in its entirety. He argues that the trial court, therefore, had no authority to impose such a sentence on him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">{\u00b6 65} This assignment of error is overruled based on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Hunter, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 164, 2009-Ohio-4147, 915 N.E.2d 292, which affirmed the imposition of an enhanced sentence for a repeat-violent-offender specification. ' The court concluded that <em>\u201cFoster </em>excised judicial factfinding from former R.C. 2929.14(D)(2) but did not eliminate the repeat violent offender specification.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27. In other words, <em>Foster </em>did not excise the entire statutory division but \u201conly the portions * * * that required judicial factfinding.\u201d Id. \u201cWe never,\u201d said the court, \u201cspecifically precluded a trial court from imposing enhanced penalties for a repeat violent offender specification.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">{\u00b6 66} The first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are overruled. Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b872-13\">Grady and Dinkelacker, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Patrick T.

The other charges were an additional count of felonious assault with a deadly weapon, accompanied by a three-year firearm specification and a repeat-violent-offender specification; an additional count of having a weapon while under disability, accompanied by a three-year firearm specification; two additional counts of having a weapon while under disability, each accompanied by a one-year firearm specification; and one count of burglary, accompanied by a three-year firearm specification. The prosecution dismissed the burglary count, and two of the counts of having a weapon while under disability, along with the accompanying one-year firearm specifications. The remaining felonious-assault charge and disability charge stemmed from a separate shooting incident. See our decision in <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21562, 2007-Ohio-2962, 2007 WL 1720476, for a discussion of this incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-14\">.
