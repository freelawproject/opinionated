Irene, appeal from a judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Jack K. Beatley. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">{\u00b6 2} Defendants all attend college in Columbus. In January 2006, defendants began looking for rental housing in the Ohio State University campus area for the 2006-2007 school year. According to Knisley and Wanner, Lavon Baker, an agent for Beatley, showed them various rental properties on January 15 and 18, 2006. On the second day of touring Beatley\u2019s rental property, Knisley and Wanner found a unit that they liked at 136 E. Norwich. Before Baker would allow the girls to rent the unit, she made several telephone calls to Beatley. Baker then told Knisley and Wanner that they would have to satisfy three conditions before a lease on the unit would become binding. First, the girls needed to find someone willing to guarantee payments on their behalf and to sign a guarantor agreement. Second, the girls needed to submit a deposit of $1,460. And third, the girls needed to secure a fourth tenant to sign a lease and to occupy the unit. Baker informed Knisley and Wanner that they had only 24 hours to satisfy all three conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Knisley and Wanner completed rental applications and signed the lease that Baker presented to them. Later that day, Irene visited Beatley\u2019s offices. After Baker told Irene about the three conditions, Irene completed a rental application and signed the lease also. None of the conditions appeared in the lease itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">{\u00b6 4} Beatley approved defendants\u2019 rental applications and signed the lease. He then withdrew the 136 E. Norwich unit from the market. Meanwhile, defendants failed to satisfy any of the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 5} Pursuant to the lease defendants signed, the lease term began on September 18, 2006. When defendants did not move into the unit on that day or the next, Beatley sent them a letter stating that they owed him $4,380 as of September 19, 2006, and that they would owe an additional $1,460 rental payment on October 1, 2006. Defendants all expressed surprise that they owed Beatley anything, as they had never completed the conditions Baker had set forth. When Beatley learned that defendants refused to take possession of the unit, he re-rented it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 6} On November 17, 2006, Beatley filed suit against defendants for breach of contract. After the parties finished discovery, Beatley moved for summary judgment. In his motion, Beatley contended that defendants could not rely upon oral conditions precedent as a defense to his breach-of-contract claim. Beatley argued that because the lease was an integrated contract, the parol evidence rule barred evidence of any conditions precedent orally imposed prior to the signing of the lease. Apparently agreeing with Beatley\u2019s argument, the trial court granted him summary judgment on March 19, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court then held an evidentiary hearing regarding the amount of damages incurred and the measures Beatley undertook to mitigate his damages. On July 18, 2008, the trial court issued a judgment entry awarding Beatley damages against defendants in the amount of $10,054.92, plus costs and post-judgment interest of eight percent per annum. Defendants now appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment, and they assign the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">[1.] The trial court erred as a matter of law when it improperly barred appellants from offering testimony that appellee\u2019s agent was responsible for leasing the premises and that she made three oral conditions precedent to induce appellants to sign the lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">[2.] The trial court erred as a matter of law when it improperly concluded that appellee mitigated his damages by adequately marketing and trying to re-rent the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 8} Before considering the merits of defendants\u2019 assignments of error, we must address a procedural point raised by Beatley. According to Beatley, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>court should conf\u00edne its review of this case to the trial court\u2019s July 18, 2008 judgment because defendants named only that judgment in their notice of appeal. In other words, Beatley asks this court to disregard defendants\u2019 first assignment of error because it challenges the March 19, 2008 entry granting summary judgment, and defendants did not designate that judgment entry as an order being appealed in their notice of appeal. We decline to so limit defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 9} Pursuant to App.R. 3(D), a notice of appeal \u201cshall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from.\u201d However, this rule does not require an appellant to separately identify each interlocutory order issued prior to a final judgment. <em>Shaffer v. OhioHealth Corp., </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-236, 2004-Ohio-6523, 2004 WL 2806417, \u00b6 12; <em>Kvinta v. Kvinta, </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-836, 2003-Ohio-2884, 2003 WL 21291049, \u00b6 20. Interlocutory orders merge into the final judgment, and thus an appeal from a final judgment allows an appellant to challenge both the final judgment and any interlocutory orders merged with it. <em>Grover v. Bartsch, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 188, 2006-Ohio-6115, 866 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 9; <em>Lingo v. Ohio Cent. RR., Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-206, 2006-Ohio-2268, 2006 WL 1230679, \u00b6 17; <em>Mtge. Electronic Registrations Sys. v. Mullins, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 12, 2005-Ohio-2303, 829 N.E.2d 326, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 10} Here, the March 19, 2008 judgment entry granting Beatley summary judgment was an interlocutory order because it failed to completely dispose of Beatley\u2019s claim. See <em>Parrett v. Univ. of Cincinnati Police Dept., </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-220, 2002-Ohio-5076, 2002 WL 31122980, \u00b6 9 (\u201c \u2018entry of judgment by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff on the issue of liability which leaves the amount of damages to be awarded unresolved until some future time, does not constitute a final judgment which may then be treated as an appealable order\u2019 \u201d). As an interlocutory order, the March 19, 2008 judgment entry merged with the July 18, 2008 final judgment. Therefore, defendants did not need to name the March 19, 2008 judgment entry in their notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 11} By defendants\u2019 first assignment of error, they argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Beatley. Defendants maintain that the parol evidence rule does not bar evidence of oral conditions precedent and that defendants\u2019 testimony created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether three oral conditions precedent existed and whether the failure of those conditions precedent prevented the lease from becoming effective. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 12} Appellate review of summary judgment motions is de novo. <em>Andersen v. Highland House Co. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 547, 548, 757 N.E.2d 329. \u201c \u2018When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent review of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abrams v. Worthington, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 94, 2006-Ohio-5516, 861 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>N.E.2d 920, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Mergenthal v. Star Banc Corp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 701 N.E.2d 383. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that a trial court must grant summary judgment when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <em>Gilbert v. Summit Cty., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 660, 2004-Ohio-7108, 821 N.E.2d 564, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 13} When seeking summary judgment on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case, the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The moving party does not discharge this initial burden under Civ.R. 56 by simply making a conclusory allegation that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Id. Rather, the moving party must affirmatively demonstrate by affidavit or other evidence allowed by Civ.R. 56(C) that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support its claims. Id. If the moving party meets this initial burden, then the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and if the nonmoving party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 14} The parol evidence rule is a substantive rule of law developed centuries ago to protect the integrity of written contracts. <em>Ed Schory &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Soc. Natl. Bank </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 433, 440, 662 N.E.2d 1074; <em>Charles A. Burton, Inc. v. Durkee </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 313, 49 O.O. 174, 109 N.E.2d 265, paragraph one of the syllabus. According to this rule, \u201c \u2018the parties\u2019 final written integration of their agreement may not be varied, contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, or prior written agreements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galmish v. Cicchini </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 22, 27, 734 N.E.2d 782, quoting 11 Williston on Contracts (4th Ed.1999) 569-570, Section 33:4. See also <em>Bellman v. Am. Internatl. Group, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 323, 2007-Ohio-2071, 865 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 7, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) (\u201cThe parol-evidence rule is a principle of common law providing that \u2018a writing intended by the parties to be a final embodiment of their agreement cannot be modified by evidence of earlier or contemporaneous agreements that might add to, vary, or contradict the writing\u2019 \u201d). By prohibiting the introduction of extrinsic evidence to alter or supplement the parties\u2019 final, complete expression of their agreement, the parol evidence rule ensures the stability, predictability, and enforceability of written contracts and \u201c \u2018effectuates a presumption that a subsequent written contract is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of a higher nature than earlier statements, negotiations, or oral agreements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galmish </em>at 27, 734 N.E.2d 782, quoting 11 Williston on Contracts 541-48, Section 33:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 15} Ohio courts have long recognized exceptions to the parol evidence rule. <em>Galmish, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 27, 734 N.E.2d 782 (excepting instances of \u201cfraud, mistake or other invalidating cause\u201d from the parol evidence rule). Among these exceptions is the allowance of extrinsic evidence to prove a condition precedent to a contract. <em>Cecil v. Orthopedic Multispecialty Network, Inc., </em>5th Dist. No. 2006 CA 00067, 2006-Ohio-4454, 2006 WL 2474349, \u00b6 38 (\u201cOhio [cjourts have recognized that parol evidence is admissible to establish a condition precedent to the existence of a contract\u201d); <em>Carter v. New Buckeye Redev. Corp. </em>(Apr. 2, 1998), 8th Dist. No. 72501,1998 WL 158855 (\u201cParol evidence is admissible to establish a condition precedent [that] was orally agreed upon, although the condition precedent was not included in the contract language\u201d); <em>Riggs v. Std. Slag Co. </em>(Nov. 10, 1993), 9th Dist. No. 16199, 1993 WL 473817 (holding that parol evidence \u201cis admissible to establish a condition precedent to the existence of a contract\u201d); <em>Roan v. Hale </em>(1950), 102 N.E.2d 603, 604, 60 Ohio Law Abs. 559, 560 (\u201cparol evidence is admissible to prove a separate oral agreement constituting a condition precedent to the signing of the written instrument\u201d); <em>Johnson v. McKinney </em>(1950), 90 Ohio App. 111, 115, 103 N.E.2d 825 (\u201cThe law recognizes the right to annex contemporaneous oral conditions precedent to a written contract\u201d); <em>Dependabilt Homes, Inc. v. Haettel </em>(1947), 81 Ohio App. 422, 424, 37 O.O. 251, 76 N.E.2d 616, quoting <em>Frankel Chevrolet Co. v. Snyder </em>(1930), 37 Ohio App. 378, 174 N.E. 751, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201c \u2018Parol evidence may be given to prove separate oral agreement constituting condition precedent to attaching of obligation under contract\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 16} Courts admit extrinsic evidence of a condition precedent because satisfaction of such a condition must occur before a contract comes into existence. <em>Russell v. Daniels-Head &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(June 30, 1987), 4th Dist. No. 1600, 1987 WL 13943; <em>Broderick Co. v. Colville </em>(1931), 41 Ohio App. 449, 451-452, 179 N.E. 810. See also <em>Mumaw v. W &amp; S. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1917), 97 Ohio St. 1, 11, 119 N.E. 132 (holding that a contract is not effective until the performance of the conditions precedent and that a condition precedent \u201ccalls for the happening of some event, or the performance of some act, after the terms of the contract have been agreed on, before the contract shall be binding on the parties\u201d). Thus, parol evidence establishing a condition precedent does not modify the terms of a written contract but instead determines whether the contract ever became effective. <em>Hiatt v. Giles, </em>2nd Dist. No. 1662, 2005-Ohio-6536, 2005 WL 3346172, \u00b6 31; <em>Coleman v. Fishhead Records, Inc. </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 537, 543, 758 N.E.2d 694, fn. 4; <em>Boblien, Inc. v. Hoge </em>(June 7, 2000), 9th Dist. No. 2967-M, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>2000 WL 727539. The parol evidence rule does not preclude evidence that contradicts the very existence or validity of an alleged contract. <em>Miller v. Lindsay-Green, Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-848, 2005-Ohio-6366, 2005 WL 3220215, \u00b6 54, quoting 11 Williston on Contracts 612-615, Section 33:14; <em>Mangano v. Dawson </em>(June 13, 1995), 7th Dist. No. 93-C-72, 1995 WL 358685; <em>McPherson v. Inland Steel Dev. Corp. </em>(Feb. 14, 1980), 10th Dist. No. 79AP-254, 1980 WL 353283.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 17} In the case at bar, defendants each testified that Baker told them that they had to perform three acts: (1) obtain a guarantor, (2) pay a $1,460 deposit, and (3) produce a fourth tenant. Defendants contend that Baker stated that they needed to complete each act before the lease would be binding. Thus, defendants have created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Beatley (through his agent) imposed oral conditions precedent to the existence of the lease. Contrary to Beatley\u2019s argument, the parol evidence rule would not prohibit this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 18} Moreover, Beatley cannot rely upon the integration clause as a bar to the introduction of evidence of the alleged oral conditions precedent. The rule of contract integration is a corollary principle to the parol evidence rule, as the degree of integration determines whether the parol evidence rule applies to a contract. <em>Galmish, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 28, 734 N.E.2d 782 (\u201cThe parol evidence rule applies, in the first instance, only to integrated writings * * * \u201d); <em>Miller </em>at \u00b6 37 (\u201cA corollary principal [sic] to the parol evidence rule is the rule of contract integration, whereby the degree of finality and completeness of a contract determines whether the parol evidence rule is applicable\u201d). Logically, then, where the parol evidence rule does not apply, neither does the rule of contract integration.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 19} Although the parol evidence rule does not preclude extrinsic evidence of a condition precedent, courts do not completely abandon the principles behind that rule when dealing with alleged oral conditions precedent. To preserve the integrity of the written contract, a party may not introduce extrinsic evidence of an oral condition precedent when the written contract addresses the subject matter of the condition precedent and the contractual terms are inconsistent with the condition precedent. <em>Cecil </em>at \u00b6 41; <em>Hiatt </em>at \u00b6 32; <em>Villa Realty Co., Inc. v. Allied Invest. Credit Co. </em>(July 14, 1977), 8th Dist. No. 35585, 1977 WL 201215. \u201cWhen the subject matter of a condition precedent is dealt with in the written instrument, in any form, the condition may not be shown by parol evidence to be different from the manner in which it is expressed in the writing.\u201d Id. at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In the case at bar, the lease addresses the subject matter of each of the alleged oral conditions precedent, although with varying degrees of specificity. With regard to the requirement that defendants\u2019 obtain a guarantor, the lease states that \u201c[ejach tenant may be required to have a Guarantor * * With regard to the requirement that defendants pay a $1,460 deposit, the lease provides that defendants \u201cwill be charged\u201d one of the following: (1) a $1,460 \u201cholding deposit\u201d in consideration for holding the unit and withdrawing it from the market,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) a liquidated-damage fee equal to the annual rental amount minus any re-rental income, or (3) a $1,460 fee if Beatley re-rented the unit within 30 days of the rental term. With regard to the requirement that defendants find a fourth tenant to sign the lease, the lease requires only that \u201c[t]he premises shall be occupied by no more than 4 persons * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 21} None of these provisions is inconsistent with the alleged oral conditions precedent. The requirement that defendants must obtain a guarantor is actually congruous to the relevant lease provision, as it resolves whether Beatley invoked that provision and required defendants to secure a guarantor. Although the lease discusses the possibility that potential tenants may owe a \u201cholding deposit\u201d under the lease, that possibility does not conflict with a condition precedent that defendants must pay a deposit before the lease would become binding. Finally, the imposition of a maximum-occupancy rate does not contradict the alleged oral condition precedent requiring a minimum-occupancy rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 22} Because the lease terms and the alleged oral conditions precedent are not inconsistent, defendants may introduce extrinsic evidence of the three alleged oral conditions precedent. As Beatley contests the existence of those alleged conditions precedent, defendants have established a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment. If a factfinder believes defendants, then the nonoccurrence of the conditions precedent prevented the lease from ever becoming effective and defendants cannot be held liable for breach of a nonexistent lease. If, on the other hand, a factfinder believes Beatley, then defendants breached a viable lease when they refused to take possession of the unit, and Beatley is entitled to damages. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in Beatley\u2019s favor, and thus we sustain defendants\u2019 first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 23} Because the trial court erred in finding defendants liable even though a genuine issue of material fact remained undecided, we must reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, we conclude that the second assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s determination of damages, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>{\u00b6 24} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain defendants\u2019 first assignment of error, and we find defendants\u2019 second assignment of error moot. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court, and we remand this matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-6\">French, P.J., and Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\">.
