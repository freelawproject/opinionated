After reviewing the facts of the case and pertinent law, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\n<em>The Chase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">{\u00b6 2} On July 10, 2006, Cleveland police officer Michael Legg and his partner, Officer Taylor, recognized a silver Mercury Sable parked near Euclid and Burgess Avenues in Cleveland, which defendant, who was wanted on several outstanding warrants, had been seen driving. The officers radioed for assistance. Several police vehicles were positioned nearby, waiting for defendant to get in the car. The plan was to box defendant in at a nearby traffic light and arrest him. However, when defendant saw the first police vehicle attempt to cut him off, he managed to get through the intersection and head west on Euclid Avenue. The police cars in the area turned their lights and sirens on and began to pursue him.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 3} The chase quickly approached speeds of 80 to 90 miles per hour, with defendant leading the police through the city of East Cleveland, onto 1-90 westbound.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 4} Cleveland police officer John Kubas heard about the chase over the police radio. He and his partner, Officer Spahia, entered 1-90 westbound at the E. 55th Street entrance ramp in a black and white marked police car. Officer Kubas saw defendant\u2019s vehicle approaching from behind, being pursued by several marked police cars with lights and sirens activated. Defendant\u2019s car swerved toward Officers Kubas and Spahia\u2019s vehicle, causing them to drive off to the side of the road. According to Officer Kubas, defendant\u2019s car was traveling in excess of 60 to 70 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 5} Officer Kubas testified that if he and his partner had not gotten out of the way when defendant\u2019s vehicle swerved toward them on 1-90, \u201cour zone car would have been struck by the auto. * * * I was afraid that we were going to get hit. And being a policeman for 13 years, I\u2019ve seen many accidents, and I was scared we were going to get hit and possibly injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 6} Defendant exited 1-90 at St. Clair Avenue and reentered the highway approximately one eighth of a mile away, at Superior Avenue, this time heading east. For a time, Cleveland police officer Vincent Lucarelli was driving his police vehicle adjacent to defendant\u2019s car. Defendant swerved toward Officer Lucarelli\u2019s vehicle, and Officer Lucarelli had to take evasive action to avoid an accident. According to Officer Lucarelli, they were traveling \u201cwell over 90 miles an hour\u201d at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 7} Defendant next approached the Eddy Road exit of 1-90. Two marked Bratenal police cars, with their overhead lights on, were positioned at the end of the Eddy Road exit ramp in another attempt to block defendant\u2019s car. When defendant did not slow his vehicle down as he exited 1-90, Bratenal police officer Daniel Gomillion and Sergeant Barton moved their cars out of the way to avoid being hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Officer Legg testified that his vehicle was parallel to defendant\u2019s vehicle for a few blocks and he got a good look at the driver, who he identified in court as defendant. Officer Legg also testified that there was no way defendant did not see and hear the police lights and sirens surrounding him. \u201cIt seemed like the closer we got to Eddy Road, the more the Sable began to accelerate. So at that point we thought the collision was inevitable is what we were anticipating,\u201d Officer Legg stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">{\u00b6 9} Officer Gomillion testified that defendant was driving 80 to 90 miles an hour when he drove across the Eddy Road ramp: \u201cI see the vehicle speeding at a high rate of speed, and I see he\u2019s not even slowing down. I instruct my sergeant, we got to get out of the way. I throw my car in reverse and peel out backwards. He throws his car in drive and peels out forward.\u201d Officer Gomillion further testified that defendant\u2019s vehicle went airborne as it crossed over Eddy Road and that it missed hitting his and Sgt. Barton\u2019s police vehicles by just a few feet. Asked what he thought would have happened had he not moved his vehicle out of the way, Officer Gomillion stated, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would be a police officer right now, let alone be alive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 10} Finally, defendant exited 1-90 at East 140th Street, ending up on a side street off Euclid Avenue, where he jumped out of the car and took off running. At this point, only the police vehicle driven by Officer Legg had kept up with defendant. By the time the other police vehicles arrived at the scene, defendant was out of sight in a nearby wooded area. Defendant was not arrested that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\n<em>The Collision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 11} On July 12, 2006,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sergeant Eugene Sharpe, of the Cuyahoga County Sheriff\u2019s Office, received a tip from a confidential informant that defendant was seen driving a maroon Chevy Lumina at the American Motel on Euclid Avenue, in Cleveland. Sgt. Sharpe was working undercover in the fugitive task force, which is a joint agency with the FBI, the Cuyahoga County Sheriffs Office, the Cleveland Police Department, and the Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority. Sgt. Sharpe and his fellow fugitive task force officers went to the motel and set up surveillance of the suspect vehicle in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 12} Sgt. Sharpe and FBI Special Agent Phillip Torsney saw defendant exit one of the motel rooms and get behind the wheel of the Lumina. A female followed defendant and also got in the vehicle. As defendant backed out of his parking space, Sgt. Sharpe and another officer walked toward the front of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>car, identifying themselves as police officers, and motioned and yelled for defendant to stop the vehicle. Instead, defendant put the vehicle in drive and headed straight toward the officers. Sgt. Sharpe drew his weapon and yelled, \u201cPolice. Stop. Stop. Stop the vehicle. Stop the vehicle now.\u201d Defendant initially put his hands up in the air, then suddenly accelerated toward Sharpe, who jumped out of the way. Sgt. Sharpe testified about what happened next:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe vehicle goes right past me. I turn around. Now I\u2019m behind the vehicle and I see him getting ready to hit Agent Torsney who is out of his vehicle. He\u2019s going right at him. At that point, I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s going to kill him or seriously hurt him. At that point, I immediately fire one or two rounds from my service weapon trying to stop the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cAlso at the same time, Special Agent Torsney is also firing as he\u2019s trying to escape the path of the vehicle from the front or the side area. The vehicle then tries to get through. At this time, he\u2019s trying to get through the small area where Torsney parked his vehicle and the fence. It\u2019s not very large. He guns past there and runs right into [Cuyahoga County Sheriffs Office] Detective Domonkos\u2019s Tahoe which is now pulled up. He hits Detective Domonkos\u2019 Tahoe at the same time that Detective Domonkos is getting out of his vehicle causing Domonkos to immediately fall to the ground and he hit his head on the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 15} Special Agent Torsney testified that the task force wanted to apprehend defendant before he had a chance to leave in his car, given the dangerous chase that defendant had led the Cleveland police on two days before. Torsney further testified that when defendant\u2019s car began to move, Torsney drew his weapon and said, \u201cPolice, FBI, stop, show us your hands.\u201d He also testified that he heard other officers telling defendant similar things. At first, defendant put his hands in the air, but his car kept moving forward at a slow pace. Torsney testified about what happened next:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cHe accelerates the vehicle, and it almost hits Detective Sharpe who is further up and to the right. He gets out of the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAt this point, this vehicle is coming right at me.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cWell, I know I have a female passenger in that car, and this car is right up on me and it\u2019s coming at me. And I get off to the side of it and brace with my left hand. It hits me on the right side around my knee, the side of the car, brushing past me. In my mind, I feared for the life of Officer Sharpe, my own life at that point, and I know there\u2019s other officers behind me. And I fired two rounds trying to stop that vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>{\u00b6 20} According to Special Agent Torsney, the vehicle kept going and ran into Det. Domonkos\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 21} Det. Domonkos testified as follows regarding when he pulled into the motel parking lot: \u201cI stop my vehicle and start coming out. As I\u2019m coming out, I hear stop, police. Let me see your hands, several times. I then hear an engine rev. I hear a couple of gunshots, and then I\u2019m picking myself up off the ground because the vehicle that the defendant was driving struck mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 22} After the collision, the authorities pulled defendant from the vehicle, got him on the ground, and handcuffed him. Sgt. Sharpe and Special Agent Torsney saw a plastic bag containing crack cocaine on the floor of the car near the driver\u2019s seat and the butt of a loaded handgun sticking out from underneath the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 23} On August 22, 2006, defendant was indicted for the following offenses in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas case No. CR-485157, which is associated with the chase on July 10, 2006: failure to comply with order or signal of a police officer in violation of R.C. 2921.331, five counts of felonious assault of a peace officer in violation of R.C. 2903.11 (officers Kubas, Spahia, Lucarelli, Barton, and Gomillion), and one count of possessing criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 24} Defendant was also indicted that same day for the following offenses in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas case No. CR-485158, which is associated with the collision on July 12, 2006: failure to comply with order or signal of a police officer in violation of R.C 2921.331, three counts of felonious assault of a peace officer in violation of R.C. 2903.11 (Officers Sharpe, Torsney, and Domonkos), two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of R.C. 2903.13 (Officers Torsney and Domonkos), two counts of having a weapon while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13, carrying a concealed weapon in violation of R.C. 2923.12, vandalism in violation of R.C. 2909.05, possessing criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24, drug possession in violation of R.C. 2925.11, and drug trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03. The indictment in case No. CR-485158 included a one-year firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 25} The two cases were consolidated, and after a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of all counts except drug trafficking. On March 6, 2008, the court sentenced defendant to an aggregate of 22 years in prison. Defendant now appeals, raising 12 assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">\n<em>Adequacy of indictments and jury instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 26} Assignments of error I, II, and V will be addressed together, and they read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201cI. Mr. Anderson cannot be convicted of the peace officer specifications attendant to each of the felonious assault convictions and assault convictions because there is no evidence that the grand jury or the petit jury ever considered whether Mr. Anderson was aware that the alleged victims were peace officers or was reckless in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cII. Mr. Anderson cannot be convicted of the one-year firearm specifications attendant to each of the convictions in counts one through six, ten and twelve because there is no evidence that the grand jury or the petit jury ever considered whether Mr. Anderson was aware that he possessed the firearm when committing these offenses or was reckless in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cV. Mr. Anderson cannot be convicted of the offense of having a weapon under disability in count seven because there is no evidence that the grand jury or the trial court ever considered whether Mr. Anderson was aware that he knew he was a fugitive from justice or was reckless in that regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 30} Defendant argues that the essential element of mens rea was missing from the indictments and the jury instructions regarding various charges that he faced. Defendant further argues that when no culpable mental state is provided under the law, the default mental state of recklessness applies. See, generally, <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">\n<em>Peace officer; adequacy of indictments and jury instructions (case Nos. CR-485157 and CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 31} Defendant was convicted of multiple counts of felonious assault and assault of a peace officer in violation of R.C. 2903.11 and 2903.13. However, his argument that an essential element of these offenses is his awareness that the assault victims were police officers has been rejected by this court. In <em>State v. Wilcox, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 468, 2005-Ohio-1745, 827 N.E.2d 832, at \u00b6 3, 7, we held the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018A finding by the jury that the victim was a peace officer simply enhances the degree of the offense and potential penalty.\u2019 Thus, proof of knowledge of the victims status is not required under these circumstances. <em>State v. Gimenez </em>(Sept. 4, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 71190, 1997 WL 547950. * * * Based on this precedent, it is irrelevant whether [the defendant] knew that those stopping his van were peace officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cAs our prior decisions bear out, there is no indication whatsoever that the General Assembly intended to impose anything other than strict liability for the peace officer penalty enhancement contained in R.C. 2903.13(C)(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>{\u00b6 35} In following <em>Wilcox, </em>we hold that the indictments and jury instructions in the instant case were adequate regarding the various charges of assaulting a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\n<em>Firearm; adequacy of indictments and jury instructions (case No. CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 36} Defendant was convicted of a one-year firearm specification attendant to various counts pursuant to R.C. 2941.141 for the gun that was found underneath the driver\u2019s seat of the Lumina he was operating when he was arrested. Defendant argues that an essential element of this firearm specification is that he knew, or was reckless concerning the knowledge, that he \u201chad a firearm on or about [his] person or under [his] control while committing the offense.\u201d R.C. 2941.141. Neither defendant nor the state set forth any law concerning this specific issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 37} We decline to extend the <em>Colon </em>school of thought to firearm specifications in violation of R.C. 2941.141. Rather, we adopt the reasoning found in <em>Wilcox </em>that a firearm specification is an enhancement to an underlying offense; therefore, strict liability applies. Accord, <em>State v. Blankenship </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 534, 547, 657 N.E.2d 559 (holding that a \u201cfirearm specification is not a separate offense\u201d and does not violate double jeopardy).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>Fuyitive from justice; adequacy of indictments and jury instructions (case No. 485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 38} Defendant was convicted of having a weapon while under a disability, with the disabling condition being that he was \u201ca fugitive from justice,\u201d in violation of R.C. 2923.13. While the indictment in the instant case alleges that defendant \u201cdid knowingly\u201d possess a gun, defendant argues on appeal that the indictment should also have alleged that he knew, or was reckless regarding the knowledge, that he was a fugitive from justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 39} Defendant failed to object to being indicted for violating R.C. 2923.13(A)(1) on the basis that the indictment was defective because it did not include the essential element of the offense\u2019s mens rea. Therefore, a plain-error analysis is appropriate. See <em>Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169, at \u00b6 7; Crim.R. 52(B) (\u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 40} In <em>State v. Clay, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 528, 2008-Ohio-6325, 900 N.E.2d 1000, at \u00b6 28, the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201cfor purposes of proving the offense of having a weapon while under a disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), the mental state of recklessness applies in determining whether the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>aware that he or she was \u2018under indictment.\u2019 \u201d See also R.C. 2901.21(B). We extend this reasoning to determining whether a defendant was aware that he or she was \u201ca fugitive from justice\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 42} In the instant case, nine law-enforcement officers testified that multiple marked police cars with lights and sirens activated were in pursuit of defendant, who narrowly missed hitting several of these cars, during the July 10, 2006 high-speed chase. In other words, there was overwhelming evidence that on July 12, 2006 \u2014 two days after this unsuccessful chase \u2014 defendant knew that he was a fugitive from justice. Therefore, any defects in the indictments or jury instructions were harmless and do not amount to plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 43} Accordingly, assignments of error I, II, and V are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\n<em>Sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 44} Assignments of error III, IV, VI, and VII will be addressed together, and read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cIII. The evidence is insufficient to find the defendant guilty of the offenses alleged in counts two through six, felonious assault of a peace officer, and thus the convictions in these counts as well as in count seven must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cIV. The convictions for the offenses alleged in counts two through six, felonious assault of a peace officer, are against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cVI. There is insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction in count eight for possessing a weapon while under disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cVII. The conviction for vandalism is not supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">{\u00b6 49} When reviewing sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine \u201c[wjhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jerks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 50} The proper test for an appellate court reviewing a claim of manifest weight of the evidence is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c[T]he appellate court sits as a \u2018thirteenth juror\u2019 and * * * reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all the reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Felonious assault of a peace officer; sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence (case No. CR-485157)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 52} Defendant argues that the evidence does not sustain his felonious assault of a peace officer convictions because it does not show that he harmed or attempted to harm any of the officers during the July 10, 2006 chase. Rather, defendant allegedly \u201cset out on a path which he successfully completed \u2014 to get free of the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 53} Defendant was convicted of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), which states, \u201cNo person shall knowingly * * * [cjause or attempt to cause physical harm to another * * * by means of a deadly weapon * * Pursuant to R.C. 2901.22(B), \u201c[a] person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d Furthermore, R.C. 2923.02(A) defines \u201cattempt\u201d as follows: \u201cNo person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.\u201d In <em>State v. Briscoe </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 569, 574, 617 N.E.2d 747, we held that a criminal attempt \u201cis an act that is a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of a crime. A substantial step is one that strongly corroborates criminal purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 54} In case No. CR-485157, the indictments for felonious assault identified the deadly weapon as an automobile and the victims as peace officers Kubas, Spahia, Lucarelli, Barton, and Gomillion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">{\u00b6 55} In <em>State v. Young, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91007, 2008-Ohio-6158, 2008 WL 5050129, we upheld a conviction for vehicular assault when the evidence showed that although nobody was hit by defendant\u2019s car, the defendant was driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>erratically immediately following a domestic-violence situation. The defendant argued at trial that he was attempting to leave the scene. However, the state\u2019s witnesses testified that the defendant \u201crevved the engine, quickly drove backward then forward, made a wide turn, and drove the car up the curb, over the sidewalk, and through a fence,\u201d toward family members standing on the front porch of their house. Testimony also revealed that if one of them had not pushed another out of the way, the defendant\u2019s car would have hit someone. Id. at \u00b6 7. See also <em>State v. Cash, </em>Lucas App. No. L-03-1198, 2005-Ohio-1382, 2005 WL 681303 (holding that there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction of felonious assault of a peace officer when testimony showed that \u201call of the officers believed that appellant was attempting to hit their vehicles in order to escape. Furthermore, they testified that they believed they avoided a collision solely because they took evasive action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 56} In the instant case, Officer Kubas testified that during the high-speed chase, defendant swerved his vehicle toward the marked police car that Officers Kubas and Spahia were in, causing them to drive off the side of the road. Additionally, Officer Lucarelli testified that defendant\u2019s car swerved toward his police car, and Lucarelli had to take evasive action to avoid an accident. Finally, multiple officers testified that defendant drove his vehicle straight toward Officers Gomillion\u2019s and Barton\u2019s police cars, which were parked on the Eddy Road exit ramp of 1-90, that the officers moved their vehicles out of the way when it became apparent that defendant was not going to stop, and that defendant\u2019s car just missed hitting the vehicles. The evidence also showed that defendant was traveling between 70 and 90 miles per hour during this chase. Defendant did not present anything to contradict this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 57} We find this evidence sufficient to support a conviction of felonious assault, as defendant knowingly attempted to harm five peace officers with his car during a high-speed chase. Compare with <em>State v. Tate </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 444, 446, 8 O.O.3d 441, 377 N.E.2d 778 (holding that the state presented sufficient evidence of felonious assault \u201cwhere the record demonstrates that the accused pointed a gun at another person, but it is undisputed that the gun was unloaded, that the accused knew it was unloaded, and that the accused made no attempt to pull the trigger or to use the weapon in any other manner as a deadly weapon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\n<em>Having a weapon while under disability; sufficiency of the evidence (case No. CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 58} Defendant was indicted for having a weapon while under disability at the time of the July 12, 2006 collision. R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) states that no person shall have a firearm if the \u201cperson is under indictment for or has been convicted of any felony offense of violence.\u201d It is undisputed that on July 12, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>defendant was under indictment in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas ease No. CR-482489 for aggravated robbery, which is an offense of violence. Additionally, defendant had multiple felony convictions prior to the collision and at least two felony cases pending in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas on July 12, 2006. However, defendant argues that the state did not present evidence that he was aware of the indictment in case No. CR-482489 on July 12, 2006. The state does not respond to this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 59} In <em>State v. Clay, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 528, 2008-Ohio-6325, 900 N.E.2d 1000, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the state was required to prove that a defendant acted recklessly regarding his awareness of being under indictment as an element of having a weapon while under disability. <em>Clay </em>was decided while the instant case was pending on appeal and defendant did not raise this issue in the trial court. Therefore, a plain-error analysis applies. Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 60} On June 23, 2006, defendant was indicted in case No. CR-482489 for offenses committed on May 22, 2006. Subsequently, a capias was issued for his arrest, and the joint fugitive task force was brought in. When surrounded by police cars on July 10 and July 12, 2006, defendant attempted to flee the scene and assault the officers. A rational trier of fact could infer from defendant\u2019s conduct that he knew he was under indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 61} Furthermore, the charge of having a weapon while under a disability in case No. CR-485158 was tried to the court, and the parties stipulated to defendant\u2019s prior convictions. We find this evidence sufficient to show that defendant was aware, or was reckless regarding his awareness, of being under indictment or having been convicted of a violent felony as an element of having a weapon while under a disability, pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">\n<em>Vandalism; sufficiency of the evidence (case No. CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 62} R.C. 2909.05(B)(2) states, \u201cNo person shall knowingly cause serious physical harm to property that is owned, leased, or controlled by a government entity.\u201d Defendant argues that there was no evidence that the Chevy Tahoe driven by Det. Domonkos, which was damaged in the July 12, 2006 collision, belonged to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">{\u00b6 63} However, Det. Domonkos testified that on July 12, 2006, he was assigned to the FBI/Cuyahoga County fugitive task force and that he was working with other peace officers from the task force to apprehend defendant after he was seen at 18510 Euclid Avenue, in Cleveland. Det. Domonkos testified that he was operating a 1999 Chevy Tahoe, which he identified in pictures as the same vehicle that defendant\u2019s car ran into. Furthermore, Special Agent Torsney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>testified that Det. Domonkos \u201chad a good undercover vehicle, some type of SUV,\u201d on July 12, 2006, which was struck by defendant\u2019s car that day. We find this to be sufficient evidence to show that the Chevy Tahoe was owned, leased, or controlled by a government entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">{\u00b6 64} Accordingly, assignments of error III, IV, VI, and VII are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>Allied offenses (case No. CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 65} Assignment of error VIII states:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">(\u00b6 66} \u201cVIII. The convictions for counts five and six, assaults on a peace officer must be vacated because they are duplicitous of counts three and four, felonious assaults on the same police officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 67} R.C. 2941.25 prohibits an offender from being convicted of two or more allied offenses of similar import. The two-part test for determining whether crimes are allied offenses is as follows: (1) The elements of the two offenses are compared to see if they correspond to such a degree that the commission of one will result in the commission of the other; if so, the crimes are allied offenses of similar import; (2) the defendant\u2019s conduct is reviewed to determine whether the crimes were committed separately or under a separate animus; if so, the defendant may be convicted of both offenses. <em>State v. Blankenship </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 116, 526 N.E.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">{\u00b6 68} In case No. CR-485158, defendant was convicted of, inter alia, two counts of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), which makes it unlawful to \u201c[kjnowingly * * * [clause or attempt to cause physical harm to another * * * by means of a deadly weapon.\u201d The victims of these two counts were Special Agent Torsney and Det. Domonkos. Defendant was also convicted of two counts of simple assault in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A), which makes it unlawful to \u201cknowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another.\u201d The victims of these two counts were also Special Agent Torsney and Det. Domonkos.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">{\u00b6 69} The state argues that the felonious-assault convictions are based on defendant\u2019s attempting to cause harm using his motor vehicle, while the assault convictions are based on defendant\u2019s actually harming the two officers. Neither party cites any relevant case law to support the arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">{\u00b6 70} In <em>State v. Breeden, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84663, 2005-Ohio-510, 2005 WL 315370, this court held that simple assault in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A) is a lesser included offense of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). \u201cThe distinguishing element between felonious assault * * * and assault * * * is whether the actor used a deadly weapon.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 55. By committing felonious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>assault under R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), an offender necessarily commits simple assault in violation of R.C. 2903.13(A). Thus, the crimes are allied offenses of similar import, which meets the first part of the <em>Blankenship </em>test. See <em>State v. Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, at \u00b6 39 (holding that R.C. 2903.12(A)(1) and (2) \u2014 two subdivisions of aggravated assault \u2014 are allied offenses because \u201c[t]hese subdivisions set forth two different forms of the same offense, in each of which the legislature manifested its intent to serve the same interest\u2014 preventing physical harm to persons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 71} In reviewing the record to determine whether the crimes were committed separately or with a separate animus, we find evidence that defendant\u2019s car struck Special Agent Torsney and then ran into Det. Domonkos\u2019s SUV while the detective was getting out of the vehicle. These events happened one after the other, in the same location, after defendant accelerated his car, against multiple peace officers\u2019 warnings, in an attempt to flee from the authorities without concern for who or what was in his way. We hold that defendant\u2019s actions are one course of criminal conduct, as the state failed to show more than one animus. See <em>State v. Cotton, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 321, 2008-Ohio-6249, 898 N.E.2d 959; <em>State v. Minifee, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91017, 2009-Ohio-3089, 2009 WL 1819493, at \u00b6 106 (holding that two counts of felonious assault are allied offenses of similar import \u201cwhere the evidence establishes a single animus concerning the assault of a single victim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 72} Defendant may be convicted of one form of assault per victim because the \u201cconvictions arise from a single act and animus.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, at \u00b6 41. The <em>Brown </em>court further held, \u201c[T]he proper disposition of matters involving allied offenses of similar import committed with a single animus is to merge the crimes into a single conviction. * * * Thus, upon remand for merger and resentencing the State must elect which of [defendant\u2019s] two assault charges will merge into the other for purposes of * * * conviction and sentence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 42-43. See also <em>State v. Harris, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 373, 2009-Ohio-3323, 911 N.E.2d 882, at \u00b6 20, reaffirming the holding of <em>Cotton </em>that \u201cconvictions for felonious assault defined in R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and felonious assault defined in R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) are allied offenses of similar import, and therefore a defendant cannot be convicted of both offenses when both are committed with the same animus against the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 73} Assignment of error VIII is sustained. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to direct the trial court to vacate both the finding of guilt and the sentence in one of the assault convictions against Special Agent Torsney and one against Det. Domonkos.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\n<em>Admissibility of evidence (case Nos. CR-485157 and CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">{\u00b6 74} In assignment of error IX, defendant states:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cIX. Mr. Anderson was deprived of a fair trial by mention of the indictment in CR-482489 and by the repeated testimony of various law enforcement witnesses that suggested he had committed other crimes of a serious and/or violent nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 76} The court joined for trial case Nos. CR-485157 and CR-485158, which are both the subject of this appeal, along with case No. CR-482489, which has since been dismissed. As discussed earlier in this opinion, case No. CR-482489 concerned aggravated-robbery charges with firearm specifications. Before voir dire began, the court read the indictments in all three cases to the potential jurors. The next morning, however, the state dismissed case No. CR-482489 because the victims/witnesses refused to cooperate. The court asked if defense counsel had any objections. Counsel replied that he did not. Additionally, defendant did not request a limiting instruction pursuant to Evid.R. 105 admonishing the jury to disregard the indictment in case No. CR-482489. Therefore, we review this issue for plain error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 77} Defendant now argues that the court should have dismissed the venire and begun anew or advised the jury, once convened, that the aggravated-robbery charges against him had been dropped. To support this argument, defendant cites violations of Evid.R. 403 and 404, which preclude the admissibility of prejudicial evidence and evidence of the accused\u2019s prior bad acts or bad character.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 78} Two or more indictments may be tried together \u201cif the offenses * * * could have been joined in a single indictment.\u201d Crim.R. 13. See also Crim.R. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 79} Evid.R. 403(A) states, \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d Evid.R. 404(B) states, \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 80} At the time the court read the indictment in case No. CR-482489 to the jury, the charges were part of the three cases that had been joined for trial, and admissibility was proper. We focus on whether it was plain error for the court to fail to give the jury instructions to disregard the dismissed charges. This court ruled on a very similar issue in <em>State v. Morrow, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 79738, 2002-Ohio-5320, 2002 WL 31195362, at \u00b6 20-22:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>{\u00b6 81} \u201cMorrow argues the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury to disregard its voir dire comments regarding his prior conviction which formed the basis of the \u2018having a weapon under a disability\u2019 charge when that issue was being tried by the bench rather than the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cMorrow failed to request a jury instruction pertaining to his argument here; thus, we again apply the principles of plain error and examine all properly admitted evidence and determine whether the jury would have convicted Morrow even if the alleged error had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cEven had the court instructed the jury to disregard count four of the indictment and the court\u2019s statements thereon, we cannot reasonably conclude the outcome of the trial would have been different. Morrow argues statement of his past conviction prejudicially effected the outcome of the trial by putting his character in issue in violation of Evid.R. 404(B). We are unpersuaded because the trial court read the indictment during voir dire, not during trial. Thus, the trial court did not accept the statement regarding Morrow\u2019s past conviction into evidence. Because the statement held no evidentiary value[,] a jury instruction on the matter would have no effect. Accordingly, we determine no error exists and Morrow\u2019s second assigned error is without merit.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 84} Following our holding in <em>Morrow, </em>we find no error with the court\u2019s statements concerning case No. CR-482489 during voir dire, nor do we find error with the failure to give a limiting jury instruction regarding the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 85} The second issue defendant argues under this assignment of error is that the following testimony of law-enforcement officers was inadmissible under Evid.R. 403 and 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 86} Asked why the dangerous high-speed chase involving defendant was not called off by the authorities, Officer Legg replied, \u201cThe information that we had pertaining to the nature of the warrants that this individual was wanted on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 87} Asked to explain the purpose of the joint fugitive task force, Sgt. Sharpe stated: \u201cIt\u2019s a joint agency with the FBI, the sheriffs office, Cuyahoga County, Cleveland police, Metropolitan Housing Authority. And what we do is we go after the serious of serious felonies, murderers, armed robbers, those types of crimes.\u201d The colloquy continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cQ: People who are wanted for having committed those crimes?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cA: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cQ: Drawing your attention to the date of July [12]th of 2006, were you working with these individuals?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cA: Yes, I was.

We all work together in an attempt to locate and apprehend violent fugitives here in the city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 95} In <em>Huddleston v. United States </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 681, 691-692, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771, the United States Supreme Court set forth four sources from which a defendant\u2019s protection arises against unduly prejudicial evidence that might be introduced under Fed.Evid. R. 404(b):<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 96} \u201c[F]irst, from the requirement of Rule 404(b) that the evidence be offered for a proper purpose; second, from the relevancy requirement of Rule 402 \u2014 as enforced through Rule 104(b); third, from the assessment the trial court must make under Rule 403 to determine whether the probative value of the similar acts evidence is substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice, see Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on Fed.Rule Evid. 404(b), 28 U.S.C.App., p. 691; S.Rep. No. 93-1277 at 25; and fourth, from Federal Rule of Evidence 105, which provides that the trial court shall, upon request, instruct the jury that the similar acts evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted. See <em>United States v. Ingraham, </em>832 F.2d 229, 235 (C.A.1, 1987).\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 97} In the instant case, evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201cfugitive\u201d or \u201cviolent criminal\u201d status was admitted for a purpose other than \u201cto punish the defendant for the similar rather than the charged act, or [to show] that the defendant is an evil person inclined to violate the law.\u201d <em>Huddleston, </em>485 U.S. at 686, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771. The testimony was elicited, in part, to show defendant\u2019s state of mind in leading police on a high-speed car chase that resulted in defendant\u2019s convictions for assault and failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer. See R.C. 2921.331 (requiring evidence that a defendant \u201cwillfully\u201d eluded or fled from the police to sustain a conviction for the offense of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer). In other words, this testimony serves as a background or foundation for the trigger that set in motion defendant\u2019s course of criminal conduct. As such, the testimony was offered for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>proper purpose, and it was relevant in that it made the existence of a material fact, i.e., defendant\u2019s state of mind, more or less probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 98} However, Evid.R. 403 allows exclusion of relevant evidence if the relevancy is outweighed by the potential of prejudicial effect. While we are aware of the potential prejudice of testimony that defendant was wanted by the police, we find that this does not outweigh the probative nature of the evidence that is the basis of the cases before us. The chase and the collision would not have occurred but for defendant\u2019s status as a fugitive from justice. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 11, 679 N.E.2d 646, quoting 2 Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed.) 111, Section 276. (\u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is today universally conceded that the fact of an accused\u2019s flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself\u2019 \u2019 \u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 99} Assignment of error IX is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\n<em>Jury instructions regarding stipulations (case No. CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 100} Defendant\u2019s tenth assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cX. The trial court violated Mr. Anderson\u2019s Federal and State constitutional rights to trial by jury and due process when it directed the jury that it must accept stipulated facts as having been proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">{\u00b6 102} Defendant argues that the court\u2019s jury instruction regarding the parties\u2019 stipulation that the firearm found in defendant\u2019s car was operable and the drugs found in the car were crack cocaine was erroneous. The court stated the following: \u201cThese stipulations were reached between the State and the defendant and they are to be accepted by you as fact. No further evidence need be brought on these issues.\u201d According to defendant, this is a structural or plain error, because a \u201cfailure to submit for the jury\u2019s consideration the elements of the crime charged\u201d violates his constitutional right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">{\u00b6 103} In our view, defendant misconstrues the law. Due process requires that a jury consider all elements of the crimes charged, absent a valid jury waiver. See R.C. 2945.11 (\u201cIn charging the jury, the court must state to it all matters of law necessary for the information of the jury in giving its verdict\u201d). Consideration of the evidence by a jury is compromised when the state withholds or does not present evidence or when the trial court fails to instruct a jury regarding a stipulated fact. See <em>State v. Fatica </em>(Oct. 15, 1999), Geauga App. No. 93-G-1799, 1999 WL 959838.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">{\u00b6 104} In the instant case, the court properly handled the parties\u2019 stipulation. We reviewed a strikingly similar situation in <em>State v. Dowd, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80990, 2002-Ohio-7061, 2002 WL 31838695. In <em>Dowd, </em>the defendant assigned as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>error that \u201cthe court improperly instructed the jury that it must accept as proven the stipulation\u201d that a certain fingerprint belonged to the defendant. We noted as follows: \u201cA stipulation in law is nothing more than an agreement between counsel as to a fact which is not disputed and for which no evidence need be presented because neither side disputes that fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 105} The <em>Dowd </em>court held that there was no error in the court\u2019s jury instruction regarding the stipulation, which reads as follows: \u201cThere was an agreement as to the thumbprint that was compared, that it was the defendant\u2019s. That\u2019s all. * * * Now, no further evidence need be brought in on the stipulation. It was an agreed to fact. You are here to find disputed facts not agreed to facts. There is nothing to decide on agreed facts, you just have to accept it.\u201d See also <em>State v. McMannis </em>(Apr. 14, 2003), Stark App. No. 2002CA00258, 2003 WL 1874723 (upholding a preliminary jury instruction that \u201cif the attorneys agree to any facts, such agreement, stipulation, or admission of fact will be brought to the jury\u2019s attention and they may then regard such fact as conclusively proved without the necessity of further evidence of such fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 106} Based on our holding in <em>Dowd, </em>assignment of error X is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\n<em>Adequacy of verdict form (case No. CR-485157)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 107} In assignment of error XI, defendant states:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 108} \u201cXI. The verdict forms setting forth the peace officer specifications were inadequate to justify an enhancement of the underlying felonious assault convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 109} Specifically, defendant argues that the jury\u2019s verdict forms \u201cdo not reflect that the peace officers were acting in the performance of their duties\u201d and that the degree of all assault convictions should be reduced accordingly. The state does not address this assignment of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">{\u00b6 110} However, the jury\u2019s verdict forms in case No. CR-485158 for the \u201cfurther finding\u201d of each assault count read as follows: \u201cWe, the Jury, further find and specify that the defendant * * * did assault a peace officer while in performance of his official duties as charged in * * * the indictment.\u201d Therefore, this assignment of error does not apply to the assault convictions in case No. CR-485158.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">{\u00b6 111} In case No. CR-485157, the jury\u2019s verdict forms for the \u201cfurther finding\u201d of each count of assault read as follows: \u201c We, the Jury, further find and specify that the Defendant * * * did assault a peace officer as defined in Section 2935.01.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 2903.11(D)(1)(a), felonious assault is a second-degree felony; however, if the victim is a peace officer, the assault becomes a first-degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>{\u00b6 112} In <em>State v. Pelfrey, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 422, 2007-Ohio-256, 860 N.E.2d 735, at \u00b6 14, the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201cpursuant to the clear language of R.C. 2945.75, a verdict form signed by a jury must include either the degree of the offense of which the defendant is convicted or a statement that an aggravating element has been found to justify convicting a defendant of a greater degree of a criminal offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 113} <em>Pelfrey, </em>and most subsequent cases applying <em>Pelfrey, </em>revolve around verdict forms that state neither the degree of the offense nor an enhancing factor. For example, in <em>Pelfrey, </em>the defendant was convicted of tampering with records, which is a first-degree misdemeanor. However, the offense may be enhanced to a third-degree felony if the records tampered with were governmental in nature. Although the evidence showed that the defendant tampered with government records, the verdict form was silent on this aggravating element. No mention was made of the degree of the offense or the fact that the records belonged to the government. The Ohio Supreme Court held that the defendant in <em>Pelfrey </em>could be convicted of only the least degree of the offense, which is a first-degree misdemeanor. Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 114} In the instant case, we find that the phrase \u201ca peace officer as defined in Section 2935.01\u201d is a sufficient statement of the aggravating element to withstand scrutiny under <em>Pelfrey. </em>The jury verdict forms were adequate to convict defendant of first-degree felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 115} Assignment of error XI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\n<em>Ineffective assistance of counsel (case Nos. CR-485157 and CR-485158)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 116} Assignment of error XII reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cXII. Mr. Anderson received the ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 118} To substantiate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) the performance of defense counsel was seriously flawed and deficient and (2) the result of-the defendant\u2019s trial or legal proceeding would have been different had defense counsel provided proper representation. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 144, 25 OBR 190, 495 N.E.2d 407. In <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, the Ohio Supreme Court truncated this standard, holding that reviewing courts need not examine counsel\u2019s performance if a defendant fails to prove the second prong of prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Bradley. </em>\u201c \u2018The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 143, 538 N.E.2d 373, quoting <em>Strickland </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>{\u00b6 119} In the instant case, defendant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because he failed to object to various alleged errors as asserted on appeal. Specifically, defendant notes the failure to object to improper character evidence elicited by peace officers and failure to request a jury instruction regarding the dismissal of case No. CR-482489.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 120} Because we rejected these lines of argument in defendant\u2019s ninth assignment of error, we conclude that the same allegations do not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, at \u00b6 231 (holding that when a defendant \u201chas not pointed to any specific evidence that was improperly admitted because of counsel\u2019s failure to object,\u201d a defendant fails to establish ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 121} Accordingly, assignment of error XII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 122} The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the court is remanded for merger and resentencing regarding the assault and felonious assault convictions for Counts 3, 4, 5, and 6 in case No. CR-485158.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b578-9\">Gallagher, P.J., and Jones, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">.

The instant case can be factually distinguished from this court's recent opinion in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91701, 2009-Ohio-3101, 2009 WL 1819445. In <em>Johnson, </em>this court reversed a conviction for having a weapon while under disability because \u201cthe offense was treated as a strict liability offense,\u201d and the record was silent as to the defendant\u2019s mens rea. Id. at \u00b6 32. In the instant case, however, the record is replete with evidence of defendant's mens rea, i.e., that he had actual knowledge of his disabling condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">.
