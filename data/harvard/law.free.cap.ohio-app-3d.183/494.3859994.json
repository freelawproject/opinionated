According to the Wilsons, Ward and Stabile lied to them about the number of other investors, the number of orders that had been placed, and how their money would be used. They sued Ward and Stabile for fraudulent inducement and for violating state securities law. The trial court entered a default judgment against Ward. Following a jury trial on the claims against Stabile, the court granted Stabile a directed verdict on the fraudulent inducement claim. A jury found in favor of the Wilsons on their claim that Stabile aided and abetted Ward in selling securities to them in violation of R.C. 1707.44. Stabile has appealed, raising six assignments of error. This court affirms because the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the burden of proof, the Wilsons properly tendered their shares, Stabile forfeited his argument that the Wilsons\u2019 claim is barred by the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches, the trial court correctly refused to give an instruction on mitigation of damages, the jury\u2019s verdict is not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and the trial court correctly denied Stabile\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b62} After Ward lost his driver\u2019s license going through airport security in 2001, he developed a clear plastic document holder that a person could wear on a lanyard that would not have to be removed while passing through a metal detector. He obtained a patent for his design and formed a company called Skeye-ID to produce it. He thought he could sell the document holders to companies for use as a promotional device because their names could be printed on the lanyards.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 3} Ward had worked for a number of years selling computers to businesses. To promote his idea, he contacted Stabile, who he knew had contacts with a number of large corporations. He asked Stabile to promote Skeye-ID in exchange for a 20 percent share in the company. For financing, Ward contacted the Wilsons. Mr. Wilson also sold computers to businesses, and he and Ward had become friends while working on several deals. Ward offered the Wilsons a 15 percent share in Skeye-ID for $120,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 4} According to the Wilsons, while they were deciding whether to invest in Skeye-ID, Stabile also called them and pressured them to invest. He allegedly told them that he and another person were invested at 20 percent and that there was over half a million dollars invested in Skeye-ID. He told them that the company was seeking additional investors so that they could increase production to meet the big orders that they had received. Stabile allegedly told Mrs. Wilson that Skeye-ID had orders from Citigroup, Continental, Austin Travel, and Station Casinos.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">{\u00b6 5} The Wilsons eventually agreed to invest $120,000 in Skeye-ID, but they had only $75,000 available. According to them, they paid $75,000 to Ward, but he did not use their money to produce document holders. Instead, he gave $18,000 to Stabile and used most of the rest to pay his own personal expenses. After a few months, Ward and Stabile pressured the Wilsons for the other $45,000 they had promised. Stabile allegedly told the Wilsons that Skeye-ID had a deal to produce items in China, but they needed $45,000 up front. After the Wilsons told Stabile that they did not have that much, Stabile offered to cover the start-up costs if the Wilsons executed a promissory note for the $45,000. The Wilsons agreed and sent Stabile $45,000 over the next six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 6} Although Stabile used his contacts to promote Skeye-ID, the company earned only a few thousand dollars in income. Ward entered into licensing agreements with a couple of companies, but those agreements failed to produce much income. He eventually sold his patent to another company for $50,000 plus a percentage of whatever proceeds were earned from the patent. Skeye-ID, however, did not receive any additional income.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The Wilsons received tax documents from Skeye-ID for 2002 indicating that it had a small loss. They did not receive any tax documents for 2003 but were told that it was because the company had not made a profit. The Wilsons received $22,500 in 2004 after Ward sold the patent. According to Mr. Wilson, he started to become suspicious that something was wrong with Skeye-ID in September 2004. He therefore hired a lawyer to look into the company. In the spring of 2005, the Wilsons received Skeye-ID\u2019s financial statements and learned that they had been the only investors. In October 2005, the Wilsons wrote Ward and Stabile asking for them to return their investment. In May 2006, the Wilsons sued Ward and Stabile. They dismissed their case after Ward agreed to repurchase their stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 8} In October 2006, the Wilsons sued Ward and Stabile again because Ward had not repaid them. They alleged that Ward had breached their settlement agreement and that Ward and Stabile had engaged in fraud and violated R.C. 1707.44. In January 2007, the Wilsons obtained a default judgment against Ward. Their claims against Stabile proceeded to trial, and a jury awarded them $120,000 on their statutory claim. Stabile has appealed, assigning six errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">BURDEN OF PROOF</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 9} Stabile\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the Wilsons had to prove their statutory claim by only a preponderance of the evidence. He has argued that to be entitled to rescission of their transaction, the Wilsons had to prove their claim by clear and convincing evidence. In support of his argument, Stabile relies on <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118. In <em>Cross, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201c[i]n order to maintain an action to rescind a contract on the ground that it was procured by fraudulent representations,\u201d plaintiffs must prove their claim \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 10} Stabile\u2019s argument fails because the Wilsons\u2019 claim was under R.C. 1707.44(B)(4), not common-law fraud as in <em>Cross. </em>See id. at 475, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118. R.C. 1707.44(B)(4) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly make * * * any false representation concerning a material and relevant fact, in any oral statement * * * for any of the following purposes: * * * (4) Selling any securities in this state.\u201d R.C. 1707.43(A) provides: \u201cEvery sale or contract for sale made in violation of Chapter 1707. of the Revised Code, is voidable at the election of the purchaser. The person making such sale or contract for sale, and every person who has participated in or aided the seller in any way in making such sale or contract for sale, are jointly and severally liable to such purchaser, * * * for the full amount paid by the purchaser * *</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn civil cases * * * the burden of proof is ordinarily carried by a preponderance of the evidence * * <em>Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Ry. v. Frye </em>(1909), 80 Ohio St. 289, 88 N.E. 642, paragraph two of the syllabus; see also <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Young </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 306, 314, 731 N.E.2d 631. When a statute is silent regarding the appropriate burden of proof, this court infers that the common preponderance-of-the-evidence standard applies. <em>Wilburn v. Wilburn, </em>9th Dist. No. 05CA008740, 2006-Ohio-2553, 2006 WL 1409784, at \u00b6 9, citing <em>Felton v. Felton </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 34, 41-42, 679 N.E.2d 672. As this court noted in <em>Wilburn, </em>\u201c \u2018[h]ad the General Assembly intended that [an alternative] standard apply, it certainly knew how to specify [one].\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Felton, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 42, 679 N.E.2d 672; see also <em>Walden v. State </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 47, 53, 547 N.E.2d 962 (concluding that \u201cthe General Assembly intended to apply the usual preponderance of the evidence standard\u201d when it did not \u201cspecify a \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 standard\u201d). Stabile\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">TENDER OF SHARES</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 12} Stabile\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the Wilsons properly tendered their shares. R.C. 1707.43(A) conditions liability \u201cupon tender to the seller in person or in open court of the securities sold or of the contract made.\u201d Stabile has argued that the Wilsons did not comply with that requirement because they did not tender their shares to Ward, either in person or in open court. The Wilsons have argued that they satisfied the requirement because they tendered their shares to Stabile at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Crane v. Courtright </em>(1964), 2 Ohio App.2d 125, 31 O.O.2d 202, 206 N.E.2d 913, the Tenth District considered the same issue. In that case, Mr. Crane alleged that Mr. Courtright had assisted Mr. Richmond in selling him an interest in a lease. Id. at 128, 31 O.O.2d 202, 206 N.E.2d 913. Courtright argued that R.C. 1707.43(A) \u201crequires tender to the seller in person or tender <em>to the seller </em>in open court.\u201d Id. at 129, 31 O.O.2d 202, 206 N.E.2d 913. The court, however, rejected his interpretation of the statute. Id. It explained that although Courtright\u2019s interpretation was plausible, it was \u201cequally grammatically correct to say that the antecedent of \u2018in open court\u2019 is the word \u2018tender,\u2019 i.e., \u2018tender to the seller in person,\u2019 or \u2018tender * * * in open court.\u2019 \u201d Id. The court noted that under R.C. 1707.43, \u201cliability is imposed individually or \u2018severally\u2019 upon a person who has participated in or aided in the sale.\u201d Id. Under Courtright\u2019s interpretation, \u201cthere would be very little significance left to this imposition of direct liability upon a participant.\u201d Id. The court reasoned that \u201cif a participant is required to make restitution of the purchase price to the plaintiff, then he is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>proper person to receive the corresponding restitution of the security.\u201d Id. The court also noted that \u201cin the last paragraph of the statute it is explicitly provided that a <em>participant </em>may tender a refund to the purchaser and thereby avoid liability.\u201d Id. The court concluded that \u201c[i]f a participant can tender to the purchaser, then the purchaser ought to be able to tender to the participant.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 14} This court agrees with the Tenth District\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 1707.43(A) and concludes that the Wilsons satisfied the tender requirement by tendering their shares in Skeye-ID to Stabile in open court. Stabile\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 15} Stabile\u2019s third assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the Wilsons\u2019 claim was not barred by the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches. R.C. 1707.43(B) provides that \u201c[n]o action for the recovery of the purchase price as provided for in this section * * * shall be brought more than two years after the plaintiff knew, or had reason to know, of the facts by reason of which the actions of the person or director were unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe application of a statute of limitations presents a mixed question of law and fact. Determination of when a plaintiffs cause of action accrues is to be decided by the factfinder. But, in the absence of such factual issues, the application of the limitation is a question of law.\u201d <em>Cyrus v. Henes </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 623 N.E.2d 1256, reversed on other grounds by <em>Cyrus v. Henes </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 640, 640 N.E.2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 17} Stabile moved for a directed verdict on the Wilsons\u2019 statutory claim, arguing, among other things, that it was not filed within the two-year statute of limitations. The trial court denied his motion. Although a question of fact existed regarding when the Wilsons \u201cknew, or had reason to know\u201d that Stabile\u2019s actions were unlawful, Stabile did not ask for an instruction on that issue. R.C. 1707.43(B). Accordingly, he has forfeited his argument. See Civ.R. 51(A) (\u201ca party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instruction unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection\u201d). He also failed to raise the doctrine of laches at trial. Stabile\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">MITIGATION OF DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">{\u00b6 18} Stabile\u2019s fourth assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly failed to instruct the jury on mitigation of damages. \u201cA court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ordinarily should give requested jury instructions where they are correct statements of the law as applied to the facts in the case and where there is evidence from which reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the instruction.\u201d <em>Dunn v. Maxey </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 665, 668, 693 N.E.2d 1138. Stabile argues that a mitigation instruction was appropriate because the Wilsons did not do any due diligence before deciding whether to invest in Skeye-ID and did not help to promote the document holders. He also argues that they received $22,500 from the sale of the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe general rule is that an injured party has a duty to mitigate and may not recover for damages that could reasonably have been avoided.\u201d <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 270, 276, 719 N.E.2d 955. The trial court, however, correctly refused to give a mitigation instruction in this case. Stabile\u2019s argument that the Wilsons should have done more research before investing in Skeye-ID fails because the Wilsons did not have to prove justifiable reliance. R.C. 1707.44(B)(4) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly make * * * any false representation concerning a material and relevant fact, in any oral statement or in any * * * written statement, for * * * [s]elling any securities in this state.\u201d R.C. 1707.44(B)(4). R.C. 1707.43(A) provides that \u201cevery sale * * * made in violation of Chapter 1707 of the Revised Code, is voidable at the election of the purchaser.\u201d Accordingly, unlike with a claim for common-law fraud, the Wilsons did not have to prove that they were justified in relying on Stabile\u2019s statements to them. See <em>Burr v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 69, 23 OBR 200, 491 N.E.2d 1101, paragraph two of the syllabus (stating elements of common-law fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 20} Stabile\u2019s argument that the Wilsons could have mitigated their damages by promoting the document holders themselves also fails. \u201cMitigation is an affirmative defense in Ohio.\u201d <em>Young v. Frank\u2019s Nursery &amp; Crafts Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 242, 244, 569 N.E.2d 1034. Stabile did not present any evidence that the Wilsons could have avoided their damages by promoting the document holders themselves. Furthermore, it appears from the record that by the time the Wilsons learned the truth about Skeye-ID, Ward had sold the document-holder patent to another company. The Wilsons, therefore, could not have promoted the document holders if they had wanted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 21} Regarding Stabile\u2019s argument that the Wilsons\u2019 damages should have been reduced because they received $22,500 from Ward, this court has held that \u201c[t]he fact that [an investor] received a return on her investment * * * does not * * * alter the operation of the statute.\u201d <em>Crater v. Internatl. Resources, Inc. </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 18, 25, 633 N.E.2d 1212. In <em>Crater, </em>this court rejected the argument that the purpose of R.C. 1707.43 is merely \u201cto put the parties in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>position they had been in prior to the investment.\u201d Id. It concluded that Crater could recover the \u201cthe full amount\u201d that she paid for securities despite any income she had earned from them. Id. Similarly, the trial court correctly concluded that the Wilsons\u2019 damages should not be reduced just because they received $22,500 from Ward. Stabile\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">MANIFEST WEIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 22} Stabile\u2019s fifth assignment of error is that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. He has argued that the Wilsons failed to establish that he knowingly made a false representation concerning a material and relevant fact. See <em>State v. Warner </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 31, 564 N.E.2d 18, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201cR.C. 1707.44(B)(4) and (J) prohibit only affirmative misrepresentation; they do not apply to fraudulent nondisclosure\u201d). He also argues that the Wilsons did not prove that he participated in or aided in the sale of securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, at \u00b6 26, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the test for whether a judgment is against the weight of the evidence in civil cases is different from the test applicable in criminal cases. According to the Supreme Court in Wilson, the standard applicable in civil cases \u201cwas explained in <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co., </em>54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24. The \u201cexplanation\u201d in <em>C.E. Morris </em>was that \u201c \u2018^judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>C.E. Morris Co., </em>54 Ohio St.2d at 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578; but see <em>Huntington Natl. Bank v. Chappell, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 1, 2007-Ohio-4344, 915 N.E.2d 665, at \u00b6 17-75 (Dickinson, J., concurring). This court, therefore, must affirm if the jury\u2019s verdict \u201cis supported by some competent, credible evidence.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, at \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 24} Mrs. Wilson testified that in April and May 2002, Stabile called her several times to ask if Mr. Wilson and she were going to invest in Skeye-ID. She said that Stabile told her that Ward, another person, and he had invested money in Skeye-ID and that the three of them had invested a total of over half a million dollars. He said that they needed the Wilsons to come in as second-level investors \u201cbecause they had orders that were in place and being filled.\u201d He told her that the biggest order was from CitiGroup for over a million units. He also told her that Skeye-ID had orders from Austin Travel, Continental, and Station Casinos. Mrs. Wilson said that she invested in Skeye-ID based on what Stabile told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Mr. Wilson testified that Stabile also pressured him to invest in SkeyeID. According to Mr. Wilson, Stabile \u201cconfirmed that the business was doing very well, they had ongoing orders with a company called Austin Travel, they were going to order fifty thousand a month.\u201d Stabile told him that he had invested $160,000 and that Ward had invested $280,000 in Skeye-ID. He allegedly told Mr. Wilson that \u201cthey needed me to invest my hundred and twenty thousand so they could ramp up production for the CitiGroup order\u201d because \u201cthey were going to sell tens of millions\u201d of the document holders to CitiGroup.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 26} Mr. Wilson also testified that after he sent $75,000 to Skeye-ID, Stabile called him about the other $45,000 he had promised. He said that Stabile told him the same thing as Ward had \u201cabout ramping up the production in China and getting the product made and sending money up front to get the product actually started.\u201d When Mr. Wilson told Stabile that he did not have $45,000 at that time, Stabile offered \u201c[to] front the money to Skeye-ID\u201d if Mr. Wilson would pay him back in six months. Mr. Wilson further testified that after he finally received financial information about Skeye-ID, he \u201crealized that my wife and I were the only investors in the company * * * and that there were no profits or no sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 27} This court concludes that there was competent, credible evidence that Stabile made false representations to the Wilsons about the number of other investors in Skeye-ID, about the number of customers Skeye-ID had, and about the number of document holders Skeye-ID was selling. There was also competent, credible evidence that Stabile aided Ward in convincing the Wilsons to purchase shares of Skeye-ID. Stabile\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">POSTJUDGMENT MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 28} Stabile\u2019s sixth assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly denied his motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. He has not raised any new arguments, but has merely incorporated \u201cthe arguments listed above * * * by reference.\u201d He has argued that \u201c[i]n committing the legal errors and abuses of discretion outlined [in his other assignments of error], the Trial Court abused its discretion in not granting [his] Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and/or Motion for New Trial.\u201d This court concludes that since the arguments Stabile raised in his other assignments of error are without merit, the trial court properly denied his motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. Stabile\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 29} The trial court correctly instructed the jury on the burden of proof under R.C. 1707.44(B)(4), the Wilsons properly tendered their shares in Skeye<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ID, Stabile forfeited his argument that the Wilsons\u2019 claim is barred by the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches, the trial court correctly refused to instruct the jury on mitigation of damages, the jury\u2019s verdict is not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and the trial court properly denied Stabile\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.
