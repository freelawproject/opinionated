Starkey, appeals the August 21, 2008 judgment entry of the Ashland Municipal Court denying his motion to suppress evidence. Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">Statement of the Facts and Case</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">{\u00b6 2} On June 28, 2008, at 4:16 a.m., Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper David Keener was traveling westbound on County Road 1302. Trooper Keener received a request for assistance from the Ashland County Sheriffs Department regarding a white male who had stopped in a driveway, was believed to be intoxicated, and was possibly walking down the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-17\">{\u00b6 3} As he approached the intersection of County Road 1302 and Township Road 753, Trooper Keener observed a vehicle stopped in the roadway. The vehicle was located in front of the stop sign, but before the actual intersection with County Road 1302. After observing the vehicle not moving, Trooper Keener <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>became suspicious. He drove toward the vehicle and observed two people sitting inside. He activated his pursuit lights, then proceeded to approach the vehicle. Trooper Keener observed the occupants of the vehicle having glassy, bloodshot eyes, and he smelled a strong odor of alcohol inside the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant was later charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of R.C. 2925.14 and possession of marijuana in violation of R.C. 2925.11(C)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence, contesting the legality of the stop and search. The trial court overruled the motion to suppress. As a result, appellant entered a plea of no contest to the drug-paraphernalia charge, and the state agreed to dismiss the possession-of-marijuana charge. The trial court proceeded with sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant now appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, assigning as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cI. The trial court erred prejudicially by overruling the motion to suppress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">{\u00b6 8} There are three methods of challenging on appeal a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress. First, an appellant may challenge the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. In reviewing a challenge of this nature, an appellate court must determine whether the findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>State v. Fanning </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 1 OBR 57, 437 N.E.2d 583; <em>State v. Klein </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 486, 597 N.E.2d 1141; <em>State v. Guysinger </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 592, 621 N.E.2d 726. Second, an appellant may argue that the trial court faded to apply the appropriate test or correct law to the findings of fact. In that case, an appellate court can reverse the judgment of the trial court for committing an error of law. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 37, 619 N.E.2d 1141. Finally, assuming the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are not against the manifest weight of the evidence and it has properly identified the law to be applied, an appellant may argue that the trial court has incorrectly decided the ultimate or final issue raised in the motion to suppress. When reviewing this type of claim, an appellate court must independently determine, without deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard in any given case. <em>State v. Curry </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 93, 641 N.E.2d 1172; <em>State v. Claytor </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 623, 620 N.E.2d 906; <em>Guysinger. </em>As the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Ornelas v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911, \u201c[A]s a general matter determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, the United States Supreme Court determined that \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possible criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d However, for the propriety of a brief investigatory stop pursuant to <em>Terry, </em>the police officer involved \u201cmust be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d Id. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Such an investigatory stop \u201cmust be viewed in the light of the totality of the surrounding circumstances\u201d presented to the police officer. <em>State v. Freeman </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 291, 18 O.O.3d 472, 414 N.E.2d 1044, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 10} A person is seized in an investigatory stop when in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, by means of physical force or show of authority, a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave or was compelled to respond to questions. <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 741, 747-748, 667 N.E.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 11} Trooper Keener testified at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cA. We were \u2014 I was requested by the Sheriffs Department to assist, they had nobody available. It was a call of a white male that had stopped in a driveway, his vehicle was stopped in a driveway, it was reported that he was intoxicated and they, they didn\u2019t locate the subject at that time, they didn\u2019t know if he was on the property or if he walked down on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cQ. All right. So what were you doing then at 4:16 in the morning?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA. I was out looking for that male subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. All right. As you did so, was your attention drawn to any vehicular traffic in your vicinity?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. Yes it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ. Describe what you saw please, Trooper?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. I was traveling westbound on Country Road 1302,1 was approaching the intersection, of Township Road 753 and as I approached the intersection I saw the red Camaro, it turned out to be a red Camaro, there was a vehicle stopped at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. All right. Describe where it was stopped in relation to the intersection itself, just where exactly was it if you can do that, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. The entire car length- \u2014 it was about a car length past the Stop sign, it was between the edge of County Road 1302 and the Stop sign it was about \u2014 -just over a car length there in distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. So it was beyond the Stop sign, is what you\u2019re saying?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">(\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Was it actually into the roadway that you- \u2014 -that you were operating your vehicle on?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Now, if you would please, describe how far away you were from the vehicle when you made that observation, first of all?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. It was approximately a tenth of a mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. Now, in that tenth of a mile, distance, please describe to the Court what you observed the vehicle do?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. Nothing, if just stopped, it stayed in the same location.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. Well, what I want to find out from you, Trooper, is whether or not this vehicle had enough time to \u2014 this is a T intersection, I believe; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">{130}\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. Whether the vehicle had enough time to turn right or left at the intersection before your immediate approach, which would make it a hazard to make a right or a left turn?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. Yes, as I was looking for this person walking and I was going slow, maybe 25, 30 miles per hour, I was going pretty slow. I mean it was at least\u2014 about a tenth of a mile when I could first see the vehicle through the, I believe it was a cornfield, there\u2019s a field between \u2014 it would be on the south, it would be the northeast corner of the intersection. And from the time that I first saw the vehicle, it was stopped and never moved that whole time as I approached slowly towards it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. So when you got up to the vehicle, what did you do then, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-18\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. As a pulled up the vehicle, I could see there were two occupants, the driver and the front seat passenger. The driver, he looked to the left as I\u2019m approaching on the left, he looked at me, very quickly he looked to his passenger and then he just looked straight ahead and just stared straight ahead and didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t do anything, just stayed there then.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-19\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. After you stopped \u2014 and what was your purpose in turning on your pursuit lights here in this case, at this location?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. Ah, more for my safety, my vehicles was on 1302 the way, as I approached and stopped right there, my vehicle was out on the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ. All right. So you did what after you stopped and approached these \u2014 the occupants of this vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA. I walked up to the driver\u2019s side and made contact with the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ. Who did you find that person to be, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA. It was the Defendant, Brandon, Brandon Curtis.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cQ. Did you determine whether or not either of the individuals were the person \u2014 was the person that you were looking for?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cA. Trooper Karr did later on.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cQ. All right. You didn\u2019t\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">045}\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cQ. Well, describe to the Court then what observations you made of the occupants or the interior of this vehicle when you approached it?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cA. As I talked to the driver, his eyes were glassy, ah, they were very bloodshot, they were almost completely red and there was a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cQ. Coming from him or the interior of the vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-17\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cA. From him and the interior of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-18\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b255-19\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ. Okay. And again, if I understand you correctly, you\u2019re conceding the fact that where they stopped was necessary for them to look down the road because of the standing corn, you would agree with that?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-21\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cQ. So they had to pull at least a car length beyond the Stop sign to peek around the corner so that they could see the direction you were coming from?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-22\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-23\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-24\">{\u00b6 56} In <em>State v. Bacher </em>(2007), 170 Ohio App.3d 457, 867 N.E.2d 864, the First District Court of Appeals held that slow driving did not amount to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 57} \u201cIn this case, Officer Norton testified that Bacher\u2019s speed \u2018caught [her] attention\u2019 and that the only other driving pattern that caught her attention was that Bacher \u2018was hesitant to pull over [and that] it took him approximately two tenths of a mile to stop.\u2019 But that occurred after Norton had decided to stop Bacher. When asked if she noticed anything else about Bacher\u2019s driving pattern, Norton replied, \u2018[N]o.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cThe state contends that Bacher\u2019s slow speed, in combination with the late hour, amounted to reasonable suspicion. But we are unable to find authority to support that conclusion. Other jurisdictions have held that slow travel alone does not create a reasonable suspicion of [operating a vehicle while intoxicated]. Generally, an officer\u2019s suspicion is reasonable when a driver is traveling well below the speed limit and is engaged in other unusual driving behavior that would suggest intoxication, such as swerving, driving on the shoulder of the road, straddling a lane, crossing the center line, or weaving.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 59} Upon review of facts in this case as testified to by Trooper Keener, we find that the interaction between appellant and Trooper Keener rises to the level of an investigatory stop. As set forth above, Trooper Keener activated his pursuit lights prior to approaching the vehicle, and we find that a reasonable person, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, would have believed he was not free to leave. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s characterization of the event as a consensual encounter. Trooper Keener\u2019s only suspicion of criminal activity was the driver\u2019s unreasonable delay in travel, which we find is not reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in light of the totality of these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 60} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained, and the judgment of the Ashland Municipal Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b256-9\">Gwin, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b256-10\">Farmer, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b256-11\">Farmer, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4b\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">{\u00b6 61} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s position that this was an investigatory stop. It is my opinion that the facts sub judice within the area of a police-citizen consensual encounter are not governed by the 4th Amendment standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">{\u00b6 62} Specifically, there was not actual demand or show of force in this encounter. The trooper testified that appellant was already stopped at the stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>sign for an inordinate time. The trooper stopped his vehicle and activated the lights for his safety and not to seize or force appellant from movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 63} Once the officer approached appellant and smelled an odor of alcohol, the reasonable-suspicion test of <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, comes into play, and there is a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 64} I would affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
