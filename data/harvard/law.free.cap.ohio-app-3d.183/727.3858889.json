On September 6, 2007, Darrel Lee Lindsey was indicted on one count of possession of crack cocaine, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a felony of the fifth degree. Lindsey pleaded not guilty on September 20, 2007. On October 3, 2007, Lindsey filed a motion to suppress, which the trial court overruled on November 27, 2007, after a hearing. A trial date was set for February 11, 2008, and on January 29, 2008, at the final pretrial conference, a continuance was granted on the joint motion of Lindsey and the state. The trial court failed to journalize the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 2} A new trial date was set for April 7, 2008. At the final pretrial conference, the trial court continued the matter until June 9, 2008. Again, the trial court failed to journalize the continuance, but a review of the transcript of the pretrial conference reveals that the trial court indicated, \u201cPm only going to be in town the week of the 7th two day \u2014 actually three days. Pm going to be in Columbus. * * * Pve got to get some training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 3} On June 10, 2008, the\u2019 matter was inexplicably continued again by the court until June 30, 2008. This continuance was also not journalized. A review of the transcript of the \u201cdocket appearance\u201d reveals the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cTHE COURT: We\u2019re going to get a new date.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cMR. LINDSEY: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE COURT: Your trial is going to be a day, I think. Do you work everyday, Monday through Friday?</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cMR. LINDSEY: Five days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTHE COURT: Monday through Friday?</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cMR. LINDSEY: Yes, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Well, we need to get it far enough out so you can get a vacation day so that you cannot be in trouble, is that right? Because we can\u2019t have you in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cMR. LINDSEY: Yes ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll do the best I can and work whatever schedule you give me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">{\u00b6 12} On June 26, 2008, the state filed a motion for a continuance, indicating the \u201cprimary witness will be out of the state of Ohio during the entire week of June 30, 2008.\u201d On the date of trial, Lindsey orally opposed the request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>continue and asked the court to dismiss the matter. The following exchange occurred on the record on June 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. The Court would note that Mr. Lindsey has been more than compliant every time we\u2019ve asked him to come in to [sic] court. I have seen him come. He has always come and participated, done what was necessary to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe Court would also note that we have a time problem in this case. The time is to run within the next week or so, and the Court just does not have\u2014 we have noted frequently that trial time is at a premium for us. And, there just is no alternative date within this time frame to offer, nor do I think that having had this trial continued four times that it is appropriate for us to ask for a time waiver from this Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cSo, at this point, the State \u2014 not the State \u2014 this Court will dismiss this case with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 16} The state did not object to the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court\u2019s entry of dismissal provides, \u201cThis matter came before the Court for trial having been continued several times. The court, finding that the State is unable to go forward on the above-mentioned case, finds Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss well-taken and GRANTS the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWherefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the above-mentioned case SHALL BE DISMISSED with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">{\u00b6 19} The state asserts one assignment of error as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">{\u00b6 21} Crim.R. 48(B) provides, \u201cIf the court over objection of the state dismisses an indictment * * * it shall state on the record its findings of fact and reasons for the dismissal,\u201d and the state\u2019s brief appears to assume that the state objected to the dismissal of Lindsey\u2019s indictment, arguing that \u201can appellate court will only overturn a trial court\u2019s dismissal under Crim.R. 48(B) upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">{\u00b6 22} According to Lindsey, \u201cWhere the State failed to preserve an objection to a trial court\u2019s dismissal of charges at the time of dismissal, an appeal is without merit,\u201d in reliance upon <em>Akron v. Jaramillo </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 51, 646 N.E.2d 212. In <em>Jaramillo, </em>at issue was the trial court\u2019s failure to set forth findings of fact and reasons for a dismissal over the alleged objection of the prosecutor. The Ninth District found no evidence of objection and held that the court was not required to state its findings of fact and reasons for the dismissal due to the state\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>{\u00b6 23} We initially emphasize that \u201c[p]rimarily, it is the judge\u2019s <em>duty to hear and determine causes submitted to him for adjudication, </em>to apply the law to proven facts, and to enter judgment in accordance with the law and with the facts.\u201d (Emphasis added and citation omitted.) <em>Dayton v. Thomas </em>(Apr. 18, 1980), Montgomery App. No. 6567, 17 O.O.3d 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA trial court has discretion over the issue of dismissal. However, that discretion is not unlimited. Of the four courts * * * that have addressed this issue, all have agreed that since neither Crim.R. 48(A) or Crim R. 48(B) expressly provides for a dismissal with prejudice, a dismissal * * * with prejudice may be entered only where there is a deprivation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional or statutory rights, the violation of which would, in and of itself, <em>bar further prosecution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added and citation omitted.) <em>State v. Jones, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22521, 2009-Ohio-1957, 2009 WL 1124457, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b625} \u201cA prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case, * * * which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment * * *.\u201d R.C. 2945.67(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">(\u00b6 26} As noted above, the state failed to object to the dismissal, and failure to object waives all but plain error. <em>State v. Kier, </em>Montgomery App. No. 189118, 2002-Ohio-2619, 2002 WL 1042041.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 27} Having reviewed the record, we find plain error in the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Lindsey\u2019s indictment with prejudice. In <em>State v. Richter </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 395, 635 N.E.2d 1295, the Sixth District found plain error when the trial court accepted defendant\u2019s guilty plea to falsification charges and then sua sponte dismissed the matter, without objection from the state. In vacating the lower court\u2019s judgment, the Sixth District determined, \u201cThe state has substantial rights to have a criminal trial conducted according to proper procedure as established by the Criminal Rules, the United States Constitution, and Ohio Constitution, and applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised Code. Erroneous acts of a court affecting the substantial rights of the state can constitute plain error which can be noticed by the court when the state appeals.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 28} Further, the Third District Court of Appeals found plain error in the absence of objection when the trial court dismissed an action on the defendant\u2019s oral motion to dismiss, a motion that asserted two distinct legal theories such that it was inadequate to put the state on notice of its basis. <em>State v. Lautzenheiser </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 461, 602 N.E.2d 705. In reversing and remanding the matter for a reinstatement of the charges, the Third District found a \u201ctotal disregard for the proper procedure,\u201d such' that the \u201cprosecutor did not have a fair chance to present his case on the merits. It appears that substantial justice may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>not have been done. Therefore, it follows that this case as it presently stands represents a miscarriage of justice which should be corrected by the recognition of plain error.\u201d Id. at 467, 602 N.E.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 29} This court has also applied the doctrine of plain error to the benefit of the state. In <em>State v. Anderson </em>(Aug. 28, 1985), Montgomery App. No. 9099, drug evidence was destroyed, and the trial court, on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, determined that the state could not prove an essential element of its case and that trial accordingly \u201cappears to be a waste of time for all concerned.\u201d We concluded, \u201cDismissal in complete disregard of other evidence available to the prosecution is plain error, is an abuse of judicial discretion as well as a denial of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 30} We initially note that the trial court\u2019s oral rationale for dismissal, namely that speedy trial \u201ctime is to run within the next week or so,\u201d is not substantiated by the record. \u201cAny period of delay necessitated by reason of a * * * motion * * * made or instituted by the accused\u201d extends the time within which an accused must be brought to trial. R.C. 2945.72(E). Accordingly, Lindsey\u2019s motion to suppress extended his speedy-trial time.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 31} Further, speedy-trial time rights may also be extended by the \u201cperiod of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\u201d R.C. 2945.72(H). The trial court failed to journalize and thereby toll Lindsey\u2019s speedy-trial time due to (1) the joint continuance requested on January 30, 2008; (2) the court\u2019s continuance on March 25, 2008 (sought because the court would be in town three out of five days and yet was unable to accommodate a one-day trial during that period); and (3) the inexplicable continuance granted on June 10, 2008. Although the above continuances were not journalized, absent pre-indictment incarceration, this record does not affirmatively demonstrate a constitutional violation of speedy-trial rights, and the trial court accordingly had an obligation to \u201chear and determine [the] cause[ ] submitted * * * for adjudication.\u201d In other words, we see no constitutional or statutory bar to further prosecution that justified dismissal with prejudice. In conclusion, it is clear that the state\u2019s substantial right to have a criminal trial conducted according to proper procedure has been compromised, such that plain error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b6 32} Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b765-10\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
