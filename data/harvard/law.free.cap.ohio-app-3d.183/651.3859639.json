(\u201cButler\u201d), appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division (\u201cprobate court\u201d), in a statutory concealment action against Butler, in which the probate court denied Butler\u2019s motion to stay the concealment proceedings pending arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 2} We begin by reviewing the salient facts and procedural history in this case. On November 5,1993, Katherine A. Guzay established a brokerage account with Butler. In connection with the establishment of this account, Guzay and Butler entered into a \u201cCustomer\u2019s Margin Agreement.\u201d By way of background, \u201cmargin trading\u201d means the \u201c[t]rading of stocks whereby the customer trades partly on collateral and partly on money borrowed from the broker-dealer.\u201d Beyer <em>&amp; </em>Redden, Modern Dictionary for the Legal Profession (3d Ed.2001). \u201cMargin\u201d is defined as \u201c[c]ash or collateral required to be paid to a securities broker by an investor to protect the broker against losses from securities bought on credit.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 3} The agreement that Guzay signed with Butler, in which the term \u201cyou\u201d refers to Butler and the terms \u201cundersigned,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d refer to Guzay, provided, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">16. This agreement and its enforcement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio and its provisions shall be continuous; shall cover individually and collectively all accounts which the undersigned may open or re-open with you, and * * * shall be binding upon the undersigned, and/or the estate, executors, administrators and assigns of the undersigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">19. ARBITRATION The undersigned agrees, and by carrying on account for the undersigned you agree that all controversies which may arise between us concerning any transaction or the construction, performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us, whether entered into prior, on or subsequent to the date hereof, shall be determined, to the extent consistent with federal and state law, by arbitration, pursuant to the arbitration laws of the State of Ohio, before the American Arbitration Association and in accordance with its rules then obtaining, or before the undersigned may elect in the first instance whether arbitration shall be by the American Arbitration Association or by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or arbitration facility provided by any other exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and in accordance with its rules then obtaining, but if the undersigned fails to make such election, by registered letter or telegram address[ed] to you at your main office, before the expiration of five days after receipt of written request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>from you to make such election, then you may make such election. The terms of arbitrations includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">a. The award of arbitration is final and binding on the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">b. The parties are waiving their right to seek remedies in court, including the right to jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 4} At the end of November 1997, Butler held cash and securities owned by Guzay that had a value in excess of $180,000. On December 12,1997; the probate court issued a judgment finding Guzay to be incompetent and appointing her daughter, Davis Erwin, as guardian of Guzay\u2019s person and estate. Plaintiffappellee, Ohio Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cOCIC\u201d), issued a bond that was filed with the probate court and conditioned upon Davis Erwin\u2019s faithful and honest discharge of her duties as fiduciary pursuant to R.C. 2109.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">{\u00b6 5} At the time, Davis\u2019s husband, Joseph Erwin, was a stockbroker with Eisner Securities. He established an account with Eisner Securities for Guzay\u2019s assets. On December 15, 1997, three days after the institution of the guardianship, Butler received an electronic request from third-party defendant, National Financial Services, L.L.C. (\u201cNFS\u201d), through a national investment-account clearinghouse service, to transfer Guzay\u2019s account assets to the Eisner Securities account.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">{\u00b6 6} It has been alleged that following deposit of Guzay\u2019s assets into the Eisner Securities account, Joseph Davis transferred the assets to a National City Bank account in Davis Erwin\u2019s name, and the Erwins misappropriated the funds. Davis Erwin was eventually removed as Guzay\u2019s guardian, and Andrew J. Art was appointed the successor guardian. On August 21, 2001, Art initiated these proceedings by filing a complaint with the probate court alleging a concealment of the ward\u2019s assets pursuant to R.C. 2109.50 et seq. The complaint, as amended, alleged concealment on the part of Butler, the Erwins, Eisner Securities, National City Bank, Bank One, and PNC National Bank, and also named OCIC as a defendant. The probate court later substituted OCIC for Art as the plaintiff in the caption of the concealment proceedings because OCIC, as surety, faces liability on its bond in the event the guardianship estate is unable to recover the misappropriated funds. Subsequently, all defendants were dismissed, with the exception of Butler. Butler filed a third-party complaint against NFS seeking indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">{\u00b6 7} On August 5, 2005, Butler filed a motion to stay the concealment proceedings pending arbitration pursuant to R.C. 2711.03(A). OCIC opposed the motion. After a long delay, a magistrate of the probate court held a hearing on the motion on February 26, 2008. On June 12, 2008, the magistrate issued a four-page decision recommending that the probate court deny Butler\u2019s motion to stay pending arbitration. The magistrate\u2019s findings of fact consisted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>parties\u2019 stipulated facts, a copy of which was appended to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The balance of the decision contained conclusions of law. The magistrate concluded that the arbitration clause in the Customer\u2019s Margin Agreement pertained only to disputes involving margin trading and that since there was no evidence that Guzay had ever engaged in any margin trading, and because the facts underlying the concealment proceedings did not involve margin trading, the arbitration clause would not apply to stay the concealment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">{\u00b6 8} Butler filed objections that OCIC opposed. In a judgment entry journalized on August 26, 2008, the probate court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. The probate court did not address the question whether the arbitration clause applied only to disputes involving margin trading. Rather, the court determined that the arbitration clause was unenforceable because a concealment action was not within the scope of issues to which the signatories intended the clause to apply. The court rejected Butler\u2019s argument that this concealment action is, in reality, a common-law negligence claim; it determined that Butler had been on notice from the inception of the proceedings that the matter was a statutory concealment proceeding. The court went on to conclude that parties cannot use an arbitration agreement to divest the probate court of its statutorily granted power to adjudicate concealment actions involving assets belonging to a guardianship estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 9} Butler timely appealed and advances four assignments of error for our review, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">First Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">The trial/probate court committed error by failing to find that the claims made against appellant Butler Wick require resolution exclusively by private arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">Second Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">The trial/probate court committed error by not finding that the claims made against appellant Butler Wick are not within the parties\u2019 written customer account agreement and their contemplation of claims to be resolved by arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">Third Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-12\">The trial/probate court committed error by finding that the claims made against appellant Butler Wick are legally and sufficiently asserted and pled pursuant to Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2109.50-56 and Ohio Civ. R. 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-13\">Fourth Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-14\">The trial/probate court committed error by finding that Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2109.50-56 vest Ohio probate courts with exclusive jurisdiction to resolve asset concealment claims, and that this jurisdiction of Ohio probate courts is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>not waivable by the agreement of parties to otherwise privately arbitrate asset concealment claims and controversies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 10} We will address Butler\u2019s assignments of error out of order for ease of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 11} We begin with Butler\u2019s third assignment of error. The probate court denied Butler\u2019s motion to stay pending arbitration because it determined that the arbitration agreement could not divest the court of its exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine concealment actions pursuant to R.C. 2109.50. In its third assignment of error, Butler argues that the within action is not a concealment action. This fact, Butler argues, renders the probate court\u2019s analysis fundamentally flawed from the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 12} According to Butler, the complaint does not include all of the elements of a claim for asset concealment under R.C. 2109.50 and states only a <em>common-law negligence action. </em>Therefore, Butler maintains, in ruling on its motion to stay pending arbitration, the trial court should have treated the matter as a negligence claim not exclusively within its jurisdiction, and, thus, fully referable to arbitration. In the alternative, Butler argues that the complaint states a claim for <em>breach of contract, </em>which is also amenable to arbitration, and for which the concealment statute is not to be used as a substitute, in order \u201cto collect a debt, obtain an accounting or adjudicate rights under a contract.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Woods </em>(1959), 110 Ohio App. 277, 285, 11 O.O.2d 302, 167 N.E.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, Butler\u2019s third assignment of error requires us to determine the nature of the claim set forth in the complaint and whether the probate court correctly analyzed it as a concealment claim. R.C. 2109.50 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">Upon complaint made to the probate court of the county having jurisdiction of the administration of a trust estate or of the county wherein a person resides against whom the complaint is made, by a person interested in such trust estate or by the creditor of a person interested in such trust estate against any person suspected of having concealed, embezzled, or conveyed away or of being or having been in the possession of any moneys, chattels, or choses in action of such estate, said court shall by citation, attachment or warrant, or, if circumstances require it, by warrant or attachment in the first instance, compel the person or persons so suspected to forthwith appear before it to be examined, on oath, touching the matter of the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">The probate court may initiate proceedings on its own motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">The probate court shall forthwith proceed to hear and determine the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">The examinations, including questions and answers, shall be reduced to writing, signed by the party examined, and filed in the probate court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>If required by either party, the probate court shall swear such witnesses as may be offered by either party touching the matter of such complaint and cause the examination of every such witness, including questions and answers, to be reduced to writing, signed by the witness, and filed in the probate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2109.52 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">When passing on a complaint made under section 2109.50 of the Revised Code, the probate court shall determine, by the verdict of a jury if either party requires it or without if not required, whether the person accused is guilty of having concealed, embezzled, conveyed away, or been in the possession of moneys, chattels, or choses in action of the trust estate. If such person is found guilty, the probate court shall assess the amount of damages to be recovered or the court may order the return of the specific thing concealed or embezzled or may order restoration in kind. The probate court may issue a citation into any county in this state, which citation shall be served and returned as provided in section 2109.50, requiring any person to appear before it who claims any interest in the assets alleged to have been concealed, embezzled, conveyed, or held in possession and at such hearing may hear and determine questions of title relating to such assets. In all cases, except when the person found guilty is the fiduciary, the probate court shall forthwith render judgment in favor of the fiduciary or if there is no fiduciary in this state, the probate court shall render judgment in favor of the state, against the person found guilty, for the amount of the moneys or the value of the chattels or choses in action concealed, embezzled, conveyed away, or held in possession, together with ten per cent penalty and all costs of such proceedings or complaint; except that such judgment shall be reduced to the extent of the value of any thing specifically restored or returned in kind as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 15} In an often-cited case setting forth the elements of a concealment claim, the court in <em>In re Estate of Popp </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 640, 647, 641 N.E.2d 739, held that \u201cin a proceeding against a financial institution under R.C. 2109.50 for wrongful conveyance, it must first be established that there was a conveyance, made to a wrong party, after which all that is required is to show by a preponderance of evidence that the money belonged to the decedent.\u201d It follows, then, that \u201c[a] financial institution which conveys out money in its possession to an unauthorized individual * * * comes within the provisions of R.C. 2109.50 et seq.\u201d <em>Rinehart v. Bank One </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 719, 728, 709 N.E.2d 559; see also <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. v. Bank One </em>(Aug. 21, 1998), 2d Dist. No. 16981, 1998 WL 892255. Therefore, in order to state a prima facie claim for concealment under R.C. 2109.50, Art (later replaced by OCIC) was required to allege that (1) Butler made a conveyance (2) of assets belonging to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Guzay\u2019s guardianship estate (3) to a party unauthorized to take possession of the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 16} In the pleading entitled \u201cSecond Amended Complaint on Concealment of Assets,\u201d Art (later replaced by OCIC) made the following allegations against Butler in Count 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">23. Plaintiff states that Defendant Butler-Wick is liable to the Ward for negligently allowing the assets of the Ward to be converted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">24. Plaintiff further states that Defendant Butler-Wick improperly allowed the Ward\u2019s assets to be transferred and/or paid out of the Ward\u2019s accounts with Defendant Butler-Wick without the proper or necessary authorization from the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 17} The second amended complaint also contains an allegation that OCIC is liable to Guzay\u2019s guardianship estate for any and all losses suffered during Davis Erwin\u2019s tenure as guardian because OCIC is the surety that issued the bond for Davis Erwin\u2019s services. Finally, in the second amended complaint, Art (later, OCIC) prayed for, among others, the following types of relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">A. That citations be issued to Defendants * * * Butler-Wick &amp; Co., Inc. requiring each to appear before this Court bringing with them all records pertaining in any way to monies, accounts, or any other property received, converted, or paid out from the accounts of Katherine A. Guzay. To the extent that such monies, accounts or other property has been liquidated or converted into another form, Defendants be ordered to appear and deliver to the Court all records pertaining thereto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">B. That Defendants be examined under oath regarding the issues presented by this Complaint and that each be required to answer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">C. That this Court find that Defendants wrongfully obtained, transferred, and/or converted assets from the Ward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">{\u00b6 18} An action filed pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950 is governed by the Civil Rules applicable in probate court. <em>Randle v. Randle, </em>8th Dist. No. 88120, 2007-Ohio-1156, 2007 WL 766104, \u00b6 8. Civ.R. 8(A)(1) requires a complaint to include only a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the party is entitled to relief.\u201d Because \u201cOhio is a notice-pleading state, Ohio law does not ordinarily require a plaintiff to plead operative facts with particularity.\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 416, 2002-Ohio-2480, 768 N.E.2d 1136, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">{\u00b6 19} In our view, the second amended complaint in this case states a claim against Butler for concealment pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2950. It contains allegations that Butler improperly transferred the ward\u2019s assets to someone without authority to receive the assets. Where a surety alleges that a financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>institution conveyed away a ward\u2019s assets to another person, without proper authorization to do so, the action \u201cfalls squarely within the ambit of R.C. 2109.50 and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Probate Division.\u201d <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(Sept. 28, 2000), 8th Dist. No. 76303, 2000 WL 1434036. Accordingly, we reject Butler\u2019s argument that the probate court erred in treating the claim as one for statutory concealment when it passed upon Butler\u2019s motion to stay pending arbitration. For this reason, Butler\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 20} In its first and fourth assignments of error, which we will address together, Butler argues that the Customer\u2019s Margin Agreement states that the exclusive means for resolving the concealment action is private arbitration. It contends that the probate court erred in rejecting that argument and instead concluding that the arbitration agreement cannot divest the probate court of its exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate concealment actions. The parties agree that the issue whether the Ohio Arbitration Act applies to concealment actions under R.C. Chapter 2950 is an issue of first impression in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 21} The law pertaining to the enforcement of arbitration provisions is set forth in R.C. Chapter 2711. \u201cA provision in any written contract * * * to settle by arbitration a controversy that subsequently arises out of the contract * * * or any agreement in writing between two or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy * * * arising after the agreement to submit, from a relationship then existing between them or that they simultaneously create, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d R.C. 2711.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIf any action is brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, the court in which the action is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until the arbitration of the issue has been had in accordance with the agreement, provided the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with arbitration.\u201d R.C. 2711.02(B). \u201cThe party aggrieved by the alleged failure of another to perform under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any court of common pleas having jurisdiction of the party so failing to perform for an order directing that the arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in the written agreement.\u201d R.C. 2711.03(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA presumption favoring arbitration arises when the claim in dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration provision. An arbitration clause in a contract is generally viewed as an expression that the parties agree to arbitrate disagreements within the scope of the arbitration clause, and, with limited exceptions, an arbitration clause is to be upheld just as any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>provision in a contract should be respected.\u201d <em>Williams v. Aetna Fin. Co. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 464, 471, 700 N.E.2d 859</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Council of Smaller Ents. v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 661, 687 N.E.2d 1352, the Supreme Court of Ohio adopted four rules for reviewing decisions concerning a dispute\u2019s \u201carbitrability\u201d: (1) that \u201carbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit,\u201d (2) that the question whether a particular claim is arbitrable is one of law for the court to decide, (3) that when deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular claim to arbitration, a court may not rule on the potential merits of the underlying claim, and (4) that when a \u201ccontract contains an arbitration clause, there is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that \u2018an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 665-666, 687 N.E.2d 1352, quoting <em>AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of Am. </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 643, 648-650, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 25} Appellate courts generally review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration under an abuse of discretion standard. However, the de novo standard of review is proper when the appeal presents a question of law. <em>Davis v. Beggs, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-432, 2008-Ohio-6311, 2008 WL 5104808, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 26} Butler argues that the concealment action clearly falls within the arbitration clause and, therefore, must be resolved through arbitration because it arises out of or is related to the Customer\u2019s Margin Agreement, which covers all funds that Butler held for Guzay. It further argues that even though jurisdiction of asset-concealment claims is statutorily vested solely in the probate courts (as opposed to other courts), such claims are nonetheless subject to arbitration, especially in light of the general public policy favoring arbitration as a means of settling disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">{\u00b6 27} Butler maintains that parties to an arbitration agreement may waive statutory rights \u2014 including their right to seek relief from the probate court under R.C. Chapter 2950 \u2014 so long as such a waiver does not violate public policy. In support of this contention, Butler cites numerous cases in which federal courts have held that parties may waive, through arbitration agreements, their right to court adjudication of other rights conferred on them by statute (e.g., Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Age Discrimination and Employment Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>{\u00b6 28} It also cites the case of <em>Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati v. Aetna Health, Inc., </em>108 Ohio St.3d 185, 2006-Ohio-657, 842 N.E.2d 488, \u00b6 20, in which the court stated that statutory claims \u201care neither per se arbitrable or not arbitrable.\u201d It also cites several decisions from Ohio courts of appeals, in which those courts concluded that statutory claims may be arbitrated so long as the complaining party is able to vindicate its statutory cause of action through arbitration. On this basis, Butler argues that the probate court should have analyzed whether arbitration here would have impaired the aims of the concealment statutes. On that point, Butler maintains that the Customer\u2019s Margin Agreement calls for an arbitration process that would not limit OCIC\u2019s statutory remedies in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b629} In response, OCIC argues that to refer the concealment action to arbitration would undermine the sound public policy that underpins R.C. Chapter 2950. OCIC maintains that the probate court must act on a complaint alleging concealment of estate assets because the offense alleged is an offense against the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction and duty, as the superior guardian of all wards, to safeguard those incompetent citizens\u2019 assets. OCIC urges that such matters are not private disputes arising out of contractual or business relationships, but quasi-criminal matters that must be dealt with summarily by the probate court because the court is the only entity with ultimate control over a ward\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">{\u00b6 30} OCIC further argues that the primary reason cited for favoring arbitration over litigation \u2014 that arbitration is quicker and more cost-efficient \u2014 would not be furthered by referring this matter to arbitration. This is because, OCIC argues, the statutory process is itself designed to be a quick and efficient means of identifying and securing estate assets. OCIC analogizes this situation to cases in which this court has refused to allow an arbitration agreement to divest the Ohio Department of Insurance Office of the Insurance Liquidator of its considerable statutory powers over the assets of insolvent insurance companies.

Kelm </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 223, 749 N.E.2d 299, in which the Supreme Court of Ohio held that child custody and visitation are not subject to the parents\u2019 arbitration agreement because the state owes a duty, by virtue of its parens patriae relationship to children, to determine their best interests; and <em>Xenia City Bd. of Edn. v. Xenia Edn. Assn. </em>(1977), 52 Ohio App.2d 373, 377, 6 O.O.3d 425, 370 N.E.2d 756, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>which the appellate court refused to enforce an agreement to arbitrate the issue of which competing contract proposal to adopt in the event of a negotiation impasse, because this would abrogate the board of education\u2019s duties to negotiate its own contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 32} Our task in resolving Butler\u2019s first and fourth assignments of error is to determine whether it is appropriate to refer statutory concealment actions to private arbitration or whether, as in <em>Kelm </em>and <em>Xenia </em>and in the insurance-liquidation cases, private arbitration would vitiate the probate court\u2019s powers and duties as the superior guardian of incompetent persons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Critical to this analysis is an examination of the nature of concealment actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 33} In the case of <em>In re Estate of Black </em>(1945), 145 Ohio St. 405, 31 O.O. 31, 62 N.E.2d 90, a case involving proceedings under a section of the General Code that is analogous to R.C. 2109.50 et seq., the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the statutory scheme for concealment actions \u201cprovide[s] a summary means, inquisitorial in nature, to recover specific property or the proceeds or value thereof belonging to a trust estate, title to which was in a decedent at his death or in a ward when his guardian was appointed; or to recover property, belonging to a trust estate, concealed, taken or disposed of after the appointment of the fiduciary.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.

Jude </em>(Sept. 7, 1994), 2d Dist. No. 14227, 1994 WL 483514, quoting <em>In re Estate of Meyer </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 454, 457, 579 N.E.2d 260. In such a proceeding, \u201ca finding of guilty or not guilty is required with the imposition of a penalty upon a finding of guilty.\u201d <em>Black, </em>supra, at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 35} The purpose of a concealment action \u201cis not to furnish a substitute for a civil action to recover judgment for money owing to an estate, but rather to provide a speedy and effective method of discovering assets belonging to the estate and to secure possession of them for administration.\u201d Id. at 410-411, 31 O.O. 31, 62 N.E.2d 90, citing <em>Goodrich v. Anderson </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 509, 17 O.O. 152, 26 N.E.2d 1016; see also <em>Rinehart, </em>supra. In <em>In re Estate of Fife </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 449, 453, 58 O.O. 293, 132 N.E.2d 185, the Supreme Court of Ohio held as follows with respect to concealment proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">1. A proceeding for the discovery of concealed or embezzled assets of an estate * * * is a special proceeding of a summary and inquisitorial character and is quasi criminal in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">2. A purpose of such proceeding is to facilitate the administration of estates by summarily bringing into them those assets which rightfully belong there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">3. In such a proceeding it is the court which cites the person suspected of having concealed or embezzled assets to appear before it to be examined on oath touching the subject matter of the complaint, and it is the court which is in control of the examination, notwithstanding such examination may be delegated to and conducted by attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">4. Such suspected person is in reality the witness of the court, and the character and extent of his examination rest largely in the court\u2019s discretion, and, where it is apparent from the record that such discretion has not been abused, there is no basis for reversal in this respect by a reviewing court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">5. Such suspected person is the court\u2019s witness, and neither the complainant nor any other person interested in the trust estate and opposed to the claims of the suspected person is bound by the suspected person\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">{\u00b6 36} Having reviewed the language of R.C. 2109.50 and the decisional law concerning its purpose, nature, and operation, we reach the following conclusions. The statutory concealment action has existed since before the adoption of the Ohio Revised Code. Its nature bears little resemblance to a civil action, either in purpose or execution. It is not a matter of dispute between two private parties, such as (in this case) a broker and a surety. It is a summary, inquisitorial, quasi-criminal proceeding which, by the plain language of R.C. 2109.50, must be conducted not merely <em>in </em>the probate court, but by the probate court. In essence, the accused is one party and the court itself, as the superior guardian of the ward, is the other. The fact that an \u201cinterested party,\u201d such as a surety or a family member or heir of the ward, may bring a complaint to begin the inquisitorial process does not, in the long-held view of the Supreme Court of Ohio, transform it into a matter akin to a private dispute and a controversy thus amenable to resolution by private arbitration. The reasons primarily advanced in favor of private arbitration, which are increased efficiency and decreased cost, would not be advanced by referring concealment actions to arbitration. For all of these reasons, we hold that statutory concealment actions under R.C. Chapter 2109 may not be referred to private arbitration. Accordingly, Butler\u2019s first and fourth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Finally, we address Butler\u2019s second assignment of error. The trial court adopted, and overruled Butler\u2019s objection to, the following conclusion of the magistrate: \u201cA careful reading of the Margin Agreement indicates it is intended to protect Butler Wick in the event Ms. Guzay desired to invest in margin activity. There is no evidence to indicate Ms. Guzay ever invested in margin activity and the dispute at hand does not involve margin activity but rather deals with the access to her account by an outside broker.\u201d In its second assignment of error, Butler argues that the probate court erred in determining that the arbitration agreement between Butler and Guzay pertained only to margin trading and not to all transactions or transfers involving Guzay\u2019s assets. Because our resolution of Butler\u2019s first and fourth assignments of error renders it moot, Butler\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">{\u00b6 38} In summary, Butler\u2019s first, third, and fourth assignments of error are overruled on their merits, its second assignment of error is overruled as moot, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b699-6\">Brown and McGrath, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">. \"In addition to the general grant of jurisdiction found in R.C. 2101.24, probate courts are granted authority over guardians in all respects.
