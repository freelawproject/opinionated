In its brief, appellant argues that the danger was open and obvious and that it is immune as a political subdivision under R.C. Chapter 2744. After reviewing the facts of the case and the pertinent law, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">{\u00b6 2} On September 28, 2006, Edmond Dynowski (appellee) slipped and fell while walking down a ramp constructed of railroad ties soaked in creosote. The ramp was located outside the pro shop on the grounds of Grantwood Golf Course (\u201cGrantwood\u201d), in Solon, Ohio. The golf course is owned and operated by the city of Solon. The ramp was designed and installed by Grantwood\u2019s superintendent, who is a city employee, approximately 15 years ago. Appellee suffered a left-wrist fracture in the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">{\u00b6 3} On June 20, 2007, appellee filed a negligence action against the city of Solon.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">{\u00b6 4} On April 24, 2008, the city of Solon filed its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">{\u00b6 5} On September 24, 2008, the trial court denied the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The city appeals, asserting two assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 7} Assignment of error one</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">The trial court erred to the prejudice of the City of Solon and Grantwood Golf Course in not dismissing all claims against them on the grounds of Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2744, Political Subdivision Immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 8} We note at the outset that R.C. 2744.02(C) gives appellate courts subject-matter jurisdiction to address the merits of a denial of summary judgment based upon immunity. See <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878. See also <em>Pearson v. Warrensville Hts. City Schools, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88527, 2008-Ohio-1102, 2008 WL 660856.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Summary Judgment Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">{\u00b6 9} We review an appeal from summary judgment under a de novo standard. <em>Baiko v. Mays </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 1, 10, 746 N.E.2d 618. Accordingly, we afford no deference to the trial court\u2019s decision and independently review the record to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Northeast Ohio Apt. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 188, 192, 699 N.E.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">{\u00b6 10} Civ.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, a court must determine that \u201c(1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Duganitz v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 190, 191, 672 N.E.2d 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">{\u00b6 11} The moving party carries an initial burden of setting forth specific facts that demonstrate his or her entitlement to summary judgment. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264. If the movant fails to meet this burden, summary judgment is not appropriate. If the movant does meet this burden, summary judgment will be appropriate only if the nonmovant fails to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Political Subdivision Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">{\u00b6 12} In its first assignment of error, the appellant argues that the trial court erred when denying its summary judgment motion because it claims that it was entitled to immunity as a matter of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-16\">Determining whether a political subdivision is immune from tort liability pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744 involves a three-tiered analysis. The first tier is the general rule that a political subdivision is immune from liability incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>in performing either a governmental function or proprietary function. The second tier requires a court to determine whether any of the five exceptions to immunity listed in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply to expose the political subdivision to liability. If any of the exceptions to immunity in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply and no defense in that section protects the political subdivision from liability, then the third tier of the analysis requires a court to determine whether any of the defenses in R.C. 2744.03 apply, thereby providing the political subdivision a defense against liability. <em>Bounds v. Marc Glassman, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90610, 2008-Ohio-5989[, 2008 WL 4951036], at \u00b6 12, citing <em>Greene Cty. Agricultural Soc. v. Liming </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 551, 556-557, 733 N.E.2d 1141.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) states that political subdivisions are not liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with respect to governmental functions of the political subdivisions. Governmental functions include the construction, renovation, maintenance, repair, and upkeep of golf courses. R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(u)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 14} There is no question in this case that appellant is a political subdivision for purposes of R.C. Chapter 2744. There is also no question that it was engaging in what the legislature expressly prescribes as a \u201cgovernmental\u201d function for purposes of the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is therefore afforded immunity under the first tier of the immunity analysis. However, under the second tier of the analysis, appellee contends that the immunity exception at R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) for injuries resulting from physical defects to property applies to this case. See also <em>Coats v. Columbus, </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-681, 2007-Ohio-761, 2007 WL 549462.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) Exception to Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"AXs\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">[Political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but not including jails, places of juvenile detention, workhouses, or any other detention facility, as defined in section 2921.01 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 16} Appellee maintains that Grantwood\u2019s superintendent designed and installed the ramp without complying with applicable building codes and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>negligently maintained it by covering the ramp surface with a nonskid material and a handrail on only one side of the ramp. In support of this, appellee relies on his deposition testimony and his expert report to support his position that the ramp w\u00e1s physically defective. At his deposition, appellee testified that he had been golfing at Grantwood twice a week for approximately 20 years and used the ramp about ten times a year prior to his fall. He further testified that the ramp was slippery when wet, that he noticed nothing unusual about the ramp on the date of injury, and that he could not recall if the ramp was wet on the date in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 17} In addition, appellee presented evidence that the ramp was negligently maintained because it was only partially covered with a nonskid surface. He showed that a handrail was installed on only one side of the ramp, the side with the nonskid surface, leaving the deteriorated exposed side without a handrail. Further, appellee presented evidence that a change in Grantwood\u2019s policy required golfers to wear rubber-soled \u201csoft\u201d spikes on the course, which made the ramp more slick. He presented evidence that the superintendent knew that patrons were falling on the ramp as a result of this policy, and that after a separate incident involving a fall, one golfer personally warned the superintendent that \u201csomeone was going to get seriously hurt.\u201d Following this admonition, workers at Grantwood installed a partial covering of astro turf over the slick areas. However, the area where appellee fell was not covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant argues, both in its summary judgment motion and on appeal, that the ramp was not physically defective; that the decision to design, install and maintain the ramp, and the manner in which these were done, was discretionary; and that it is entitled to statutory immunity unless it acted in a willful or wanton manner. Specifically, appellant argues that the \u201cphysical defect\u201d exception found in the statute is inapplicable because the ramp at issue was not required to comply with local building codes and that, in any event, the condition of the ramp was open, obvious and admittedly well known by appellee. Under appellant\u2019s view, it is entitled to statutory immunity unless it acted in a willful or wanton manner. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 19} Appellee has failed to present sufficient evidence that would expose appellant to liability under the \u201cphysical defect\u201d exception to immunity at R.C. 2744.02(B). While it has presented evidence that the ramp in question violated certain nonspecific building codes, it has presented no evidence that the ramp was required to comply with those codes to begin with. In short, appellant cannot be in violation of a law it is not required to follow. Since the \u201cphysical defect\u201d exception found at R.C. 2744.02(B) of the statute does not apply, appellant is therefore immune from liability. We therefore need not reach the question of whether the third tier of the immunity analysis applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>{\u00b6 20} However, even if the \u201cphysical defect\u201d exception at R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) applied under the second tier, we find that the third tier of the immunity analysis would further protect appellant by virtue of its use of discretion regarding \u201cpolicy-making, planning or enforcement of its duties and responsibilities\u201d under the exceptions provided at R.C. 2744.03(A)(3). We also note that even if an exception to immunity under the second tier applied, appellant regains its immunity under subsection (A)(5) because appellee presented no evidence of wantonness, malice, recklessness, or ill will. Therefore, we find that appellant was immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 21} For these reasons, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Open-and-Obvious Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 22} In the second assignment of error, appellant argues that appellee\u2019s claims were barred by the open-and-obvious doctrine. Even if immunity did not bar appellee\u2019s claims, the open-and-obvious doctrine bars them.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">The trial court erred to the prejudice of the City of Solon and Grantwood Golf Course in not granting summary judgment in favor of Solon and Grantwood under the open and obvious doctrine as the presence and condition of the ramp was open and obvious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">{\u00b6 24} In premises-liability law, a business invitee is one who enters another\u2019s land by invitation for a purpose that is beneficial to the owner. <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 312, 315, 662 N.E.2d 287. A property owner owes an invitee a duty of ordinary care to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of hidden defects. <em>Paschal v. Rite Aid Pharmacy, Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 203, 18 OBR 267, 480 N.E.2d 474. Invitees, however, have a duty in that they are expected to take reasonable precautions to avoid dangers that are patent or obvious. See <em>Brinkman v. Ross </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 82, 84, 623 N.E.2d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">{\u00b6 25} Ohio courts consistently bar negligence claims where the allegedly dangerous condition is observable. <em>Simmers v. Bentley Constr. Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 642, 597 N.E.2d 504; <em>Anderson v. Ruoff </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 601, 654 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">{\u00b6 26} The open-and-obvious doctrine provides that a premises owner owes no duty to persons entering those premises regarding dangers that are open and obvious. <em>Sidle v. Humphrey </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 45, 42 O.O.2d 96, 233 N.E.2d 589, at paragraph one of the syllabus. The rationale underlying this doctrine is that \u201cthe open and obvious nature of the hazard itself serves as a warning. Thus, the owner or occupier may reasonably expect that persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>entering the premises will discover those dangers and take appropriate measures to protect themselves.\u201d <em>Bentley Constr. Co., </em>at 644, 597 N.E.2d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 27} A business ordinarily owes its invitees a duty of ordinary care in maintaining the premises in a reasonably safe condition and has the duty to warn its invitees of latent or hidden dangers. <em>Paschal; Jackson v. Kings Island </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 357, 390 N.E.2d 810. When applicable, however, the open- and-obvious doctrine obviates the duty to warn and acts as a complete bar to any negligence claims. <em>Armstrong v. Best Buy Co., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088. \u201c[I]t is the fact that the condition itself is so obvious that it absolves the property owner from taking any further action to protect the plaintiff.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13. The open-and-obvious doctrine satisfies the duty prong of a negligence claim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 28} When only one conclusion can be drawn from the established facts, the issue of whether a risk was open and obvious may be decided by the court as a matter of law. <em>Klauss v. Marc Glassman, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84799, 2005-Ohio-1306, 2005 WL 678984. However, where reasonable minds could differ with respect to whether a danger is open and obvious, the obviousness of the risk is an issue for the jury to determine. Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 29} In this case, appellant contends that appellee cannot create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the allegedly defective condition of the ramp was open and obvious, based upon his prior use of the ramp and his familiarity with the layout of Grantwood as a long-standing patron. Appellant also argues that appellee had knowledge of the condition of the ramp on this basis, having acknowledged in his deposition that he saw nothing wrong with the ramp and could not recall whether the ramp was wet on the date in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 30} Appellee counters that even if the danger is open and obvious, summary judgment is inappropriate in slip-and-fall cases where there are alleged building code violations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 31} First, as appellant points out, the ramp in question was not required to comply with building codes, as it was not a required means of ingress and egress. Second, Ohio law is clear that the open-and-obvious doctrine may be asserted as a defense to a claim of liability arising from a violation of the Ohio Basic Building Code. <em>Lang v. Holly Hill Motel, Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 120, 2009-Ohio-2495, 909 N.E.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Holly Hill, </em>the Supreme Court held that a building code violation does not provide an exception to the open-and-obvious doctrine in slip-and-fall cases. In so holding, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Because administrative-rule violations do not create a per se finding of duty and breach of duty, the plaintiff must present evidence to establish those two prongs of the negligence test. While a violation of the Building Code may serve as strong evidence that the condition at issue was dangerous and that the landowner breached the attendant duty of care by not rectifying the problem, the violation is mere evidence of negligence and does not raise an irrebuttable presumption of it. As is the case with all other methods of proving negligence, the defendant may challenge the plaintiffs case with applicable defenses, such as the open-and-obvious doctrine. The plaintiff can avoid such defenses only with a per se finding of negligence, which we declined to extend to this context in <em>Chambers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Id. at \u00b6 21, citing <em>Chambers v. St. Mary\u2019s School </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 563, 697 N.E.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 33} Thus, appellee\u2019s claim that the ramp violated certain nonspecific building codes is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cOpen and obvious hazards are those that are neither hidden or concealed from view nor nondiscoverable by ordinary inspection.\u201d <em>Terakedis v. Lin Family Ltd. Partnership, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1172, 2005-Ohio-3985, 2005 WL 1840022, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Parsons v. Lawson Co. </em>(1989), 57 Ohio App.3d 49, 566 N.E.2d 698. An owner or occupier of property owes no duty to warn invitees of open and obvious dangers on the property. <em>Sidle v. Humphrey, </em>13 Ohio St.2d at 48, 42 O.O.2d 96, 233 N.E.2d 589. The rationale behind this doctrine is that the open and obvious nature of the hazard itself serves as a warning, and that the owner or occupier may reasonably expect that persons entering the premises will discover those dangers and take appropriate measures to protect themselves. <em>Bentley Constr. Co., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 644, 597 N.E.2d 504; <em>Ruoff, </em>100 Ohio App.3d at 604, 654 N.E.2d 449. This doctrine applies regardless of alleged violations of Ohio\u2019s Basic Building Code. <em>Kirchner v. Shooters on the Water, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86919, 2006-Ohio-3583, 856 N.E.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 35} Here, the slope of the ramp, the lack of a handrail, and the slip-resistant material on only one side of the ramp are conditions readily apparent to anyone. As such, they cannot amount to a defect or hazard. See, e.g., <em>Kirchner, </em>id. In Ohio, negligence claims are barred under the open-and-obvious doctrine where the allegedly hazardous condition is readily observable. See <em>Ryan v. Guan, </em>Licking App. No. 2003CA00110, 2004-Ohio-4032, 2004 WL 1728519 (finding that the slope of a ramp, whether known or unknown, is not a hidden danger). See also <em>Terakedis, </em>supra (holding that the condition of slip-resistant material on a ramp is open and obvious). Further, Ohio law does not require that such conditions be actually observed by the claimant, only that they be observable. Id. at \u00b6 10, stating that \u201c[t]he dangerous condition at issue does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>not actually have to be observed by the plaintiff in order for it to be an \u2018open and obvious\u2019 condition under the law. Rather, the determinative issue is whether the condition is observable.\u201d Thus, appellee cannot now contend, as he does in his brief, that the slope of the ramp was too steep, that there should have been a handrail on both sides of the ramp, and that a nonskid surface should have covered the entire ramp. All of these alleged hazards were readily observable upon observation. Because of the open and obvious nature of these alleged hazards, appellant owed no duty to warn appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 37} Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for entry of summary judgment for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-7\">Gallagher, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b408-8\">Rocco, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\">.

Appellee is not required by Civ.R. 56(C) to prove his case; he is required only to point out evidence in the record that demonstrates Solon is not entitled to summary judgment. When I view the evidence presented in this case in a light most favorable to the appellee, I see the existence of genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 39} According to the evidence presented to the trial court, the city acquired the golf course in 1972. At that time, Gary Mazzeo was the general manager of the course, in charge of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">{\u00b6 40} In approximately 1991, Mazzeo decided that certain areas of the course needed updating for \u201csafety\u201d reasons, so he took it upon himself to replace the stairway from the clubhouse to the putting green. Without consulting any contractors, he and his employees installed railroad ties, placed lengthwise to form a ramp. He also had a handrail placed along one side.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">{\u00b6 41} Since the ties initially had a rough surface, they did not create any problems. However, Mazzeo knew that the creosote imbedded in the wood was \u201coily.\u201d He also knew that over the years, the ties became smoother with wear.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">{\u00b6 42} In approximately 1996, Mazzeo received a promotion to superintendent, in charge of \u201cthe whole operation.\u201d He was required to go to the board of trustees only for major projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>{\u00b6 43} In approximately 2002, the trustees decided to open the driving range for use \u201cyear round.\u201d To ensure that during the winter months people would not slip on his ramp, which was by then over 11 years old, Mazzeo decided to install a roll of \u201castro turf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 44} The roll, however, was not as wide as the ramp, so Mazzeo placed the material nearer to the handrail. Mazzeo knew that the ramp became somewhat slippery in damp conditions. He believed that most people who used the ramp walked single file, so each could hold onto the rail if the weather made the ramp wet. Mazzeo was aware that some of the users found the railroad ties he had installed slippery; he had been told by people that \u201cthey slipped on a railroad tie or something.\u201d Nevertheless, he did nothing about the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 45} Three years later, in 2005, the trustees decided that metal spikes on golf shoes would be prohibited at the course; this type of spike did too much damage to the greens. They notified the regular patrons of this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 46} One of the regular patrons was Dynowski. He had been using the course for approximately 20 years, so he was familiar with the physical layout of the course. However, he only occasionally used the ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 47} On September 23, 2006, Dynowski began walking down the ramp with a fellow golfer. Dynowski was next to his friend, on the outside and off of the astro turf strip. It was a cool and dewy morning. Dynowski slipped on the ramp and fractured his wrist as he attempted to break his fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 48} He subsequently instituted this action, asserting that his injury was proximately caused by Solon\u2019s negligence in failing \u201cto prevent, remove and warn against hazards and defects\u201d on the golf course. Solon subsequently filed its motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to sovereign immunity and the danger was \u201copen and obvious.\u201d Necessarily, this indicated that Solon acknowledged the existence of a \u201cdanger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">{\u00b6 49} Solon\u2019s motion was supported by copies of Dynowski\u2019s and Mazzeo\u2019s deposition, together with the affidavit of its own chief building inspector, Jack Clifford. Clifford stated that since the ramp was not a \u201crequired means of egress, the requirements set forth in Ohio\u2019s Building Code do not apply\u201d to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">{\u00b6 50} Dynowski filed an opposition brief, in which he argued that issues of material fact existed concerning whether Solon was entitled to immunity under R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) and whether, if so, immunity was abrogated by R.C. 2744.03(A). He attached to his motion copies of additional deposition testimony to demonstrate that Mazzeo had been placed on notice of the dangerous conditions of the railroad ties, together with an expert\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">{\u00b6 51} Civil engineer and construction consultant Marko Vovk provided a copy of his curriculum vitae and photographs of the ramp. He stated that the ramp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>had been poorly designed and had \u201cphysical defects.\u201d Construing his statements in a light most favorable to Dynowski, Vovk indicated the defects rendered it unreasonably dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 52} R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) provides that a municipality is liable for injury \u201ccaused by the <em>negligence </em>of [its] employees and that occurs* * *on the grounds of, and is <em>due to physical defects </em>within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in connection with a governmental function.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 53} The evidence presented raised an issue of material fact concerning whether the ramp constituted a \u201cdefect\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Mazzeo designed and built the ramp without any expert help, permitted it to deteriorate over the years, and was informed that the railroad ties he installed were causing patrons to slip and fall. These facts indicated an exception to Solon\u2019s immunity applied pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(4). Cf. <em>Kratochvil v. Mayfield Bd. of Edn., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81790, 2003-Ohio-1360, 2003 WL 1392605.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 54} Furthermore, the evidence presented raised an issue of fact concerning whether Solon had a defense, even in light of the exception, pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A). <em>Perkins v. Norwood City Schools </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 191, 707 N.E.2d 868. Mazzeo\u2019s testimony showed that the trustees gave him a wide range of authority when it came to policy-making and planning decisions involving the golf course. R.C. 2744.03(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 55} Mazzeo\u2019s testimony also indicated that, while he exercised his discretion when it came to acquiring and using \u201cequipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources\u201d relating to the golf course, he ignored the fact that a potential problem existed, despite being informed by patrons that the railroad ties were becoming hazardous. His admissions might be considered by a jury to be evidence of recklessness within the meaning of R.C. 2744.03(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 56} Based upon the record, therefore, I would find that the trial court correctly denied Solon\u2019s motion and would overrule Solon\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">{\u00b6 57} Furthermore, I would not address Solon\u2019s second assignment of error. This court has jurisdiction only to determine appeals brought by a municipality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. Since Solon\u2019s second assignment of error presents an issue of common-law negligence, this court has no jurisdiction to consider it. R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">{\u00b6 58} I would, accordingly, affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
