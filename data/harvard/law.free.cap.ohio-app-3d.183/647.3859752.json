We do not reach the merits of this challenge because the sentence imposed on Fields for cocaine possession was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">{\u00b6 2} In 2006, Fields was convicted upon guilty pleas to cocaine possession and having a weapon under a disability. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms totaling five years. He unsuccessfully challenged his convictions in his direct appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a timely R.C. 2953.21 petition for postconviction relief,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>motion seeking, alternatively, a \u201cnew trial\u201d under Crim.R. 33 or to withdraw his guilty pleas under Crim.R. 32.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 3} In May 2008, Fields filed with the common pleas court a second postconviction petition. He sought by his petition to withdraw his guilty pleas on the ground that the trial court had failed, as required by Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), to advise him of the maximum penalty for cocaine possession, when it did not inform him that he was subject to a mandatory fine. And he cited the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. </em>Beasley<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in support of his contention that res judicata did not bar him from presenting this claim in a late postconviction petition filed after our decision in his direct appeal, because the court\u2019s failure to impose the mandatory fine had rendered his cocaine-possession sentence void. The common pleas court denied the petition on three alternative grounds: (1) Fields\u2019s petition was late and did not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of R.C. 2953.23; (2) res judicata barred his postconviction claim because he had advanced, and we had rejected, this claim in his direct appeal; and (3) the trial court\u2019s failure to fine Fields did not prejudice him. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>The Cocaine-Possession Sentence is Void</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 4} Fields is right that his sentence for cocaine possession is void because the trial court did not include in the sentence the statutorily mandated fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2925.11(E) and 2929.18(B)(1) required the trial court to impose a mandatory fine upon Fields\u2019s cocaine-possession conviction. Fields could have avoided the mandatory fine only if, before the court entered the judgment of conviction, Fields had alleged in a \u201cformally filed\u201d and time-stamped affidavit and had \u201caffirmatively demonstrate[d],\u201d and the trial court had then \u201creasonably determined,\u201d that Fields was indigent and was unable to pay the fine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">{\u00b6 6} Fields\u2019s guilty-plea form reflected his \u201cunderstanding]\u201d that he was <em>not </em>subject to a mandatory fine. Neither the Crim.R. 11 colloquy nor his plea form disabused him of this notion. And the court did not impose the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">{\u00b6 7} But Fields did not meet the prerequisites for avoiding the mandatory fine. He did not, before sentencing, file an affidavit of indigency. Nor did he offer at the sentencing hearing proof of his inability to pay the mandatory fine. And the record reflects no finding by the trial court concerning Fields\u2019s indigency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>or his ability to pay the fine. Thus, R.C. 2925.11(E) and 2929.18(B)(1) required the trial court to impose the fine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">{\u00b6 8} The Ohio Supreme Court has long held, and has recently reemphasized, that \u201c[a]ny attempt by a court to disregard statutory requirements when imposing a sentence renders the attempted sentence a nullity or void.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the failure of the court below to impose the statutorily mandated fine rendered Fields\u2019s cocaine-possession sentence void.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\n<em>The Court Had, No Jurisdiction to Entertain the Postconviction Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">{\u00b6 9} We further conclude that the common pleas court properly declined to entertain on its merits Fields\u2019s postconviction challenge to his guilty pleas. His appeal from his judgment of conviction had divested the trial court of jurisdiction over his case, except to act in aid of the appeal or in a manner not inconsistent with our jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And because we did not remand the case, the trial court did not regain jurisdiction after we had decided the appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the common pleas court correctly concluded that R.C. 2953.21 et seq. did not confer upon it jurisdiction to entertain Fields\u2019s postconviction petition, because Fields failed to satisfy either the time restrictions of R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) or the jurisdictional requirements of R.C. 2953.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">\n<em>The Court Had Jurisdiction to Resentence Fields</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">{\u00b6 10} But a trial court retains jurisdiction to correct its void judgments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the court below did not include in Fields\u2019s sentence for cocaine possession the statutorily mandated fine, the sentence was void. And regardless of the jurisdictional bar to its consideration of Fields\u2019s postconviction claim on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>merits, the court should have vacated the void sentence and conducted a new sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed on Fields for cocaine possession and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Sentence vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b685-7\">Hendon, P.J., and Painter and Cunningham, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-17\">.
