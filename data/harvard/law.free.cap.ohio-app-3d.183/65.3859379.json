The trial court, without ordering a presentence-investigation report, imposed the maximum, consecutive terms of incarceration that Sawyer had agreed to as part of a plea bargain. On appeal, Sawyer now challenges (1) the voluntariness of her pleas due to judicial participation in the plea process and (2) the legality of her sentence. We affirm, but not without reproach.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Background Information</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">{\u00b6 2} Sawyer was indicted on two counts of felonious assault, second-degree felonies, arising out of an attack on Camella Harris with a box cutter. Harris received multiple injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">{\u00b6 3} The pretrial proceedings were extensive. There was a bill of particulars and discovery. At the request of defense counsel, the trial court ordered a competency evaluation of Sawyer. She was found competent to stand trial and later notified the state of her alibi defense. Also, while the case was awaiting trial, the court held a hearing on Sawyer\u2019s request for a bond reduction. The court rejected Sawyer\u2019s request after reviewing the allegations and Sawyer\u2019s prior record, including her juvenile adjudications and her recent misdemeanor convictions for which she had been serving a jail term.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">{\u00b6 4} The court was unable to proceed on the first trial date. On the second trial date, November 28, 2007, Sawyer\u2019s alibi witness, whom she could not locate, did not appear, and the case was continued until February 12, 2008. The transcript from the November hearing demonstrates that the state had offered to dismiss one count of felonious assault in exchange for Sawyer\u2019s guilty plea to the other (\u201cone-for-one\u201d), with no agreed sentence and the state\u2019s not taking a position on sentencing except to relay that the victim was requesting prison time.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">{\u00b6 5} The case was set for a jury trial on April 9, 2008. On that date, Sawyer waived her right to a jury. A short break ensued as the trial court dismissed the jury. During the break, the state and Sawyer resumed plea discussions. When the break ended, the prosecutor informed the trial court that they \u201cmay\u201d have reached a plea agreement during the recess. Defense counsel added to the record that Sawyer had asked him to continue to work out a deal after rejecting the one-for-one offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">{\u00b6 6} The new deal, which defense counsel called a \u201clast minute option,\u201d unequivocally involved a tendered plea to \u201ctwo Felony 4\u2019s\u201d \u2014 aggravated assault. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>He added, though, that \u201c[his] basic understanding is that what [they] have at this point is that there is no representations as to sentencing from either side, or from the Court on the plea that is tendered. There would be a sentencing \u2014 .\u201d Counsel was interrupted by the trial court, and the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe Court: No, I did say \u2014 I did say I think.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cDefense counsel: \u2014on this. I don\u2019t know if \u2014 she\u2019s not been to the penitentiary before, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re requesting a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe Court: Well, the deal is \u2014 originally the deal is \u2014 we talked about this. I know the family wanted more time. I think, of course, the police said they wanted four, the family wants four, and we talked about it. And we talked about, I threw out the figure of three. We talked about three. And she thought that three was okay. I think we asked you, Detective, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe Detective: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cDefense Counsel: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t think you had too much of a problem with three because she was like a first offender, and usually first offenders I give the minimum, which is two, since she cut her a couple of times, there was a scar, I thought she should get another \u2014 more. I was going to add another year. I thought that three was in line with other sentencings that I have given. That\u2019s kind of a deal, three. That\u2019s what we talked about, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cDefense Counsel: Are you doing that without a presentence investigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe Court: Yeah. The deal is \u2014 let\u2019s just do it, three years. It\u2019s three years. That\u2019s it, three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cDefense Counsel: I did represent\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t want to make any \u2014 I like everything on the record clear, so everybody understands what we\u2019re doing, you know. Three years. I thought it was a serious thing she did. She was a first offender, though. I think it\u2019s in line with other sentencings, you know.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cDefense Counsel: I just wanted the Court to be aware that I did represent to her that the plea on the one for one, that there was a real possibility of three. I did not represent to you\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Court: I\u2019m representing\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cDefense Counsel: \u2014this was the maximum exposure. On this plea tendered in front of the Court now it is three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-18\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe Court: Yeah. It\u2019s a Felony 4. It carries 6 to 18 months on each one; * * * It\u2019s been reduced from a Felony 2, which is \u2014 -a Felony 2 carries 2 to 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>years on each count. Technically, she faced 16 years. I felt three was the right figure. I thought she was going to plead to one of these felonious assaults. I was surprised when I saw assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIf everybody is okay with agg assault, I\u2019ll take it. What do you think, the police? I thought it was going to be felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe Detective: We had mixed feelings on it, Your Honor, but decided to go with the agg assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe Court: As long as she gets three years \u2014 I\u2019m okay with it as long as she gets three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe Prosecutor: Basically, that\u2019s what we decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe Court: I said if she pleads to felonious \u2014 I know you said four, we talked a little more. I thought, what about, let me see, first offender, normally I give first offenders the minimum, which is two. Since she did cut this young girl more than one time, a couple of times; twice I think on the arm and once on the head three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe Prosecutor: Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe Court: Four times. Okay. I thought, you know, she deserved then more than the minimum. I thought three. We tossed around three. Everybody seemed okay. You seemed okay with three. I thought it was a plea to felonious, now I see agg assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cI\u2019m okay with agg assault as long as \u2014 the bottom line is three years. She does three years. She gets 292 days time served. So she still has a little more, another \u2014 365 days in a year. So, she\u2019s got a couple more months to serve on the first year. And then she will get two more years after that, you know, she still has two more years to serve. So, is that \u2014 you okay with that as long as it\u2019s three years?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe Detective: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe Court: So, that\u2019s okay. Do you understand that it is going to be three years?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cDefense Counsel: I did not know it was coming to that. I thought we were having a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-16\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe Court: No point in wasting money.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cDefense Counsel: I understand at this point\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe Court: It\u2019s going to be three years. Her mom and she knows it\u2019s going to be three years?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-19\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe Mother: No, I did not know that.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cDefense Counsel: She was only aware of one for one. That\u2019s all I discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe Court: It clearly has to be three. I am not going lower than three years, okay. Okay. Well, now you know, so it\u2019s up to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cDefense Counsel: He\u2019s asking, do you want to proceed?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe Court: Your mom is not doing the time, it\u2019s up to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cDefense Counsel: She says yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe Court: That\u2019s why I do everything on the record. Do you understand that now, mom, she still wants to do it?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe Mother: She wants to do what?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe Court: She wants to do the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe Mother: Where will she do it at?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe Court: In prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cThe Court: Now we\u2019re talking to you (the defendant). You\u2019re 21. You\u2019re the one doing the time. Okay. That\u2019s what you want to do? You understand that it is going to be three years?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">{\u00b6 49} The court then completed the Crim.R. 11 colloquy and accepted Sawyer\u2019s guilty pleas to both offenses. The court provided Sawyer with her right of allocution before imposing sentence. At that time, defense counsel called the sentence \u201cfair,\u201d and Sawyer agreed. Defense counsel added, \u201cWe have no comment as to sentencing. It\u2019s a negotiated plea from two Felony 2s to two Felony 4s. There\u2019s not much else we can say, Your Honor. I think that we pretried this case extensively.\u201d The court then imposed consecutive 18-month terms for a cumulative term of three years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-18\">Voluntariness of the Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b104-19\">{\u00b6 50} In her first assignment of error, Sawyer claims that the trial court improperly participated in the plea-bargaining process, which ultimately caused her plea to be involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-20\">{\u00b6 51} The basic principles of due process require that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The absence of any of these elements \u201crenders enforcement of the plea unconstitutional under both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In reviewing the merits of Sawyer\u2019s due-process claim, we examine the record of the proceedings before the trial court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> taking into account the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">{\u00b6 52} The trial court\u2019s participation in the plea-bargaining process presents a \u201chigh potential\u201d for coercion, as the court\u2019s power is intimidating.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the participation may appear to interfere with, or actually interfere with, the court\u2019s role as an impartial arbiter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ohio courts are counseled to avoid participation in plea discussions for compelling reasons: \u2022 \u201c[J]udicial participation in the discussion can create the impression in the mind of the defendant that he would not receive a fair trial were he to go to trial before this judge; (2) judicial participation in the discussion makes it difficult for the judge objectively to determine the voluntariness of the plea when it is offered; (3) judicial participation to the extent of promising a certain sentence is inconsistent with the theory behind the use of the presentence investigation report; and (4) the risk of not going along with the disposition apparently desired by the judge may seem so great to the defendant that he will be induced to plead guilty even if innocent.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"> {\u00b6 53} In contrast to the approach taken in federal courts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ohio has rejected a rule that such participation per se renders a plea involuntary and thus invalid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[a] trial judge\u2019s participation in the plea bargaining process will be carefully scrutinized to determine if it affected the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s plea.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily, if the judge\u2019s active conduct could lead a defendant to believe he cannot get a fair trial because the judge thinks that a trial is a futile exercise or that the judge would be biased against him at trial, the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>should be held involuntary and void\u201d under the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">{\u00b6 54} Sawyer specifically alleges, \u201c[A]fter being told by the trial court that unless [I] served three years it would not accept the plea, [I] felt that [I] had no other choice\u201d but \u201cto enter the plea to avoid a harsher result by going to trial.\u201d In reviewing this contention, we are mindful that if Sawyer had gone to trial, she would have been exposed to a much higher penalty range, as she would have been tried for the original \u2014 and more serious \u2014 offenses, not the reduced ones. Recognizing the limitation to her argument under these circumstances, we hold that our ultimate inquiry in reviewing Sawyer\u2019s claim is whether the court\u2019s active participation could have led Sawyer to believe that she could not get a fair trial, including a fair sentence after trial, and thus whether the judicial participation undermined the voluntariness of her plea.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">{\u00b6 55} After our review of the record, we are not persuaded by Sawyer\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s actions undermined her free will to the extent that her plea was not voluntary in a constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">{\u00b6 56} In this case, the trial court did not initiate the plea discussion that resulted in Sawyer\u2019s plea of guilty. Rather, the plea-bargaining process had begun with the parties themselves, in the absence of the trial court, as the court was dismissing the jury. Clearly Sawyer had taken steps to acknowledge her guilt without reservation before the trial court became involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">{\u00b6 57} Moreover, the trial court\u2019s participation, at least at the outset, was due to the lack of a clearly defined agreement, as indicated by counsel\u2019s choice of these words: \u201cwe may have a deal,\u201d and \u201cmy understanding of the deal is.\u201d (Boldface added.) The court was enforcing Crim.R. 11(F), which requires that in a felony case involving a negotiated plea to a lesser offense, the terms of the underlying agreement upon which the plea is based be stated on the record in open court. The court was also seeking information to determine whether to exercise its discretion to reject the plea.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And the court had had previous conversations with the parties that had led it to believe that a term of three years had been previously agreed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 58} No doubt the court\u2019s participation moved from a clarification of the plea arrangements to a more active role. But the court\u2019s participation cannot readily be characterized as plea-inducing: the court promised to impose maximum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>consecutive terms if Sawyer entered the plea, and it did not make any threat bearing on her exercise of her trial rights if she rejected the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">{\u00b6 59} The court\u2019s participation in this case was not similar to the coercive judicial participation invalidated by this court in the recent decision of <em>Cincinnati v. </em>Smith.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Smith, </em>the trial court coerced the defendant into accepting a plea on solicitation charges by threatening to impose a harsher sentence for the probation violation after he pleaded no contest to the violation. \u201cThe trial court gave Smith an ultimatum: (1) try the soliciting charge to a jury and go to jail for 180 days for the probation violation or (2) plead no contest to soliciting and remain on probation. * * * When faced with 180 days in jail, Smith folded and pleaded no contest to solicitation.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court\u2019s threat to punish the defendant for exercising her trial rights was inherently coercive and rendered her plea involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">{\u00b6 60} This case is also distinguishable from our decision in <em>State v. Harper.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Harper, </em>we held that the trial court had abused its discretion by basing its decision whether to accept a no-contest plea on an inappropriate consideration\u2014 the denial of the plea would prevent the defendant from exercising the right to appeal \u2014 and the court compounded the error by repeatedly advising the defendant that any plea agreement had to be based on a guilty plea, adversely affecting the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s eventual decision to plead guilty.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At one point, the court told the defendant, \u201cOn a plea of no contest, you know, all deals are off as far as the minimum sentence is concerned, since he\u2019s going to appeal.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 61} In this case, the trial court\u2019s unstated motivation for its involvement was to make sure that Sawyer could receive the term of incarceration warranted by the attack \u2014 at least three years \u2014 a term that might not have been lawful with reduced charges absent the sentencing agreement, because of an allied-offenses issue. Notably, the defendant has no constitutional right to plead guilty to an offense,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the trial court has discretion to accept or reject a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>change in plea.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">{\u00b6 62} Finally, the trial court\u2019s participation was not similar to the pervasive participation criticized by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. </em>Byrd.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Byrd, </em>a capital case, the trial court engaged extensively in plea negotiations involving the defendant, and as a result, \u201c[i]t appeared as if the judge had joined * * * with the prosecution in deciding that the appellant was guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition to initiating and negotiating the bargain with the prosecutor, the court contacted the defendant\u2019s relatives and encouraged them to pressure him to plead guilty,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and it spoke to the defendant, without his attorney present, in chambers, where it told Byrd that the deal was \u201cpretty good.\u201d The court also told Byrd that, if he chose not to plead guilty, he would be in for a long trial that would not be \u201c \u2018a picnic, but neither is killing somebody a picnic.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">{\u00b6 63} In addition, the record supported Byrd\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s involvement had coerced him to accept the plea. Defense counsel represented in the postconviction proceeding that Byrd\u2019s desire to have a trial had been unwavering, from the time that Byrd had been charged until the time that counsel was notified by the court of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">{\u00b6 64} The Ohio Supreme Court held that Byrd\u2019s plea had been given involuntarily because of the intense pressure on Byrd to plead guilty, initiated by the trial court, coupled with Byrd\u2019s drug addiction and his inability to consult counsel.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The case before us does not involve the circumstances that persuaded the court in <em>Byrd </em>that the plea was tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">{\u00b6 65} We do not condone the later aspect of the trial court\u2019s participation, but the record in this case does not compel a conclusion that Sawyer\u2019s plea had been given involuntarily because of the court\u2019s active conduct. Rather, the record indicates that Sawyer entered the plea to reduce her sentencing exposure from two to 16 years of incarceration to three. Importantly, she had pressed for a plea bargain before the court\u2019s challenged participation. It is also noteworthy that Sawyer did not mention her alibi witness at the change-of-plea hearing. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>subpoena issued to this witness requesting personal service had been returned as undeliverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 66} Sawyer contends also that although she was found competent to stand trial, she had \u201cmental issues\u201d that we should consider in evaluating the voluntariness of her plea. We have considered these, along with the totality of the circumstances, in arriving at our conclusion. Sawyer was represented by counsel, and the trial court personally and carefully advised her in accordance with Crim.R. 11(C) before finding her plea knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Under these facts, we arrive at the same conclusion that the trial court reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Sentencing Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 67} Sawyer challenges the sentence imposed by the trial court for two reasons: (1) the court imposed the sentence without ordering a presentence investigation, and (2) the court sentenced her on allied offenses of similar import. But R.C. 2953.08(D) prevents our review of these sentencing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">{\u00b6 68} R.C. 2953.08(D) provides exceptions to a defendant\u2019s right to appeal a felony sentence.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) precludes appellate review of an agreed sentence. An agreed sentence is one that has been jointly recommended by the defendant and the state, is imposed by the sentencing court, and is \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d This court has previously held that a sentence is \u201cauthorized by law\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), and is therefore not appealable, so long as it is within the statutory range of possible sentences and does not exceed the maximum term authorized by statute for the offense.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he General Assembly intended a jointly agreed-upon sentence to be protected from review precisely because the parties agreed that the sentence is appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">{\u00b6 69} R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) bars our review of Sawyer\u2019s sentencing issues. In reaching this conclusion, we first determine that Sawyer and the prosecutor \u201cjointly recommended\u201d the sentence as contemplated in R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), where the prosecutor thought that the deal involved a recommended three-year sentence, and where Sawyer provided express consent to this sentence and later entered her guilty plea, knowing that it involved her agreement to the sentence. Our determination is bolstered by Sawyer\u2019s conduct during sentencing- \u2014 -she did not offer any objection to the sentence and characterized it as fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>{\u00b6 70} And in addition to the sentence\u2019s being jointly recommended, the sentencing court imposed the jointly recommended sentence. Finally, the sentence imposed did not exceed the maximum term statutorily allowed for the offenses and thus \u201cwas authorized by law.\u201d Consequently, R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) places the sentence beyond our review, and we are without jurisdiction to vacate it. In light of this conclusion, we overrule the second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">{\u00b6 71} We note that our narrow definition of the phrase \u201cauthorized by law\u201d in R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) comports with decisions from several appellate districts,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> but that it conflicts with the Second Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Underwood.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> Underwood </em>recently held that a defendant\u2019s agreed sentence was not \u201cauthorized by law,\u201d even though it was within the statutory range, when the trial court failed to merge allied offenses of similar import. Thus, <em>Underwood </em>held that appellate review of the sentences was not precluded by R.C. 2953.08(D).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court will ultimately resolve this conflict.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 72} We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-8\">Hendon, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\">.
