Puckett and Deborah J. Puckett, appeal a decision of the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas granting plaintiffsappellees, Roger McCumbers and Nancy McCumbers, an easement by estoppel over a driveway on a strip of land owned by the Pucketts.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">{\u00b6 2} Roger McCumbers and his wife, Nancy McCumbers, own real property located in the village of Good Hope in Fayette County, Ohio. Gary Puckett and his wife, Deborah Puckett, own the real property immediately south of the McCumberses\u2019 property, as well as the strip of land in question that runs along the eastern boundary of the McCumberses\u2019 property and extends to the Pucketts\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">{\u00b6 3} The strip of land is approximately 33 feet wide and 265 feet in length. As the strip\u2019s northern end connects to a public road, i.e., Washington-Good Hope Road, the strip provides both parties with ingress and egress to their respective properties. In 1979, the Pucketts installed a gravel driveway on the strip, and the McCumberses\u2019 predecessors in title shared the costs of installing it. In 2000, the Pucketts paved the gravel driveway with blacktop.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">{\u00b6 4} Nancy and Deborah are first cousins, and at one time, the McCumberses and the Pucketts were good friends and good neighbors. Among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>they visited with one another\u2019s families, shared a garden, and vacationed together. The McCumberses even had Gary build an extension on their house, which the McCumberses used for a kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">{\u00b6 5} In 2004, Gary agreed to build a new garage for the McCumberses for $3,000. The garage was to be located along the eastern boundary of the McCumberses\u2019 property and adjacent to the paved driveway on the Pucketts\u2019 strip of land. In May 2005, with 80 to 90 percent of the garage completed, Gary quit work on the project. The McCumberses hired someone else to complete the garage and then paved the approach to the garage so that it connected to the driveway on the strip of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">{\u00b6 6} In 2006, a dispute arose between the parties regarding the location of their mail boxes. As a result, Gary threatened to \u201cfence in\u201d the McCumberses by erecting a fence along the paved driveway to deny them access to their new garage. In June 2006, the McCumberses filed a complaint in the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas, alleging that they had obtained an easement over the driveway on the Pucketts\u2019 strip of land because the McCumberses and their predecessors in title have used this portion of the Pucketts\u2019 property in an \u201copen, notorious and continuous\u201d manner since at least 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">{\u00b6 7} A three-day trial was held on the matter in May and June 2007. Both parties filed posttrial briefs, with the McCumberses arguing that they were entitled to an easement over the Pucketts\u2019 driveway under the doctrines of adverse possession, prescriptive easement, and/or easement by estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court issued a decision finding against the McCumberses on their claim for adverse possession, but for them on their claim for an easement by estoppel. The trial court granted the McCumberses \u201can appurtenant easement by estoppel for purposes of ingress and egress to [their] property\u201d involving \u201c[t]he area fronting on the Washington-Good Hope Road with a surveyed width of 33.80 feet and continuing in a southerly direction to a point which shall be 16.0 feet south of the structure denoted as a frame garage with the dimensions of 36.3\u2019 x 30.2\u2019 [i.e., the McCumberses\u2019 new garage].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">{\u00b6 9} The Pucketts now appeal, assigning the following as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">{\u00b6 10} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellants in finding that an easement by estoppel was created by the actions of Gary Puckett.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">{\u00b6 12} The Pucketts argue that the trial court erred in finding that the McCumberses were entitled to an easement by estoppel over the driveway on the Pucketts\u2019 strip of land because there was no evidence presented to show that they made a misrepresentation to the McCumberses or engaged in a \u201cfraudulent failure to speak.\u201d The McCumberses counter by arguing that there was suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>cient evidence presented to support a finding that they were entitled to either an easement by estoppel or a \u201cprescriptive easement\u201d over the driveway on the Pucketts\u2019 strip of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">{\u00b6 13} When reviewing a trial court\u2019s determination as to whether an easement exists, an appellate court will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision as being against the manifest weight of the evidence so long as it is based on some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case. <em>Cadwallader v. Scovanner, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-4166, 896 N.E.2d 748, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">{\u00b6 14} An \u201ceasement\u201d is a property interest in the land of another that allows the owner of the easement a limited use of the land in which the interest exists. <em>Colburn v. Maynard </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 246, 253, 675 N.E.2d 1333. An easement has also been defined as a right that the owner of one estate, referred to as the \u201cdominant estate,\u201d may exercise for his benefit in or over another\u2019s estate, referred to as the \u201cservient estate.\u201d <em>1st Natl. Bank v. Mountain Agency, L.L.C., </em>Clermont App. No. CA2008-05-056, 2009-Ohio-2202, 2009 WL 1278429, \u00b6 14. An easement can be created by an express or implied grant, by prescription, or by estoppel. Id., citing <em>Trattar v. Rausch </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 286, 43 O.O. 186, 95 N.E.2d 685, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">{\u00b6 15} Initially, we reject the McCumberses\u2019 prescriptive easement claim. \u201cPrescriptive easements are not favored in law, because the legal titleholder forfeits rights to another without compensation.\u201d <em>Cadwallader, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-4166, 896 N.E.2d 748, at \u00b6 55. To prove that a prescriptive easement exists, a party must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he has used the property (1) openly, (2) notoriously, (3) adversely to the property rights of the servient estate\u2019s owner, (4) continuously, and (5) for a period of at least 21 years. Id. \u201cAdverse use\u201d can be shown only when a party uses the land \u201cwithout permission and inconsistent with the rights of the property owner.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 57. Moreover, a party\u2019s <em>permissive use </em>of land cannot ripen into an easement by prescription, no matter how long it may be continued. <em>Pennsylvania RR. Co. v. Donovan </em>(1924), 111 Ohio St. 341, 350, 145 N.E. 479; <em>Monroe Bowling Lanes v. Woodsfield Livestock Sales </em>(1969), 17 Ohio App.2d 146, 152, 46 O.O.2d 208, 244 N.E.2d 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">{\u00b6 16} In this case, there was ample evidence presented to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the McCumberses\u2019 use of the driveway was permissive and not inconsistent with the Pucketts\u2019 property rights. Therefore, the McCumberses were not entitled to a prescriptive easement over the Pucketts\u2019 driveway. <em>Cadwallader, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-4166, 896 N.E.2d 748, at \u00b6 57. However, there was also ample evidence presented to support the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>finding that the McCumberses were entitled to an easement by estoppel over the Pucketts\u2019 driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">{\u00b6 17} Courts in this state have long recognized the creation of an easement by estoppel. See, e.g., <em>Monroe Bowling Lanes, </em>17 Ohio App.2d at 149-151, 46 O.O.2d 208, 244 N.E.2d 762 (easement by estoppel may be created where a landowner, without objection, permits another to expend money in reliance upon a supposed easement, when in justice and equity the former ought to have asserted his conflicting rights, and therefore should be estopped to deny the easement). See also <em>Maloney v. Patterson </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 405, 410, 579 N.E.2d 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">{\u00b6 18} In granting the McCumberses an easement by estoppel over the Pucketts\u2019 driveway, the trial court relied on Restatement of the Law 3d, Property (2000) 143, Section 2.10(1), entitled, \u201cServitudes Created by Estoppel,\u201d which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cIf injustice can be avoided only by establishment of a servitude, the owner or occupier of land is estopped to deny the existence of a servitude burdening the land when:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(1) the owner or occupier permitted another to use that land under circumstances in which it was reasonable to foresee that the user would substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked, and the user did substantially change position in reasonable reliance on the belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cNormally, the change in position that triggers the application of the rule stated in [Section 2.10(1) ] is an investment in improvements either to the servient estate or to the other land of the investor. * * * <em>Failure to object to an investment made in improvements to land by another may give rise to an estoppel against the owner or occupier of the land, if the owner or occupier knows or reasonably should know that the investment is being made on the basis of a mistaken belief that the investor has a nonrevokable right to use the land.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Restatement of the Law 3d, Property (Servitudes) (2000), Section 2.10, Comment <em>e.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, there was clear and convincing evidence presented to show that the Pucketts permitted the McCumberses to expend money to construct a new garage adjacent to the driveway on the Pucketts\u2019 strip of land and that the McCumberses acted in reasonable reliance on their belief that they would have a right to use the driveway as a way of ingress and egress to their new garage. The new garage was placed adjacent to the driveway, and Gary himself completed construction on 80 to 90 percent of the garage before discontinuing work on the project. As a result, there is ample evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>trial court\u2019s finding that it would be \u201cunconscionable\u201d to deny the McCumberses an easement over the driveway on the Pucketts\u2019 strip of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">{\u00b6 23} The Pucketts argue that they never permitted the McCumberses to use the driveway on their strip of land as a means of access to them new garage. However, the evidence shows that Gary constructed 80 to 90 percent of the new garage that was positioned next to the driveway. There was also evidence to show that Gary knew at the earliest stages of construction that the doors on the new garage were going to be facing the driveway. Consequently, there was ample evidence presented to show that the McCumberses reasonably, though mistakenly, believed that they had a nonrevokable right to use the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">{\u00b6 24} The Pucketts also argue that this is not an instance where injustice can be avoided <em>only </em>by granting the McCumberses an easement over the driveway since there was evidence that the McCumberses could access their new garage from their property\u2019s western side. However, this argument ignores the fact that the Pucketts knew that the garage was being constructed on the eastern side of the McCumberses\u2019 property, immediately adjacent to the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">{\u00b6 25} The Pucketts also contend that they made no misrepresentation to the McCumberses regarding an easement and had no obligation to speak to them about the absence of an easement because the McCumberses were aware they had no easement over the driveway, but \u201cstudiously avoided\u201d requesting an easement from the Pucketts until after the garage was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">{\u00b6 26} However, the McCumberses testified that they never asked for permission to use the driveway because they believed that they owned at least half of it. Moreover, Gary constructed about 80 to 90 percent of the garage situated next to the Pucketts\u2019 driveway before he quit work on it. Under these circumstances, Gary had an obligation to raise the issue of a lack of an easement over the driveway <em>before </em>he commenced building the McCumberses\u2019 garage next to that driveway. See <em>Monroe Bowling Lanes, </em>17 Ohio App.2d at 149-151, 46 O.O.2d 208, 244 N.E.2d 762. Since Gary said nothing at that time, the trial court was justified in finding that he should be estopped from denying that the McCumberses were entitled to an easement over the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">{\u00b6 27} Consequently, the Pucketts\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">{\u00b6 28} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendants-appellants in granting an easement by estoppel to the owners of the dominant estate that includes an area 16 feet in length beyond the \u2018south of the structure denoted as a frame garage * * *.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>{\u00b6 30} The Pucketts argue that there was no evidence presented to support the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the dimensions of the easement granted to the McCumberses, as the McCumberses never claimed that they used the entire width of the strip of land in question nor described what dimensions would satisfy their needs. Therefore, the Pucketts argue, the trial court\u2019s decision on the easement\u2019s dimensions was \u201csimply arbitrary and without any evidentiary or legal basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">{\u00b6 31} When establishing the dimensions of an easement, the trial court must consider what \u201cis reasonably necessary and convenient to serve the purpose for which the easement was granted.\u201d <em>Crane Hollow, Inc. v. Marathon Ashland Pipe Line, L.L.C. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 57, 67, 740 N.E.2d 328. A trial court\u2019s determination as to the dimensions of an easement will not be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence so long as there is some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case. Id. at 66, 740 N.E.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">{\u00b6 32} The Restatement of the Law 3d, Property (Servitudes) (2000), Section 4.8(2) provides that except where the. dimensions of an easement are determined by the instrument or circumstances surrounding the easement\u2019s creation, \u201c[t]he dimensions are those reasonably necessary for enjoyment of the servitude.\u201d Comment <em>d </em>to Section 4.8(2) states that where the dimensions of an easement are not specified, the owner of the easement \u201cmay use so much of the servient estate as reasonably necessary to carry out the [easement\u2019s] intended purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">{\u00b6 33} The intended purpose of granting the McCumberses an easement by estoppel over the driveway on the Pucketts\u2019 strip of land was to provide the McCumberses with ingress and egress to their property, including their new garage. To achieve this purpose, the trial court granted the McCumberses an easement that encompasses \u201c[t]he area fronting on the Washington-Good Hope Road with a surveyed width of 33.80 feet and continuing in a southerly direction to a point which shall be 16.0 feet south [of the McCumbers\u2019 new garage].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">{\u00b6 34} Contrary to what the Pucketts contend, there was some competent, credible evidence presented to support the trial court\u2019s decision to extend the easement 16 feet past the McCumberses\u2019 new garage. <em>Crane Hollow, Inc., </em>138 Ohio App.3d at 67, 740 N.E.2d 328. The McCumberses will obviously need at least some of the space to back out of their new garage, and Nancy testified that the McCumberses maintain a garden in the back of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">{\u00b6 35} However, there was no evidence presented to support the trial court\u2019s decision to extend the <em>width </em>of the easement to include the grassy area between the paved driveway and the property of the McCumberses\u2019 next-door neighbors, the Browns. Extending the easement to include this area was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>reasonably necessary for the easement\u2019s intended purpose and therefore not reasonably necessary for the McCumberses\u2019 enjoyment of the servitude. Restatement of the Law 3d, Property (Servitudes) (2000), Section 4.8(2), Comment <em>d. </em>On remand, the trial court is instructed to narrow the width of the easement, as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, the Pucketts\u2019 second assignment of error is sustained to the extent indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">{\u00b6 37} The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b804-8\">Powell, P.J., and Young, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
