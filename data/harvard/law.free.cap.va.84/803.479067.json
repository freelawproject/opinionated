In both cases it means \u201cto build.\u201d And this is recognized and provided for in the law in question. The second section of the ordinance, referring to the fire limits, provides: \u201c (2) No person shall erect, or cause to be erected, within the fire limits as hereinbefore defined, any building or buildings, or any addition to an existing building, unless the walls thereof are composed entirely of brick, stone, mortar, iron, or other incombustible material, and the roof or roofs thereof covered with slate, tile, metal, or other material which shall be deemed fire proof: provided that a wooden building, or a wooden addition to an existing building, costing fifty dollars or less, may be erected upon the rear of any property, provided a special permit is first obtained in the manner hereinafter set forth. But no shingle roof shall be put on any.building within the fire limits either in repairing an old or constructing a new one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The wooden building of the plaintiff in error was erected before the passage of the ordinance of March 5, 1886, concerning wooden buildings outside the fire limits, cited above as \u201c section 4and concerning this there is no provision and no contention here; but since the passage of the said ordinance, the plaintiff has erected another story to this building of the prohibited material, wood. This was as much a violation of the ordinance as if the new building had been on the ground, instead of on the top of another building, or by the side of another building; and the corporation court having so held, we think there was no error in the said judgment, which is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Judgment arrirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
