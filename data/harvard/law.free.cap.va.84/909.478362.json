He had no remedy at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b942-10\">The plea of the statute of limitations is not good for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b942-11\">1st. Bill alleges, and it is not denied either by answer or plea, that the account was to be paid when the crop of each year should be disposed of. It is for the defendants to show when said crop was disposed of, and that it was more than two years from the time of such disposal until suit was brought. <em>JE contra </em>it might have been within the two years, and this is a reasonable position. The account was made in 1880. Suit was brought in 1884. The crop 'raised in 1880 could not be sold before 1881, and it is very reasonable to suppose that it was not sold until 1882, aird at such a time as to bring us within the statute. And it is not in accordance with the tfsages of courts of equity to .presume a thing to be done which is not shown to be done when the effect and purpose of that assumption is to aid an immoral defence. The cause of action did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>arise until the sale of the crop. If before this time the plaintiff had sued he would have been met with the answer, \u201cYour contract was to wait for your money until we had sold our crop, and your money is not due until then.\u201d How the appellant comes into court and asks for his money, and is answered, two years have elapsed since the cause of action has arisen. How, the appellant submits that they must clearly show to-the court that the crop has been sold, and that, too, two years before the institution of this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b943-5\">\u201c Under a contract for work and labor to be paid for after the death of the employer, the statute of limitations will not commence to run until after the occurrence of that event.\u201d <em>Riddle </em>v. <em>Backus, </em>38 Iowa, 81; <em>Titman </em>v. <em>Titman, </em>64 Penn. St., 480; <em>Nimmo </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>14 La. Ann., 581.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b943-6\">2d. The appellant was prevented from bringing his suit both by direct and indirect means.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b943-7\">\u201c \"When any such right as is mentioned in this chapter shall accrue against a person who has before resided in this State, if such person shall by departing without the same, or by absconding or concealing himself, <em>or by any other indirect ways or means, </em>obstruct the prosecution of such right, the time that such obstruction may have continued shall not be computed as any part of the time within which the said right might or ought to have been prosecuted.\u201d Code, c. 146, sec. 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b943-8\">It appears from the record that the appellant was prevented from bringing suit by the repeated promises of the defendants that they would pay it, if given a little time, from the proceeds of the farm owned by them all in common, and induced him not to bring suit and sell the land, but to give them one year. These facts, clearly stated in the bill and not denied, and proved, show that the defendants have clearly prevented the bringing of this suit, and that the appellant is clearly saved by the statute referred to above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b943-9\">This is conclusive as-to Lucy Hamner, and the court erred in not giving judgment as to Lucy.Hamner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b944-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>B. <em>B.

The suit was by bill in chancery against the defendants, some of whom are infants, to collect a store account of $415 12, of August 31, 1880, alleged to be due on account of purchases at the store of Morton Pannill, a merchant who has failed and assigned, from 1877 to 1880. The suit was brought on the 6th of October, 1884. The complainant alleges that, at the time of the death of the elder Hamner, he agreed to credit his eight surviving children for goods at his store, six being infants, and charged the same to the estate of the father, Thomas F. Hamner; that the children constantly .promised to pay him, and did not do it; and'that, although the bar of the statute of limitations of two years has been interposed by plea, he has been so often promised, and so hindered in getting payment, that the statute does not apply, and that equity has jurisdiction to correct the mistake he, has made of charging the goods to Thomas F. Hamner\u2019s estate, and should then give him a decree against his real debtors. The bill being demurred to, and the limitations of two years pleaded, the circuit court dismissed the bill. \u00a5e think this was plainly right. The claim does not come within the jurisdiction of a court of equity; the remedy being plain and adequate at law, so far as the form goes. But, upon the merits, the latest item in the account is plainly and clearly within the bar of the statute, and it was right to dismiss the bill. The decree complained of will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
