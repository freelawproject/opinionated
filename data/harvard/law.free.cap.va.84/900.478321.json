Lewis, trustee, and the deed of the 15th day of December, 1886, by John H. Lewis, trustee, to said plaintiff, the 'defendant introduced a witness (the said Fauntleroy Murrell) for the purpose of showing that at the sale of the real estate mentioned in the deed of trust of the 18th November, 1881, he was present at said sale and forbid the sale on the ground that the deed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>trust aforesaid was a forgery; was never heard of by him before steps were taken to sell his house and lot; that he never \u25a0executed the said deed, nor authorized any oiie for him to do so; and, for the purpose of showing further that said deed of trust was not executed by him, offered to prove that no \u2022 consideration ever existed for said deed; that he further offered J. S. Diggs as a witness for the purpose of showing that he is not a purchaser for value without notice, and offered to prove by said witness that on the day of sale, and before the property was bought by him, said defendant notified him by public proclamation that said deed was not executed by him, but was a forgery and void; that he further offered another deed, bearing date on the 18th November, 1881, of the same date of the forged deed, and also the book of the Tobacco City Building-Fund association, kept by A. M. Davies, for the purpose of showing, by entries therein made by said Davies, that the whole purchase-money had been paid said association; that said Davies was the original beneficiary in said deed of trust. But the court refused to permit any evidence to be introduced to disprove the execution of said deed of trust by the plaintiff in error, and that the same was forged throughout, on the ground that said deed, having been duly recorded, could not be questioned as to its genuineness or its execution inquired into.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b933-5\">1.

Lewis, trustee, dated December 15, 1886. The plaintiff purchased the premises in controversy at a public sale thereof made by the said Lewis, trustee, under a certain deed of trust dated November 18, 1881. The last-mentioned deed, which was introduced as evidence at the trial by the plaintiff, has annexed to it two certificates, signed by A. G. Waugh, notary public, and in the form prescribed by the statute, certifying that on the said 18th day of November, 1881, the deed was acknowledged before him by Murrell (the defendant) and wife, \u201cwhose names are signed\u201d thereto. And\u00f3n the same day, the deed having been presented in the clerk\u2019s office of the corporation court of Lynchburg, in which city the premises in controversy are situate, was admitted to record \u201cupon the annexed certificates of acknowledgment,\u201d as appears from the endorsement of the clerk on the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and at the trial offered to testify, as a witness in his own behalf, that at the sale of the premises by the trustee, he, the defendant, was present and forbade the sale, on the ground that the deed of trust was a forgery; that it was never heard of by him before steps were taken to sell the property; that he never-executed the deed, nor authorized its execution, and that, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>all this the plaintiff was informed on the day of sale, and before the sale took place. The circuit court, however, excluded the evidence, and the defendant excepted; and the question thus presented is the question to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">It is conceded that the holder of the note secured by the deed of trust, and for whose benefit the sale was made, had no notice prior to the sale that the validity of the deed ivas questioned; nor was any attempt made to prove <em>mala fides </em>either on the part of the <em>cestui que trust </em>or the trustee The simple question, then, is whether upon the grounds just mentioned, parol evidence was admissible to contradict the deed of trust, which is regular on its face, and which purports to have been duly acknowledged and admitted to record. We are clearly of opinion that it was not. The act of an officer in taking an acknowledgment of a deed is judicial in its character, and cannot he impeached collaterally. He determines whether the person whose name is signed to the deed is the actual grantor, and also whether he truly acknowledges the same as his act and deed; and after these points have been determined'and certified by him, in conformity with law, and the deed has been duly recorded, the proceeding has all the force and conclusiveness of a judgment of a court of record. The'mischievous consequences of a different doctrine can hardly be overstated, inasmuch as it would render titles to real estate utterly insecure, and liable at any moment, and at any distance of time afterwards, to he questioned and overthrown by parol evidence in a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The question is not an open one in this court. In <em>Carper </em>v. <em>M\u2019Dowell, </em>5 Gratt., 212, it was said by Judge Baldwin, in delivering the-opinion of the court, that \u201cit may be laid down, without qualification, that the registration of a deed, regular upon its face, cannot be contradicted by evidence in any collateral controversy. Thus, in an action of ejectment for the recovery of land, if the title turns upon the due registration of a deed, the registry itself is the only legitimate evidence upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the question, and parol evidence is inadmissible to prove that it was not duly proved or acknowledged and admitted to record, even though the registration was fraudulently procured.\u201d And in the same ease it was said that not only is a proceeding to register a deed, which is regular on its face, not impeachable collaterally by any evidence whatever, but that it cannot be impeached even directly, except in a court of equity, and not even there except upon the ground of fraud or upon some other ground which reaches the conscience of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The same principle was asserted in <em>Harkins </em>v. Forsythe, 11 Leigh, 294, in which ease it was decided that a certificate of two justices of the peace of the privy examination of a married woman could not be contradicted by parol evidence, there being-no allegation of fraud. The privy examination of a married woman, it was said, is in Virginia a substitute for the ancient common law proceeding by fine in a court of record, which derived its name from putting <em>an end </em>not only to the suit, but <em>to </em>all controversies concerning the same subject matter, and could be relieved against only for fraud in the court of chancery. See also <em>Hitz </em>v. <em>Jerks, </em>123 U. S., 297; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Beazley, </em>75 Va., 491; <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Paul, Id., </em>594.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">In the light of these principles, it is very clear that the judgment \"complained of must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
