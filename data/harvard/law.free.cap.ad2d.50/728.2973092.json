Order reversed, without costs, and motion denied. Absent a reservation of a right to do so, the court was without power to reopen the judgment to add additional interest to the award in order to conform to a decision made by the Court of Appeals in a later unrelated case <em>(Deeves v Fabric Fire Hose Co., </em>14 NY2d 633; <em>Matter of Huie [Furman] </em>20 NY2d 568). We have sent for, and examined, the original stipulations, upon the basis of which the above-mentioned decree was entered. There are no reservations therein of the right to move for increased interest. Gulotta, P. J., Martuscello, Christ, Brennan and Shapiro, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
