Cl. 691 (1996), dismissing their complaint that the United States Enrichment Corporation had overcharged them for uranium enrichment services. Because (1) the contracts at issue permit the government to charge any price below the ceiling, (2) the government has not violated any alleged treaty rights, and (3) the government is not recovering its decommissioning and decontamination costs twice, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Empresa Nacional del Uranio, S.A. (ENU-SA) is a nuclear fuel cycle company owned by Spain that purchases fuel for nuclear power plants there. On March 20,1974, the United States and Spain entered a treaty styled \u201cAtomic Energy: Cooperation for Civil Uses\u201d (Spanish Treaty). Pursuant to this treaty, if Spain, or authorized persons, want to obtain uranium enrichment services from the United States, they will \u201chave access on an equitable basis with other purchasers of such services to uranium enrichment capacity then available in [Atomic Energy] Commission facilities and not already allocated.\u201d The Spanish Treaty also states that \u201cthe agreed delivery schedules and other terms and conditions of supply\u201d will be set forth in \u201cfirm contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">Barseback Kraft AB (Barseback) is a Swedish energy company that owns and operates a commercial nuclear power plant. In December 1983, the United States and Sweden executed an \u201cAgreement for Cooperation Between Sweden and the United States of America Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy\u201d (Swedish Treaty). This treaty did not specifically mention uranium enrichment services. A subsequent letter from the American Ambassador to Sweden to the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, however, states: \u201cWith respect to any contract executed between the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Government of Sweden or authorized persons under its jurisdiction ... charges for enrichment services ... will be those in effect for users in the United States of America at the time of delivery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-18\">In 1984, Barseback and ENUSA entered contracts with the United States to purchase fixed percentages of their enriched uranium needs from the Department of Energy (DOE). The duration of the contracts is thirty years or the life of the longest operating nuclear power facility included under the contracts, whichever is shorter. Barseback and ENUSA may terminate their contracts upon ten years\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-19\">Of particular importance to this case is the pricing provision of the contracts, article IV(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It states that \u201c[t]he charges to be paid to DOE for enrichment services provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>ed to the Customer hereunder will be determined in accordance with the established DOE pricing policy for such services.\u201d Article 1(8) defines \u201cestablished DOE pricing policy\u201d as \u201cany policy established by DOE that is applicable to prices or charges in effect at the time of performance of any services under this contract.\u201d Additionally, the price cannot exceed a \u201cceiling charge,\u201d which fluctuates under the contracts\u2019 formula, accounting for changes in electrical rates and the purchasing power of the dollar. Article IV(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The \u201cestablished DOE pricing policy\u201d at the time the parties contracted was that DOE\u2019s prices would recover only the government\u2019s costs over a reasonable period of time. This policy was mandated by section 161(v) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which provided that \u201cany prices established under this subsection shall be on a basis of recovery of the Government\u2019s costs over a reasonable period of time.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(v) (1988). Section 161(v), as amended, also directed DOE<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to \u201cestablish criteria in writing setting forth the terms and conditions under which services provided under this subsection shall be made available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to this directive, <em>see </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 762.1(a) (1987) (\u201cthese criteria are established pursuant to section 161(v)\u201d), DOE published its Uranium Enrichment Services Criteria (Enrichment Criteria). The final Enrichment Criteria were published in 1986 and echoed section 161(v)\u2019s cost-recovery based pricing policy. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 762.5. The Enrichment Criteria also listed the costs included in DOE\u2019s charge, which included, <em>inter alia, </em>certain decontamination and decommissioning (D &amp; D) costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Subsequently, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Policy Act), which made three significant changes in the government\u2019s uranium enrichment services program. First, it transferred responsibility for administering the program from DOE to the newly-created United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2297c(a) (1994). USEC is wholly owned by the government, with the United States Treasury as the sole shareholder, and ultimately it is to be privatized. Importantly, all of DOE\u2019s existing uranium enrichment contracts, including Barseback\u2019s and ENUSA\u2019s, were transferred to USEC. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2297c(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">Second, the Energy Policy Act eliminated section 161(v)\u2019s cost-recovery based pricing policy. Instead, Congress directed USEC to \u201cestablish prices for its products, materials, and services provided to customers other than [DOE] on a basis that will allow it to attain the normal business objectives of a profitmaking corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2297e-l(a). Stated otherwise, Congress changed the government\u2019s pricing strategy from one based on recovering just its costs to one aimed at \u201cprofit maximization.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 102-474(1), at 200 (1992), <em>reprinted in </em>1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1954, 2023.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Third, this act created the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund (D &amp; D Fund). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2297g. It was designed to \u201caccumulate the monies required to clean up the old uranium enrichment plants,\u201d over fifteen years. <em>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>112 F.3d 1569, 1572 (Fed.Cir.1997). The D &amp; D Fund is financed by deposits of $480 million per year, adjusted annually for inflation, from two sources: (1) a \u201cspecial assessment\u201d of up to $150 million collected from domestic utilities, and (2) congressional appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"ATQ\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">On June 28, 1993, USEC informed Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA (and other uranium enrichment customers) that effective July 1, 1993, their contracts would transfer to it, and their contract price of $125 per separative work unit (SWU), the common measure by which uranium enrichment services are sold, would remain the same on an interim basis. In further implementing the Energy Policy Act, USEC notified all uranium enrichment customers on June 24, 1994, that it was adopting a new pricing policy to replace the interim policy. The new policy provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>USEC prices will ensure that (i) the Corporation generates sufficient revenues to remain a viable, long-term supplier of uranium enrichment services, (ii) the United States Treasury, as the Corporation\u2019s sole stockholder, receives a reasonable return on its investment in the uranium enrichment services business, and (iii) the price a customer pays for additional incremental uranium enrichment services purchased from USEC is competitive in the marketplace. USEC will retain the flexibility to respond to the circumstances of all customers by negotiating prices and other contract terms on an individual basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1d\">USEC also told its customers that the price of $125 per SWU would remain in force. Although Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA have continued to pay $125 per SWU, USEC has given lower prices to purchasers who have renegotiated their contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA submitted certified claims<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the contracting officer in accordance with the Disputes clause of their contracts, seeking damages caused by USEC: (1) failing to set prices in accordance with the cost-recovery methodology; (2) pricing its services uncompetitively and diseriminatorily, in violation of the Swedish and Spanish Treaties and the government\u2019s duty of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) double-charging for D &amp; D costs by purportedly including charges for these expenses in its uranium enrichment prices, while simultaneously collecting these costs from domestic utilities via the special assessment. The contracting officer denied the claims. Barseb\u00e1ek and ENUSA then filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, which granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. RCFC 56(e); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2509-10, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all justifiable factual inferences in favor of Barseb\u00e4ck and ENUSA <em>Winstar Corp. v. United States, </em>64 F.3d 1531, 1539 (Fed.Cir.1995) (in banc), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996). The underlying questions of contract and treaty interpretation are both questions of law, which we also review de novo. <em>Olympus Corp. v. United States, </em>98 F.3d 1314, 1316 (Fed.Cir.1996) (contract); <em>Cook v. United States, </em>86 F.3d 1095, 1097 (Fed.Cir.1996) (treaty).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA argue that the court erred in granting summary judgment because: (1) the contracts\u2019 pricing provision was ambiguous, thus raising factual issues not properly resolved by summary judgment; (2) the government breached the Swedish and Spanish Treaties by charging other customers lower prices; and (3) the government improperly double-recovered its D &amp; D costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each of these issues requires us to interpret Barseb\u00e1ek\u2019s and ENUSA\u2019s contracts. In doing so, we begin with their plain language. <em>McAbee Constr., Inc. v. United States, </em>97 F.3d 1431, 1435 (Fed.Cir. 1996); <em>C. Sanchez and Son, Inc. v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1539, 1543 (Fed.Cir.1993) (\u201cA contract is read in accordance with its express terms and the plain meaning thereof.\u201d). If the provisions are clear and unambiguous, a court will give them their plain and ordinary meaning and will not resort to parol evidence. <em>McAbee, </em>97 F.3d at 1435. The second issue additionally requires us to interpret the Swedish and Spanish Treaties, an exercise we undertake using the same general principles, remembering that treaties are to \u201cbe construed broadly to accomplish the intent\u201d of the sovereigns. <em>Compagnie Fin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number><em>anciere de Suez et de L\u2019Union Parisienne v. United States, </em>203 Ct.Cl. 605, 492 F.2d 798, 810 (1974). Applying these established rules, we disagree that the court erred in construing the agreements at issue or in granting summary judgment. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">A. <em>Contract Ambiguity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">In support of their primary argument that the contracts\u2019 pricing policy is ambiguous,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Barsebaek and ENUSA draw three arrows from their collective quiver. First, they argue that price must be based on <em>DOE\u2019s, not USEC\u2019s, </em>established policy, which was the cost-recovery based policy set forth in the Enrichment Criteria. Thus, USEC\u2019s profit-maximization policy violates their contracts. Second, they contend that the word \u201cany,\u201d found in the pricing provision, is itself an ambiguous term, whose meaning is derived only from its context, thus requiring a trial to examine parol evidence. Finally, they offer that two of their contracts\u2019 recital clauses cloud the meaning of the pricing provision, thus requiring a trial to sort out the contracts\u2019 true policy. In the end, the arrows miss their mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Article IV(1), \u201cCharges for Enrichment Services \u2014 Ceiling Charge \u2014 Other Charges,\u201d sets forth the contracts\u2019 pricing policy. It states that the \u201ccharges to be paid to DOE\u201d for enrichment services will \u201cbe determined in accordance with established DOE pricing policy\u201d but will not exceed the ceiling, which varies annually. The contracts define \u201cestablished DOE pricing policy\u201d as \u201cany policy established by DOE that is applicable to prices or charges in effect at the time of performance of any services under this contract.\u201d Article 1(8). We see no ambiguity in this provision. The contracts state that the price to be paid is to be determined by the policy existing at the time the uranium enrichment services are provided. When the services at issue were provided, the government\u2019s policy was to charge an amount that recovered not just its costs but also produced a profit, while remaining below the ceiling. We find nothing in the pricing provision or elsewhere in the contracts that limits USEC\u2019s ability to price its services in this manner, which, of course, is mandated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Notwithstanding, Barsebaek and ENUSA argue that the contract literally requires that the price be determined in accordance with <em>DOE\u2019s </em>pricing policy, not <em>USEC\u2019s. </em>They say that during the years in question, 1993 and 1994, the established <em>DOE </em>pricing policy was the cost-recovery policy set forth at 10 C.F.R. Part 762, which was not formally withdrawn from the Code of Federal Regulations until 1995. <em>See </em>Removal of Obsolete Regulations, 60 Fed.R\u00e9g. 49,195, 49,196 (1995) (stating that the statutory authority for Part 762 was superseded by the Energy Policy Act). Thus, they argue, that policy controlled the government\u2019s pricing in 1993 and 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">This argument fails for at least two reasons. First, DOE could not have had any valid uranium enrichment pricing policy in 1993 and 1994 because Congress had stripped it of its authority to sell uranium enrichment services. It had transferred that responsibility to USEC. Second, the statutory authority upon which that regulation rested, section 161(v), was repealed by the Energy Policy Act. It was replaced with a new policy to price uranium enrichment services to maximize profits. USEC was not constrained to base its prices on a cost-recovery basis. To the contrary, it was required to operate as a profit-seeking entity. The fact that DOE\u2019s Enrichment Criteria had not been formally withdrawn from the Code of .Federal Regulations does not save them from invalidity. A \u201cregulation cannot override a clearly stated statutory requirement.\u201d <em>Aerolineas Argentinas v. United States, </em>77 F.3d 1564, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1996) (citing <em>Brush v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>982 F.2d 1554, 1560 (Fed.Cir.1992) (\u201cregulation must be held to be invalid since it does not comport with the clear statutory mandate\u201d)); <em>see also United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 873, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2156, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977) (a regulation is valid only if it is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>with the statute under which it was promulgated).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Nor is there merit to the argument that the inclusion of \u201cany\u201d in the pricing provision renders that clause ambiguous. The \u201cword \u2018any\u2019 is generally used in the sense of \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018every\u2019 and its meaning is most comprehensive.\u201d <em>Fleck v. KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 107, 115 (3rd Cir.1992) (quoting <em>McCormick v. Columbus Conveyer Co., </em>522 Pa. 520, 564 A2d 907, 910 (1989)); <em>see also United States v. Rosenwasser, </em>323 U.S. 360, 362-63, 65 S.Ct. 295, 296-97, 89 L.Ed. 301 (1945) (\u201cany\u201d employee means all employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act, unless specifically excluded). This word does not introduce ambiguity into the pricing provision, it gives it breadth. While Barseback and ENUSA are correct that Black\u2019s Law Dictionary states that \u201cany\u201d \u201cmay be restricted by the context\u201d in which it is used, there is nothing in their contracts that robs \u201cany\u201d of its plain and expansive meaning. The fact that the parties entered their contracts at a time when the 1979 Enrichment Criteria were in effect neither limits the phrase \u201cany policy\u201d to the cost-recovery based policy found in those criteria, as Barsebaek and ENUSA appear to argue, nor otherwise reins in its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Finally, Barsebaek and ENUSA claim that two recital clauses in their contracts render the agreements ambiguous. The first states, emphasis added, that \u201cDOE <em>intends </em>to serve as a reliable long-term supplier of uranium enrichment services at predictable prices while providing the most competitive prices possible through technological innovation.\u201d The second \u201cWhereas\u201d clause states, emphasis added, that \u201cDOE <em>desires </em>to operate the enrichment complex on a sound business basis without Government subsidy.\u201d Again, these clauses do not render ambiguous the contracts generally or the pricing provision specifically. The first expresses DOE\u2019s aim to rely on technological innovation to price its services as competitively as possible. The second expresses only the government\u2019s desire to operate its uranium enrichment program in a self-sufficient manner. Moreover, facially these clauses express only desires, not binding commitments. Barsebaek and ENUSA\u2019s argument that these clauses mandate that the government offer the most competitive possible price while avoiding the need for a government subsidy would give the government very little, if any, latitude to price its services other than on a cost-recovery basis. Indeed, this construction would essentially strip the government of the broad discretion the pricing provision accords it.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The contracts, however, place the risk of any changed government pricing policy on Barsebaek and ENUSA In this respect, this case is the other side of the <em>Winstar </em>coin. The agreements at issue in <em>United States v. Winstar, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996), upon which Barsebaek and ENUSA rely, permitted healthy thrifts that merged with ailing ones to count \u201csupervisory goodwill\u201d obtained through the mergers towards the capital reserve requirements imposed by federal regulations. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2442. Congress later legislated that thrifts may not use supervisory goodwill to meet capital reserve requirements, causing numerous thrifts to file breach of contract suits. The Court construed the agreements at issue to shift the risk of loss to the government, thus requiring it to \u201cindemnify its contracting partners against financial losses arising from regulatory change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 116 S.Ct. at 2461. In other words, the risk of any policy change resided with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">Here, on the other hand, the risks associated with any change in the government\u2019s pricing policy are allocated to Barsebaek and ENUSA The contracts do not set a firm price that will govern the thirty-year lives of the contracts. Rather, they say that the price will be dictated by the pricing policy in effect at the time the services are delivered. This provision reflects the parties\u2019 recognition that the pricing policy would change over the contracts\u2019 lives. Of course, this does not just require Barsebaek and ENUSA to swallow any price increase, which, at least in whole dollar terms, has not occurred; it gives them the benefit of any price decrease as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>B. <em>Treaty Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2D\">Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA next contend that by offering lower prices to utilities entering new contracts, USEC has violated the treaties between the United States and their respective governments. The Spanish Treaty grants Spain \u201caccess on an equitable basis with other purchasers of [uranium enrichment] services to uranium enrichment capacity then available in Commission facilities and not already allocated.\u201d Importantly, it also states that the services will be provided under the terms and conditions set forth in firm contracts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This treaty requires only that ENUSA be given access to the government\u2019s available uranium enrichment services to the same extent as other purchasers. The price of these services, though, is governed by the provisions of its contract. ENUSA does not claim that it has been denied the right to secure uranium enrichment. Indeed, it continues to acquire such services from USEC in accordance with the pricing terms of its contract. USEC has not abrogated any treaty right of ENUSA</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Similarly, Barseb\u00e1ck has been not deprived of its treaty rights. The Swedish Treaty does not address enriched uranium services at all. Diplomatic correspondence, however, provides that with respect to any contract that Sweden, or authorized persons, execute with the government, charges for enrichment services will be those in effect for users in the United States at the time of delivery. Barseb\u00e1ck does not argue that other users in the United States are not also being charged $125 per SWU. Indeed, the base charge in <em>effect </em>during the period in question remained $125 per SWU. Moreover, the government represented at argument that every customer buying services under the same contracts as Barseb\u00e1ck and ENU-SA pay the same price. Instead, what Barseb\u00e1ck contends is that by charging those customers who renegotiated their contracts less than $125 per SWU, USEC violated the treaty. But there is nothing in the treaty or in the diplomatic correspondence that guarantees Barseb\u00e1ck the lowest price. The treaty is silent on pricing. The diplomatic correspondence says only that charges for enrichment services will be those in effect for users in the United States at the time of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Moreover, Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA were <em>free </em>to approach USEC to <em>renegotiate </em>their contracts; they simply failed to do so. In June 1993, when the government notified its customers of its interim policy of maintaining the existing prices, it simultaneously notified them that the pricing policies were \u201csubject to change, modification, or revision ... as mutually agreed by the parties.\u201d A year later, in June 1994, USEC informed its customers that the \u201cbase price\u201d for enrichment services would remain at $125 per SWU, but \u201cUSEC will retain the flexibility to .respond to the circumstances of all customers by negotiating prices and other contract terms on an individual basis.\u201d Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that USEC\u2019s pricing violates the Swedish Treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">C. <em>Double-Recovery of D &amp; D Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA\u2019s final allegation is that the government is improperly double-recovering its D <em>&amp; </em>D costs. First, DOE is recovering them from domestic utilities via the special assessment. <em>See Yankee, </em>112 F.3d at 1572. Second, USEC is allegedly recovering them because D &amp; D costs were a component of DOE\u2019s price, and USEC has not decreased its price, even though it is not charged with <em>recovering D &amp; D </em>costs. Consequently, the argument goes, USEC must be recovering D &amp; D costs. Assuming Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA have standing to bring this claim,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is nevertheless unavailing. First, it is beyond dispute that USEC is not literally charging its customers an amount used for, or intended to finance, the government\u2019s D &amp; D efforts. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>\u00a7 2297g-l (D &amp; D fund is financed by only two sources: the special assessment and annual appropriations); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 2297c-2(d) (DOE is responsible for paying D &amp; D costs for pre-existing conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Second, the fact that USEC, which has a very different pricing mandate from that which DOE had, did not decrease the price of uranium enrichment services after it assumed DOE\u2019s prior responsibilities does not mean the government is double-recovering. Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA are, quite simply, comparing apples to oranges. DOE\u2019s cost-recovery based pricing policy included a D &amp; D component. USEC\u2019s profit-maximization policy, on the other hand, requires it to set prices in a profitable manner. In light of these quite different policies, USEC\u2019s failure to decrease its price indicates nothing more than that it believes that price \u201cwill allow it to attain the normal business objectives of a profitmaking corporation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2297c-l. It does not mean USEC is recovering D &amp; D costs. As the trial court correctly stated, \u201c[USEC\u2019s] prices do not bear a direct relationship to the cost structure on which the DOE based its prices.\u201d 36 Fed. Cl. at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Federal Claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-14\">. Citations to article numbers refer to the articles contained in the contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-6\">. This congressional direction was originally given to the Atomic Energy Commission, which was responsible for administering the uranium enrichment services program before 1977, when that responsibility was transferred to DOE. For simplicity, we refer to both agencies as DOE.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\"><em>. </em>The claims of Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA were identical except for the dollar amounts claimed, which depended upon the amount of uranium enrichment services purchased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b923-13\">. Barseb\u00e1ck and ENUSA also contend that the court erred in not permitting discovery. However, we do not see that the court abused its discretion in this regard. <em>See New Am. Shipbuilders, Inc. v. United States, </em>871 F.2d 1077, 1081 (Fed. Cir.1989). Nor do we find error in the court's rejection of the argument that USEC\u2019s pricing policy breached the government\u2019s duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\">. Although framed as arguments that the contracts are ambiguous, Barsebaek and ENUSA essentially argue, in part, that USEC\u2019s pricing policy breaches their contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b926-5\">. ENUSA complains that the court improperly relied on paragraph C, instead of paragraph A, of Article VII of the Spanish Treaty in concluding that the treaty states that the terms of any contracts would be agreed upon in the future, see 36 Fed. Cl. at 704. However, paragraph A contains substantively identical language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b926-11\">. The government argues that they do not have standing because they are not being double-charged since they are not domestic utilities subject to the special assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
