Thompson requested that the district court compel the state of Florida to produce and allow independent testing of DNA evidence used in his criminal trial. The magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Thompson\u2019s claim was foreclosed by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and thus subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), was adopted by the district court. Thompson argues on appeal that the district court erred because its decision was inconsistent with our opinion in <em>Bradley v. Pryor, </em>305 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>an appeal from a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915, the district court may dismiss a case filed <em>informa pauperis </em>at any time if it is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i-iii). \u201cA complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the prisoner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Harmon v. Berry, </em>728 F.2d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir.1984). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cin order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. If this type of action is brought prior to the invalidation of the challenged conviction or sentence, it must be dismissed. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Thus, \u201cthe district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cif the district court determines that the plaintiffs action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>ing criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512 U.S. at 487,114 S.Ct. at 2372-73. (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">In <em>Bradley, </em>we held that a \u00a7 1983 action seeking only post-conviction access to DNA evidence used during trial was not barred by <em>Heck </em>because prevailing in the action and obtaining access to the evidence would not demonstrate or imply that the prisoner\u2019s underlying conviction was invalid. <em>Bradley, </em>305 F.3d at 1290. In fact, allowing access to DNA evidence for testing \u201cnecessarily implies nothing at all about the plaintiffs conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. For example, the results of DNA testing could be \u201cinconclusive, ... insufficiently exculpatory, or they may even be inculpatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThat these scientific possibilities exist, in and of itself, suffices to establish that the asserted right of mere access is not a direct, or for that matter even an indirect, attack on one\u2019s conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if a plaintiff \u201cis successful in his lawsuit, his conviction and sentence will not be called into question, since the only thing he will have secured is access to evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292. Instead, he \u201cwould have to initiate an entirely separate action at some future date, in which he would have to argue for his release upon the basis of a separate constitutional violation altogether.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Because Thompson seeks access to DNA evidence used during his trial, and denies that he is challenging his conviction, we conclude that his action is not barred by <em>Heck. See </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372; <em>Bradley, </em>305 F.3d at 1291. Thus, we hold that the district court erred by relying on <em>Heck </em>as grounds for concluding that Thompson failed to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915, and consequently failing to address whether he sufficiently stated a \u00a7 1983 claim. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand this matter for further proceedings to determine whether Thompson\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleged a \u00a7 1983 cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
