In Appeal No. 05-6780, Stewart appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for Fed. R.Civ.P. 11 sanctions against the U.S. Attorney and his paralegal. In Appeal No. 06-6111, Stewart appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for new trial. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s orders and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>No. CR-01-11 (W.D.N.C. filed Mar. 16, 2005 &amp; entered Mar. 18, 2005; filed Apr. 13, 2005 &amp; entered Apr. 15, 2005; filed Nov. 5, 2005 &amp; entered Nov. 7, 2005). We further deny Stewart\u2019s motion for \u201cSupersedeas In Court of Appeals.\u201d We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
