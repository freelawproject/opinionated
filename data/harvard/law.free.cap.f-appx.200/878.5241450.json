The district court properly denied relief. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-19\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b901-20\">Vinasco filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2241 petition challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s (\u201cBOP\u201d) failure to grant him early release for his participation in a drug treatment program. The BOP based its decision on the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) finding that Vinasco had carried a firearm, even though he was not charged with a firearm offense nor was his sentence enhanced because he was carrying a firearm during the underlying offense. The records show that Vinasco was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), and sentenced to 87 months imprisonment. The PSI stated that police found a firearm and a knapsack containing approximately $14,000 and ledgers with entries relating to narcotics and money laundering in Vinasco\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, the district court had noted its belief that Vinasco\u2019s plea was a favorable disposition because, <em>inter alia, </em>the PSI showed that Vinasco possessed a loaded firearm at the time of his arrest, although Vinasco was not charged with a firearm offense. The court also recommended that Vinasco participate in a drug treatment program. Once incarcerated, the BOP determined that even though Vinasco was eligible for the drug treatment program, Vinasco\u2019s participation in the program would not qualify him for early release because his offense included possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Vinasco challenged this determination through the administrative grievance process and was denied his requested relief. After exhausting his administrative remedies, he filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The BOP answered the petition, explaining that Vinasco was ineligible for early release under PS 5162.04 because his offense involved carrying a firearm and that its policies permitted the consideration of the underlying conduct and not just the offense of conviction. The BOP noted that the Supreme Court has upheld the exercise of the BOP\u2019s discretion in this area in <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 241, 243-44, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001) (holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> grants the BOP the authority but not the duty to reduce an inmate\u2019s sentence after completion of a drug treatment program and that in exercising that authority, the BOP may rely on rulemaking to resolve certain issues of general applicability, and then may make categorical exclusions based on those rules). The BOP attached to its answer: (1) Vinasco\u2019s qualification application showing that he was ineligible for the drug treatment program because his offense involved a firearm; and (2) the BOP\u2019s policy statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Vinasco replied that he was being punished for conduct for which he was neither charged nor convicted. He distinguished <em>Lopez, </em>arguing that he differed from the petitioner in that case because the petitioner there had faced a sentencing enhancement for the firearm possession, but he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The magistrate judge recommended denying habeas relief, finding that the BOP properly exercised its discretion in classifying certain offenses as ineligible for early release, that this discretion had been upheld in <em>Lopez, </em>and that Vinasco\u2019s offense of conviction fell within the list of offenses for which the BOP could preclude early release. The magistrate judge further found that the BOP\u2019s determination was reasonable because the PSI stated that Vinasco had been in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The district court adopted the recommendation over Vinasco\u2019s objections and denied habeas relief. Vinasco filed his notice of appeal, and then filed a motion to amend judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3)(6), seeking to amend his complaint to explain that the firearm possession was not in connection with the conspiracy offense, as he carried the firearm with him at all times because he lived in a dangerous neighborhood. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">Vinasco argues that the BOP abused its discretion by denying him credit for partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>ipation in the drug treatment program because, according to Vinasco, he did not possess the firearm in connection with his conspiracy offense. He contends that, at the very least, the district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">As an initial matter, Vinasco abandoned or waived two arguments. First, Vinasco no longer challenges whether the BOP had the discretion to deny early release. Accordingly, he has abandoned that argument. <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998). Second, Vinasco requests an evidentiary hearing for the first time on appeal. Therefore, he has waived that argument. <em>Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526-27 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding that arguments raised for the first time on appeal are not considered by this court absent one of five exceptions).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Here, the district court properly determined that the BOP reasonably determined that Vinasco was ineligible for the early release credit. Under PS 5612.04, \u00a7 7(c)(3), the BOP is to consider the offense conduct in full. In this case, the PSI showed that Vinasco possessed the firearm at the time he was in possession of the money and the ledgers. Moreover, the sentencing court noted that Vinasco had a firearm but had not been charged with a firearm offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">As stated, the BOP has the discretion to determine who is eligible for Bureau programs. In exercising its discretion, the BOP promulgated a program statement, which includes \u201c[i]nmates whose current offense is a felony ... that involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm\u201d in its list of categories of inmates the BOP chose to exclude from eligibility. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(l)(vi) <em>&amp; </em>(a)(l)(vi)(B). The Supreme Court has held that the BOP\u2019s Program statement is a reasonable exercise of administrative discretion because \u201c \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) demonstrates Congress\u2019s concern for pre-conviction behavior and, therefore, the BOP is justified in considering that behavior when making categorical exclusions.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>531 U.S. at 243, 121 S.Ct. 714; <em>Walther v. Bauknecht, </em>155 Fed.Appx. 463, 466 (11th Cir.2005). Because the conduct \u2014 carrying a firearm \u201cindicates a willingness to endanger the lives of others, the BOP\u2019s categorical exclusion is a reasonable interpretation of statutory intent because the statute states that only nonviolent offenders are eligible.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>531 U.S. at 243-44, 121 S.Ct. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">In light of the facts in the PSI, the district court\u2019s recognition that Vinasco had possession of a firearm at the time he was arrested for the conspiracy, and the BOP\u2019s discretionary authority, the BOP\u2019s determination that the firearm was possessed in connection with the underlying offense was reasonable. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-16\">. The record neither contains the entire PSI nor reflects whether Vinasco objected to these factual statements in the PSI. On appeal, Vinasco contends that there was no evidence that he possessed the firearm in connection with the conspiracy to launder money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-17\">. Policy Statement (\"PS\u201d) 5612.04, \u00a7 7(c)(3) provides that \"an inmate may be precluded from receiving certain Bureau program benefits based on an offense listed in this section.

Furthermore, the introductory notes to section 7 state that if the offense \"involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm\u201d the inmate is precluded from receiving certain Bureau program benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b902-15\">.
