The BIA also found that Olvera\u2019s request for reconsideration was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-24\">In her petition for review, Olvera challenges the basis for the denial of her application for cancellation of removal but does not address the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen and reconsider. Olvera has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>abandoned her challenge to the denial of her motion to reopen and reconsider by failing to brief the relevant issues. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b402-16\"> Petitioner, a native and citizen of Mexico, was charged with being removable because inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). Before the Immigration Judge (IJ) she conceded removability and sought cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l) on the basis of hardship to her United States citizen children. The IJ denied cancellation of removal finding that the requisite hardship had not been shown. Petitioner appealed, contending that she had shown the requisite hardship. The BIA on February 10, 2005, adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. On March 10, 2005, petitioner timely filed a petition for review in this court <em>(Maria Louisa Olvera v. Gonzales, </em>#05-60187) challenging the BIA's February 10, 2005 decision; the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) &amp; (ii), the BIA\u2019s decision was an unreviewable discretionaiy determination; and on May 9, 2005, a panel of this court granted that motion of respondent and dismissed the petition for review. On May 10, 2005, petitioner filed with the BIA a motion to reopen and to reconsider its February 10, 2005 decision. On June 10, 2005, the BIA denied the motion to reopen and to reconsider. On July 8, 2005, petitioner filed the instant petition for review purportedly directed to the June 10, 2005 BIA decision. Petitioner has been represented by counsel throughout.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
