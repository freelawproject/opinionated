We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Kpognon\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006). We conclude that Kpognon\u2019s equitable tolling argument was not administratively exhausted and is therefore not properly before the court. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available.... \u201d); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004) (holding court lacks jurisdiction to consider a claim that was not raised before the Board and was therefore not exhausted under \u00a7 1252(d)(1)).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Kpognon, </em>No. A76-781-031 (B.I.A. Nov. 29, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-17\"> Although Kpognon subsequently presented the claim to the Board in a motion to reconsider, no petition for review of the Board\u2019s order denying that motion has been filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
