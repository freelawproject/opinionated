At the change-of-plea hearing, the Government alleged that Gutierrez-Mira had been found to be in the United States unlawfully after deportation and that he had previously been convicted of forcible rape in California. Gutierrez-Mira admitted the accuracy of the proffer. When defense counsel argued that the prior conviction was not an element of the charged offense, the district court reminded counsel that Gutierrez-Mira had admitted to the prior conviction and added that if the defendant \u201cwant[ed] to debate those issues\u201d he should reconsider the plea as it was likely that the prior conviction would impact sentencing. Counsel indicated that she was only seeking to preserve a legal objection. The court then accepted the plea and found Gutierrez-Mira guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">The probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI), assigning a base level of 8 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 with a 16-level enhancement for the prior conviction under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The report also included a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, giving an adjusted offense level of 21. The report categorized Gutierrez-Mira\u2019s criminal history as Category II given the prior conviction for forcible rape. The resulting guideline range was 41 to 51 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Gutierrez-Mira objected to the PSI\u2019s 16-level enhancement again, arguing that the indictment did not refer to the prior conviction and thus, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the prior conviction cannot be taken into account for sentencing. The district court overruled the objection and sentenced Gutierrez-Mira to a term of 46 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Gutierrez-Mira appeals his sentence, claiming that the 16-level enhancement is unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment because it is based on his prior conviction that was neither charged in the indictment nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He also argues that the district court violated the holding in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) by considering facts <em>about </em>his prior conviction (that the conviction was for an aggravated felony) rather than the fact <em>of </em>his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">We review constitutional challenges to sentencing <em>de novo, </em>but will reverse only if the error was harmful. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">There is no merit to Gutierrez-Mira\u2019s arguments. First, the Supreme Court specifically has held that a prior conviction is a sentencing factor that need not be charged in the indictment or proved to a jury. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005) (affirming that a prior conviction is a sentencing factor). This court has consistently held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law and is bound by it until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 335, - L.Ed.2d - (2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Second, contrary to Gutierrez-Mira\u2019s argument, the district court did not violate <em>Shepard </em>by looking beyond the facts of the conviction to determine whether the enhancement applied. Rather, the district court merely referred to the commentary in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, that categorizes rape as a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n.l(B)(iii)). <em>See United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1340 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the court properly considered the defendant\u2019s prior convictions and properly categorized the convictions as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1). Unlike the facts of <em>Shepard </em>where the district court had been asked to review police documents concerning the nature of the underlying offense, here the district court only took into account the prior conviction and applied the correct enhancement under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Moreover, Gutierrez-Mira\u2019s acceptance of the factual proffer when he plead guilty constitutes an admission of the prior conviction sufficient to apply the enhancement. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>444 F.3d 1286, 1308 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the defendant\u2019s admission of the factual basis for his sentence eliminated any <em>Booker-error).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
