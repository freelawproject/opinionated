Duarte\u2019s attorney on appeal has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising as a potential issue whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied trial counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Duarte was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Whether a motion for substitution of counsel should be granted is within a trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Corporan-Cuevas, </em>35 F.3d 953, 956 (4th Cir. 1994). An indigent defendant has no right to a particular attorney and can demand new counsel only for good cause. <em>See United States v. Gallop, </em>838 F.2d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1988). Further, a defendant does not have an absolute right to substitution of counsel. <em>United States v. Mullen, </em>32 F.3d 891, 895 (4th Cir.1994). In evaluating whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, this court must consider: (1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry; and (3) whether the attorney/client conflict was so great that it had resulted in total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense. <em>Gallop, </em>838 F.2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">In this case, Duarte filed his motion only two weeks before sentencing, and after pleading guilty. The district court conducted an adequate inquiry into Duarte\u2019s reasons for requesting his counsel withdraw. Duarte\u2019s sole reason for wanting new counsel was that his counsel had advised him that the letter from a witness indicating that Duarte had nothing to do with the drugs was not going to help him. However, this is not sufficient to warrant Duarte being appointed or retaining new counsel. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 435, 443-44 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that disagreement with counsel concerning trial strategy and tactics does not constitute a breakdown in communications sufficient to warrant new counsel). Duarte had no other complaints about his counsel and, in fact, stated that if he were to proceed to trial he would have counsel represent him. Counsel indicated that she was willing and capable to continue representing Duarte. We find no evidence in the record that the conflict between Duarte and counsel resulted in a total lack of communication preventing Duarte from receiving adequate representation. We therefore conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Duarte\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
