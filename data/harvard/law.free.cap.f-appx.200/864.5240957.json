On appeal, Payne argues that the district court erred by not sentencing him below the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment on his conviction for possession of ammunition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>correctly determined that it did not have discretion to sentence Payne below the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir. 2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Sept. 12, 2006) (No. 06-6496); <em>see also United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe emphasize that the district court was, and still is, bound by the statutory m\u00ednimums.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-9\">. It is undisputed that Payne was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), because he had at least three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
