Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">Coleman argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to appoint a mitigation investigator under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(1). He has not established that he is entitled to relief on this ground. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>15 F.3d 417, 421-22 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-18\">Coleman argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement to his offense level computation based on the Presentence Report finding that \u201cthe offense involved three or more firearms\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A). Coleman also argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement to his offense level computation after finding that the firearms he possessed unlawfully were \u201cpossessed ... in connection with another felony offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Coleman did not present any evidence rebutting the Presentence Report. The district court\u2019s finding that Coleman constructively possessed at least three firearms and that Coleman possessed the firearms in connection with felony possession of drugs with the intent to distribute them was plausible \u201cin light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Yi </em>451 F.3d 362, 373 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Houston, </em>364 F.3d 243, 248 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-23\">Coleman claims that the district court erred by sentencing Coleman under a mandatory guidelines regime, but the district court explicitly acknowledged at sentencing that the Guidelines are no longer mandatory. Coleman also argues that the district court erred by increasing his sentence on the basis of facts neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the district court was not operating under a mandatory guidelines regime when it sentenced Coleman, the district court was authorized to find pertinent sentencing facts. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 516-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-26\">Coleman argues that his sentence was unreasonable. The district court imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>a sentence within the guidelines range, which is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Coleman has not identified any \u00a7 3553(a) factor that the district court did not specifically consider as supporting the sentence it imposed. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
