Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Johnson first argues that the district court erred in admitting testimony from a co-defendant in rebuttal of Johnson\u2019s testimony. We review a district court\u2019s admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Stitt, </em>250 F.3d 878, 888 (4th Cir.2001). Evidentiary rulings are further subject to harmless error analysis. <em>See United States v. Brooks, </em>111 F.3d 365, 371 (4th Cir.1997). \u201c[Tjhere must be a nexus between the purported rebuttal evidence and the evidence that the purported rebuttal evidence seeks to rebut.\u201d <em>Stitt, </em>250 F.3d at 897 (citing <em>United States v. Curry, </em>512 F.2d 1299, 1305 (4th Cir.1975)). We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s rulings, and the briefs of the parties on appeal. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion, and even assuming admission of the rebuttal testimony was erroneous, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Next, Johnson argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court gave inadequate consideration to the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a district court\u2019s sentence \u201cfor unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). A sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. In determining the sentence, however, courts are still required to calculate and consider the Guidelines range, as well as the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) in checklist fashion; it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">\u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Johnson\u2019s sentence was within the properly calculated Guidelines range, and is thus presumptively reasonable. Upon review, we conclude that Johnson has not overcome this presumption, and that his sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>tentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
