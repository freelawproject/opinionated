He argues that the district court reversibly erred in treating his prior drug conviction under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). As Medina preserved his objection in the court below, we review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 356 (5th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-24\">When determining whether a prior offense warrants a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines, the district court generally \u201clooks to the elements of the prior offense rather than the facts underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005) (citation omitted). In certain cases, such as Medina\u2019s, a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>trict court may look beyond the elements of the offense when determining whether a drug trafficking offense was committed. <em>Taylor v. United, States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). However, only \u201cconclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt\u201d should be used by the district court \u201ccharacterizing a sentence for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274 (citing <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 19-23, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). This court has specifically rejected reliance on facts presented in presentence reports to characterize prior offenses for enhancement purposes. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274 (citing <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In the instant case, the documentation in the district court is too ambiguous to support an enhancement. <em>See Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 357. The Government provided the district court with the state Information and the minute entry for Medina\u2019s plea colloquy. The minute entry states that Medina pleaded guilty to \u201cviolation of section[s] \u00a7 11352.A [sic] Health and Safety Code in count II\u201d of the indictment. Only the first paragraph of count 2 of the indictment charged the violation of \u00a7 11352(a). That paragraph tracked the language of \u00a7 11352(a) which contains acts not encompassed by the Sentencing Guidelines enhancement sections and thus does not, without more, support an enhancement. <em>See Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d at 359; <em>see also </em>Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The minutes do not indicate whether Medina pleaded guilty to the second paragraph of count 2, which states a more specific drug violation. Like the abstract relied upon by the district court in <em>Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>the minutes are only a \u201cshorthand description! ]\u201d of the legal proceeding at issue. The minutes do not establish specifically what Medina pleaded. <em>See </em>405 F.3d at 358. Additionally, despite noting that \u201ccounts/enhancements\u201d were. dismissed, the minutes do not actually state <em>which </em>counts and enhancements the court dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Given the ambiguity of the evidence, the district court erred in its determination that the prior conviction was for a drug trafficking offense in the context of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) and increasing Medina\u2019s offense level on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Medina also contends that the treatment of felonies and aggravated felonies as sentencing factors under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that he should be resentenced subject to the two-year maximum set forth in \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Medina\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Medina contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. Medina concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has not been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">For these reasons, we vacate Medina\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
