Martin (\u201cMartin\u201d), proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of his 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition challenging his 1996 conviction for first degree felony murder. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">This appeal concerns two events at Martin\u2019s trial for which Martin now claims reversible error. The first occurred when Martin\u2019s counsel read from the transcript of a co-defendant\u2019s plea colloquy to support the defense theory that the co-defendant was the actual trigger man. Immediately after Martin\u2019s counsel read the factual stipulations to the co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the prosecution arose and read a victim impact statement (\u201cVIS\u201d) from the same transcript. Martin\u2019s counsel did not immediately object. The next morning, Martin\u2019s counsel made a motion \u2014 which the court granted \u2014 to have the VIS redacted from the trial transcript and to give the jurors a curative instruction. Never was the VIS again mentioned at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">The second event occurred during a lunch break when \u201csomeone came across the street and said something\u201d directed at the jurors. After learning of this event from a bailiff, the court inquired of the jurors collectively and asked if anyone had heard the person\u2019s remark. Four of the jurors raised their hands. Upon further questioning, all four of these jurors responded that they did not know the person, that the remark would not influence their decision in the case, and that they could disregard the remark. Martin\u2019s counsel informed the court of his satisfaction with the questioning and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">On appeal, Martin argues his trial counsel was ineffective (1) for introducing a co-defendant\u2019s plea colloquy without first seeking suppression of the VIS contained therein, and failing to object immediately to the prosecution\u2019s reading of the VIS; and (2) for failing to ask the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>for an individualized <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors after the lunch-break incident. He also argues that the government did not overcome the presumption of prejudice that attaches when a jury is exposed to extrinsic information.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>Sims <em>v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Federal habeas relief cannot be granted for claims adjudicated in state court unless the state court adjudication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The habeas petitioner has \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness [of a state court\u2019s factual findings] by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). We do not disturb a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Cunningham v. Zant, </em>928 F.2d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.1991). Questions of law as well as mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed <em>de novo. Jacobs v. Singletary, </em>952 F.2d 1282, 1287-88 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must demonstrate (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc) (citations and quotations omitted). Petitioner must show \u201cthat no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Marquard v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>429 F.3d 1278, 1304 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting <em>Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1315).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">First, failure of Martin\u2019s counsel to suppress or immediately object to the prosecution\u2019s reading of the VIS did not rise to the level of deficient performance. The Constitution \u201cerects no per se bar\u201d against victim impact statements. <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2609, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991); <em>see also Sims, </em>155 F.3d at 1317 (11th Cir.1998). Both the state courts and the district court found that Martin\u2019s counsel introduced the transcript to bolster the defense\u2019s claim that the co-defendant was the victim\u2019s killer and that counsel did so with the good faith belief that the VIS would be considered irrelevant and inadmissible. Martin\u2019s counsel later testified that he felt \u201cblindsided\u201d by the prosecution\u2019s reading of the statement. When the trial reconvened the next morning, Martin\u2019s counsel immediately made a motion to redact the VIS portion of the plea colloquy, strike the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, and give a curative instruction \u2014 all of which the court ordered. Martin\u2019s counsel did not act unreasonably in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Even assuming the performance of Martin\u2019s counsel was deficient, Martin did not demonstrate that absent the reading of the VIS, the outcome of his trial would have been different. The victim impact statement was short and used generic language, barely describing the offense or the victim. Martin has failed to establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Second, Martin\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to <em>voir dire </em>individually four jurors who heard an outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>statement during a lunch break. Martin\u2019s counsel acted reasonably when he accepted the court\u2019s inquiry into the matter and chose not to pursue the issue further, avoiding the appearance of questioning the jurors\u2019 credibility. Such decisions \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy\u201d and are \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2065. In addition, Martin has faded to establish that his counsel\u2019s acts or omissions caused prejudice to the outcome of the case. The trial court took corrective measures upon learning of the outside remark, and the jurors gave their assurance that they could disregard the remark and that it would not influence their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Martin also argues on appeal that the district court failed to consider the presumption of prejudice involved when a jury is tainted by extrinsic information. <em>Remmer v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 451, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954). <em>Remmer </em>held that the government may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the jurors\u2019 exposure to the information was \u201charmless to the defendant,\u201d <em>id., </em>which a court determines by examining \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1307 (11th Cir.2005). Also, to support a claim under <em>Remmer, </em>the extrinsic information must have \u201cpose[d] a reasonable possibility of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>748 F.2d 1519, 1533 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In this case, the trial court appropriately considered the circumstances of the outside remark, questioned the affected jurors, and ensured the remark would not influence the jurors\u2019 decision. \u201cBased on the record before us, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s adjudication of this claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Parker v. Head, </em>244 F.3d 831 (11th Cir.2001) (affirming district court\u2019s finding of no prejudice from extrinsic information because of the trial court\u2019s remedial actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">We conclude that the state courts reasonably determined that, in the light of applicable federal law, Martin failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudicial jury taint. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Martin\u2019s habeas corpus petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-14\">. As an initial matter, the certificate of appealability (\"COA\u201d) issued by the district court was vague as to the specific issues raised for appellate review. The district court should have made a more definite statement. Nonetheless, we have the option to address issues we deem worthy of a COA. <em>See Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (11th Cir. 2001); <em>see also Moore </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>344 F.3d 1313, 1315 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Peoples v. Haley, </em>227 F.3d 1342, 1347 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2000). Because the few issues raised by Martin\u2019s appeal are limited in scope and are the only issues briefed by the parties, we address these issues without remanding for clarification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
