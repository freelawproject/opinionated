Shaikh contends that the denial of the continuance was inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) and deprived him of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">We assume without deciding that Shaikh had pending a timely application for labor certification. Even a timely application for labor certification did not constitute good cause for a continuance because the grant of certification would have been only the first step in a long, discretionary process. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the denial of Shaikh\u2019s motion for a continuance was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">Shaikh also argues that the denial of his motion for a continuance violated his due process rights because he was prevented from pursuing an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). This contention fails because \u201cdiscretionary relief from removal, including an application for an adjustment of status, is not a liberty or property right that requires due process protection.\u201d <em>Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">Shaikh\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
