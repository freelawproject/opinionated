Porter, a social security claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ant, appeals the district court\u2019s decision to affirm the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that he was not entitled to social security benefits. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Porter filed for disability benefits under Title II and supplemental security income benefits under Title XVI in October 2001. He alleged his inability to work began on March 3, 2000. His claims were denied by the Commissioner, and he sought review by an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). After a hearing, the ALJ denied benefits. The ALJ concluded that, while Porter\u2019s impairments were severe, he retained the ability to perform sedentary work with the restriction that his employer must permit him to occasionally change position at the work site. Accordingly, the ALJ denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">After exhausting his administrative remedies, the ALJ\u2019s decision became final, and Porter sought review in federal district court under \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000). A federal magistrate judge heard his case and made recommendations to affirm the decision of the Commissioner. The district court adopted those recommendations and denied relief. Porter now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">II. Standard op Review</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">We review a denial of social security benefits \u201conly to ascertain whether (1) the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). A final decision is supported by substantial evidence if we find relevant evidence sufficient to establish that a reasonable mind could reach the same conclusion reached by the Commissioner. <em>See id. </em>In our review of the evidence, we do not substitute our judgment for the Commissioner\u2019s judgment. <em>See id. </em>If there are conflicts in the evidence, we accept the Commissioner\u2019s resolution of those conflicts so long as that resolution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Porter raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding as to Porter\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC). Second, Porter argues that the ALJ committed legal error prejudicial to Porter in determining his RFC. The Commissioner uses a sequential five-step inquiry to evaluate disability claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). In step four of the inquiry, the Commissioner considers whether the claimant has the RFC to perform past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">A. RFC Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">Porter argues that less than substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s omission of any manipulative or grip limitations with respect to the RFC finding. We disagree. The ALJ considered the reports of two physicians. First, Dr. Cravens, a treating physician, stated that Porter was limited in several ways but did not recommend any specific grip or manipulative limitations. Dr. Cravens did not note any grasping or squeezing limitations. As a treating physician, Dr. Craven\u2019s opinion, supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, was entitled to \u201cgreat weight.\u201d <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 566 (5th Cir.1995). Second, the ALJ considered the opinion of Dr. Stoll. He reported that Porter exhibited some numbness in his right wrist. He also noted that Porter\u2019s sensation was otherwise normal, and he did not exhibit any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>motor or muscle weakness. Dr. Stoll opined that Porter showed no physical limitations other than his multiple, moderate pain complaints. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Porter could perform sedentary work is consistent with these physician assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Porter contends, however, that the ALJ should have found limitations in his ability to use his right hand on the basis of a chiropractor\u2019s functional capacity evaluation. The test showed that Porter had strength deficits in grip testing. At the outset, the ALJ was not required to rely on the chiropractor\u2019s evaluation in making the RFC finding because a chiropractor is not an acceptable medical source. Acceptable medical sources include licensed physicians or osteopathic doctors, licensed or certified psychologists, licensed optometrists, licensed podiatrists, and qualified speech-language pathologists. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513(a), 416.913(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Nonetheless, a chiropractor\u2019s report may be used to show the severity of any impairment and how it affects the claimant\u2019s ability to work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513(d), 416.913(d). Here, the ALJ considered the chiropractor\u2019s evaluation. While that testing revealed strength deficits in Porter\u2019s right arm, the examination indicated that the range of motion was within normal limits. The chiropractor did not recommend specific grip or manipulation limitations. This evidence coupled with the other opinions that did not indicate that Porter exhibited significant functional limitations in his right arm provided substantial evidence in support of the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Porter could perform sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">B. Prejudicial Legal Error</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Porter contends that the ALJ committed prejudicial legal error in making its RFC finding. Specifically, Porter asserts that the ALJ erred by (1) failing to address his alleged limitations in manipulation and gripping through a function-by-function analysis and (2) failing to address the opinion of a \u201cmedical source.\u201d Porter argues that these two failures establish that the ALJ did not comply with Social Security Ruling (SSR) 96-8p. SSR 96-8p provides that an individual\u2019s RFC measures their \u201cmaximum remaining ability to do sustained work activities in an ordinary work setting on a regular and continuing basis.\u201d A \u201cregular and continuing basis\u201d is defined by SSR 96-8p as \u201c8 hours a day, for 5 days a week, or an equivalent work schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The ALJ complied with SSR 96-8p by considering all of the medical evidence, including the testing performed by the chiropractor, and Porter\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. The ALJ analyzed each alleged impairment in detail. The ALJ concluded that this evidence demonstrated that Porter \u201cretain[ed] the functional capacity to perform the exertional demands of sedentary work____\u201d The medical opinions did not warrant a contrary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">As to Porter\u2019s second argument, the ALJ did not err by failing to consider the opinion of a medical source \u2014 the chiropractor. As discussed above, a chiropractor is not listed as an acceptable medical source. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513(a), 416.913(a). In any event, the ALJ did acknowledge the chiropractor\u2019s opinion and noted that it \u201cdid not cite any specific limitations or restrictions that [Porter\u2019s] condition caused him.... \u201d Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Porter could perform sedentary work did not conflict with the chiropractor\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">Based on the foregoing, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
