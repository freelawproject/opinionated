Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In his complaint, Jones alleged that the defendants conducted an illegal search resulting in the seizure of evidence used to secure his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">In order to recover damages for harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the validity of the conviction or sentence has been called into question or that the conviction and sentence has been reversed or otherwise set aside. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. If a favorable judgment on an illegal search claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of the plaintiffs conviction, his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims must be dismissed pursuant to <em>Heck. See Jackson v. Vannoy, </em>49 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">Jones\u2019s allegations do not clearly reflect whether a favorable judgment on his illegal arrest claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction. Nevertheless, Jones does not allege an actual, compensable injury under <em>Heck </em>for purposes of \u00a7 1983 other than the injury of conviction. <em>See id. </em>The district court therefore did not err by dismissing the complaint, but the judgment should be modified to reflect a dismissal without prejudice. <em>See Price v. City of San Antonio, </em>431 F.3d 890, 895 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-21\">Jones also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for default judgment. The record shows that the defendants properly complied with the court\u2019s order. There is no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jones\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Jones is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED as modified; all outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
