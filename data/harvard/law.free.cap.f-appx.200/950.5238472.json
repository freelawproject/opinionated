Humphrey alleges (1) violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962-1964; (2) racial discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982; and (3) racial discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d by Appellees United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d) and Dell Corporation (\u201cDell\u201d). Upon review of the record and briefs, we find that Humphrey did not allege predicate criminal activity under RICO or allege facts that demonstrate disparate treatment on the basis of race. Accordingly, we affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">According to Humphrey\u2019s complaint, he ordered a business computer system from Dell using expedited delivery. Dell uses UPS exclusively for shipping purposes, and Humphrey was subsequently informed that his computer was awaiting pickup at the UPS will-call office. Humphrey attempted to retrieve his computer, but was denied delivery because the address listed on his driver\u2019s license did not match the delivery address. After obtaining further identification, Humphrey again attempted to pick up the computer, and it was released to him later that day. Humphrey, who is African-American, alleges that Dell and UPS used security concerns as a ploy to unnecessarily prolong and complicate delivery of the computer, and that their actions were motivated by racial animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1262 (11th Cir.2004). We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to Humphrey. <em>Id. </em>at 1263. As Humphrey is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we will construe his pleadings liberally, and we will hold them to a less stringent standard than we would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>hold pleadings drafted by attorneys. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The RICO Act allows for recovery for injuries based on violations of RICO\u2019s criminal provisions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c); <em>Langford v. Rite Aid of Ala., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe four elements of civil RICO liability are (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For RICO purposes, racketeering activity is defined as an act that is indictable under a list of criminal offenses including, <em>inter alia, </em>murder, kidnaping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, mail fraud, wire fraud or counterfeiting and a pattern is defined as two predicate acts of racketeering activity within ten years. <em>Id. </em>at 1311-12; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. Humphrey\u2019s claim clearly does not fall within these provisions. A single incident of delay in delivering a computer do not constitute criminal offenses under RICO, nor does it establish a pattern of RICO violations. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Humphrey\u2019s RICO claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Humphrey further makes a racial discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, alleging that UPS subjects minority customers to delay and harassment when picking up their deliveries. For a successful claim under \u00a7 1981, Humphrey was required to demonstrate that UPS and Dell intentionally discriminated against him because of his minority status with regard to certain enumerated activities. <em>Rutstein v. Avis Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc., </em>211 F.3d 1228, 1235 (11th Cir. 2000) (noting that intent to discriminate on the basis of race is the \u201ccritical element\u201d of a \u00a7 1981 claim). Similarly, for a \u00a7 1982 claim, Humphrey was required to demonstrate that he was deprived of his property interest because of an intentional act based on racial animus. <em>Jackson v. Okaloosa County, Fla. </em>21 F.3d 1531, 1543 (11th Cir. 1994). Humphrey\u2019s complaint, taken in the most favorable light possible, merely demonstrates that he was temporarily deprived of his property because of UPS procedures. It fails entirely to state facts sufficient to show that the restrictions were imposed on him because of his race or to compare his treatment to that of other groups picking up deliveries at the will-call center. His claim therefore fails, and we find that it was properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Finally, Humphrey alleges that as a recipient of federal funding, UPS can be held liable for racial discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. \u201cTitle VI prohibits discrimination on account of race, color, or national origin in all programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Vollert, </em>602 F.2d 87, 89 (5th Cir. 1979). Specifically, the statute requires that a person prove that he was denied participation, based on his race, in a federally funded program for which he was otherwise qualified. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. Since Humphrey does not claim that he was eligible for federal funding, but merely that UPS received some federal assistance, Title VI does not apply to him. We therefore find that the district court correctly dismissed his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
