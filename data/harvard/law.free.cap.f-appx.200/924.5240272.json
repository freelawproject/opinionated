Organes-Gandavilla argues that his sentence is unreasonable because of an unwarranted sentencing disparity between his sentence and the sentences of his co-conspirators. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-18\">\u2018We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-19\">Section 3553 of the sentencing guidelines includes as a sentencing factor \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). The district court considered this factor and found that the greater sentence imposed on Organes-Gandavilla was not unwarranted because Organes-Gandavilla was responsible for a firearm. The sentence imposed was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-20\">The sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b946-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
