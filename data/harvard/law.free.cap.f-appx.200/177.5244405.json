He timely appeals, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Viewing the evidence as required, <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996), we find there was substantial evidence to support Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction for Count 4. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We reject Johnson\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence that the guns at issue were in furtherance of his drug trafficking. <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002). To the extent that Johnson alleges erroneous jury instructions regarding Count 4, this court only reviews for plain error, because he failed to object to the instructions below. Fed.R.Crim.P. Rule 30(d). We find no plain error in the district court\u2019s instructions for Count 4. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (giving review standard for plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
