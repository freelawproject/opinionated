California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). McMorris has filed a response in which he requests the appointment of new counsel. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on McMorris\u2019s appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-19\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Morris\u2019s reply discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, defendant\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
