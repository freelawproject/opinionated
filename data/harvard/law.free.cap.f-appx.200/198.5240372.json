We previously dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Diawara v. Gonzales, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 132 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished). On May 11, 2005, Congress enacted the REAL ID Act, adding a new subsection to the judicial review provisions. The Supreme Court subsequently granted Diawara\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Having reconsidered Diawara\u2019s petition for review in light of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005), we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-24\">Diawara challenges the IJ\u2019s findings that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to establish extraordinary circumstances for an exception under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2) (2000). He contends his former counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance constituted extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing and a violation of his due process rights. We previously concluded we lacked jurisdiction to consider Diawara\u2019s challenges to the denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>asylum application pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(8) (2000). Even after the REAL ID Act, \u201cdiscretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals.\u201d <em>Vasile v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.2005). The timeliness of an alien\u2019s asylum application is usually a question of fact. <em>See Mehilli v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.2005). However, pursuant to the REAL ID Act, we have a narrowly circumscribed jurisdiction to resolve constitutional claims or questions of law raised by aliens seeking discretionary relief. <em>Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2973, 165 L.Ed.2d 955 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We conclude that even in light of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we are precluded from considering Diawara\u2019s ineffective assistance claim at this stage because he failed to properly exhaust administrative remedies with respect to the claim in his direct appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000); <em>Ming Ming Wijono v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 868, 871-72 (8th Cir. 2006); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 596 (4th Cir.1999). We also lack jurisdiction over Diawara\u2019s challenges to the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of deportation and relief under the Convention Against Torture because Diawara failed to properly exhaust these claims in his appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
