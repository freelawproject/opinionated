Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). In determining the sentence, however, courts are still required to calculate and consider the guidelines range, as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>In sentencing defendants after <em>Booker, </em>district courts should apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, taking into account that the resulting guideline range is advisory only. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-21\">Here, the district court correctly calculated Canady\u2019s range under the now-advisory sentencing guidelines using a preponderance of the evidence standard. After giving due consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court then sentenced him within the statutorily prescribed range for his offenses and below the range pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>vided for by the sentencing guidelines. Canady has not rebutted the presumption that the district court imposed a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">We also reject Canady\u2019s argument that the district court failed to follow this court\u2019s mandate when it conducted the re-sentencing proceeding on remand. The district court fully complied with this court\u2019s direction that it \u201cdetermine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all the factual findings appropriate for that determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-22\"> Canady was initially sentenced to a total prison term of 360 months. On appeal, we vacated Canady\u2019s sentence and remanded for re-sentencing. See <em>United States v. Canady, </em>139 Fed.Appx. 483 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
