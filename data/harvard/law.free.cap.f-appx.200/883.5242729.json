After review, we dismiss the petition to the extent it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s November 30, 2005 order affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) removal order. We deny Sanchez\u2019s petition to the extent it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s February 8, 2006 denial of the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b906-18\">Sanchez, a native and citizen of Colombia, was admitted to the United States on November 18, 2001 as a non-immigrant visitor authorized to stay until May 17, 2002. Once in the United States, Sanchez filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), claiming that he had been persecuted by paramilitary groups in Colombia based on his membership in a social group and his political opinion. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a notice to appear charging Sanchez with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who had remained in the United States longer than permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">After an asylum hearing, the IJ found that Sanchez was removable and that Sanchez had failed to meet his burden of proof to show that he was eligible for asylum, withholding of removal or CAT relief. Sanchez appealed the IJ\u2019s order to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on November 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-20\">On December 20, 2005, Sanchez filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA and repeated the arguments he made in his appeal to the BIA. On February 8, 2006, the BIA denied Sanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Sanchez filed a petition for review with this Court on March 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On appeal, Sanchez seeks to challenge both the BIA\u2019s November 30, 2005 order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision and the BIA\u2019s February 8, 2006 order denying his motion for reconsideration. We do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s November 30, 2005 order because Sanchez did not file his petition for review until March 8, 2006, more than 30 days after that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1) (requiring a petition for review to be filed within 30 days of the final order of removal); <em>see also Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining that the statutory time limit for filing a petition for review is not subject to equitable tolling based on a timely filing of a motion to reopen). To the extent Sanchez seeks review of the November 30, 2005 final order of removal, his petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Because Sanchez filed his petition for review within 30 days of the denial of his motion for reconsideration, we have jurisdiction to review this claim. Sanchez argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion for reconsideration because the BIA did not use its independent judgment. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall specify errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The BIA denied Sanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration because the motion had failed to demonstrate any error in the November 30, 2005 order. In fact, Sanchez\u2019s motion to reconsider contained virtually the same arguments found in his appeal brief submitted to the BIA. Rather than point to any errors in the BIA\u2019s denial of his request for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief, Sanchez merely reiterated the facts as presented first to the IJ and later to the BIA in the appeal brief. Under these circumstances, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to reconsider arguments it had already rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
