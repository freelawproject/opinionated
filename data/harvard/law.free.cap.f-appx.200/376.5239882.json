In a prior opinion, we rejected as foreclosed Bonilla\u2019s claim that the felony and aggravated felony provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional. <em>U.S. v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 318-19 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)). We also rejected the Government\u2019s argument that Bonilla had waived his objections to his crime of violence enhancement, and, after reviewing for plain error, we vacated Bonilla\u2019s sentence and remanded the case to the district court for re-sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 319-22. The district court re-sentenced Bonilla, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-20\">Bonilla again challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony convictions as sentencing factors, but he concedes that this claim is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Neither party argues the effect of the previous panel\u2019s decision, but this court explicitly addressed this argument and held that the claim was foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d at 318-19. Therefore, we should first consider whether under the doctrine of the law of the case, Bonilla\u2019s claim should be heard a second time. <em>See United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 752-753 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-21\">The law of the case doctrine generally instructs that \u201ca prior decision of this court will be followed without re-examination ... unless (i) the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different, (ii) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues, or (iii) the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Becerra, </em>155 F.3d at 752-53 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">In this case, the previous panel squarely and explicitly reached the issue that Bonilla now attempts to raise anew. <em>Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d at 318-19. None of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine are applicable to this case, and application of the doctrine here would further the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>policy goals the doctrine is generally meant to achieve. <em>See Becerra, </em>155 F.3d at 752-53. Accordingly, we decline to reconsider this court\u2019s prior holding under the doctrine of the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
