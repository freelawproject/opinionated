Thomas argued in his \u00a7 2241 petition that the sentences imposed following his guilty-plea convictions of possessing with the intent to distribute marijuana and misprision of a felony were invalid. Thomas\u2019s numerous claims were based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) .</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition alleged errors that occurred at sentencing. Such errors may not be asserted in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Thomas has not shown that his claims satisfy the mandates of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27; <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Thomas\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s application of the savings clause violates the Suspension Clause of the United States Constitution is foreclosed. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 346 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901 n. 19. Thomas\u2019s argument that the AEDPA\u2019s restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions violate the Suspension Clause lacks merit. <em>Cf. Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 664, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996) (holding that successive-petition restrictions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) do not violate the Suspension Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">Thomas\u2019s argument that the district court should have considered his claims under its inherent powers because they do not constitute a collateral attack on his sentence is inadequately briefed and lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 558 n. 2 (5th Cir.2002). Thomas\u2019s suggestion that the errors in his case were structural and should override all statutory restrictions has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-19\">The district court did not err in dismissing Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 385 (5th Cir.2003). As the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Thomas\u2019s substantive claims, we need not consider them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-20\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
