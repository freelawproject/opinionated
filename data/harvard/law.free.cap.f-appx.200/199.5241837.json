Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>though we previously affirmed Locklear\u2019s convictions and sentence, the Supreme Court granted Locklear\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We reaffirm Locklear\u2019s conviction, which he does not challenge, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Locklear contends that the district court improperly sentenced him when it imposed a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts to which he admitted in his guilty plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because he failed to raise this claim below, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Locklear pled guilty to distribution of at least five grams of cocaine base and conspiracy to distribute at least fifty grams of cocaine base. At sentencing, the district court held Locklear accountable for 1.76 kilograms of cocaine base for a base offense level of thirty-eight under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2004). The district court also added two offense levels for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and subtracted three offense levels for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a). The drug quantity stated in the indictment equates only to a base offense level of thirty-two and not the base offense level of thirty-eight upon which he was sentenced. Also, Locklear\u2019s guilty plea did not include an admission to the possession of a firearm; thus the district court\u2019s two offense level increase for possession of a dangerous weapon also violated the Sixth Amendment. Because Locklear\u2019s criminal history level was II, the district court\u2019s drug quantity and role in the offense factual findings increased Locklear\u2019s sentencing range from 135-168 months to 235-293 months. Locklear\u2019s 235-month sentence thus exceeded the sentence that could have been imposed based only on the facts admitted to in the guilty plea. The district court erred in basing the sentence on judge-found facts under a mandatory guidelines regime, and the error was plain. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48. Because Locklear\u2019s sentence was longer than what could have been imposed based on the guilty plea alone, the error affected his substantial rights, <em>id. </em>at 548, and we will notice the error, <em>id. </em>at 555. Therefore, Locklear must be resentenced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all the factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Locklear\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\">. The Government contends that Locklear admitted the higher drug quantity by not objecting to the presentence report. However, in <em>United States v. Milam, </em>443 F.3d 382 (4th Cir.2006), this court determined that a failure to object to the presentence report does not constitute an admission of facts set forth in the report for the purposes of <em>Booker. </em>\"To presume, infer, or deem a fact admitted because the defendant has remained silent is contrary to the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w] e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Locklear\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
