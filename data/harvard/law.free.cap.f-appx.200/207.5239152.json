In his action, Rankins sought compensatory and punitive money damages, declarative relief, a temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunctive relief. While we grant Rankins leave to proceed without prepayment of fees under the PLRA, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">As in his previous appeal before this panel, <em>Rankins v. Rowland, </em>188 Fed.Appx. 201 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished), Rankins alleged the ventilation system of the \u201cH-Con Supermax Unit\u201d in which he was housed at the Butner Correctional Facility was inadequate because the air contained dust and lint particles that caused him to have burning eyes, to cough excessively, and to cough up mucus mixed with blood. He alleged in his complaint that his grievances were denied in June and July 2005 and that his medical treatment for the cough, chest pain, stomach pain, vomiting, and blood in his stool was inadequate. He also claimed he was denied exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">Rankins is now incarcerated in Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, so his claims for a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief are now moot, and we dismiss the appeal as to those claims for that reason. Though Rankins does not complain on appeal about the district court\u2019s disposition of his claims for damages (which are not mooted by his transfer) based upon inadequate medical care and harm from the alleged inadequate ventilation system at Butner, his appeal as to those claims is interlocutory. The district court ordered Rankins to particularize those claims, so the court\u2019s order is not a final, appealable order in that respect. For these reasons, we dismiss Rankins\u2019 appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
