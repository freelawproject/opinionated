Rosa-Padilla argues that the district court clearly erred during sentencing when it denied him a minor-role reduction and that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">We review the application of the sentencing guidelines by the district court <em>de novo </em>and review findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177-78 (11th Cir.2005). We review sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction for a minor role for a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5. Whether a defendant is a minor participant is based on the criminal conduct for which the defendant is held responsible. <em>United States v. Rodriguez DeVaron, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir. 1999). In a drug offense, the court may not consider the \u201cgreater drug conspiracy\u201d but only the conduct that determined the defendant\u2019s base offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 942. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. Similarly, the defendant\u2019s culpability is determined by comparison with other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Rosa-Padilla and several codefendants were arrested as they attempted to transport approximately 2,600 kilograms of cocaine, and Rosa-Padilla\u2019s relevant conduct was limited to that cargo. Because evidence was presented that Rosa-Padilla assisted in the navigation of the boat, recruited at least one other member of the conspiracy to join, and was identified by his co-conspirators as the captain of the \u201cgo fast\u201d boat, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Rosa-Padilla did not qualify for a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">We also conclude that Rosa-Padilla\u2019s sentence is reasonable. \u201cWe are required \u2018to determine whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable in the context of the factors outlined in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)].\u201d\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005)). Review for reasonableness is deferential, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005), and \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing. reflects that the district court considered the section 3553 factors and the arguments made by Rosa-Padilla regarding his background and personal characteristics. We cannot say that Rosa-Padilla\u2019s sentence, which falls at the low end of the undisputed guideline range, is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>The sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
