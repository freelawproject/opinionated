Although we previously dismissed this appeal, <em>see Green v. Ozmint, </em>155 Fed.Appx. 694 (4th Cir.2005), we subsequently granted panel rehearing and denied rehearing en banc. On rehearing, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000). Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). As noted in our prior opinion, the district court\u2019s denial of Green\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order is not appealable, and we accordingly dismiss the appeal as to this portion of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">On the other hand, the district court\u2019s denial of Green\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction is immediately appealable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (2000). With respect to the portion of the appeal regarding the district court\u2019s denial of Green\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Green v. Ozmint, </em>No. CA-04-22074-2 (D.S.C. Mar. 16, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
