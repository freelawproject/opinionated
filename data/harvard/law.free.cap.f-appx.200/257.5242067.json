On appeal, DIRECTV challenges the court\u2019s dismissal of these two claims. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">In the context of a default judgment, \u201c[t]he defendant, by his default, admits the plaintiffs well-pleaded allegations of fact\u201d so a court must \u201cdetermine whether the well-pleaded allegations in [plaintiffs] complaint support the relief sought in th[e] action.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Homecomings Fin. Network, </em>253 F.3d 778, 780 (4th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s default does not in itself warrant the court in entering a default judgment. There must be a sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered.\u201d <em>Nishimatsu Constr. Co. v. Houston Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1975). Further, a \u201cdefendant is not held to admit facts that are not well-pleaded or to admit conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">With respect to DIRECTV\u2019s claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 and \u00a7 2520, the district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that DIRECTV did not have a cognizable claim, finding that the legislative history of the Wiretap Act indicated that the statute was not intended to protect commercial satellite services from surreptitious interceptions by private individuals. While this appeal was pending, we issued an opinion in <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Nicholas, </em>403 F.3d 223 (4th Cir.2005), which is dispositive of this claim. In <em>Nicholas, </em>we specifically concluded that DIRECTV could maintain a cause of action under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 and \u00a7 2520 against a private individual for the alleged interception of its encrypted satellite transmissions. <em>See also DIRECTV, Inc. v. Pepe, </em>431 F.3d 162 (3d Cir.2005) (same). Accordingly, because the district court erred in dismissing DIRECTV\u2019s claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 and \u00a7 2520, for failure to state a claim, we vacate the judgment and remand with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">With respect to 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 605(e)(4), the district court held that \u00a7 605(e)(4) is intended to cover sellers and manufacturers of intercepting devices, not end users, and accordingly dismissed the count for failure to state a claim. In <em>DIRECTV v. Robson, </em>420 F.3d 532 (5th Cir.2005), the Fifth Circuit rejected the district court\u2019s construction that \u00a7 605(e)(4) exempts individual users. 420 F.3d at 543-44. Specifically, the court held \u00a7 605(e)(4) pertains to commercial as well as individual users. <em>Id. </em>at 544. We find the reasoning in <em>Robson </em>persuasive and accordingly conclude that \u00a7 605(e)(4) does not categorically exempt individual users. We offer no opinion at this time on whether Pernites\u2019 alleged actions in removing and inserting pirate access devices and/or inserting illegally programmed access cards into valid DIRECTV receivers qualify as \u201cassembly\u201d and/or \u201cmodification\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 605(e)(4). Accordingly, we vacate judgment on this claim also and remand to the district court for an opportunity to consider in the first instance whether the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate assembly or modification within the meaning of \u00a7 605(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
