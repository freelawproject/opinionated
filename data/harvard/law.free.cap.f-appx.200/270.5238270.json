Because we find that Johnson alleged sufficient facts to establish the presence of imminent danger, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">In his detailed complaint, Johnson alleged that prior to and upon his September 1998 assignment to Virginia\u2019s \u201csupermax\u201d prisons,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> he was threatened by defendants with bodily harm and death if he persisted in litigation and defending himself from \u201cabuse.\u201d As a result, Johnson lives in perpetual fear of being assaulted, especially because the defendants have periodically made good on their threats. Johnson described in detail a number of alleged assaults by prison guards beginning in 1999. The assaults were invariably unprovoked and resulted in serious injuries, including severe cuts, electrocution, and a concussion. Johnson claimed that the most recent assault occurred in February 2005, one month before he filed his complaint. In that assault, guards allegedly took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Johnson outside and slammed him face-first into a wall. Johnson sustained a variety of injuries, including a broken front tooth, whiplash, and a deep laceration to his lower lip. Johnson sought damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The district court dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g). The court took judicial notice of the fact that Johnson had had at least three civil actions dismissed for failure to state a claim. Therefore, Johnson was ineligible to proceed without prepayment of fees unless he demonstrated that he was \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The court concluded that Johnson had alleged no facts from which it could conclude that he was presently under such danger. Therefore, the district court dismissed the action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">It was undisputed that Johnson had the requisite three dismissals required by \u00a7 1915(g). Therefore, the question before the district court was whether he showed that he was in imminent danger of serious physical harm either when he filed his complaint or at some time thereafter. <em>See Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 314 (3rd Cir.2001). \u201c[T] he exception focuses on the risk that the conduct complained of threatens continuing or future injury, not whether the inmate deserves a remedy for past misconduct.\u201d <em>Martin v. Shelton, </em>319 F.3d 1048, 1050 (8th Cir. 2003). Vague, speculative, or conclusory allegations are insufficient to invoke the exception of \u00a7 1915(g); rather, the inmate must make \u201cspecific fact allegations of ongoing serious physical injury, or of a pattern of misconduct evidencing the likelihood of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We find that Johnson\u2019s complaint presented facts that sufficiently established the existence of an imminent danger of serious physical harm. He detailed unprovoked assaults and resulting serious physical injuries beginning in 1999 and continuing to 2005. The complaint alleges that Johnson was threatened with severe bodily injury or death upon his entry into \u201csuper-max,\u201d and that Johnson lives in an atmosphere of constant fear in which he never knows when the next violent assault may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u201c[T]he determination that [the prisoner] alleged imminent danger of serious physical injury does not end our inquiry.\u201d <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004). Because we may affirm the district court for any reason based on the record, the next inquiry is whether the complaint fails to state a claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">We conclude that Johnson\u2019s complaint states a claim under the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits the infliction of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. VIII. The Amendment \u201cnot only outlaws excessive sentences but also protects inmates from inhumane treatment and conditions while imprisoned.\u201d <em>Williams v. Benjamin, </em>77 F.3d 756, 761 (4th Cir.1996); <em>see Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 298, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). To succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim for cruel and unusual punishment, a prisoner must establish the deprivation of a basic human need was sufficiently serious and that prison officials acted with a \u201csufficiently culpable state of mind.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>501 U.S. at 298, 111 S.Ct. 2321. The objective element generally requires more than a de minimis use of force. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). De minimis injury defeats a plaintiffs excessive force claim \u201cabsent the most extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Norman v. Taylor, </em>25 F.3d 1259, 1262-63 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Here, Johnson sufficiently stated a claim of an Eighth Amendment violation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>allegedly repeated and unprovoked nature of the assaults establishes the necessary state of mind. Further, both the force used and the injuries claimed to have been sustained were more than de minimis.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We accordingly vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with directions that Johnson be permitted to proceed without prepayment of fees. The matter is remanded for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-13\"> Johnson has been transferred between Wallens Ridge State Prison and Red Onion State Prison, Virginia\u2019s two supermax facilities, since 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
