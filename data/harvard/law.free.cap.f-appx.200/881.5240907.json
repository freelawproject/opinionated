We VACATE our prior opinion in this case and substitute the following in its place:</p>\n<p id=\"b904-22\">Ofelia Canals appeals the order granting judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in favor of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami, Inc. (\u201cCatholic Charities\u201d) on Canals\u2019s claim alleging Catholic Charities violated the Florida Whistle Blower Protection Act (\u201cFWBPA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 448.101 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We review the district court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. See Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) by considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See Pulte Home Corp., v. Osmose Wood Preserving, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 734, 739 (11th Cir.1995). Judgment as a matter of law for the defendant is proper when there is insufficient evidence to prove an element of the claim, which means that no jury reasonably could have reached a verdict for the plaintiff on that claim. <em>See Collado v. UPS, </em>419 F.3d 1143, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Canals alleged Catholic Charities violated the FWBPA, which provides the following: \u201c[a]n employer may not take any retaliatory personnel action against an employee because the employee has ... [objected to, or refused to participate in, any activity, policy, or practice of the employer which is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 448.102. Canals asserted that she was terminated after she refused to commit perjury, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 837.012, 837.02. In its order, the district court outlined the elements of a perjury claim under Florida law and concluded that Canals\u2019s FWBPA claim failed because she presented <em>no </em>evidence on the \u201cunder oath in an official proceeding\u201d element of a perjury claim. Accordingly, the district court set aside the jury\u2019s verdict and entered judgment in favor of Catholic Charities.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">From our own review of the record, we too can find no evidence that Canals made a false statement \u201cunder oath in an official proceeding,\u201d an element of a perjury claim under Florida law. Therefore, the district court properly entered judgment as a matter of law, based on Canals\u2019s failure to present any evidence on one of the elements of her FWBPA claim. <em>Collado, </em>419 F.3d at 1149. In short, the district court carefully considered all of the arguments Canals raises in this appeal, including her untimely assertion that the underlying violation of law that supported her FWBPA was <em>conspiracy </em>to commit perjury. Based upon the district court\u2019s well-reasoned analysis, we affirm, after a <em>de novo </em>review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-13\">. We discern no error in the entry of judgment as a matter of law on Canals\u2019s other claims under Florida law, or the entry of final judgment, consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict, on Canals\u2019s claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, Canals also challenges the district court\u2019s evidentiary decision to exclude certain what-she-terms \u201cdefamatory memoranda\u201d that would support her ADEA claim and the court\u2019s denial of her mid-trial motion to amend her witness list to call a witness not listed on any of her Canals\u2019s witness lists. The district court did not abuse its discretion by disallowing the memoranda, which the court found, in essence, were irrelevant. <em>Cf, Walker v. NationsBank of Fla., N.A., </em>53 F.3d 1548, 1554 (11th Cir.1995) (reviewing district court exclusionary ruling for clear abuse of discretion). We likewise discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to amend, which Canals filed on the second day of a trial that followed many months of discovery, during which the district court gave Canals numerous extensions of time to comply with the court\u2019s pre-trial schedule. <em>Cf. Rogers v. Muscogee County Sch. Dist., </em>165 F.3d 812, 818 (11th Cir.1999) (\"A district court's decision to exclude a witness not listed on the pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>order is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
