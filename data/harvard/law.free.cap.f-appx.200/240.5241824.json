Godbolt was also separately convicted of another count of armed robbery and aiding and abetting, pursuant to a Criminal Information.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Godbolt was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count Five and the Criminal Information and 84 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count Six, to be served consecutively. Gilchrist was sentenced to a total of 200 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 116 months on Count Five, to be served consecutively with 84 months on Count Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Godbolt\u2019s and Gilchrist\u2019s counsel on appeal filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but urging this court to reconsider our decision in <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2005). Gilchrist filed a pro se supplemental brief alleging claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Godbolt was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The parties contend this court should reconsider its decision in <em>Blick </em>because Godbolt and Gilchrist could not have understood at the time they waived their rights to appeal that their sentences were unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and hence their appellate waivers were involuntary. We find the argument is moot because the Government has not sought enforcement of the waiver in these appeals. Moreover, because the district court clearly announced that it would impose identical sentences if the guidelines were treated as advisory, any <em>Booker </em>error in these cases was harmless. <em>See United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448, 451-52 (4th Cir.2006) (concluding that a Sixth Amendment error was harmless because the error did not affect the outcome of the proceeding, based on the district court\u2019s announcement of an identical alternate sentence after considering the guidelines as advisory only).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Gilchrist argues that his counsel was ineffective. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999). Instead, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant generally must bring his ineffective assistance claims in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). An exception exists where the record conclusively shows ineffective assistance. <em>Id. </em>Because the record on its face does not conclusively demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, Gilchrist\u2019s claims are not cognizable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Godbolt\u2019s and Gilchrist\u2019s convictions and sentences. We also deny Gilchrist\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel. This court requires that counsel inform their clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\"> Godbolt waived prosecution by indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
