SMITH, Circuit Judge:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Roy and Carol Mudrick appeal a summary judgment determining that their decedent was a Jones Act seaman and a ruling that federal maritime law bars recovery. For the reasons stated below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 son, Jonathan Mudrick, was fatally wounded when he was struck on the head by a steel anchor cable while working aboard a barge in Nikishi Bay, Alaska. His widow, acting on behalf of herself, her children, and the estate, negotiated a mediated settlement of $2,900,000.00 with Mudriek\u2019s employer, Cook Inlet Spill Prevention and Response, Inc. Both parties to the settlement agreed that, for purposes of the mediation, Mudrick was a Jones Act seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The Mudrieks sued under the Texas Wrongful Death Act, alleging negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty. Defendants manufactured the stern anchor winch that Mudrick was operating at the time of his death. The Mudrieks seek only non-pecuniary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">Defendants moved for the application of federal maritime law and for summary judgment that the decedent was a Jones Act seaman. The district court granted the motion, finding that Mudrick was a Jones Act seaman as a matter of law. The court ruled that federal maritime law applies because the injury took place on navigable water and injury to a Jones Act Seaman has a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce. <em>See Scarborough v. Clemco Indus., 391 </em>F.3d 660, 665 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>513 U.S. 527, 534, 115 S.Ct. 1043, 130 L.Ed.2d 1024 (1995). The court concluded, on the basis of <em>Scarborough, </em>391 F.3d at 668, that the survivors of a Jones Act seaman cannot recover non-pecuniary damages from non-employer third-parties. Accordingly, the court dismissed the claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-20\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo. Lee v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>34 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1994). We conclude that the district court did not apply the correct legal standard governing summary judgment on an issue as to which the moving party bears the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-21\">Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). The district court applied the standard in <em>Celotex v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), under which, in the district court\u2019s words, \u201c[t]he party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of \u2018informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548). The non-movant must then present \u201cspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The <em>Celotex </em>standard, however, is appropriate only where, as in that case, the non-moving party bears the burden of proof on the issue that the moving party seeks to have determined through summary judgment. Here, because defendants seek legal benefit from a determination that Mudrick was a Jones Act Seaman, they bear the burden of proof on that issue. <em>See Bernard v. Binnings Constr. Co., </em>741 F.2d 824, 827 (5th Cir.1984). Thus, to obtain summary judgment, defendants cannot force plaintiffs to come forward with \u201cspecific facts showing there [is] a genuine issue for trial\u201d merely by pointing to parts of the record that defendants believe illustrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Instead, defendants must establish, as a matter of law, all essential elements of their defense before plaintiffs can be obligated to bring forward any specific facts alleged to rebut defendants\u2019 case. <em>See Chaplin v. Nations Credit Corp., </em>307 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">It is uncertain how consideration of defendants\u2019 motion under this more stringent standard would have affected the district court\u2019s decision. The court applied the Supreme Court\u2019s two criteria for determining whether someone is a Jones Act seaman. First, \u201cthe worker\u2019s duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.\u201d <em>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, </em>515 U.S. 347, 376, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995). Second, \u201cthe worker must have a connection to a vessel in navigation (or an identifiable fleet of vessels) that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding the district court\u2019s citation of <em>Celotex, </em>it appears from its discussion of the first requirement that it believed that the defendants had proved as a matter of law that Mudrick had satisfied the first criterion and that this showing had been insufficiently rebutted by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">It is less obvious, however, whether the court would have come to a similar conclusion with respect to the second criterion, the duration of Mudrick\u2019s connection to a vessel in navigation, had it applied the standard for summary judgment that we have stated above. The court provided sparse discussion of plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the accuracy of decedent\u2019s timesheets and gave no explanation (other than pointing out that 32% exceeded the minimum threshold to be determined a Jones Act seaman) to support its determination that, under the circumstances of this case, the percentage of time decedent spent working in connection with a vessel was enough to establish conclusively his status under the second criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">We VACATE the summary judgment and remand for reconsideration. Because the district court\u2019s application of federal maritime law and its dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claims are predicated on its finding that Mudrick was a Jones Act seaman as a matter of law, we VACATE these orders as well and remand for further proceedings as needed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
