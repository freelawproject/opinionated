Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Nino-Jaramillo challenges as unconstitutional \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>offense. Nino-Jaramillo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Nino-Jaramillo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Nino-Jaramillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">For the first time on appeal, Nino-Jaramillo argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)(2004) based on its determination that his 1991 conviction under Tex. Penal code \u00a7 21.11(a) for indecency with a child was a crime of violence. A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) is defined to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). However, Nino-Jaramillo argues that his conviction under \u00a7 21.11(a) did not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d because the victim of an offense under \u00a7 21.11(a) can be as old as a day under seventeen and such an individual would not fall under the generic, contemporary meaning of the term minor as it is used in the vast majority of statutes proscribing sexual activity with or against persons below a certain age.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604 (5th Cir.2000), this court held that the victim of a \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) offense, \u201c \u2018a child younger than 17 years,\u2019 \u201d is clearly a \u201c \u2018minor.\u2019\u201d It also held that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) was \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u201d meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 604-05. Although it is unclear whether Nino-Jaramillo was convicted under \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) or (2) and the <em>Zavala-Sustaita </em>court reviewed an enhancement imposed under a previous version of \u00a7 2L1.2, its reasoning is dispositive in this case. Nino-Jaramillo has not shown error, plain or otherwise. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
