The district court denied his request for permission to file the application and did not consider the \u00a7 2254 application. Accordingly, the motion for COA is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">Lawson\u2019s motions for recusal, reconsideration, and leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>were unauthorized. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Because he has appealed from the denial of unauthorized motions, <em>see id., </em>his appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. His request to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
