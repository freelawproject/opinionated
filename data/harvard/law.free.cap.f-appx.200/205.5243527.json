His attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but claiming the sentence was greater than necessary because it was above the statutory minimum. Mateo declined to file a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-22\">Mateo\u2019s sentence was six months more than the statutory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment and near the low end of the advisory guidelines. In imposing the sentence, the district court properly calculated the guidelines range of imprisonment and considered the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). We find the sentence reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-23\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Mateo\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
