Potter, the Postmaster General of the United States (\u201cPostmaster General\u201d), in her employment discrimination lawsuit, alleging disparate treatment based on race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, Roland argues the district court erred by entering summary judgment on her disparate-treatment claim, after finding (1) that she had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination because she was unable to identify a similarly situated employee who had been treated more favorably, and (2) that she had not shown the Postmaster General\u2019s proffered reasons for her demotion were pretextual. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Fisher v. State Mut. Ins. Co., </em>290 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). To warrant the entry of summary judgment, the moving party must demonstrate that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>HCA Health Servs. of Ga., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 982, 991 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA mere \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence supporting the opposing party\u2019s position will not suffice; there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party.\u201d <em>Walker v. Darby, </em>911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">The parties are familiar with the relevant facts and we only summarize them here. Roland began working for the U.S. Postal Service in 1978. In 1984, she was promoted to the position of Supervisor, and in 1985, she became an Officer in Charge at the Grovetown, Georgia post office. In 1986, Roland again was promoted, this time to the position of Postmaster of Louisville, Georgia, a \u201clevel 18\u201d post office. Then, in 1990, she became the Postmaster of Hephzibah, Georgia, a \u201clevel 20\u201d post office. In May 1999, Roland was demoted to the position of Part-Time Flexible Clerk in the Northern Augusta post office.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Roland filed the instant action against the Postmaster General and her former U.S. Postal Service supervisor, Billy Pierce, a Manager of Post Office Operations for the Southern Georgia District, asserting that she was improperly demoted and discriminated against based on her race, in violation of Title VII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She further alleged that because of her race, she was treated differently from two similarly situated Caucasian males in terms of the discipline she received for allegedly conducting her Mary Kay business during work hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The Postmaster General answered, denying liability and asserting several defenses. After discovery was completed, the Postmaster General moved for summary judgment, arguing that: (1) Roland could not satisfy her burden of showing a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination under Title VII because she failed to show that a similarly situated individual outside of her protected class was treated differently; (2) the U.S. Postal Service had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Roland \u2014 that she conducted Mary Kay sales activities while at work; and (3) Roland could not demonstrate that the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s proffered legitimate reason for terminating her was pretextual. In support of the motion for summary judgment, the Postmaster General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>submitted a statement of material facts as to which there were no genuine issues to be tried and an appendix of supporting materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">According to the summary judgment materials, Roland had been charged with \u201cunacceptable conduct\u201d relating to her Mary Kay business, and an unrelated charge pertaining to the use of improper time recording procedures. Her supervisor, Pierce, alleged that he received complaints from subordinate employees in Roland\u2019s office. According to these complaints, Roland \u201chad solicited and sold Mary Kay products on postal premises to postal employees and postal customers.\u201d Pierce investigated the complaints and concluded that the allegations were accurate and that Roland had used her position as a postmaster to further her Mary Kay business. Her activities included displaying Mary Kay flyers in the post office; verbally soliciting employees, including subordinates, to make purchases and become Mary Kay representatives; verbally soliciting postal customers to make purchases and \u201chost sales parties\u201d; handing out her Mary Kay business cards and displaying them at the post office; and conducting business transactions from her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Subsequently, Charles Matthews, the Manager of Human Resources for the Southern Georgia District, issued Roland a letter of decision in which he concluded that the charges against her were \u201cfully supported by the record,\u201d but recommended that only a demotion was warranted, rather than a removal. Matthews acknowledged Roland\u2019s denial of the allegations against her, but ultimately found that they were nonetheless supported by a preponderance of the evidence. In his letter, Matthews noted that \u201c[t]he sale and solicitation of sales from subordinate employees and postal customers conflicted] with [Roland\u2019s] position as Postmaster in that [she] used [her] position for personal gain.\u201d Based on that finding, Matthews determined that Roland could not \u201cbe trusted in a position of supervision\u201d nor could she have \u201ccontact with the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Roland appealed the agency\u2019s decision to demote her and had a three-day hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), the transcript of which was attached to the materials in support of the Postmaster General\u2019s summary judgment motion. At the hearing, Roland testified that she began her Mary Kay business in May of 1999, and had sold products to employees, but denied soliciting subordinate employees or customers to buy her products, or to become representatives. However, Roland admitted that she informed employees about how to become Mary Kay representatives when they inquired, and acknowledged that she made a financial profit when individuals signed up through her. Roland said that while she had limited conversations with postal customers about Mary Kay, she did so only after they complimented her on her appearance. Roland admitted that she had used the post office photocopier on one occasion and made calls from her work telephone for Mary Kay-related purposes, but denied distributing business cards or conducting Mary Kay business transactions from her office. Roland testified that she thought the demotion was based on race and gender discrimination because two white male postal employees had engaged in similar conduct and were not disciplined as severely: Wayne Grier used his postal vehicle to deliver his wife\u2019s Avon products; and Roland alleged that Billy Pierce had assaulted another employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">At the MSPB hearing, the Postmaster General also presented the testimony of nine employees formerly under Roland\u2019s supervision, all of whom testified that Roland conducted her Mary Kay business at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the post office during work hours, and the testimony of Tommy Caruthers, an African-American male and the Labor Relations Manager for the U.S. Postal Service. Caruthers said that he had cautioned Roland about selling Mary Kay products at work on more than one occasion. The MSPB also considered the testimony of the Human Resources Manager, Matthews, and Roland\u2019s former supervisor, Billy Pierce.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The MSPB affirmed the agency\u2019s demotion of Roland based on her Mary Kay. activities at work, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that Roland\u2019s denial of the relevant allegations to be \u201cincredible.\u201d The MSPB also determined that Roland\u2019s claim of disparate treatment failed because she had not identified a similarly situated employee who was treated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The district court granted the Postmaster General\u2019s motion for summary judgment. First, the district court determined that Roland failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment because she did not show that another similarly situated employee was treated differently. More specifically, the district court concluded that Grier \u201cwas not within the same or similar supervisory regime ... and did not have the same appeal rights\u201d as Roland, and thus, was not a proper individual for comparison. Also, Roland was a supervisor, and Grier was not, making her conduct \u201cmore egregious,\u201d supporting the conclusion that they were not similarly situated for purposes of Title VII analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Second, the district court found that even if Roland had demonstrated a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, she failed to effectively rebut the Postmaster\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons, and thus, had failed to show pretext. In fact, Roland \u201coffered no evidence or argument to suggest that [Potter\u2019s] proffered reasons [were] pretext.\u201d Even if Caruthers (the Labor Relations Manager, for the U.S.P.S.) had made a statement regarding \u201cwhite boys,\u201d the district court found, Roland presented no evidence to \u201cconnect or attribute\u201d the statement \u201cto the actions or intent of Pierce or Matthews,\u201d who were the decisionmakers as to Roland\u2019s discipline, and thus the comment could not support a finding that they disciplined Roland based on race. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to her compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Because Roland relies on circumstantial evidence to establish her disparate-treatment claim, we test the sufficiency of that claim by applying the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). <em>See Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, a plaintiff first must show an inference of discriminatory intent, and thus carries the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. In a disparate-treatment case like this one, to satisfy her <em>prima facie burden, </em>a plaintiff must show: (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) she was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside her protected class. <em>See Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Fla. Dept. of Educ. ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number><em>Univ. of S. Fla., </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The plaintiffs successful assertion of a <em>prima facie </em>case \u201ccreates a rebuttable presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against her.\u201d <em>E.E.O.C. v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 714, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)). If the plaintiff successfully demonstrates a <em>prima facie case, </em>the burden then shifts to the employer to produce evidence that its action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>See Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, </em>296 F.3d at 1272. \u201cShould the employer meet its burden of production, the presumption of discrimination is rebutted, and the inquiry \u2018proceeds to a new level of specificity,\u2019 in which the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason really is a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1272-73 (quoting <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089). \u201cAlthough the intermediate burdens of production shift back and forth, the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The district court found that Roland did not satisfy her initial burden to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Again, to do so, she was required to show: (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) she was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside her protected class. <em>See Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289. The instant appeal concerns only the fourth element of the <em>prima facie </em>case since the parties do not dispute that Roland satisfied the other elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">\u201cIn determining whether employees are similarly situated for purposes of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case, it is necessary to consider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). To show that employees are similarly situated, the plaintiff must establish that the employees are \u201csimilarly situated in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1091 (11th Cir.2004). The comparator must be \u201cnearly identical\u201d to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">On this record, Roland has failed to establish the fourth prong of her <em>prima facie </em>case. In her brief, Roland again points to Wayne Grier as a suitable comparator. According to Roland, Grier used his official vehicle to deliver his wife\u2019s Avon products and was not disciplined in a comparable way to her. However, even if Grier engaged in the activities alleged and was not disciplined in the same way, he is not a proper comparator because he worked in a different facility, reported to a different supervisor, and was not entitled to the same appeals rights as Roland was, by virtue of her \u201cveteran\u201d status. Indeed, as Matthews put it, and Roland presented no evidence to the contrary in her responsive materials in opposition to summary judgment, \u201c[Grier\u2019s] status within the organization put him on a separate level\u201d as he had been disciplined by \u201ca Manager in another functional unit.\u201d Moreover, the comparison to Grier fails for another reason. The district court found that Roland\u2019s conduct was more egregious that Grier\u2019s because Roland engaged in Mary Kay sales and marketing in the postal facility and while in a position of authority. Grier, on the other hand, delivered his wife\u2019s Avon products outside of the postal facility and did not involve subordinates in his Avon activities. Finally, it was undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>puted that neither Pierce nor Matthews, who were the ones to make the disciplinary decisions as to Roland, had anything to do with the supervision or discipline of Grier. <em>Cf. Silvera v. Orange County Sch. </em>Bd., 244 F.3d at 1253, 1261 n. 5 (11th Cir.2001 (\u201c[D]ifferences in treatment by different supervisors or decision makers can seldom be the basis for a viable claim of employment discrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Simply put, Grier was not \u201csimilarly situated in all relevant respects\u201d or \u201cnearly identical\u201d to Roland for purposes of Title VII. <em>See Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1091. Accordingly, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of the Postmaster.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">. Roland also raised, unsuccessfully, a claim of retaliation before the district court, but does not raise this as an issue on appeal. Accordingly, issues as to that claim are deemed waived. <em>Flanigan\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. of Georgia v. Fulton County, Georgia, </em>242 F.3d 976, 987 (11th Cir.2001). Likewise, Roland does not challenge the district court\u2019s order dismissing Pierce as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-16\">. Because summary judgment was proper based on Roland\u2019s failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, we need not, and do not, reach her argument concerning pretext, the third step of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
