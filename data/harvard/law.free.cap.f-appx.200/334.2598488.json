And, once again, we must deny him. The underlying facts and much of the procedural history of this case are well-established in <em>Bustamante v. Cueva (In re Cueva), </em>371 F.3d 232, 233-35 (5th Cir.2004), and do not require repetition in any depth here. The litigation stems from Bustamante\u2019s purchase at a foreclosure sale, later deemed void, of property formerly owned by Cueva. <em>Id. </em>at 233-34. With the bankruptcy court\u2019s permission, the property was later sold by Cueva to a third party, and the lenders payed off. Bustamante sought, and continues to seek, all or a portion of the money he paid to purchase the property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-21\">In <em>Bustamante, </em>concluding that the Bankruptcy Code included no bona fide purchaser defense to the invalidity of a purchase of property from under an automatic stay, we upheld the district court\u2019s conclusion that Bustamante had purchased no interest in the property. <em>Id. </em>at 238. Additionally, we rejected his claims for damages, a lien by equitable subrogation and other relief under Texas law. <em>Id. </em>We remanded for a decision by the bankruptcy court not inconsistent with our ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-22\">After this court denied Bustamante\u2019s petition for rehearing, Cueva moved to distribute the funds remaining in the bankruptcy court\u2019s registry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bustamante responded with a motion to distribute the funds to himself; his motion raised neither legal nor equitable theories to support the disbursement. The bankruptcy court ordered the funds disbursed to Cueva alone, which they were on July 15, 2004. As a result, ultimately, the lenders received $191,962.00, Cueva $628,114.25 and Busta-mante $42,654.67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-23\">The district court vacated the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling, remanding and ordering the bankruptcy court to explain why it awarded Cueva all the funds in the registry without considering Bustamante\u2019s out-of-pocket loss. On remand, on April 18, 2005, the bankruptcy court explained that it disbursed the funds based on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate in <em>Bustamante. </em>It deemed equitable subrogation the \u201conly legal or equitable theory by which Busta-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>mante might be entitled to a refund of his out-of-pocket funds\u201d and the only one \u201craised by Bustamante to recover those sums.\u201d On August 8, 2005, the district court affirmed. Bustamante timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">In a bankruptcy appeal, we apply the same standard of review as the district court. <em>Wells Fargo Bank of Texas, N.A. v. Sommers (In re </em>Amco), 444 F.3d 690, 694 (5th Cir.2006). We review factual findings for clear error, and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Id. </em>We review matters left to the lower courts\u2019 discretion for abuse. <em>Century Resources Land LLC v. Adobe Energy Inc. (In re Adobe Energy Inc.) </em>82 Fed App\u2019x 106, 110 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">In four ways, Bustamante argues that he is entitled to his money because he was a good faith purchaser of the half-interest in the property not originally paid for by his co-purchaser, Jonathan R. Campbell,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and because Cueva is not entitled to the money either equitably or under Texas law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bustamante provides no legal support for the argument that Cueva\u2019s alleged lack of entitlement gives him an interest in the disbursement. At core, his argument, that he was a good faith purchaser, is an equitable one; and the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting it. <em>See Arens v. Boughton (In re </em>Prudhomme), 43 F.3d 1000, 1003 (5th Cir.1995) (noting bankruptcy courts\u2019 broad discretion in applying equity powers) (citing <em>Anderson v. Anderson (In re Anderson), </em>936 F.2d 199, 204 (5th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1098-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1098-24\">. The funds were from Cueva\u2019s court-approved sale of the property on May 2, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">. The parties do not dispute what is now the law of the case, that Campbell was not a good faith purchaser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">. Bustamante\u2019s Texas law argument takes three forms: (1) an owner of property sold in a void foreclosure can recover either damages or the property, but not both; (2) a debtor must do equity and pay off his debts, and not receive a windfall; and (3) the \u201cone satisfaction\u201d rule bars Cueva being satisfied twice, <em>i.e., </em>receiving the property and getting the funds generated by its sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
