Cadena argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he is an alien. He contends that he has derivative citizenship through his mother who was a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-28\">Because Cadena failed to renew his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the evidence, his sufficiency challenge is reviewed only for a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United, States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004). Such a miscarriage of justice occurs when the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence of guilt or [when] the evidence [is] so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-29\">The Government introduced evidence that Cadena was born in Mexico, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>informed a Border Patrol agent at the time of his apprehension that he was a Mexican national, that he had previously-filed for an Immigrant Visa, that he had been deported as an alien, and that he waived his right to appeal the deportation order. The only evidence of Cadena\u2019s derivative citizenship came from Cadena\u2019s testimony, which was inconsistent. This inconsistency provided support for a jury-finding that Cadena was not entitled to derivative citizenship. The jury was free to reject Cadena\u2019s testimony regarding his claim to citizenship. <em>See United States v. Runyan, </em>290 F.3d 223, 240 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The record is not devoid of evidence that Cadena is an alien. Cadena\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1326 does not constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See Avants, </em>367 F.3d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
