Smith has not shown that jurists of reason would debate the district court\u2019s denial of his claims that appellate counsel was ineffective (1) for not advising him to appeal the district court\u2019s assessment of a two-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2)(B) for direct money laundering and (2) for not advising him to appeal the district court\u2019s assessment of three levels pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1 for his aggravating role (manager) in the offense. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Smith\u2019s motion for COA is DENIED as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Because Smith raised for the first time in his COA motion his claim that his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), this court need not consider it. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Smith has shown that jurists of reason would debate whether the district erred in denying his claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for advising him not to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the third point for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(b). <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Smith\u2019s motion for COA is GRANTED with regard to this claim. However, Smith has not shown in either his COA motion or his appeal brief that counsel was ineffective. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Reinhart, </em>357 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.2004). At sentencing, the district court overruled the Government\u2019s objection to its refusal to assess a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. There was support in the record for the Government\u2019s position, and the Government specifically reserved its right to appeal on this issue. Since an appeal by Smith on the \u00a7 3El.l(b) claim might have provoked a cross-appeal by the Government on the obstruction-of-justice issue, defense counsel\u2019s advice to Smith not to appeal the denial of the third point under \u00a7 3E 1.1(b) was within the wide range of reasonable professional conduct. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Smith is not entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief on this claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">COA DENIED IN PART; COA GRANTED IN PART; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
