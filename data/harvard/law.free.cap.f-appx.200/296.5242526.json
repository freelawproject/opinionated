Reid (\u201cReid\u201d) filed a claim under the Social Security Act for Disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Insurance Benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and for Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Reid\u2019s claim and the Appeals Council affirmed the decision of the ALJ. Treating the decision of the Appeals Council as the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, Reid filed suit in the district court for the Western District of Louisiana seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The case was referred to the Magistrate Judge for report and recommendation, and the Magistrate Judge recommended that Reid\u2019s petition for review be denied. Reid filed objections to the Magistrate\u2019s Report and the district court, after review of Reid\u2019s objections, adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and entered final judgment denying any relief to Reid. Reid appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the record excerpts, and relevant portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report, as adopted by the district court, we affirm the decision of the district court to enter final judgment against Reid.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
