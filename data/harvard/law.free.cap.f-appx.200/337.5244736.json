Wines. </em>Counsel appointed to represent Marvin Eugene Chappell has requested leave to withdraw from this appeal and has filed a brief as required by <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Chappell has received a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and brief but has not filed a response. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and Chappell\u2019s APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
