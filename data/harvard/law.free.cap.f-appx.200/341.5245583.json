During the pendency of the petition, Ybarra filed pleadings indicating that his counsel during the revocation proceedings was not licensed to practice law during the revocation proceedings. Finding that the claim was not exhausted in the state courts, the district court dismissed the \u201cmixed\u201d petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-25\">In his motion for a COA in this court, Ybarra argued for the first time that the district court should have sua sponte stayed the proceedings rather than dismiss the petition for failure to exhaust because any subsequent petition would be time-barred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>During the pendency of Ybarra\u2019s motion, the Supreme Court decided <em>Rhines v. Weber, </em>544 U.S. 269, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005), which addressed, in part, the situation in which a petitioner filed a timely but mixed petition in federal district court and the court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust after the limitations period had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 125 S.Ct. 1528. This court issued Ybarra a COA on the issue whether, in light of <em>Rhines, </em>the district court reversibly erred in dismissing Ybarra\u2019s petition rather than sua sponte holding it in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">A district court has discretion to stay, rather than dismiss, a \u201cmixed\u201d habeas petition \u201conly in the limited circumstances\u201d where there is \u201cgood cause\u201d for the petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust his claim first in state court, the petitioner\u2019s unexhausted claim is potentially meritorious, and the petitioner has not engaged in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay. <em>Rhines, </em>544 U.S. at 277-78, 125 S.Ct. 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Ybarra\u2019s only assertion on appeal is that his counsel\u2019s suspension from practice for non-payment of taxes rendered her per se ineffective. This court has declined to apply a per se ineffectiveness rule in situations involving unlicensed attorneys. <em>See United States v. Maria-Martinez, </em>143 F.3d 914, 916-917 (5th Cir.1998). Because his claim is not potentially meritorious, Ybarra has not shown that the district court reversibly erred by not sua sponte granting a stay in the proceedings. <em>See Rhines, </em>544 U.S. at 277, 125 S.Ct. 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
