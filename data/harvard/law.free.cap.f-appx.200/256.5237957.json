Counsel has filed an <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) brief and Scott has filed a supplemental brief. The Government elected not to file a reply brief. The only issue raised by counsel is whether the district court erred in denying Scott\u2019s Fed. R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-22\">This court reviews the denial of a Rule 29 motion de novo. <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 as \u2018evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alerre, </em>430 F.3d at 693 (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). The court \u201cmust consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). This court \u201cmay not weigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>118 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.1997). We have reviewed the record and find that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-23\">Scott filed a supplemental brief arguing that she should not have received a harsh sentence, that she lied in her statement to police, and that one of the witnesses implicating her was not credible. We find these claims without merit. We deny Scott\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the motion to remand. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Scott\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Scott, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Scott requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Scott. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
