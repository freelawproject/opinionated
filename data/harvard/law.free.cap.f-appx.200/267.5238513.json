We affirmed his sentence. Subsequently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment in light of the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded his case for further proceedings. <em>United States v. Shipman, </em>107 Fed.Appx. 354 (4th Cir.2004) (No. 03-4967), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1114, 125 S.Ct. 1079, 160 L.Ed.2d 1056 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-22\">Shipman was sentenced before the decisions in <em>Booker </em>and its predecessor, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on judicial fact finding rather than facts he admitted. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. </em>Hughes, 401 F.3d 540, 546-60 (4th Cir.2005). Shipman now contends that the district court plainly erred under <em>Booker </em>in applying the guidelines as mandatory and in enhancing his sentence for possession of the firearm in connection with another felony because the enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment. With respect to the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines, the court gave no indication of what sentence it would impose under an advisory guideline system. Therefore, Shipman cannot show actual prejudice and resentencing is not authorized on this ground, independent of a Sixth Amendment error. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223-24 (4th Cir. 2005). However, we conclude that the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Shipman\u2019s base offense level was 20, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(4)(A) (2003). He received a four-level increase under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), upon the district court\u2019s finding that he intended to distribute the marijuana he possessed when he was arrested with the illegal firearm. Shipman contested this enhancement, arguing that the evidence did not show an intent to distribute, but the district court overruled his objection. Shipman also received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. His final offense level was 21. Shipman was in criminal history category V, which gave him a guideline range of 70-87 months. The court imposed a sentence of eighty-four months. Without the enhancement for possession of the gun in connection with another felony, Ship-man\u2019s offense level would have been 20 and the guideline range, based on facts he admitted, would have been 63-78 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shipman\u2019s sentence of eighty-four months thus meets the standard for plain error that must be recognized under the standard set out in <em>Hughes.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The government asserts that the enhancement was supported by Shipman\u2019s admission (through his guilty plea) that he possessed the firearm while in possession of marijuana, because simple possession of marijuana after any prior drug conviction is a federal felony offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2000). Shipman was convicted of simple possession of marijuana in 2001. In our prior per curiam opinion affirming Shipman\u2019s sentence, we agreed that this fact could provide an alternative ground for affirmance. However, in light of <em>Booker, </em>we must take note of the fact that Shipman did not admit he possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d his possession of the marijuana. <em>See United States v. Milam, </em>443 F.3d 382, 387 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that, for <em>Booker </em>purposes, defendant\u2019s silence in response to presentence report does not constitute admission of facts in report on which sentence enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ment is based). We therefore conclude that resentencing is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">For the reasons discussed, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 543 U.S. at 265, 125 S.Ct. 738. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West Supp.2006). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">. For purposes of determining <em>Booker </em>error, we consider the guideline range based on facts Shipman admitted before the reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w] e of course offer no criticism of the district court judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Shipman\u2019s sentencing. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
