Herrera raises five issues on appeal: (1) denial of his motion to suppress; (2) sufficiency of the evidence; (3) modification of a proposed <em>voir dire </em>question; (4) use of a deliberate ignorance jury instruction; and (5) denial of a minor role reduction at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-24\">As to the first issue, we conclude the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. The officers had probable cause to arrest Herrera, and they seized the narcotics during a lawful search incident to arrest. <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981); <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>411 F.2d 627 (5th Cir.1969);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v.
