He argues that the district court erred by denying his motion in which he argued the government breached its plea agreement with him when it did not file a substantial-assistance motion, pursuant to Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. He also claims the government breached its obligations under the plea agreement by not recommending that he receive a seven-year sentence and that all of his sentences be served concurrently. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">\u201cWhether the government has breached a plea agreement is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir. 1998). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether the government can be compelled to make a substantial-assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993) (reviewing the government\u2019s refusal to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K 1.1 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Rule 35(b) provides that upon the government\u2019s motion, the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if, after sentencing, he provided substantial assistance. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). We will not review the government\u2019s decision to file, or not to file, a substantial-assistance motion in the absence of an unconstitutional motive. <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1501-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Contrary to Penaloza-Zarate\u2019s claims on appeal, our review of the plea agreement reveals <em>no </em>provisions indicating that the government would recommend either a seven-year sentence or concurrent sentences, nor was there any mention, during the guilty plea hearing, that the government agreed to recommend a seven-year sentence or concurrent sentences. Moreover, Penaloza-Zarate failed to allege that he provided substantial assistance <em>after </em>sentencing, which, by the plain terms of Rule 35(b), is a prerequisite to the government\u2019s filing of a substantial-assistance motion. Finally, on appeal, he has not alleged an unconstitutional motive, on the government\u2019s part, for not filing the motion. For all of these reasons, we affirm the denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
