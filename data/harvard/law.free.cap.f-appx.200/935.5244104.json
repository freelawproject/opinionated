The Government responds that we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Vesga\u2019s application for asylum because the application was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Insofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, as occurred here, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based upon a legal determination, our review is de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard and \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>1288-84 (citation omitted); see also INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d). To reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, we must conclude that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). That evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">An alien may apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that his application has been filed within one year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-6\">An application for asylum of an alien may be considered ... if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Nevertheless, \u201c[n]o Court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under [\u00a7 1158(a)(2) ].\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Consequently, \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests this court of jurisdiction to review \u201ca decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Jurisdictional provisions in the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 310 (2005), do not affect our precedents, such as <em>Mendoza. Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">The IJ determined that Vesga\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that he failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimeliness. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Yesga\u2019s asylum application and dismiss the petition for review as to such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">An alien shall not be removed to a country if his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The alien must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not that [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum. <em>Mazariegos v. Office of the U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1324 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-12\">If the alien establishes past persecution in his country based on a protected ground, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to his country unless the [Department of Homeland Security] shows by a preponderance of the evidence that, among other things, (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened upon his removal; or (2) that the alien could avoid a future threat to his life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal, and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. In the absence of a showing of past persecution, however, the alien \u201cmay still be entitled to withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[a]n alien cannot demonstrate that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the IJ finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An alien may also sustain his burden of proof by showing a pattern or practice of persecution of groups similarly situated to him in which he is included or with which he is identified. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Persecution is an \u201cextreme concept.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Although the INA does not define persecution, courts have generally held that persecution is \u201cpunishment or the infliction of harm for political, religious, or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Tamas-Mercea v. Reno, </em>222 F.3d 417, 424 (7th Cir.2000). \u201c[Persecution encompasses more than threats to life or freedom; non-life threatening violence and physical abuse also fall within this category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mere harassment is not persecution; persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; <em>see also Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000) (persecution \u201cmust rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering\u201d). Furthermore, with regard to political opinion claims, \u201c[i]t is not enough to show that [the alien] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Vesga did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted upon returning to Colombia. The record does not compel a finding that Vesga established more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation; therefore, the IJ\u2019s finding that Vesga did not show past persecution is supported by substantial evidence. Additionally, the record does not contain evidence compelling a conclusion that Vesga demonstrated a future threat to his life or freedom. His encounters with the ELN occurred more than ten years ago and his family members who remained in Colombia have had no specific problems with or threats from the ELN.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Finally, there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Vesga failed to establish a nexus between the feared persecution and his political opinion. The evidence in the record reflects a three-year lag between Vesga\u2019s first encounter with the ELN and his two months of political activity, which consisted of campaigning on behalf of a friend. This is not sufficient to compel a conclusion that there was a connection between his political activity and the ELN\u2019s actions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Accordingly, we deny Vesga\u2019s petition for review of his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">PETITION DISMISSED, in part; DENIED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-13\">. The asylum application in this case and the petition for review are based on Vesga\u2019s claims of persecution. Therefore, this opinion refers only to Vesga; our decision, however, applies to all petitioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b958-19\">. Vesga also applied for relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\u201d). Vesga makes no arguments on appeal concerning the denial of his request for CAT relief. Therefore, he has waived that issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
