Patel, a <em>pro se </em>Georgia prisoner, appeals the denial by the district court of his multiple motions for sanctioning fees and costs filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1927, 1919, 1920, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54. Because we lack jurisdiction to review anything but the district court\u2019s 22 December 2005 order and because we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the record fails to support a finding of bad faith on the part of the defendants\u2019 counsel, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b864-20\">Patel filed a <em>pro se </em>civil rights complaint in state court against defendants-appellees, Cobb County Jail Officer McCall, Cobb County Sheriff Bill Hutson, Cobb County Board of Commissioners Chairman, and the Honorable R.E. Flournoy, III, seeking recovery for alleged violations of numerous federal statutes, including 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The appellees removed Patel\u2019s case to federal court on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>his lawsuit alleged violation of rights protected by the Constitution. The notice stated that the appellees had \u201cgiven written notice\u201d to Patel, \u201cfiled a written notice with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Cobb County,\u201d and had \u201ccontacted counsel for the State defendant [the Honorable R.E. Flournoy III], and the State does not object to the removal.\u201d Rl-1 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Patel \u201cobject[ed],\u201d arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) the notice of removal contained untruthful statements; (2) there was no documented confirmation of the state\u2019s consent to removal; and (3) the defendants were using the removal process to harass him and frustrate the litigation of his case. Rl-6 at 2. 6. 10-11. The appellees responded that Patel had directly referred to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, along with other federal statutes, in his complaint and that he had set forth no legal basis precluding removal. Patel then filed a motion for remand, in which he argued that his case did not contain a federal question because the federal statutes cited merely filled gaps left by the state statutes. While the district court considered this motion, Patel proceeded to file a motion for summary judgment. The defendants responded with discovery requests, to which Patel responded with numerous further motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">In an order addressing several motions filed by the parties, the district court, <em>inter alia, </em>denied Patel\u2019s motion to remand his case because Patel\u2019s complaint had alleged both federal and state causes of action, and Patel had failed to present any adequate reasons for remand. Patel filed a motion for reconsideration in which he argued, in part, that defendants had violated the rule of unanimous consent as set forth by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446 because no affidavit had been filed on behalf of the state defendant, Flournoy, confirming his express consent to the removal. The district court remanded the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447, on the ground that the \u201cstatement in the [defendants\u2019] removal notice [as to the state\u2019s consent was] insufficient to satisfy the unanimity rule even if it [were] construed as a consent\u201d and that the \u201cdefendants\u2019 later assurance of the State\u2019s intent to consent [were] untimely and insufficient.\u201d R2-58 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Patel then filed an emergency motion for sanctions on 12 December 2005, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, which allows for costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees for conduct that unreasonably and vexatiously \u201cmultiplies the proceedings.\u201d In arguing that defendants had maliciously removed his <em>pro se </em>civil action, Patel alleged that they had: (1) \u201cinstituted a chain of proceedings before the issue of illegal removal [could] be resolved\u201d; (2) misled the district court on 6 October 2005 to obtain a ruling in their favor; and (3) for over eight months \u201cmaintained a stubborn, unapologetic, and vindictive attitude ... in their attempts to perpetrate injustice on [Patel] by legal manipulations.\u201d R2-66 at 2. Patel asserted that the defendants\u2019 actions caused him to incur monetary damages in the amount of $7,593.10, which included costs, expenses, and attorney time. <em>Id. </em>The defendants responded that Patel was unable to prove either legally or factually that removal of the civil case was improper. They asserted that they had possessed a good-faith belief that the showing of the state\u2019s consent in their notice of removal was sufficient to satisfy the rule on unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">On 22 December 2005, the district court issued an order denying Patel\u2019s motion for sanctions on the grounds that the facts did not show maliciousness on the part of the defendants and that the \u201cremand of [the] case resulted due to defendants\u2019 failure to timely obtain express consent from one of the defendants, [and that] such [a] procedural defect in a removal [did] not warrant an award of monetary damages.\u201d R2-73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>at 1-2. On 3 January 2006, Patel filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s 22 December 2005 order, restating his previous arguments and contending that: (1) the court used one standard for licensed attorneys and another for <em>pro se </em>litigants; (2) the defendants knew that they were improperly removing the case to federal court; and (3) the court\u2019s rulings had favored the defendants. R2-75 at 1-2. More specifically, he added that defendants\u2019 counsel had acted in bad faith by: (1) presenting speculative and groundless presumptions of fact and law to have his case removed to federal court, (2) harassing him by choosing an inconvenient forum, and (3) compelling discovery \u201cto obscure the issue of remand and sidetrack\u201d the court from the issue of removal. R276 at 8. Patel supplemented the motion a second time to assert that he was also entitled to all costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1919, 1920 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">On 17 January 2006, Patel filed a second emergency motion for attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1919, 1920, and Rule 54, based again on the defendants\u2019 removal of his case. In this motion, he raised the amount of his claim to $8,843.10. R2-78 at 11. Then, on 18 January 2006, before the court had ruled on either the motion to reconsider the denial of sanctions or the second emergency motion, Patel filed a timely notice of appeal from the 22 December 2005 order. The notice specifically stated that: (1) the appeal was made under the jurisdiction of the \u201cU.S. Court of Appeals for Eleventh Circuit;\u201d and (2) the order appealed was the district court\u2019s 22 December 2005 order, denying his emergency motion for sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. R2-79 at 1. Patel also stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">Plaintiff further informs and requests to Clerk of U.S. District Court to present Plaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration and its supplemental motions, and motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1919, 1920, Fed. R.Civ.P. Rule 54(c)(d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and O.C.G.A. 9-15-1 et seq. timely filed and pending for ruling so that the entire issue of paralegal\u2019s fees, expenses and costs can be determined by U.S. Court of Appeals if any or all of those motions are denied by U.S. District Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">On 1 February 2006, the district court issued an order denying Patel\u2019s motion for reconsideration and the second emergency motion. As to the motion for reconsideration, the court found again that remand of the case resulted from the defendants\u2019 failure timely to obtain express consent from one of the defendants and that such a procedural defect did not indicate that the defendants had acted in bad faith warranting sanctions under \u00a7 1927. In denying Patel\u2019s second emergency motion for attorney\u2019s fees, the court found that: (1) \u00a7 1919 was inapplicable because it authorized the court to order payment of costs when an action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction whereas Patel\u2019s case was remanded due to a procedural defect; and (2) \u00a7 1988, Rule 54, and \u00a7 1920 did not entitle Patel to receive attorney\u2019s fees and costs because Patel had yet to prevail on the merits of his claim as required by \u00a7 1988 and Rule 54 and because the costs he requested were not covered by \u00a7 1920. Patel did not file a notice of appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">On 7 February 2006, however, Patel filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s 1 February 2006 order and repeated his previous arguments. On the same day, Patel filed a document styled: \u201cPlaintiffs Emergency Motion for Certified Questions to U.S. Court of Appeals (11th Cir.) If Hon. Court Declines to Provide Rulings on Key Procedural Issues Remained Unattended in This Case Which May Prejudice to Legal Interests of Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>tiff in State Court.\u201d R2-86 at 1. In this document, Patel requested that the district court issue a ruling as to the timeliness of the defendants\u2019 notice of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Patel also requested that \u201cin [the] absence of any ruling [by the district court] on the issues presented, please, [for someone to] forward questions to be certified by the U.S. Court of Appeals (11th Cir.).\u201d <em>Id. </em>These questions included: (1) when an advance payment of filing fees must be made and (2) what \u201cspecial rules, general rules or statutes of the United States Courts\u201d allow a \u201cclerk of court\u201d or \u201ca court [to] by-pass it[]s Local Rules to \u2018favor\u2019 a litigant over the other party/ies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. The district court characterized this document as an \u201cAmended Notice of Appeal\u201d from the 22 December 2005 order. <em>See </em>Rl, District Court Docket Sheet, Entry No. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">On 9 February 2006, the district court issued an order denying Patel\u2019s motion for reconsideration of its 1 February 2006 order. The district court found no manifest error of law or fact in its previous two orders denying Patel\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Patel filed no further notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">A. <em>Scope of Appellate Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">In his brief, Patel states that he is appealing from the district court\u2019s 22 December 2005, 1 February 2006, and 9 February 2006 orders. We must \u201cindependently examine our appellate jurisdiction and dismiss when our jurisdictional limits are exceeded.\u201d <em>Russell Corp. v. Am. Home Assurance Co., </em>264 F.3d 1040, 1043 (11th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">\u201cIn a civil case ... [a] notice of appeal ... must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Both a motion to alter or amend a judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 and a motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 toll the time to file an appeal for all parties \u201cfrom the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv), (vi). Additionally, a notice of appeal must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-11\">(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-12\">(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-13\">(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1). \u201cThe test for determining the sufficiency of a notice of appeal is \u2018whether it is objectively clear that a party intended to appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>Bogle v. Orange County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>162 F.3d 653, 660 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting Fed. R.App. P. 3(c) advisory committee\u2019s note (1993 amendment)).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">The district court\u2019s 22 December 2005 order denying Patel\u2019s 12 December 2005 emergency motion for sanctions filed pursuant to \u00a7 1927 is properly within the scope of the appeal. The notice of appeal as to that order was timely filed on 18 January 2006 and specifically stated that: (1) the order being appealed was the 22 December 2005 order denying Patel\u2019s emergency motion under \u00a7 1927; and (2) the appeal was being taken under the jurisdiction of this court. However, Patel never filed an additional or amended notice of appeal as to the district court\u2019s 1 February 2006 or 9 February 2006 orders. Thus, an issue arises as to whether these two orders are within the scope of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">Generally, we have held that when a litigant \u201cfail[s] to file an additional or amended notice of appeal referring to [a] subsequent order, [we are] without jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the merits.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number><em>Id. </em>We have also observed that \u201cRule 3(c) requires that a notice of appeal designate an existent judgment or order, not one that is merely expected or that is, or should be, within the appellant\u2019s contemplation when the notice of appeal is filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661. We explained that \u201ca litigant who file[s] a notice of appeal prior to the entry of the relevant order without referring to that order ha[s] failed to satisfy FRAP 3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660 (citing <em>McDougald v. Jenson, </em>786 F.2d 1465, 1474 (11th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">However, an appellate brief may be construed as a notice of appeal so long as the appellate brief was filed within the time limits governing notices of appeal. <em>Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248-49, 112 S.Ct. 678, 682, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992) (examining whether a <em>pro se </em>appellant\u2019s brief could constitute a notice of appeal). The Supreme Court explained that, even though the requirements of Rule 3 are jurisdictional, they are also liberally construed. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 112 S.Ct. at 682. To determine whether a document should be construed as a notice of appeal, we follow a two-part test. <em>Rinaldo v. Corbett, </em>256 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Barry, </em>502 U.S. at 248, 112 S.Ct. at 681-82). First, we ask whether the document fulfills the three-part requirement of Rule 3(c)(1) and is therefore the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>Second, we ask \u201cwhether it is objectively clear [from the document] that a party intended to appeal\u201d such that the other parties and the courts are provided with sufficient notice. <em>Id. </em>at 1279 (quotations omitted). \u201cIf a document filed within the time specified by Rule 4 gives the notice required by Rule 3, it is effective as a notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Barry, </em>502 U.S. at 248-49, 112 S.Ct. at 682. Finally, <em>\u201c[p]ro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Despite this leniency \u201cafforded <em>pro se </em>litigants, we nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">As noted earlier, Patel never filed either an additional or amended notice of appeal as to either the 1 or 9 February 2006 orders. In his 18 January 2006 notice of appeal, Patel stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">Plaintiff further informs and requests to Clerk of U.S. District Court to present Plaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration and its supplemental motions, and motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1919, 1920, Fed. R.Civ. P. 54(c)(d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and O.C.G.A. 9-15-1 et seq. timely filed and pending for ruling so that the entire issue of paralegal\u2019s fees, expenses and costs can be determined by U.S. Court of Appeals if any or all of those motions are denied by U.S. Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">R2-79 at 1. This instruction, however, runs counter to our interpretation of Rule 3(c) requiring that the notice designate an existent order. <em>See Bogle, </em>162 F.3d at 661. Additionally, although Patel\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion For Certified Questions,\u201d filed on 8 February 2006, was construed by the district court and labeled on the docket sheet as an \u201cAmended Notice of Appeal\u201d from the 22 December 2005 order, it fails to reference any subsequent district court order and only presents questions for the district court and us to answer. Thus, it does not meet the Rule 3(c) requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Additionally, Patel\u2019s appellate brief may not be liberally construed as a notice of appeal of the 1 and 9 February 2006 orders pursuant to <em>Barry </em>and <em>Rinaldo. </em>Even though Patel\u2019s brief meets the three-part requirements of Rule 3(c)(1), it was not filed within the 30-day notice of appeal time period. Even if Patel\u2019s 7 February 2006 motion for reconsideration as to the district court\u2019s 1 February 2006 order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>were construed as a Rule 59(e) motion tolling that period, the order denying that motion for reconsideration was entered on 9 February 2006. Patel did not file his appellate brief until 22 March 2006, well over 30 days later. Thus, we may not construe Patel\u2019s appellate brief as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a notice of appeal. Accordingly, the only order that falls within the scope of our review is the 22 December 2006 order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">B. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We also inquire <em>sua sponte </em>into subject matter jurisdiction \u201cwhenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004). We lack jurisdiction to review most remand orders, including the one at issue here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). However, although we have yet specifically to address whether we have jurisdiction to review a remand order in considering a motion for sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, we have specifically held that \u201c[w]e may review the merits of a remand order in considering whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Legg v. Wyeth, </em>428 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2005). We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) bars our review of a remand such as this one based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the statute does not exclude the district court\u2019s assessment of costs from appellate review. As the Fifth Circuit has explained [in <em>Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>385 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir. 2004)], while we may not review the decision to remand itself, we must, as part of our examination of the award of fees, consider the objective validity of the removing party\u2019s efforts, at the time that party attempted to remove the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1319-20 (citations and quotes omitted). Even though Patel seeks fees and costs as sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, as opposed to costs and expenses pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), we have jurisdiction to review Patel\u2019s appeal since our review of the fees and costs requested by Patel under \u00a7 1927 would require us to \u201cconsider the objective validity of the removing party\u2019s efforts, at the time that party attempted to remove the case,\u201d and we have specifically held that we have jurisdiction to review such matters. <em>See Wyeth, </em>428 F.3d at 1319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>C. <em>Motions for Fees, Costs, and Expenses as Sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Patel argues that the district court erred in denying him fees and expenses in light of the fact that he provided the court with detailed reasons for his eligibility for compensation under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding the imposition of sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Schwartz v. Millon Air, Inc., </em>341 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir.2003). Section 1927 addresses counsel\u2019s liability for excessive costs and states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. \u201cFor sanctions under section 1927 to be appropriate, something more than a lack of merit is required. The statute was designed to sanction attorneys who willfully abuse the judicial process by conduct tantamount to bad faith,\u201d but not by conduct constituting \u201cmere negligence.\u201d <em>Schwartz, </em>341 F.3d at 1225 (quotations and citations omitted). Bad faith exists \u201cwhere an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim or engages in litigation tactics that needlessly obstruct the litigation of non-frivolous claims.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The record in this case fails to support a finding of bad faith on the part of the defendants\u2019 counsel. Patel failed to submit any evidence of conduct beyond mere negligence. The defendants claimed that they thought they had properly executed removal by obtaining consent from all of the defendants. The district court remanded the case only because of the defendants\u2019 failure timely to have one of its defendants expressly consent to removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Additionally, Patel, not the defendants, multiplied the proceedings. While the issue of removal was before the court, it was Patel who filed a motion for summary judgment prior to any discovery being conducted. The defendants responded to Patel\u2019s motion with discovery requests and Patel responded to those by filing several additional motions. Accordingly, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Patel failed to show justification for sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Patel appeals the denial of his motions for fees and costs incurred in connection with the removal and remand of his civil rights complaint. Because we lack jurisdiction to review anything but the district court\u2019s 22 December 2005 order and because we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the record fails to support a finding of bad faith on the part of the defendants\u2019 counsel, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. Patel also argues that the defendants lied about their failure to make the advance payment of $250 when filing their notice of removal and that the district court did not have jurisdiction over his case because the notice of removal was procedurally and structurally defective. These issues, however, were rendered moot by the district court\u2019s remand of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. \"An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d).
