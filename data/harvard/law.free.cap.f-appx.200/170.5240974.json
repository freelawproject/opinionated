Augustin appealed his sentence, and we affirmed it. <em>United States v. Augustin, </em>102 Fed.Appx. 771 (4th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court later vacated this court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On remand, we again affirmed the sentence. <em>United States v. Augustin, </em>157 Fed.Appx. 582 (4th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">Augustin subsequently filed in the district court a \u201cNotice of Application for a Certificate of Appealability,\u201d referencing the date of his 2003 sentencing hearing. The district court construed the application as a notice of appeal from the original judgment. Augustin has now filed an informal brief in this court in which he challenges his conviction and sentence and asserts that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Because Augustin has previously appealed from the judgment entered on January 12, 2004, this appeal is redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
