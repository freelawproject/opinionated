We vacate and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-31\">Byrd filed a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1983 alleging that the North Carolina courts erred in denying his action challenging the validity of his state conviction. Byrd requested the district court \u201cconstrue [his] \u00a7 1983 petition as a habeas corpus, order vacation of [his state] conviction of being a habitual felon and remand case to the [state] trial court for resentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ing, on possession of fire-arm [sic] by convicted felon.\u201d The district court correctly noted that Byrd\u2019s complaint was inappropriate under \u00a7 1983 and should be construed as a petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). However, the court declined to do so and dismissed the complaint, finding that \u201cany habeas action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 filed by Plaintiff must be done so in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Consequently, because a habeas filing would be dismissed for venue reasons by this Court, this Court declines to go through the motions of converting Plaintiffs filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">A civil rights action under \u00a7 1983 is the appropriate vehicle to challenge the conditions of confinement, but not the fact or length of the confinement. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 498-99, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). In order to challenge the fact or duration of his confinement, a state prisoner must seek federal habeas corpus relief or the appropriate state relief instead. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). \u201c[A] state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is barred (absent prior invalidation) \u2014 -no matter the relief sought (damages or equitable relief), no matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit (state conduct leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings) \u2014 if success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration.\u201d <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 81-83, 125 S.Ct. 1242. Because Byrd challenges his conviction, which affects the fact of his confinement, his complaint should be construed as a \u00a7 2254 petition, as noted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We find the district court erred, however, in its dismissal of the complaint on the basis that even if it were construed as a \u00a7 2254 petition, it would nevertheless be dismissed for improper venue. Byrd is incarcerated at the Lanesboro Correctional Institution in Polkton, Anson County, North Carolina, which is located in the Western District of North Carolina. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 113 (2000). His judgment of conviction was entered in Wake County, North Carolina, which is in the Eastern District of North Carolina. <em>Id. </em>He filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint in the Western District of North Carolina. The court determined that if it construed Byrd\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as a \u00a7 2254 petition, it would still be dismissed because venue was improper since a \u00a7 2254 must be filed in the \u201cdistrict within which the state court was held which convicted and sentenced [Byrd].\u201d However, \u201ca prisoner contesting a conviction and sentence of a state court of a State which contains two or more federal judicial districts, who is confined in a district within the State other than that in which the sentencing court is located, has the option of seeking habeas corpus either in the district where he is confined or the district where the sentencing court is located.\u201d <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, </em>410 U.S. 484, 497, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d). Thus, Byrd could properly file a \u00a7 2254 in the Western District of North Carolina. As noted by the district court, however, under the joint order of the District Courts for the Eastern, Middle, and Western Districts of North Carolina regarding Applications for Writs of Habeas Corpus by Persons in Custody Under Judgments and Sentences of State Courts, \u00a7 2254 petitions \u201cshall be filed, heard, and determined in the district court for the district within which the state court was held which convicted and sentenced him, and the clerks of the several district courts are authorized and directed to transfer such applications to the district herein designated for filing, hearing, and determination.\u201d Therefore, while Byrd\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition would ultimately need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>be determined in the Eastern District of North Carolina under the joint order, we find it should not have been dismissed on that basis. The better course would have been to transfer it to the appropriate district in accordance with the joint order. <em>Thompson v. North Carolina, </em>1:06CV124-MU-02, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20864, at *2 (W.D.N.C. April 13, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s orders and remand with instructions that Byrd\u2019s filing be construed as a \u00a7 2254 petition and transferred to the appropriate district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
