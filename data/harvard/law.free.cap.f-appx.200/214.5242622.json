Green seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s May 4, 2005 order adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge to deny relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. Within ten days of that order, Green moved for reconsideration of the order based on not having received the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. The district court granted Green\u2019s motion, giving him additional time to file his objections and noting that the court would issue a new order as to the report and recommendation upon its receipt and consideration of Green\u2019s objections. Although Green filed his objections, the district court has not yet issued a final order in Green\u2019s \u00a7 2255 action taking his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-21\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Although Green\u2019s notice of appeal became effective when the district court ruled on his motion for reconsideration, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)\u00ae, because the court granted the motion, the order Green seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">Accordingly, we deny Green\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
