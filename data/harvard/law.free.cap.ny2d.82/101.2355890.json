The order below violates this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Matter of Wolpoff v Cuomo </em>(80 NY2d 70 [1992]) by second-guessing the Districting Commission\u2019s judgment on such matters as the appropriate definition of neighborhood boundaries and the policy of not splitting the City\u2019s 33,559 census tabulation blocks into smaller subdivisions. <em>(Matter of Johnson v Joy, </em>48 NY2d 689; <em>Matter of Fineway Supermarkets v State Liq.

Consequently, the Board of Estimate was abolished and some of its powers, by vote of the electorate of New York City, were transferred to the City Council, which in 1991 was expanded from 35 to 51 members (NY City Charter \u00a7 22). The task of redrawing the Council districts was assigned under the referendum to the bipartisan City Districting Commission, appointed by the Council and the Mayor (Charter \u00a7 50).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The Charter set forth a number of requirements for the districting plan. Each district, for example, was to \"be contiguous\u201d (Charter \u00a7 52 [2]), and the Commission was required to use the \"final count results\u201d of the 1990 census (Charter \u00a7 1152 [d] [11] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Charter additionally set forth seven criteria which were to be applied \"to the maximum extent practicable\u201d and given \"priority in the order in which they are listed\u201d (Charter \u00a7 52 [1]). Two of these are particularly relevant here \u2014 the second-ranked priority mandating \"fair and effective\u201d representation of minorities, and the third requiring that \"[district lines shall keep intact neighborhoods and communities with established ties of common interest and association, whether historical, racial, economic, ethnic, religious or other.\u201d (Charter \u00a7 52 [1] [b], M.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">For census purposes, the United States Census Bureau divided the City into 33,559 tabulation blocks, which are the smallest geographic units for which official census counts are available. As a result, the Commission adopted two polici\u00e9s: it would create districts by grouping together tabulation blocks, and it would not divide any tabulation blocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The focus of this litigation is tabulation block 105 in Brooklyn, which runs more than one mile along the waterfront, from the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to Old Fulton Street. Block 105 consists primarily of warehouses and industrial buildings, and official 1990 census data \u2014 which the Commission was bound to accept (Charter \u00a7 1152 [d] [11] [b]) \u2014 reported 47 residents. Extending from block 105 into the East River are 10 unpopulated piers, each its own tabulation block.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In pursuit of the second-ranked priority of ensuring fair and effective minority representation (Charter \u00a7 52 [1] [b]), the Commission chose to make District 38, which included the Sunset Park and Red Hook areas, a Latino-majority district. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>To do so, however, it was necessary to annex a noncontiguous area of Latinos living along Atlantic Avenue. Accordingly, a \"land bridge\u201d of 11 tabulation blocks \u2014 including block 105\u2014 was created to link the noncontiguous area with the rest of the district. By virtue of the Commission\u2019s policy of not splitting tabulation blocks, however, the lengthy waterfront also became a part of District 38, though it was not geographically necessary to include the entire waterfront as part of the land bridge. The piers adjacent to block 105 were placed in District 1 in Manhattan \u2014 the border between Manhattan and Brooklyn being \"the low-water mark on the shore of Long Island\u201d (Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 2-202 [1]; <em>see also, </em>\u00a7 2-202 [3]; Charter \u00a7 52 [1] [e] [fifth-ranked criteria is that a \"district shall not cross borough or county boundaries\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Residents and civic groups in Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood in District 33, objected to the districting plan because, in their view, the part of tabulation block 105 north of Atlantic Avenue and the adjacent five piers historically have been a part of Brooklyn Heights and thus should have been placed in District 33. Arguing that the plan violated the intact-neighborhoods requirement of Charter \u00a7 52 (1) (c), they commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to have the district lines redrawn to include this territory within their Council district.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Supreme Court granted the petition, finding an \"historic and unique relationship\u201d between Brooklyn Heights and the waterfront, and concluding that the Commission\u2019s refusal to split block 105 was arbitrary and capricious. The Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, affirmed, noting that \"petitioners\u2019 proof clearly established that the relevant portion of census tabulation block 105 has historically been considered a part of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood\u201d and that under these facts, the Commission\u2019s decision not to divide block 105 \"served no real purpose.\u201d (192 AD2d 22, 27, 28.) The dissent opined that ever since the construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) in the 1950s, Brooklyn Heights has been effectively separated from the waterfront and thus the intact-neighborhoods requirement is not implicated here, and that in any event, the Commission\u2019s policy of not dividing tabulation blocks was not arbitrary or capricious. The City appealed to this Court as of right (CPLR 5601 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Although the City contends that a \"neighborhood\u201d within the meaning of Charter \u00a7 52 (1) (c) can consist only of people, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>not unpopulated parcels of land, and thus residents of Brooklyn Heights cannot claim that the waterfront is part of their neighborhood, we need not resolve that issue today. Even assuming for purposes of this appeal that the disputed portion of the waterfront is part of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, we conclude that the petition should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The Commission was required to use the \"final count results\u201d of the 1990 census (Charter \u00a7 1152 [d] [11] [b]), and determined that it could best effectuate this mandate by building districts from tabulation blocks, the smallest geographical units for which census data was available. The Commission\u2019s policy choice not to split tabulation blocks implemented the Charter\u2019s requirement that census data be used in creating districts. Indeed, even the dissent acknowledges that \"in most instances\u201d the Commission cannot be asked to split a tabulation block (dissenting opn, at 110). It is not our role to second-guess the Commission\u2019s reasonable policy choice related to implementing the technical requirements of districting <em>(see, Matter of Wolpoff v Cuomo, </em>80 NY2d 70, 79).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">By contrast to the unequivocal mandate that census \"final count results\u201d be used, the Charter did not impose strict adherence to the seven ranked criteria, instead requiring only that the criteria be applied <em>\"to the maximum extent practica</em>ble\u201d (Charter \u00a7 52 [1]; emphasis added). Thus, the Charter contemplated the need for flexibility in the Commission\u2019s execution of what the United States Department of Justice described as \"a job of staggering proportions\u201d and \"an enormous task [that] necessarily involved many compromises and difficult choices.\u201d Since we are satisfied that the Commission\u2019s policy was not arbitrary and capricious (CPLR 7803 [3]), but was directly and reasonably related to implementing the census requirement, our review is at an end <em>(contrast, Matter of Wolpoff v Cuomo, </em>80 NY2d, at 80 [constitutional challenge to legislative action]).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In view of our conclusion with regard to block 105, it is unnecessary to consider the disposition of the five disputed piers, because they would not be contiguous to District 33 in any event <em>(see, </em>Charter \u00a7 52 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b188-8\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZV\">(dissenting). In upholding the final City Council redistricting plan adopted by the New York City Districting Commission, the majority has deferred to what it deems the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Commission\u2019s \"reasonable policy choice\u201d of maintaining the integrity of census tabulation blocks. In so ruling, the Court has discounted the importance of preserving neighborhood integrity and has, in effect, rewritten the New York City Charter provisions governing redistricting. Since, in my view, the challenged portion of the redistricting plan was not drafted in accordance with those Charter provisions, I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Section 52 of the City Charter establishes the criteria to be followed in creating new districts for the recently expanded City Council. The primary goal declared in the statute is equalization of the population encompassed within each district (NY City Charter \u00a7 52 [1] [a]). Deviations beyond a certain permissible range are permitted only when \"justified by the other criteria set forth in [the statute]\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Those criteria are, in turn, set forth in the order of their importance, and they are specifically required to \"be applied and given priority in the order in which they are listed\u201d \"to the maximum extent practicable\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 52 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">This dispute concerns the first two of the latter class of criteria. Section 52 (1) (b) requires that the plan \"be established in a manner that ensures the fair and effective representation of the racial and language minority groups in New York city which are protected by the United States [Vjoting [R]ights [A]ct of [1965].\u201d Section 52 (1) (c) requires that the district lines \"keep intact neighborhoods and communities with established ties of common interests and association, whether historical, racial, economic, ethnic, religious or other.\u201d In other words, assuming that the population deviations are kept within the permissible range, the Commission is directed first to consider the goal of ensuring fair and effective minority representation and then, \"to the maximum extent practicable,\u201d to draw district lines in such a way as to preserve the integrity of established neighborhoods and communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">There is no dispute here that the goal of ensuring fair and effective minority representation was considered and implemented. The Commission combined Sunset Park and Red Hook, two Brooklyn neighborhoods with high Latino populations, so that the resulting district would have enough members of that group to form a voting majority. Indeed, the Commission even went so far as to create a \"land bridge\u201d joining the two communities in order to advance the minority-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>representation goal without violating the independent statutory requirement of contiguity <em>(see, id., </em>\u00a7 52 [2]). Again, neither the creation nor the siting of this \"land bridge\u201d are challenged in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Petitioners\u2019 only quarrel with the Commission\u2019s plan in regard to the Sunset Park-Red Hook district is its decision to include in the connecting \"land bridge\u201d the entirety of the geographical entity known as census tabulation block 105, which runs along the Brooklyn waterfront from the Battery Tunnel to Old Fulton Street. According to petitioners, a portion of this block, along with the adjacent six Port Authority piers (Piers 1 through 6) that were included in Manhattan\u2019s District 1, are contained within the area that has historically been considered part of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Inasmuch as there was no sound reason for excising this small zone from the Council district that encompasses Brooklyn Heights, petitioners contend, the statutory criteria, specifically section 52 (1) (c)\u2019s neighborhood-integrity provision, were not properly observed and the redistricting plan is, consequently, defective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Respondents\u2019 initial contention that census tabulation block 105 and the adjacent piers are not part of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood lacks merit and need not be discussed at great length.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The main thrust of the present dispute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>respondents\u2019 alternative contention that the Districting Commission was not required to give controlling weight to section 52 (1) (c)\u2019s neighborhood-integrity criterion in this instance because of the overriding importance of maintaining the integrity of census tabulation blocks as the basic geographic units for designing City Council districts. Respondents stress that the use of these census tabulation blocks, which are the smallest geographical units for which United States Census Bureau population figures are available, is the only feasible method of determining the population in a given area. And, according to respondents, a strict rule keeping these blocks inviolate is essential for ensuring compliance with the Charter provision requiring that the Commission \"utilize the final count results of the [1990] census\u201d in determining the new Council district lines (NY City Charter \u00a7 1152 [d] [11] [b]; <em>see also, Seaman v Fedourich, </em>16 NY2d 94, 104).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Although it does not suggest that unflagging adherence to the census tabulation block units is necessary or required, the majority has upheld the Commission\u2019s actions on the theory that the Commission\u2019s insistence on the inviolability of census tabulation blocks is a \"reasonable\u201d and nonarbitrary policy choice made to implement the requirement that census data be used as the statistical basis for redistricting. Concluding that \"[i]t is not our role to second-guess the Commission\u2019s reasonable policy choice related to implementing the technical requirements of districting\u201d (majority opn, at 106), the majority holds that the courts have no further duty or responsibility to interfere with the Commission\u2019s decision. In my view, however, this analysis represents a misreading of the statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Under that mandate, the Commission is clearly <em>not </em>free to make its own policy choices regarding such values as minority representation and preserving neighborhood integrity. Moreover, in view of the clear language of the Charter provisions, the Commission cannot be deemed to have been given unfettered discretion to employ any methodology it wishes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>implement the Charter\u2019s technical requirements, regardless of that methodology\u2019s impact on the realization of those values. To the contrary, when the Legislature mandated that the criteria delineated in section 52 (1) be considered and applied \"to the maximum extent practicable,\u201d it limited the Commission\u2019s freedom to choose among the various \"reasonable\u201d methods of implementing the \"technical\u201d aspects of redistricting and, in effect, directed that, wherever possible, those methods must be harmonized with the Charter provision\u2019s substantive goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Thus, unlike the majority, I would not read the \"technical\u201d requirements of the Charter such as section 1152 (d) (11) (b) to be free-standing standards that exist and may be \"implemented\u201d independently and without regard to the values expressed in section 52 (1). Accordingly, contrary to the majority\u2019s view, I would conclude that the courts cannot simply defer to the Commission\u2019s policy choices with regard to technical implementation after examining them for rationality. Regardless of whether those policy choices are \"reasonable\u201d or otherwise, the courts are responsible for ensuring that the Commission adheres to its statutory mandate by adopting policies that promote the legislatively declared criteria or at least do not unnecessarily undermine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Viewed in that light and under the circumstances presented in this case, the Commission\u2019s insistence on keeping census tabulation blocks intact cannot be upheld. It is true that, in most instances, the Commission cannot be asked to split census tabulation blocks because there would then be no realistic way of determining the population within the subdivided geographical entities. In those situations, the value of preserving neighborhood integrity must give way, since adherence to it would not be \"practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In this case, however, the entire tabulation block in dispute has, at most, only 47 souls residing within its borders. Respondents cannot \u2014 and do not \u2014 seriously contend that so small a population could have any legally or politically significant impact on the size or ethnic character of a Council district, regardless of how it is distributed. Thus, apart from the abstract theoretical value of keeping census tabulation blocks inviolate, there is no real reason why census tabulation block 105 in particular could not be subdivided in the interest of preserving the integrity of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Manifestly, the goal of preserving the natural boundaries of that community is not rendered \u201cimpracticable\u201d because of the abstract benefit the Commission perceives in keeping all tabulation blocks intact and undivided. The Commission certainly could have subdivided tabulation block 105 so as to keep the small area between the Battery Tunnel and Old Fulton Street within the district covering Brooklyn Heights without either disturbing the Latino majority in the newly drawn Sunset Park-Red Hook district or creating a meaningful risk of population imbalance.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the negative impact of the Commission\u2019s effort to satisfy section 52 (1) (b) on the \u201clower priority\u201d goal of neighborhood integrity was not \u201cincidental.\u201d Rather, it was, at best, gratuitous, perhaps even arbitrary. Certainly, in light of the relatively trivial, and indeed barely articulable, value to be served by preserving the inviolability of census tabulation block 105, it cannot be said that the Commission acted to \"keep intact\u201d the Brooklyn Heights community \"to the maximum extent practicable.\u201d Accordingly, the mandate of the City Charter was not obeyed and the Commission\u2019s districts were properly modified. For that reason, I dissent and vote to affirm the order of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Hancock, Jr., Bellacosa and Smith concur in Per Curiam opinion; Judge Titone dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">. The focus of the parties\u2019 arguments, as well as of the decisions below, is the placement of the disputed section of census tabulation block 105. For that reason, both the majority opinion and this dissent are primarily concerned with that question. I would note, however, that respondents have offered no real justification at all for including the piers adjacent to census tabulation block 105 in a Council district that covers an area in lower Manhattan. The only explanation for this seeming anomaly that respondents have offered is the fact that the border of New York County is technically represented by the low water mark at the Brooklyn side of New York Harbor and, as a result, the computer program used to assist in the redistricting process annexed the adjoining pier area to the nearest district in New York County. In my view, that explanation does not furnish an adequate basis for removing the piers from the Council district covering Brooklyn Heights, the neighborhood of which they are a part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">. As the lower courts concluded, the considerable evidence adduced by petitioner supports the position that the disputed waterfront area was historically considered part of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Inasmuch as a \"historic\u201d connection with the neighborhood is sufficient under Charter \u00a7 52 (1) (c), the fact that the waterfront may have been separated from the other sections of the neighborhood as a result of the construction of an intersecting highway is not dispositive. Similarly unpersuasive is respondents\u2019 contention that the largely uninhabited waterfront strip can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>not be part of the \"neighborhood\u201d because, as used in Charter \u00a7 52 (1) (c), that term denotes groupings of people, not places. A neighborhood consists not only of the people who reside therein, but also of the physical features\u2014 its churches, parks, libraries and geographical landmarks, that give it its character <em>(see, </em>Websters Deluxe Unabridged Dictionary 1203 [2d ed 1983]). There is no basis for assuming that the drafters of the City Charter intended to suggest a more limited meaning when they used the term \"neighborhood\u201d in section 52 (1) (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
