We must decide whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to move for a new trial based on a court security officer (\u201cCSO\u201d) or Deputy United States Marshal\u2019s (\u201cMarshal\u201d) comments to a juror that the defendants were \u201cpigs\u201d was a denial of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel during trial and whether a defendant\u2019s inability to pay his counsel the full retainer fee caused the counsel not to represent the defendant completely because of the counsel\u2019s financial interest. The district judge determined that the convicted defendant was not entitled to habeas corpus relief on either ground. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AvE\">Petitioner-appellant, Juan Vincente Cad-erno, was convicted for his participation in a cocaine distribution conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, 952, and 963.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before sentencing, Caderno and four of his codefendants filed pro se letters alleging that, during a break in the jury deliberations, \u201cspectators, relatives, lawyers and defendants\u201d had observed a female juror engage in a conversation with a CSO or Marshal on two occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Exh. 1-266, attached letters. Caderno and his codefendants asserted that the CSO or Marshal told the juror that the defendants were \u201cpigs\u201d and that two defense attorneys advised the presiding judge of the conversations. They acknowledge that the judge reprimanded the juror and the CSO or Marshal and that he ordered counsel to respond to the letters. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">Caderno\u2019s counsel responded that, immediately upon noticing an apparent conversation between the juror and the CSO, he and other defense counsel notified the trial judge of their observation. Exh. 1-277 at 3. He stated that the district judge inquired about the conversations and instructed the jurors and the United States Marshal\u2019s office that no communications were to occur. Caderno\u2019s counsel stated that he witnessed the conversation but was unaware of the specific comments allegedly made by the CSO or Marshal to the juror. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">Following counsel\u2019s responses, the district judge entered an order stating that the defendants\u2019 letters did not constitute motions before the court. Exh. 1-285 at 1. The judge noted that, if the defendants wanted their convictions reviewed, they should request review through a procedurally correct motion or appeal. He also stated that he was satisfied by his inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>into the issues raised in the defendants\u2019 pro se letters. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Thereafter, Caderno and four of his co-defendants filed motions for a new trial based on the alleged contacts between the CSO or Marshal and juror during the jury deliberations. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1348-49 (11th Cir.1997). They asserted that the CSO or Marshal said to one of the jurors, in reference to the defendants, that \u201c[tjhese people are all pigs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349. The district judge denied the motions for a new trial because they were untimely under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. Exh. 1-484 at 2-3. The judge also noted that the alleged incidents were known to the defendants prior to the entry of the jury verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Caderno was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 235 months of imprisonment. He and his codefendants appealed the denial of their motions for a new trial based in part on their assertion that a CSO or Marshal had improper contact with a juror during jury deliberations. <em>Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1349. On direct appeal, we affirmed the district judge\u2019s determination that Caderno and his codefendants\u2019 motions for a new trial were filed untimely. <em>Id. </em>at 1351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Caderno reiterates his assertions in district court. He pursues his contention that, during jury deliberations, several of the codefendants\u2019 family members heard a CSO or a Marshal state to an unidentified juror, in reference to the defendants: \u201c \u2018 \u201cThese people are all pigs\u201d or \u201cThey\u2019re all pigs\u201d and \u201cThey must be like this at home.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Rl-1 at 7, \u00b6 9 (quoting <em>Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1349). Caderno states that his attorney and other defense counsel witnessed the exchange or were made aware of it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">In his report, a magistrate judge recommended that Caderno\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion be denied. The magistrate judge concluded that Caderno failed to supply any reliable indicia that a CSO or Marshal made any improper comments to one of the jurors and that, if the comments were made, they were addressed by the trial judge either on the record or informally outside the courtroom. Rl-17 at 6-7. Thus, the magistrate judge reasoned that a timely motion for new trial probably would not have been granted. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Over Caderno\u2019s objections, the district judge adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and denied Caderno\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Proceeding pro se, Caderno appealed the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion based on two alleged instances of ineffective assistance of counsel: (1) his attorney\u2019s failure to move for a new trial because of the CSO or Marshal\u2019s improper communication to a juror and (2) his contention that his attorney had a personal financial interest that conflicted with and adversely affected his defense of Caderno because Caderno was unable to pay his counsel the full retainer fee, which prevented his attorney from providing Caderno with a complete defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">A. <em>Failure to Move for New Trial Based on Security Officer\u2019s Communications with Juror</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>mixed question of law and fact. <em>Greene v. United States, </em>880 F.2d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.1989). The defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below constitutional standards and that his defense was prejudiced as a result. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Ineffective assistance exists if: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable; and (2) a reasonable probability exists that the outcome would have been different absent the deficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable and adequate, with great deference shown to choices dictated by reasonable trial strategy. <em>Rogers v. Zant, </em>13 F.3d 384, 386 (11th Cir.1994). Our review of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is from the perspective of defense counsel, and we consider the facts \u201cas they were known to counsel <em>at the time of the representation.\u201d United States v. Teague, </em>953 F.2d 1525, 1535 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">We have not addressed a \u00a7 2255 motion alleging counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to file a motion for a new trial after a security officer\u2019s improper contact with a juror. In an appeal from the denial of a defendant\u2019s state motion for post-conviction relief, the Supreme Court found that a bailiffs comment to three jurors, \u201c[o]h that wicked fellow [petitioner], he is' guilty,\u201d deprived the defendant of trial by a fair and impartial jury. <em>Parker v. Gladden, </em>385 U.S. 363, 363, 87 S.Ct. 468, 470, 17 L.Ed.2d 420 (1966) (per curiam) (alteration in original). In reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction, the Court noted that, \u201cpetitioner was entitled to be tried by 12, not 9 or even 10, impartial and unprejudiced jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 87 S.Ct at 471. On direct appeal in this case, we decided that the district court properly dismissed Cad-erno\u2019s motion for a new trial as untimely, but we did not address his allegation that improper juror contact warranted a new trial. <em>See Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Although Caderno maintained that his counsel observed the CSO or Marshal having a conversation with a juror in his pro se letter to the court, Caderno never asserted in district court, nor does he assert on appeal, that his counsel knew the substance of the conversation. Additionally, in his response to the trial judge\u2019s order, Caderno\u2019s counsel stated that he was not able to overhear any conversation which may have occurred between the CSO or Marshal and the juror. Consequently, Caderno has failed to establish that his counsel had any reason to object on the record or to move for a new trial because he has not shown that his counsel knew the allegedly prejudicial nature of the exchange between the CSO or Marshal and the juror when it occurred. It is uncontested that Caderno\u2019s counsel, along with codefendants\u2019 counsel, immediately brought to the trial judge\u2019s attention that a conversation had taken place between the CSO or Marshal and the juror. Therefore, we conclude that Caderno\u2019s counsel did not act unreasonably by not objecting on the record to the conversation between the CSO or the Marshal and the juror, since he did not know the substance of it, or by not filing a timely motion for new trial based on that conversation. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066; <em>see Tejada v. Dugger, </em>941 F.2d 1551, 1559 (11th Cir.1991) (recognizing that a petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief \u201cwhen his claims are merely \u2018eonclusory allegations unsupported by specifics\u2019 or \u2018contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">B. <em>Conflict of Interests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">Caderno also asserts that his counsel had a financial conflict of interest that adversely affected his defense because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>Caderno was unable to pay his counsel the full retainer fee. Caderno contends that this resulted in his counsel\u2019s having \u201cto sit through many days of trial proceedings without being paid fees he could have been earning by working on other defendants\u2019 cases.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 33. Therefore, Caderno argues that an actual conflict of interests existed because his counsel\u2019s personal financial interest conflicted with his defense of Caderno. Because of his attorney\u2019s personal financial concerns, Caderno alleges that his attorney met with him only twice before trial, failed to object to the alleged improper comments made by a CSO or Marshal to a juror, declined to employ an interpreter to assist in communications with Caderno, agreed to cancel a discovery conference, and refused to file a motion for a bond hearing pending sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>an appellant\u2019s contention that his attorney had a conflict of interests and, consequently, provided ineffective assistance. <em>Mills v. Singletary, </em>161 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir. 1998) (per curiam), <em>cert denied, </em>528 U.S. 1082, 120 S.Ct. 804, 145 L.Ed.2d 677 (2000). To succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim based on a conflict of interests, an appellant must show specific instances in the record that \u201cdemonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980); <em>see United States v. Marrera, </em>768 F.2d 201, 208 (7th Cir.1985) (defining \u201cperformance\u201d in the conflict-of-interest context as meaning \u201cany defense counsel decision which can reasonably be expected to affect the ultimate defense whether that decision be made before, during, or after trial\u201d). \u201c[T]he possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. at 1719. \u201cA speculative or hypothetical conflict ... does not violate the Constitution\u201d; the appellant must demonstrate that his lawyer \u201c \u2018actively represented conflicting interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 968 (11th Cir.) (quoting <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. at 1719), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>910 F.2d 713 (11th Cir. 1990) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Caderno asserts that his counsel had a financial conflict of interest based on Caderno\u2019s failure to pay fully his counsel\u2019s fees, which conflicted with his defense of Caderno. We have not addressed specifically a conflict-of-interests argument based on a contention that counsel was concerned with his own financial interest throughout the trial, which resulted in his not providing the defendant with complete representation. Under the reasoning in <em>Cuyler </em>and <em>Khoury, </em>it is manifest that Caderno must establish that an actual financial conflict existed by showing that his counsel actively represented his own financial interest during Caderno\u2019s trial, rather than showing the possibility of an actual financial conflict. <em>See Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. at 1719;, <em>see also Khoury, </em>901 F.2d at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">In support of his argument that his counsel had a financial conflict of interest, Caderno filed his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and three letters written from his attorney to Caderno after his conviction. Rl-3 at Attachments FI, Gl, HI, II. These documents, however, fail to show that Caderno\u2019s counsel had an actual financial conflict; the letters show only the possibility of such a conflict. For example, Caderno\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, filed after the conclusion of Caderno\u2019s trial, states that, although Caderno never paid him for his services, their differences were unrelated to payment. Rl-3 at Attachment FI. Although the letters by Cad-erno\u2019s counsel, sent after the conclusion of Caderno\u2019s trial, clearly expressed Cader-no\u2019s counsel\u2019s frustration at not being paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees for representing Caderno at trial, the letters do not indicate that Caderno\u2019s attorney had an actual financial conflict because of his own financial interest during Caderno\u2019s trial. <em>See id. </em>at Attachments G1, H1, I1; <em>see also Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. at 1719.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">In this court, Caderno supports his argument that his counsel had a actual financial conflict during his trial with his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and post-trial letters. Because Caderno only speculates that his counsel had an actual financial conflict, he has failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s financial interest actually conflicted with his representation of Cad-erno thereby adversely affecting Cader-no\u2019s defense. Without a showing of actual conflicting interests, there is no constitutional violation. <em>See Khoury, </em>901 F.2d at 968. \u201cAlthough a \u2018defendant\u2019s failure to pay fees may cause some divisiveness between attorney and client,\u2019 courts generally presume that counsel will subordinate his or her pecuniary interests and honor his or her professional responsibility to a client.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>139 F.3d 924, 932 (D.C.Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. O\u2019Neil, </em>118 F.3d 65, 71 (2d Cir. 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">In this appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Caderno argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to move for a new trial upon learning that a CSO or Marshal had commented to a juror that the defendants were \u201cpigs.\u201d He also speculates that his attorney had an actual financial conflict of interests because Caderno could not pay his full retainer fee, which adversely affected Cader-no\u2019s defense. For the reasons that we have explained, the district judge\u2019s denial of Caderno\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">. The description of this cocaine distribution conspiracy and the proceedings in district court are found in our opinion on direct appeal in which we affirmed the convictions and sentences of the eight codefendants. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1243-18\">. These alleged conversations occurred on the courthouse terrace provided for members of the jury who were smokers. Exh. 1-277 at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">. Because Caderno filed his \u00a7 2255 motion after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), the AEDPA governs this appeal. Our review is limited to the issues specified in the certificate of appealability: 1) whether Caderno\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a timely objection or motion for a new trial based on an alleged conversation between a CSO or Marshal and a juror; and 2) whether counsel had a financial conflict of interest that adversely affected Caderno's defense.
