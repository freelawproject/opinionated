For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">On December 20, 2002, Plaintiffs Adell and Otis Daniels, a black couple, arrived at Advantage Rent-A-Car location 103 seeking a rental car. Mr. and Mrs. Daniels had been involved in an automobile accident, and needed a temporary replacement for their own car. The rental was arranged for and paid by the Danielses\u2019 insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Customer service representative Michelle Kamenicky asked Mr. and Mrs. Daniels for a credit card to cover a deposit for their rental. Mr. Daniels provided Ms. Kamenicky with a debit card. On regular, non-insurance rentals paid for with a debit card, Advantage requires a $200 deposit. Advantage asks for only a $50 deposit for insurance rentals, however. Ms. Kamenicky told Mr. Daniels that the deposit was $200, since he was paying with a debit card. At this point, Mr. Daniels provided Ms. Kamenicky with a different debit card, which was tied to his Merrill Lynch account.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Ms. Kamenicky swiped the card and informed Mr. Daniels that it had been declined. As Mr. Daniels\u2019s account resources exceeded $200 at that time, his card should not have been declined. In any event, Ms. Kamenicky requested another credit card or cash. Mr. Daniels, at this point, informed Ms. Kamenicky that the Danielses\u2019 insurance company had told them the deposit would only be $50. Advantage\u2019s District Manager Sharon Slonaker intervened, and she told Ms. Kamenicky that only $50 was required for insurance rentals. Mr. Daniels paid $50 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Mr. and Mrs. Daniels were assigned a Hyundai Accent at a rate of $21.74/day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Daniels found the Accent to be too small and asked for a Ford Escort. The Accent is classified by Advantage as an \u201ceconomy\u201d car, and the Escort is a \u201ccompact\u201d car. Advantage charges different rates for these different classes of cars. Nonetheless, Advantage employees told Mr. and Mrs. Daniels that they could exchange the Accent for an Escort at Advantage\u2019s 107 location at no extra cost, if they so desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">Mr. and Mrs. Daniels decided to exchange the Accent, so they went to location 107. At this new location, Mr. and Mrs. Daniels waited in line behind Kathryn Burke, a white woman. Ms. Burke, like Mr. and Mrs. Daniels, was seeking an insurance rental. The terms of Ms. Burke\u2019s rental had been previously negotiated by Advantage and Ms. Burke\u2019s insurance carrier, Allstate Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">When Ms. Burke reached the front of the line, the customer service representative, Jeff Davis, asked for her credit card. Ms. Burke told Mr. Davis that her credit limit had been reached. Mr. Davis responded that he was not going to charge her credit card, and that it was only for security purposes. Mr. and Mrs. Daniels, as previously noted, had been charged a $50 deposit, and, upon seeing that Ms. Burke was not required to pay a deposit, Mr. Daniels called Ms. Sloanaker at location 103. Ms. Sloanaker explained that Ms. Burke should have been charged a $50 deposit, in accordance with company policy. After getting off the phone with Mr. Daniels, Ms. Sloanaker immediately called Mr. Davis, informed him of his mistake, and asked him to get a deposit from Ms. Burke if she was still in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">Company policy regarding insurance rentals before October 30, 2000, was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>swipe the customer\u2019s credit card and keep the card number and customer information on file, rather than charging a $50 deposit to the credit card. Mr. Davis did not know the company\u2019s policy had changed because he had been working at the company\u2019s telephone reservation center when the policy went into effect. Mr. Davis was subsequently reprimanded for not obtaining a $50 deposit from Ms. Burke.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Ms. Burke was given a Chevrolet Cavalier, a compact car, at a rate of $19/day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">When Mr. and Mrs. Daniels returned to the line, Mr. Davis was helping Jency Valiente, a Hispanic woman, and Corey Anderson, a black man. Ms. Valiente was renting a car for the use of both herself and Mr. Anderson. Theirs was a walk-up retail rental, rather than an insurance rental. As a security measure, Advantage requires retail renters to produce a major credit card in the renter\u2019s name. Advantage\u2019s policy is to charge retail customers the amount of the rental plus a $200 refundable deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Mr. Davis asked Ms. Valiente for a credit card. As with Mr. Daniel\u2019s card, Ms. Valiente\u2019s card had adequate funds to pay the deposit. When Mr. Davis swiped Ms. Valiente\u2019s card, however, he announced that it had been declined. Ms. Valiente next presented her father\u2019s debit card, and told Mr. Davis that he could call her father to get authorization for its use. Mr. Davis told Ms. Valiente that this was against company policy. Eventually, Ms. Valiente called her mechanic, who brought $200 cash for the deposit. After much convincing, the location manager, Victor Medina, agreed to take the cash. This was against company policy; Advantage normally required authorization for the full amount of a retail rental plus the $200 deposit on a credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">Ms. Valiente, like Mr. and Mrs. Daniels, was given a Hyundai Accent. For this, she was charged $23.99/day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As it turned out, the Accent\u2019s wheels were improperly aligned. When Ms. Valiente reported the problem to location 107, she was told that the location had no other economy cars to rent to her. Ms. Valiente and Mr. Anderson called another Advantage location, and this location agreed to trade the defective car for one with proper alignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">Plaintiffs Mr. and Mrs. Daniels, Ms. Valiente, and Mr. Anderson brought suit against Advantage for racial discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, and 2000a. After the close of discovery, Advantage filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">The district court granted Advantage\u2019s motion. First, the district court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 2000a claim failed because the statute covers only places of \u201cpublic accommodation,\u201d and rental car establishments do not fall into this category. Second, the district court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1982 claims failed because Plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence showing that Advantage\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiseriminatory reasons for the allegedly unequal treatment were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">Plaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on their claims under \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment. <em>Wallace v. Tex. Tech Univ., </em>80 F.3d 1042, 1046 (5th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, presents no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); <em>see Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cOnce a summary judgment motion is made and properly supported, the nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts in the record showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>80 F.3d at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">In analyzing Plaintiffs\u2019 case under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982, the district court applied the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first step in this analysis requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802; <em>LaPierre v. Benson Nissan, Inc., </em>86 F.3d 444, 448 (5th Cir.1996). In this circuit, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case under \u00a7 1981 by showing that \u201c(1) he or she is a member of a racial minority; (2) the defendant had an intent to discriminate on the basis of race; and (3) the discrimination concerned one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute.\u201d <em>Bellows v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>118 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.1997). In establishing the second element of the prima facie case, a plaintiff may rely on circumstantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA cause of action based upon section 1982 likewise requires an intentional act of racial discrimination by a defendant.\u201d <em>Vaughner v. Pulito, </em>804 F.2d 873, 877 (5th Cir.1986) (comparing \u00a7 1982 to \u00a7 1981); <em>cf. Woods-Drake v. Lundy, </em>667 F.2d 1198, 1200 n. 3 (5th Cir.1982) (\u201cSections 1981 and 1982 are similar in language, legislative history, and purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to provide legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802; <em>see also Lee v. Washington County Bd. of Educ., </em>625 F.2d 1235, 1238 (5th Cir.1980). If the defendant meets this burden, \u201cthe <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework\u2014with its presumptions and burdens\u2014disappear[s].\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quotation marks omitted). At this point, the plaintiff \u201cmust be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143 (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the [defendant\u2019s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the [defendant] unlawfully discriminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Plaintiffs have met the first and the third elements of the prima facie case. First, Plaintiffs, two black men, one black woman, and one Hispanic woman, are all racial minorities. In addition, in contracting with Advantage to lease cars, Plaintiffs were engaged in activities enumerated in \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982; \u00a7 1981 prohibits discrimination in making contracts<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>\u00a7 1982 prohibits discrimination in leasing property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Furthermore, Plaintiffs have put forward evidence from which the final element of the prima facie case, intentional discrimination, may be inferred: (1) Advantage declined Mr. Daniels\u2019s debit card and Ms. Valiente\u2019s credit card, when both cards had sufficient balances to cover the transactions; (2) Advantage required Mr. and Mrs. Daniels and Ms. Valiente to pay deposits, but did not require Ms. Burke to do so; (3) Mr. and Mrs. Daniels and Ms. Valiente were charged higher rental rates than Ms. Burke; (4) Ms. Valiente was given a car with faulty alignment; and (5) Advantage initially refused to accept a cash deposit from Ms. Valiente. Thus, the district court properly found that Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">As explained below, however, Advantage has presented legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the occurrences listed by Plaintiffs. The question, then, is whether Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to determine that Advantage\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual. Because we find that Plaintiffs have produced insufficient evidence suggesting that Advantage\u2019s given reasons are pretextual, we hold that summary judgment in favor of Advantage was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">First, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Advantage\u2019s explanation for rejecting Mr. Daniels\u2019s and Ms. Valiente\u2019s cards was untrue. Advantage claims that the cards were rejected by Advantage because, when swiped, they were declined. Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that their credit cards were not actually declined, or that Advantage employees lied when they told Mr. Daniels and Ms. Valiente that the cards had been declined. Plaintiffs merely provide evidence that their cards should have had sufficient resources to cover the charges. This evidence is insufficient to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">Second, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence contradicting Advantage\u2019s explanation for charging Mr. and Mrs. Daniels, Ms. Valiente, and Ms. Burke different deposit amounts. Advantage asserts that its company policy is to charge insurance renters a $50 deposit and to charge retail renters a $200 deposit. According to Advantage, Ms. Valiente was charged a higher deposit because she was a retail renter, rather than an insurance renter, like Mr. and Mrs. Daniels and Ms. Burke. Plaintiffs have offered no evidence suggesting that this explanation is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Advantage concedes that both Mr. Daniels and Ms. Burke should have been charged $50 deposits. But Advantage has put forward evidence that Ms. Kamenicky\u2019s attempt to charge the Daniels-es a $200 deposit and Mr. Davis\u2019s failure to charge Ms. Burke a $50 deposit were caused by confusion over Advantage\u2019s policy with regard to insurance rentals, not racial animus. Ms. Kamenicky, mistakenly applying Advantage\u2019s retail rental policy, asked Mr. and Mrs. Daniels for a $200 deposit. Ms. Slonaker, Advantage\u2019s District Manager, quickly intervened to inform Ms. Kamenicky that insurance rentals require only a $50 deposit. Accordingly, Mr. and Mrs. Daniels eventually paid only a $50 deposit\u2014the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>amount. Similarly, Mr. Davis, acting in accordance with Advantage\u2019s former insurance rental policy, did not charge Ms. Burke a deposit. When Ms. Slonaker discovered this, however, she informed Mr. Davis that a deposit was required for all insurance rentals, and she reprimanded him for not obtaining a deposit from Ms. Burke. Again, Plaintiffs have put forward no evidence contradicting any of Advantage\u2019s evidence on this point, or suggesting that they were charged deposits because of their race.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Third, Plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence that Advantage\u2019s given reason for charging Mr. and Mrs. Daniels and Ms. Valiente higher rental rates than Ms. Burke was pretextual. Advantage has provided evidence that retail customers, like Ms. Valiente, are subject to different rates than insurance customers, like Mr. and Mrs. Daniels and Mrs. Burke. Although Mr. and Mrs. Daniels and Ms. Burke were all insurance customers, Mr. and Mrs. Darnels used a different insurance company than Ms. Burke. The two insurance companies, apparently, had negotiated different rates with Advantage. Therefore, the uncontroverted evidence suggests that Advantage\u2019s reason for charging an array of rental rates for differently situated customers had nothing to do with the customers\u2019 races.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Fourth, Ms. Valiente has put forward no evidence suggesting that Advantage purposefully rented her a car with faulty alignment. Ms. Valiente has not even demonstrated that Advantage knew about the problem before renting the car to her. Rather, the undisputed evidence is that, when Ms. Valiente called another Advantage location, the location readily agreed to exchange the ear for one with proper alignment. The evidence put forward by Ms. Valiente is insufficient to allow a rational jury to infer discriminatory motivations on the part of Advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Fifth, Plaintiffs point to no evidence that Advantage\u2019s explanation for refusing to accept a cash deposit from Ms. Valiente was specious. Advantage contends that its policy required retail renters to present a valid credit card to which Advantage could charge the full amount of the rental plus a $200 deposit. Thus, accepting a $200 cash deposit was contrary to Advantage\u2019s policy. This policy is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for Advantage\u2019s initial reluctance to accept the cash. In response, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that this was not Advantage\u2019s policy, or that Advantage only enforced this policy against minorities. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not met their burden on this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Since Plaintiffs have put forward no summary judgment evidence suggesting that Advantage\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its employees\u2019 actions were pretextual, this case presents no issue of disputed material fact, and Advantage is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Thus, the district court properly granted Advantage\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Advantage is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b964-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-10\">. Advantage has negotiated different rental rates with different insurance companies. The Danielses' rental rate was set by an agreement between Advantage and Charter Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-7\">. This rate had been set by a prior agreement between Advantage and Allstate Insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. Walk-up rental rates constantly fluctuate. The rates are set by Advantage\u2019s \"rate analysts\" based on what is happening in the market. When retail customers rent cars from Advantage, customer service representatives access the current rate on their computers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b967-8\">. Although our research has found no cases in this circuit applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>outside the employment context, neither party has challenged the district court\u2019s methodology. Therefore, we will assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the district court\u2019s methodology was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b967-14\">.
