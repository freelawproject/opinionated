Glover, </em>No. 03-50195, 2003 WL 22682127 (5th Cir. Nov. 13, 2003) (unpublished). The COA specified the issue on appeal as whether Glover\u2019s counsel objected to the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) in a manner that rendered his assistance ineffective. <em>Id. </em>at 3. As it appeared that the district court did not address the merits of this issue below, the parties were also directed to address whether the record is sufficiently developed for appellate review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The Government concedes that the record is not sufficiently developed for review by this court. Accordingly, the Government now moves to remand this matter to the district court to allow for the development of a complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The Government\u2019s motion is well-taken. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">MOTION TO REMAND GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED; MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE BRIEF DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
