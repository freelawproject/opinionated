Swift alleges in his lawsuit that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated because he was housed in a screening cell for two weeks without bedding or a pillow while jail officials investigated alleged misconduct by Swift. He claims that the denial of bedding material amounted to a denial of basic human needs, and he claims to have suffered back and hip injuries as a result. The district court rejected his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-21\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion. The record supports the district court\u2019s determination that the deprivation was not sufficiently serious and the Clay County jailers were not sufficiently culpable to violate the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Swift was housed in the screening cell only as long as necessary to investigate the allegations made against him and to secure the availability of alternative housing. The evidence also indicates that his back injury did not manifest itself for many months after his confinement in the screening cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
