Marvin Rodriguez also appeals the denial of his application for withholding of deportation and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-24\">We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the BIA\u2019s legal rulings but \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration regulations if the interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>The substantial-evidence standard requires only that the decision have some basis in fact in the record; it does not require that we agree with the decision. <em>Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 816 (5th Cir.2003). Under the substantial evidence test, we may not reverse the BIA\u2019s factual determination unless the evidence compels it. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-25\">The record supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Marvin Rodriguez\u2019s testimony is contradictory. The Rodriguez family\u2019s assertion that Marvin Rodriguez was specifically targeted by guerrillas is contradicted by his own account of the bridge attack, in which he testified that the guerrillas had mistaken him for a member of the military. In addition, the Rodriguez family has failed to provide any documentary evidence to support the claim of persecution. In light of the vague and contradictory testimony given by Marvin Rodriguez, the BIA did not err in concluding that some form of documentary support was vital to the Rodriguez family\u2019s claims. <em>See In re Y-B, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 1136, 1139 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-26\">Marvin Rodriguez also contends that he is entitled to relief under the CAT because deportation to Guatemala would almost certainly lead to his being tortured. The CAT requires an alien to show \u201c \u2018that it is more likely than not that he or she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). In the absence of any corroborating evidence to support his claims, Marvin Rodriguez\u2019s inconsistent testimony cannot sustain his burden of proof. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying Marvin Rodriguez\u2019s CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Petitioners Marvin and Ana Maria Rodriguez have not briefed the BIA\u2019s denial of their application for cancellation of removal. The issue is therefore waived on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The Petitioners\u2019 petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
