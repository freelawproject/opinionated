He argues that the district court\u2019s judgment should be vacated and his case remanded because the district court erred in characterizing his supervised-release violations as Grade B violations under the policy statements set forth by the Sentencing Commission, when they were only Grade C violations. Freeman contends that the district court thus considered the incorrect sentence available and an inapplicable sentencing range, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3588(e) and 3553(a)(4) which require consideration of the appropriate policy statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Because Freeman did not assert this argument in the district court, this court\u2019s review is for plain error only. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc), <em>abrogated in part, Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). As the parties agree, the district court committed error at Freeman\u2019s revocation hearing in concluding that the supervised-release violations were Grade B violations, and the error was arguably clear in light of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1, p.s., and the Texas statutes relating to Freeman\u2019s violations. <em>See Calverley, </em>37 F.3d at 162-64. However, Freeman fails to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Although the district court is required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) to consider the applicable policy statements, this court has held that the policy statements relating to revocation of supervised release and resentencing after revocation are advisory only and non-binding. <em>United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 92-93 (5th Cir.1994). Because there are no applicable Sentencing Guidelines, this court will uphold a defendant\u2019s \u201crevocation and sentence unless it is in violation of law or is plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Teran, </em>98 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">The district court\u2019s revocation of Freeman\u2019s supervised release and its imposition of a twenty-four-month sentence were not in violation of law, but were in accordance with the governing statutory authority, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). <em>See Teran, </em>98 F.3d at 836. Because the district court could, on remand, revoke Freeman\u2019s supervised release and impose the same sentence (and such a sentence would not be plainly unreasonable), Freeman fails to demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s error in classifying his supervised-release violations as Grade B violations. <em>See United States v. Leonard, </em>157 F.3d 343, 346 (5th Cir.1998). Consequently, he fails to satisfy the plain error standard of review. <em>Id.; See also United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Calverley, </em>37 F.3d at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
