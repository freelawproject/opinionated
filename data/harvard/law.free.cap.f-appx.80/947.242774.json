Heimlich appeals the jury verdict for First Bank, N.A., on his civil-rights complaint. For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Heimlich filed suit alleging that First Bank made false statements that caused him to be charged with and convicted of a crime that was later overturned by the state appellate court. He further argued that First Bank invaded his privacy in violation of the federal Privacy Protection Act; tortiously interfered with his contractual and business relationships; converted his money; wrongfully dishonored his check; and maliciously prosecuted him, resulting in false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The jury rejected most of his contentions. It found, for example, that First Bank had not engaged in a conspiracy to deprive Heimlich of liberty or property, and that First Bank was not negligent in placing a hold on his bank account. The jury did, however, find that First Bank violated its fiduciary duty to Heimlich by releasing account information without authority and by seizing the proceeds in his account. Nonetheless, the jury found that Heimlich suffered no damages from that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-17\">Shortly after the district court entered final judgment on December 4, 2001, Heimlich filed a notice of appeal, in which he raised three specific issues. First, he contended that the district court erred by giving the jury a \u201cjury nullification\u201d instruction. Second, he claimed that the district court erred in submitting a state appellate court opinion to the jury. Finally, he argued that the evidence did not support certain jury findings, that the court\u2019s \u00a7 1983 jury instruction incorrectly included an intent requirement, and that the court erred in presenting the issue of probable cause to the jury for determination. Just over a week later, he attempted to withdraw that filing by submitting a \u201cWithdrawal of Appeal\u201d so that the district court could rule on his post-trial motions. He filed a second notice of appeal on February 13, 2002. In this notice, he raised two additional arguments: that multiple errors rendered a constitutionally intolerable result and that he was denied equal protection and due process by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Heimlich\u2019s attempted withdrawal of his original notice of appeal, however, was ineffective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Heimlich\u2019s first notice of appeal raised three specific issues, our review is confined to those issues only.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his brief to this court, Heimlich failed to brief two of these issues\u2014the submission of the state appellate opinion to the jury, and the sufficiency of the evidence. Accordingly, he has waived these two issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only issues properly before us involve the district court\u2019s jury instructions. Heimlich has not shown that he raised any objection to the jury instructions before the jury began deliberation, and we therefore review the instructions for plain error only.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Heimlich first contends that the district court erred in instructing the jury that intent is an element of a \u00a7 1983 claim. The district court instructed the jury that, in order to prevail on his \u00a7 1983 claim, he must prove that \u201cFirst Bank intentionally committed acts that violated\u201d certain of Heimlich\u2019s constitutional rights. Although \u00a7 1983 itself does not contain an independent intent requirement, a plaintiff must prove a violation of an underlying constitutional or statutory right,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and this underlying right may contain an intent component. In this ease, Heimlich\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was based upon an allegation of malicious prosecution. Under Texas law, the tort of malicious prosecution includes, as an element, a requirement that the defendant acted with \u201cmalice.\u201d Moreover, a private actor is not amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983 unless the party was \u201c \u2018a willful participant in joint action with the State or its agents.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given that the definition of \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d requires malice and that \u00a7 1983 requires willfulness, it cannot be said that the court\u2019s instruction on intent was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">Heimlich next argues that the district court\u2019s instruction to the jury on probable cause was error. Although his argument here is unclear, he appears to claim that the jury should have been instructed that he was prosecuted without probable cause. To prevail on a claim of malicious prosecution under Texas law, however, a plaintiff must prove that the defendants acted without probable cause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury was thus entitled to determine whether First Bank reasonably could have believed that Heimlich had committed a crime before the criminal proceedings were begun.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Heimlich has not shown that the district court plainly erred by submitting this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Heimlich\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred by telling the jury \u201cstories\u201d regarding \u201cjury nullification.\u201d The record on appeal does not reflect any such \u201cstories\u201d or instructions to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>and Heimlich has provided us with no information to corroborate his claim. Consequently, Heimlich has not shown the existence of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Because each of Heimlich\u2019s arguments are without merit, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The parties each filed numerous motions with their briefs on appeal. We dispose of these as follows. First Bank\u2019s request to strike the \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d contained in Heimlich\u2019s record excerpts is GRANTED. The motions that Heimlich included in his reply brief\u2014a petition for a writ of mandamus and motion to strike portions of First Bank\u2019s brief\u2014are DENIED. Heimlich\u2019s motion for retroactive recusal of the district judge and his petition for en banc hearing are DENIED. The \u201cSupplemental Letters\u201d that Heimlich submitted, presumably pursuant to Fed. RApp. P. 28(j), are STRICKEN for noncompliance with the rule.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
