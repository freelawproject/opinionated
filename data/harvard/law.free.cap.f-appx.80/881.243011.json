For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">In his petition, Weldmichael first challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Weldmichael fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Weldmichael seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Weldmichael\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, both of which require the applicant to make a more stringent showing to qualify for relief. To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). To obtain relief under the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003). Because Weldmichael fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standards for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Finally, Weldmichael contends that the Board faded to engage in reasoned decision making when it affirmed the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2003). In support of his claim, Weldmichael cites numerous federal appellate cases requiring the Board to articulate a reasoned basis for its decision. <em>See, e.g., Mousa v. INS, </em>223 F.3d 425, 430 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Panrit v. INS, </em>19 F.3d 544, 546 (10th Cir.1994). We find that by explicitly adopting the immigration judge\u2019s decision as the agency\u2019s final determination, the Board has fulfilled this requirement. Cf. <em>Gandarilla-Zambrana v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>44 F.3d 1251, 1255 (4th Cir.1995) (upholding the Board\u2019s practice of adopting, without further explanation, the reasoning of the immigration judge and stating that the immigration judge\u2019s decision then becomes the sole basis for this court\u2019s review).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
