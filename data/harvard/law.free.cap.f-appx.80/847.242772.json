She was sentenced to five years imprisonment and appeals her sentence, arguing that the district court clearly erred in finding that she abused a position of trust. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.3 (2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">Smith\u2019s offenses occurred while she was promotions manager at Food Lion, Incorporated. While she held that position, Food Lion carried on a number of promotions involving cash prizes. The winners were determined by an outside fulfillment agency. Smith\u2019s position required her to receive the list of winners, determine whether they were eligible, and direct that checks be prepared for her to disburse to the winners. Between July 1998 and June 2000, in five different Food Lion promotions, Smith deleted winners selected by the outside fulfillment agencies and substituted variations of her own name or family members\u2019 names on Food Lion memoranda and records. In this manner, Smith collected checks for $34,300 and caused Food Lion to issue two checks totaling $384,600 to her grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">The district court\u2019s factual determination that a defendant abused a position of public or private trust is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Caplinger, </em>339 F.3d 226, 235 (4th Cir.2003). A position of trust is \u201ccharacterized by professional or managerial discretion (ie., substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference),\u201d and employees in such positions are subject to less supervision than employees with non-diseretionary duties. USSG \u00a7 3B1.3, comment. (n.1). Thus, it does not apply to a bank teller or hotel clerk who embezzles or steals from his employer because these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>and similar positions involve little discretion and close supervision. <em>Id. </em>Whether the adjustment applies is determined from the perspective of the victim. <em>Caplinger, </em>839 F.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">This court has previously set out specific factors to be considered in determining whether the adjustment applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">(1) whether the defendant had either special duties or special access to information not available to other employees; (2) the extent of the discretion the defendant possesses; (3) whether the defendant\u2019s acts indicate that he is more culpable than others who are in positions similar to his and who engage in criminal acts; and (4) viewing the question of abuse of trust from the victim\u2019s perspective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-8\"><em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 203 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\"><em>Caplinger </em>describes the distinction between ordinary fraud and abuse of a position of trust as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-10\">A sentencing court must \u201ccarefully distinguish between those arms-length commercial relationships where trust is created by the defendant\u2019s personality or the victim\u2019s credulity\u201d and those \u201cwhere a \u2018fiduciary or personal trust relationship exists\u2019 with [the victim], and the defendant takes advantage of the relationship to perpetrate or conceal the offense.\u201d Only the latter circumstances justify the enhancement. At bottom, \u00a7 3B1.3\u2019s critical term\u2014\u201cposition of public or private trust\u201d\u2014is a \u201cterm of art, appropriating some of the aspects of the legal concept of a trustee or fiduciary.\u201d In other words, application of the enhancement \u201crequires more than a mere showing that the victim had confidence in the defendant.\u201d Something more akin to a fiduciary function is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 237 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Smith contends, as she did in the district court, that her position as promotions manager with Food Lion did not give her special access to information not available to other employees because her supervisor, Dave Godfredson, also received copies of the winners\u2019 list. However, no witness with actual knowledge testified that Godfredson received winners\u2019 lists. Godfredson testified that the standard procedure was for lists of winners to be sent to the promotions manager, i.e., to Smith. Smith further argues that she had little discretion in her work and that Godfredson kept closely informed about her work. But Godfredson testified that he was concerned only with the concepts of Food Lion\u2019s promotions and always delegated the details to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">Thus, Smith had access to special information (the winners\u2019 lists) and was entrusted by her supervisors with verifying the winners, excluding any who were disqualified, and instructing employees in the Expense Payables Department to disburse considerable sums of the company\u2019s money to whomever she identified as winners. In practice, Smith operated without supervision from within the company, and was caught only after the IRS notified Food Lion of a discrepancy between a winner\u2019s name and Social Security number. Smith\u2019s position placed her in a type of fiduciary relationship with her employer, which she abused. Therefore, we conclude that the district court\u2019s determination that Smith abused a position of trust was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Akz\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
