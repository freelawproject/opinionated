The Villarreals filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint as representatives of the estate of their deceased son, Jorge. They alleged that the City violated Jorge\u2019s due process rights by having a deliberately indifferent policy or practice by which it permitted and even encouraged a public-works employee, defendant Lazaro Castellano, to drive under the influence of alcohol. They also asserted a claim under the Texas Tort Claims Act (\u201cTTCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">Late on the evening of August 9, 1997, near Elsa, Texas, Castellano, while under the influence of alcohol, drove his car through a stop sign and collided with the 18-year-old Jorge\u2019s car, causing Jorge\u2019s death. It has been the Villarreals\u2019 contention that Castellano was acting within the scope of his employment at that time, in that he was returning to Mercedes in order to close up the Mercedes Civic Center following a private function there. They argue that, for TTCA purposes, he was on a \u201cspecial mission\u201d for his employer. They also complain that the district court erred by \u201crefus[ing] to consider\u201d an affidavit from Castellano that they submitted after the district court had granted the City\u2019s summary-judgment motion. In this 2001 affidavit, Castellano attested that, at the time of the accident, he was in fact returning to Mercedes to close the Civic Center and that he considered himself to be \u201con the clock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting a party\u2019s summary-judgment motion. <em>Whittaker v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>206 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of showing the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). If the moving party meets the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Rule 56(e). The nonmovant cannot satisfy his summary-judgment burden with conclusional allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or only a scintilla of evidence. <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Although in district court the parties and the court focused primarily on the issue whether Castellano was acting under color of state law at the time of the accident, they overlooked a threshold issue: whether the Villarreals had even alleged a tort of constitutional dimension against the City. <em>See McKinney v. Irving Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>309 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1194, 123 S.Ct. 1332, 154 L.Ed.2d 1030 (2003) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claimant must establish (1) a violation of rights secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States that (2) was committed by a person acting under color of state law). The substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u201cprotects individual liberty against \u2018certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. City of Harker Heights, Tex., </em>503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992) (citation omitted). It \u201cdoes not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 201, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). Generally, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe substantive component of the Due Process Clause is violated by executive action only when it \u2018can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 847, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (quoting <em>Collins, </em>503 U.S. at 128).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The claim set forth by the Villarreals does not rise to the level of a constitutional tort. It is \u201canalogous to a fairly typical state-law tort claim.\u201d <em>See Collins, </em>503 U.S. at 128. Although the Villarreals use the words \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to describe the City\u2019s policy, their specific assertions regarding the City\u2019s acts or omissions alleged a tort in the nature of negligence. <em>See id. </em>Even if this court were to apply the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the Villarreals\u2019 allegations\u2014that the City knew of Castellano\u2019s alcohol problems, his prior arrests for public intoxication, and his prior convictions of driving while intoxicated\u2014failed to establish that Jorge\u2019s death was a \u201cknown or obvious consequence\u201d of the City\u2019s treatment of Castellano. <em>See In re Foust, </em>310 F.3d 849, 861 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The Villarreals also continue to assert a claim against the City under the TTCA. The TTCA creates a limited waiver of sovereign immunity when a death is caused by negligence of a government employee acting \u201cwithin his scope of employment,\u201d if the death arises from the operation of a \u201cmotor-driven vehicle.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 101.021(1)(A) (Vernon 1997); <em>DeWitt v. Harris County, </em>904 S.W.2d 650, 654 (Tex.1995). An employee is generally not acting within his \u201cscope of employment\u201d when he is driving his or her own vehicle to or from his place of employment. <em>Terrell v. Sisk, </em>111 S.W.3d 274, 278 (Tex.App.2003). Under the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception, however, the governmental unit may be held liable when the employee has undertaken a \u201cspecific errand\u201d at the \u201cspecific request\u201d of the employer. <em>Wilie v. Signature Geophys. Servs., Inc., </em>65 S.W.3d 355, 359 (Tex.App.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Contrary to the Villarreals\u2019 contention, the district court did not refuse to consider Castellano\u2019s 2001 affidavit. The court ruled that, even if it considered the affidavit, the affidavit would not change its ruling that the Villarreals were not entitled to relief as to either their due process or TTCA claim. This unsubstantiated evidence, which contradicted other evidence in the record showing that Castellano was not considered to be working at the time he attempted to drive back to mercedes from Elsa, was not sufficient to show any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>thing more than that Castellano was driving to work. It did not demonstrate that Castellano was on a \u201cspecial mission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Because no summary-judgment evidence showed that Castellano had been directed by his employer to be anywhere near Elsa on the night of August 9, 1997, the Villarreals cannot establish that he was on a special mission. Accordingly, the City was not liable under the TTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
