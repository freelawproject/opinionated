During Ms sentencing hearing, McCollum raised for the first time an objection to the quantity of drugs attributed to him in the pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which the district court rejected. On appeal, McCollum argues that the district court: (1) abused its discretion by refusing to consider Ms objection regarding the drug quantity attributable to him; and (2) violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), by faffing to state in open court its reasons for imposing a 360-month sentence. Finding no reversible error, we affirm McCollum\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">In July 2000, the DEA took McCollum into custody in South Carolina and advised him of his rights after observing him attempt to sell one kilogram of crack cocaine to a DEA informant. In an effort to cooperate with the government, McCollum identified his drug supplier and agreed to assist in his apprehension by acting as an informant. Accordingly, the government provided McCollum with recording equipment and arranged a transaction with McCollum\u2019s supplier. A few weeks later, however, McCollum disappeared. In December 2000, the government indicted and charged McCollum with one count of possessing with the Mtent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">In April 2002, McCollum was arrested and shortly thereafter entered a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>plea on the possession charge. The probation officer prepared a PSR and later revised the same, incorporating two objections raised by McCollum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At his sentencing hearing, McCollum raised, for the first time, an objection to the quantity of drugs attributed to him in the PSR. The district court inquired into whether McCollum had received the PSR, and having been informed that he had, refused to consider McCollum\u2019s objection, stating that his objection \u201ccomes too late.\u201d The district court then determined that McCollum\u2019s total offense level was 35 and that the guideline sentencing range was 292-365 months of imprisonment. The district court sentenced McCollum to 360 months of imprisonment but did not provide an oral statement as to its reasons for imposing this sentence. The written criminal judgment, however, stated that McCollum\u2019s sentence \u201cconforms with the U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">McCollum timely filed this appeal arguing that: (1) the district court abused its discretion by refusing to consider his objection to the drug quantity attributed to him; and (2) the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) by fading to announce in open court its specific reasons for imposing a 360 month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision of whether to consider untimely objections to the PSR for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Morsley, </em>64 F.3d 907, 914 (4th Cir.1995). Our power to review sentences is limited <em>to </em>instances in which a sentence is imposed in violation of the law or imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 n. 4 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Greer, </em>285 F.3d 158, 177 (2d Cir.2002). McCollum argues that we have the power to review his sentence because it was imposed in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). Because McCollum failed to raise this issue at sentencing, we review his claim for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">It is solely within the discretion of the district court to consider untimely challenges to the PSR. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(D). Indeed, the district court \u201cmay, for good cause, allow a party to make a new objection....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court heard McCollum\u2019s objection to the drug quantity attributed to him in the PSR, J.A. 78, and inquired into whether the probation officer had furnished McCollum and his lawyer with a copy of the PSR, which contained information related to the drug quantity attributed to McCollum. <em>Id. </em>at 79. Once the district court determined that McCollum and his lawyer had received a copy of the PSR and therefore notice of the drug quantity, it refused to consider the newly raised objection. <em>Id. </em>We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying this objection. Contrary to McCollum\u2019s assertions, the district court provided McCollum the opportunity to proffer a reason as to why his objection to the drug quantity contained in the PSR should be considered. Having concluded that McCollum failed to proffer \u201cgood cause\u201d as to its untimeliness, the district court properly refused to consider McCollum\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Both parties agree that the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) by failing to state in open court its reasons for imposing a 360 month sentence on McCollum. As previously noted, this Court\u2019s ability to review sentences is limited to instances in which a sentence is \u201cimposed in violation of law\u201d or \u201cas a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1-2). This Court has never directly addressed whether a sentence imposed in violation of \u00a7 3553(c)(1) is reviewable as a sentence \u201cimposed in violation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we need not resolve this issue today. Because McCollum failed to request an explanation or object to the sentence imposed during the sentencing proceedings, this Court may review the error under the plain error test. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). That is, McCollum\u2019s sentence may be reversed only if the error is plain and affects his substantial rights. Even if McCollum overcomes this hurdle, the decision to correct the error remains in the \u201csound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Here, the district court relied upon the PSR for its determination of the sentencing guideline range\u2014292 to 365 months\u2014 applicable to McCollum. McCollum did not object to the guideline range and the district court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment within that range, 360 months. Thus, although the district court erred by failing to state, in open court, its reasons for this sentence, we conclude that the error does not seriously affect the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings. We therefore find that the district court did not commit plain error warranting reversal of McCollum\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">For the above-mentioned reasons, we find no reversible error. We therefore affirm McCollum\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\">. First, McCollum objected to a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice related to his fleeing to New York in 2002. The district court granted this objection. Second, McCollum objected to the PSR\u2019s characterization of his two prior drug convictions as two separate incidents. The district court denied this objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-15\">. In any event, the district court\u2019s finding with respect to the quantity of drugs attributable to McCollum is not clearly erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The PSR attributed 1,002 grams of cocaine base and 319.5 kilograms of powder to McCollum for purposes of sentencing. The probation officer derived this drug quantity from statements McCollum made when he was cooperating with the DEA in July 2000 and from a letter provided by McCollum's lawyer in which McCollum admitted that he transported 1 kilogram of cocaine base in July 2000. <em>See </em>J.A. 95 (detailing account of McCollum\u2019s July 2000 drug sale transaction). These statements are sufficient to support the district court\u2019s findings on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b856-22\">. In <em>United States v.
