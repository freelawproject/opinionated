Based on Onwuegbuzie\u2019s use of a false document to obtain a visa, the IJ denied Onwuegbuzie\u2019s applications for asylum and for a waiver of deportability. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). Because the BIA used the streamlined review process, we review the IJ\u2019s decision and not that of the BIA. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Onwuegbuzie first contends that the BIA should not have subjected his case to streamlined review because his case did not meet the statutory requirements for it. Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii), such review of an IJ\u2019s decision is proper if the single BIA member to whom the case is assigned</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-9\">determines that the result reached in the decision was correct; that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial; and that (A) the issue on appeal is squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and does not involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation; or (B) the factual and legal questions raised on appeal are so insubstantial that three-Member review is not warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Onwuegbuzie further contends that our standard of review on this issue is <em>de novo </em>because the BIA\u2019s determination that streamlined review is proper is a question of law. Although Onwuegbuzie is correct that the standard of review is <em>de novo, </em>we must give deference to the BIA in making its determination. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>see also CarbajalGonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Therefore, we should ask \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute\u201d and if so, we must defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>I.N.S. v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999). Moreover, when the question of law involves internal procedures of the agency, reviewing courts are generally not free to impose procedures if the agency has chosen not to grant them. <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 524, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">Onwuegbuzie has not met his burden to show that the BIA\u2019s decision is based on an impermissible construction of the statute. Onwuegbuzie\u2019s contention is that the IJ\u2019s decision was not \u201ccorrect\u201d as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7), essentially because he disagrees with the IJ\u2019s factual determinations. Because we give deference to the BIA member\u2019s determination that the IJ\u2019s decision was correct, we decline to hold that this decision was based on an impermissible construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">Onwuegbuzie further contends that the streamlined review process violated his due process rights. This claim is foreclosed by our court\u2019s recent holding that this review procedure does not violate due process. <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 832-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">Onwuegbuzie next asserts that the IJ applied an erroneous standard to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>his application for a waiver of deportability. We need not analyze this issue because, under the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), our review of the waiver decision is foreclosed. Under the IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, courts may not review the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decisions over whether to suspend deportation. IIRIRA \u00a7 309(a), \u00a7 309(c)(4), 110 Stat 3009 (30 Sept., 1996); <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002). The transitional rules apply because the proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, and concluded more than 30 days after the IIRIRA\u2019s passage on September 30, 1996. IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E); <em>Omagah, </em>288 F.3d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Onwuegbuzie next asserts that the IJ erred in denying asylum based on the IJ\u2019s finding that Onwuegbuzie did not demonstrate persecution, or a well-founded fear or future persecution, in Nigeria. This court will uphold the factual finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum if it is supported by substantial evidence, which requires only that the decision be based on the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that, although Onwuegbuzie suffered some episodes of mistreatment, the mistreatment did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). With respect to future persecution, there is also substantial evidence in the record that the situation in Nigeria has improved and that Onwuegbuzie does not have a well-founded fear of such persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
