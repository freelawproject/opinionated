Minix consented to have a magistrate judge (\u201cMJ\u201d) decide his complaint. After conducting a <em>Spears</em><footnotemark>**</footnotemark> hearing, the MJ screened Minix\u2019s complaint and dismissed the complaint as frivolous, citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). Minix now appeals that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A review of the record reveals that Mi-nix was seen promptly and frequently by the staff of the Gurney Unit infirmary for his complaints of chest pain and hypertension and was treated conservatively with aspirin therapy. The infirmary staff conducted an EKG test, which suggested a minor abnormality, and also prescribed Zantac for Minix\u2019s gastro-esophageal reflux disorder. Because Minix has not shown that the Gurney Unit infirmary staff refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, or intentionally treated him incorrectly, he has not shown that the MJ abused her discretion in dismissing his complaint as frivolous. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 506 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Minix seeks to have this court order that he be transferred to a medical facility whose infirmary is open 24 hours a day. The remedy sought by Minix is in the nature of mandamus relief, which is not available to federal courts to direct state officials in the performance of their duties and functions. <em>See, e.g., Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1275-76 (5th Cir.1973); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Minix\u2019s complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b) counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Minix is warned that if he accumulates two more strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">AFFIRMED; REQUEST FOR MANDAMUS RELIEF DENIED; SANCTION-WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. B 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th <em>Cir.</em>1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
