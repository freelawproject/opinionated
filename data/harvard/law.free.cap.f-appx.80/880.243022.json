An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">We conclude that we cannot determine on the present record whether Harvey filed his \u00a7 2255 motion within one year of the date on which the facts underlying his \u00a7 2255 motion could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence. Accordingly, we remand to the district court for further factual findings to determine if Harvey instructed his counsel to file a notice of appeal and, if so, when he could have discovered counsel\u2019s failure to follow such instructions through the exercise of due diligence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
