Tamez moves to supplement the record on appeal; his motion to supplement is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-26\">Tamez\u2019s contentions arise from his allegedly erroneous classification as a member of the Mexican Mafia prison gang. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>alleges that his erroneous classification led to his confinement in administrative segregation; his exclusion from the GRAD program for former gang members; and denial of legal visits with other prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Tamez had no due process right to the removal of false information in his prison record. <em>Velasquez v. </em>Woods, 329 F.3d 420, 421-22 (5th Cir.2003). He had no liberty interest that was violated by his placement in administrative segregation. <em>Pichardo v. Kinker, </em>73 F.3d 612, 613 (5th Cir.1996). To the extent that classification as a gang member may have deprived Tamez of the ability to advance in good-time earning capability, that did not give rise to a constitutional claim. <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 957, 959 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Tamez\u2019s exclusion from the GRAD program did not inevitably affect the duration of his sentence and therefore did not infringe on Tamez\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Tamez\u2019s contention that GRAD participants are required to waive their privilege against self-incrimination is not ripe for judicial review. <em>See Monk v. Huston, </em>340 F.3d 279, 282 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Tamez had no right to legal assistance by other prisoners. <em>Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 43 (5th Cir.1996). We need not address Tamez\u2019s allegation that a pleading in another case was delayed due to the denial of legal visits, as Tamez did not make that allegation in the district court. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Tamez\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The appeal therefore should be dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the current case and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal count as two strikes against Tamez for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Tamez previously had an action dismissed as frivolous. <em>Tamez v. Zeller, </em>No. H-98-1069 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 17, 2000 &amp; Jan. 25, 2000). Tamez has attained three-strike status. He may not proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in any civil action or appeal unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT DENIED. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
