Dunlap is proceeding pro se and raises four issues on appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-28\">First, Dunlap has failed to show that his indictment was constructively amended in violation of the Fifth Amendment. <em>United States v. Floresca, </em>38 F.3d 706, 710 (4th Cir.1994). To the extent that Dunlap now objects to evidence of the \u201cTonda Mesa\u201d account being admitted at trial, we do not find that the district court plainly erred in allowing its admission. Fed.R.Crim.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Second, Dunlap alleges certain anomalies regarding the grand jury proceedings. Our review of the record does not disclose any prejudice to Dunlap. <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 250, 256-57, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988). Neither does our review show constitutional error or prosecutorial misconduct. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>995 F.2d 480, 486 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Next, we do not find that the district court clearly abused its discretion by denying Dunlap\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>757 F.2d 1486, 1491 (4th Cir.1985). Finally, we find that Dunlap failed to establish grounds for the district judge to recuse himself from conducting the trial. <em>Shaw v. Martin, </em>733 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1984). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Dunlap\u2019s motion to recuse. <em>United States v. DeTemple, </em>162 F.3d 279, 283 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Dunlap\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
