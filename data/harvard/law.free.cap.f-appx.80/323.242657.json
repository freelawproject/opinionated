Seifu contends that she will be subjected to persecution on the basis of her gender and that relief is warranted by her prior subjection to female genital mutilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">The record does not contain significant evidence which would compel a finding that \u201ca reasonable person in [Seifu\u2019s] circumstances would fear persecution.\u201d <em>See Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). As a married woman whose husband has been deported and who has already been subjected to female genital mutilation, the danger to Seifu of marital rape, wife-beating, female genital mutilation, and abduction as a form of marriage is attenuated. Further, the act of female genital mutilation is unfortunately the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>fundamental change required to rebut the presumption of persecution created by the showing of past persecution. Though the threat of employment discrimination and general gender-based persecution may remain real, the decision to deny asylum is not substantially unreasonable. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
