Brown argues that his due process rights were violated by the district court\u2019s consideration of testimony at sentencing that concerned matters not included in the presentence report. Brown further contends that the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination was based upon unreliable and insufficient evidence. Brown additionally maintains that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history category and by denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Brown\u2019s due process argument is without merit; criminal defendants do not have a due process right to be notified in advance of the Government\u2019s witnesses at sentencing or the substance of their testimony. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>225 F.3d 637, 644 (6th Cir.2000). Although the drug quantity determination was based in part on the statement of a witness who repudiated that statement at sentencing, it was the district court\u2019s province to evaluate the conflicting statements made by the witness and make a credibility determination. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 83-85 (5th Cir.1996). Thus, the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination was not clearly erroneous or based on unreliable evidence. <em>See id. </em>We dismiss the remainder of Brown\u2019s appeal because Brown waived his right to appeal these issues in his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
