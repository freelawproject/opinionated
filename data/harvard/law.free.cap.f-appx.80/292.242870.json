Gadson\u2019s attorney has filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising sufficiency of the evidence but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal. Gadson filed a pro se supplemental brief raising several additional issues. The United States declined to file a brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to each count of conviction. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and assuming that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the Government, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support each conviction. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 857 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (defining the test for conspiracy); <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002) (outlining the test for \u00a7 924(c)); <em>United States v. Bengali </em>11 F.3d 1207, 1211 (4th Cir.1993) (stating the test for the Hobbs Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Gadson argues that his life sentence for conspiracy is unconstitutional because he is not a career offender. However, after careful review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly sentenced Gadson as a career offender. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). We have reviewed the remainder of the claims in Gadson\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and concluded that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Gadson\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
