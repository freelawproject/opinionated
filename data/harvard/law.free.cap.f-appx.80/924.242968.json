GARZA, Circuit Judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">In this appeal we review Defendant\u2014Appellant, Roberto Uribe-Garcia\u2019s (hereinafter, \u201cUribe\u201d) conviction and sentence for illegal reentry into the United States following deportation. For the following reasons, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">Uribe was charged pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b) with illegal reentry into the United States following deportation. The United States filed a notice of sentencing enhancement based on Uribe\u2019s prior state-court conviction for assault with the intent to inflict serious injury. Uribe pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">Uribe\u2019s PSR calculated a total offense level of 21, which included a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) due to Uribe\u2019s previous deportation subsequent to his state-court conviction for assault. The PSR characterized this conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Uribe\u2019s offense score, along with his criminal history category of I, resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 37 to 46 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">Uribe objected to the 16-level increase, arguing that his prior state-court assault conviction did not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it was not specifically included in the enumerated list of offenses constituting \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under the sentencing guideline\u2019s definition of that term. Uribe also argues that his state-court assault conviction was designated as an aggravated misdemeanor under state law, and that he should receive only an 8-level increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(c). The district court overruled Uribe\u2019s objection and sentenced him to 37 months imprisonment. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-19\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-20\">CRIME OF VIOLENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b953-21\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>301 F.3d 309, 312-313 (5th Cir.2002). In our analysis, the commentary to the guidelines is given controlling weight if it is not erroneous or inconsistent with the guidelines themselves. <em>Id. </em>at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) requires a 16-level increase to the base offense level if the defendant has been previously deported after a conviction for a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Aggravated felonies that do not qualify as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d merit only an 8-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(c). The commentary defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense (I) that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>physical force against the person of another and (II) includes murder, manslaughter, kidnaping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 1(B)(ii)(I) and (II)).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Uribe contends that because subsections (I) and (II) are joined by the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d both conditions must be satisfied for an offense to qualify for a 16-level enhancement. Because his state-court conviction for assault with the intent to inflict serious injury is not specifically listed under subsection (II), Uribe argues that it does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">However, Uribe acknowledges that his state-court conviction was for an assault that constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines because the term of incarceration was for more than one year. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). In addition, the nature of Uribe\u2019s state-court offense was an aggravated assault, which satisfies both subsections (I) and (II) of the guideline\u2019s definition of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>319 F.3d 194, 196 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>323 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court was correct in applying a 16-level increase to Uribe\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-14\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
