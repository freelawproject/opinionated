We find that the district court properly denied Tisdale\u2019s motions to suppress her confession. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">We review de novo whether a confession was voluntary, \u201caccepting \u2018the district court\u2019s findings of fact on the circumstances surrounding the confession ... unless [those findings are] clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Braxton, </em>112 F.3d 777, 781 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Pelton, </em>835 F.2d 1067, 1072 (4th Cir.1987)). In making our ultimate determination of voluntariness, we look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession. The critical issue is \u201cwhether [the] defendant\u2019s will has been overborne or [her] capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">The district court did not err in concluding that Tisdale\u2019s statement was voluntary. The record confirms that the customs agents made no promises or threats to Tisdale and that Tisdale had been questioned for approximately a half-hour when she confessed. The district court\u2019s finding that Tisdale was not heavily medicated at the time of the interview was supported by testimony in the record and was not clearly erroneous. At most, the circumstances of the interview amounted to intimidation, which is insufficient to find that the agents coerced Tisdale to the point that her will was overborne. Accordingly, accepting the district court\u2019s factual conclusions as true and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, Tisdale\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">The district court also did not err when it denied Tisdale\u2019s renewed motion to suppress. The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that agent Dixon\u2019s statement was not an implied promise that rendered Tisdale\u2019s admission involuntary. A law enforcement officer\u2019s admonition to a suspect during an investigatory interview to tell the truth or face consequences is not an implied promise of non-prosecution. <em>Braxton, </em>112 F.3d at 782. Because agent Dixon\u2019s statement was an accurate representation of Tisdale\u2019s predicament, it was not sufficiently coercive to render Tisdale\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>statement involuntary. <em>Pelton, </em>835 F.2d at 1073. Our review of the record convinces us that the setting of the interview in the agents\u2019 vehicle was not unduly coercive. Accordingly, under the totality of the circumstances test, Tisdale\u2019s will was not so overborne or her ability to make her own decisions so critically impaired that her confession was rendered involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">For these reasons we affirm Tisdale\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
