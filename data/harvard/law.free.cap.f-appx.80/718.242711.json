Reviewing the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">First, Regan\u2019s MSPA claim is barred by <em>res judicata </em>because it is part of the same cause of action as the claims in his previous lawsuit, and could have been brought as part of that suit. <em>Res judicata </em>bars claims that were or could have been raised against the same defendants in a prior action that reached a final judgment on the merits. <em>L-Tec Elecs. Corp. v. Cougar Elec. Org., Inc., </em>198 F.3d 85, 87-88 (2d Cir.1999). Under New York\u2019s \u201ctransactional approach\u201d to determining whether claims are part of the same cause of action for <em>res judicata </em>purposes, \u201conce a claim is brought to a final conclusion, all other claims arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions are barred, even if based upon different theories or if seeking a different remedy.\u201d <em>Yoon v. Fordham Univ. Faculty and Admin. Ret. Plan, </em>263 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>O\u2019Brien v. City of Syracuse, </em>54 N.Y.2d 353, 357, 445 N.Y.S.2d 687, 429 N.E.2d 1158 (1981)). Whether two claims arise out of the same transaction is determined \u201cpragmatically,\u201d by examining whether the claims arise \u201cout of the same act ... alleged to be wrongful,\u201d seek the \u201csame basic relief,\u201d and are so related as to be conveniently tried together. <em>Reilly v. Reid, </em>45 N.Y.2d 24, 29-31, 407 N.YS.2d 645, 379 N.E.2d 172 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Here, all of Regan\u2019s claims arise from the same series of transactions. His state court claims arose out of the defendants\u2019 failure to pay for the portion of his August and September 1997 medical expenses that would have been covered by Medicare had he enrolled in it earlier. Regan argued that defendants improperly failed to notify him of the requirement that he promptly enroll in Medicare as his primary health care payer, and that their failure to cover the entirety of his medical expenses after the termination of his state employment violated the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act amendments to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Public Health Services Act (COBRA). The instant lawsuit is based on the same refusal of coverage; here, Regan asserts that the same defendants violated the MSPA by refusing to cover the Medicare-eligible portion of his expenses, because he was a \u201cvestee\u201d who maintained current employment status despite having left state service. Though Regan may characterize or emphasize the operative facts differently in the two lawsuits, all of the facts pleaded here were present at the time of his first lawsuit. <em>See Waldman v. Village of Kiryas Joel, </em>207 F.3d 105, 110-11 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201c[P]laintiff cannot avoid the effects of res judicata by \u2018splitting\u2019 his claim into various suits, based on different legal theories (with different evidence \u2018necessary' to each suit).\u201d). Thus, Regan\u2019s two lawsuits are based on the same transaction even though they involve differing legal theories, and his MSPA claim is barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Second, while Regan correctly points out that <em>res judicata </em>will not apply when a plaintiff faces formal barriers to litigating a claim in a previous action, <em>Davidson v. Capuano, </em>792 F.2d 275, 278 (2d Cir.1986), no such barriers existed in this case. Relying on the fact that the remedies available under COBRA are limited to \u201cappropriate equitable relief,\u201d <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300bb-7 (2000), Regan argues that federal law prevented him from asserting any claims for damages (i.e., the MSPA claim) in his initial lawsuit, and that the contradictory factual assertions required by the COBRA and MSPA claims made them mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Both of these arguments are unavailing. Nothing suggests that COBRA\u2019s equitable relief provision limits the remedies available for claims brought under other statutes as part of the same litigation, whether in federal or state court. Although Regan\u2019s remedies under COBRA were limited to equitable relief, he was free to pursue other remedies for his other claims, and he has not cited any COBRA provision or New York procedural rule that prevented him from simultaneously seeking equitable relief under COBRA and monetary relief for his other claims. New York law expressly permits alternative pleading of both claims and remedies, <em>see Two Queens, Inc. v. Scoza, </em>296 A.D.2d 302, 745 N.Y.S.2d 517, 519 (1st Dep\u2019t 2002) (noting pleading in the alternative is permitted under New York C.P.L.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3014 and 3017), so Regan would have been free to assert both his MSPA and COBRA claims and requests for relief in his state court action, regardless of the contradictory factual assertions required, and the different relief available, for each claim. We therefore reject Regan\u2019s argument that he could not have brought his MSPA claim in the same action as his COBRA claim. <em>See Kiryas Joel, </em>207 F.3d at 112 n. 4 (\u201c[Procedural impossibility ... is generally viewed as the necessary predicate for making an exception to res judicata.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Third, Regan\u2019s previous state lawsuit does not fall under the declaratory judgment exception to <em>res judicata. </em>When a prior action \u201cinvolved only a request for declaratory relief\" rather than coercive relief, \u201cthe preclusive effect of the declaratory judgment is limited to the subject matter of the declaratory relief sought,\u201d permitting a plaintiff to \u201cpursue further declaratory or coercive relief\u2019 in the future. <em>Harborside Refrigerated Servs., Inc. v. Vogel, </em>959 F.2d 368, 372 (2d Cir.1992). In his state lawsuit, however, Regan explicitly sought monetary damages, requesting \u201c[a]n Order directing defendants ... to pay in full, with interest\u201d his unpaid medical expenses as a remedy for several of his claims. State Compl. at 27. In addition to damages, Regan also sought a variety of coercive relief in his state lawsuit, including an injunction re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>quiring the defendants to alter their health plan and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Having pursued these broad objectives, Regan cannot now argue that his state lawsuit sought only declaratory relief in order to take advantage of the narrow exception to <em>res judicata </em>that allows litigants to prospectively \u201cclarify the legal relationships of parties before they have been disturbed thereby tending towards avoidance of full-blown litigation.\u201d <em>Harborside Refrigerated Servs., </em>959 F.2d at 373; <em>cf. Minneapolis Auto Parts Co. v. City of Minneapolis, </em>739 F.2d 408, 410 (8th Cir.1984) (finding declaratory judgment exception inapplicable where plaintiff \u201csought more than declaratory relief in the original state court suit\u201d by pursuing coercive measures, such as injunctions and other equitable relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Finally, we reject Regan\u2019s claim that he was not afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claims in the original lawsuit because the trial court refused his request to re-open discovery. The trial court provided plaintiff with a lengthy opportunity for discovery and entertained extensive written argument before determining that it would not reopen discovery. Moreover, the additional discovery Regan requested concerning defendants\u2019 contractual authority to require retirees to enroll in Medicare as their primary health care payer would not have affected his ability to make the claim that in doing so defendants violated the MSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
