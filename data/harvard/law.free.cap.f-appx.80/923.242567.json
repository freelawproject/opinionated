A COA was granted on the issue whether the district court erred in holding that this court addressed and rejected his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in granting counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em><footnotemark>**</footnotemark> motion, thereby procedurally barring him from raising the claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Our opinion granting counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismissing the direct criminal appeal included the sentence, \u201cCarter has filed a response asserting that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and that counsel was ineffective.\u201d Not unreasonably, the district court construed the opinion to mean that this court had considered the merits of Carter\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">This court\u2019s reference to Carter\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, however, meant only that Carter had made the claims, not that we considered them on the merits, which would have been a departure from our normal practice. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>55 F.3d 173 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the district court erred in holding that this court did address the merits of Carter\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Accordingly, with regard to the disposition of the ineffectiveness claims, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Carter\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is vacated. The case is remanded to the district court for further consideration of Carter\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
