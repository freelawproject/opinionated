In addition, he appeals the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to remand for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Huamani-Diaz contends that the Board erred in concluding, as did the immigration judge, that he was not entitled to a hardship waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4) (2000), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1216.5 (2003). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (2000), we lack jurisdiction to review this decision committed to the discretion of the Attorney General. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that, without the hardship waiver, Huamani-Diaz\u2019s conditional permanent resident status was properly terminated and he was subject to removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Huamani-Diaz also challenges the Board\u2019s denial of his motion for remand to consider his application for adjustment of status. We review a decision by the Board to deny a motion to remand or reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003). Huamani-Diaz bore the burden of establishing a prima facie case for entitlement to the relief sought. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Because his record showed he had entered into a marriage determined by the Attorney General to be for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, he did not show his eligibility for adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c) (2000). Therefore, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
