A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ACh\">The Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation determined that petitioner was permanently disabled to the extent of 20% of total as the result of a fall at her place of employment and awarded her compensation therefor, besides ordering the payment of hospital and medical bills, as well as medical and legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">On respondent\u2019s appeal, the County Court affirmed the award and also allowed petitioner interest at 6% from the date of the Division\u2019s judgment on each week\u2019s award to the date of entry of judgment in the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">On this further appeal by respondent from the judgment of the County Court, respondent argues that (1) the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>tioner failed to sustain her burden of proof; and (2) the County Court erred in allowing interest dating back to the time of the award in the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The employment relationship, the happening of the accident, due notice thereof to the employer, 'the nature of petitioner\u2019s permanent disability, and the timeliness of her claim petition are not in issue. Hor do the parties argue the correctness of the percentage of disability found by the Division, though petitioner\u2019s neurologists gave appraisals of 60% and 25%, as against a figure of 15% of total testified to by respondent\u2019s expert. The primary basic dispute is whether there exists a causal connection between petitioner\u2019s accident and her disabling condition of multiple sclerosis. Her medical experts swore that there is such a causal relationship and respondent\u2019s expert testified to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Guided by <em>Russo v. United States Trucking Corp., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>430 (1958), and <em>Ricciardi v. Marcalus Mfg. Co., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>445 (1958), we have made our own independent study of the evidence, giving \u201cdue regard to the opportunity of the hearer of the evidence to judge of the credibility of the witnesses\u201d and \u201cfull and respectful consideration of the views expressed on both fact and law\u201d by the Division and by the County Court. We note that both tribunals concurred in finding causal relationship and that the deputy director made special mention of the fact that he was impressed by the honesty of petitioner\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Respondent concedes that petitioner sustained a compensable accident on July 30, 1957, when she slipped and fell on the-floor of the office lobby, where she was employed as a switchboard operator and receptionist. She was then 42 years old and had been in the employ of respondent and its predecessor for about nine years prior to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s accident was a simple one. As she described it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">\u201cI closed up the board at five o\u2019clock and started to walk towards the front door to go\u2014well\u2014in fact, I was going to the ladies\u2019 room first, and I stood for a few minutes talking to one of the girls that was sitting there, and then continued on inside, and then came out to go out the front door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">When I came out, I slipped, I fell down. I turned on my arm and hit the side of my head.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">She attributed her fall to the slippery, waxed door. She explained that she struck the left side of her head, got up and was holding her hand, which started to swell up aud hurt her, when the office manager, who was coming down the stairs at the time, came over to her. She stood there a few minutes and then continued on to get a bus over at the comer.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">She testified further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201c* * * when I got on the bus I felt kind of funny. * * * I felt dizzy and started to get pain in the side of my face. * \u2022 * Loft side. * * * and by the time I got home it was all numb to the center of my lip and it was paining me, and the back of my head, and I called Dr. Forte who is my family physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Dr. Forte saw her at her home on the day of the accident, was informed that she fell at her place of work, and found objectively, in examining her, \"swelling, ecchymosis left side of face aud lip, left arm and leg with tenderness.\u201d He treated her symptomatically, \"pnt her on analgesics, diathermy to the arm and leg a,nd then * * * gave her \u2018Vitamin B12 injections for her numbness she was complaining of in the face.\u201d Dr. Forte treated her further on July 30 and July 31, 1957 at her home and thereafter on August 5, 9, 12, 15, 22 and 29, 1957 at his office. While he had not discharged her as cured, she did not return to his office until January 2, 1958, at which time she still had discomfort, pain and numbness on the left side of her face. On the last-mentioned date, he examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>her superficially, made a diagnosis of \u201ccerebral concussion, contusion of the left side of the face, head, face and left arm and leg.\u201d He found no neurological signs at that time. He prescribed the same medicine, told her to come back, but that was her last visit to Dr. Eorte.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">On cross-examination, Dr. Eorte testified that, at her January 1958 visit to his office, petitioner complained of \u201cswaying\u201d and that he told her it could be the result of her injury, her concussion. He did not regard the swaying as a neurological sign and \u201cdidn\u2019t pay any attention to that.\u201d Dr. Eorte had treated Mrs. Cohrs for four or five years prior to her accident, from eight to twelve times a year for \u201cbronchitis, asthma, pleurisy, influenza, colds and menopausal syndrome,\u201d but she never complained before the accident of any dizziness, loss of balance, loss of sense of balance, or anything in that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Petitioner testified that the swaying and loss of balance first manifested themselves about two months after the accident and that she never had these symptoms prior thereto. She seems to have worked regularly before her mishap and engaged in bowling \u201cmaybe once a week witu the girls.\u201d On cross-examination, she denied making any statements to her doctors that her dizziness and instability in walking had appeared prior to her 1957 accident. She particularly denied having told Dr. Furst or any other doctor who examined her in July or August 1958, or anyone else at East Orange General Hospital when she was there in 1958, that she had noticed dizziness and difficulty in her walking for \u201ctwo years\u201d prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Because she wasn\u2019t getting better under Dr. Forte\u2019s care and \u201ckept going to the side\u201d when walking, she consulted another physician, Dr. Becker, on June 2, 1958. He verified that she gave him a history of her accident and that on her third visit she told him that \u201cshe had this falling over to the left side or pulling over to the left side ever since September, 1957.\u201d He gave her a Romberg test and finding positive neurological signs recommended her to Dr. Eurst, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>a neurologist. Dr. Eurst saw her for the first time on July 10, 1958 and found that she was ataxic. He advised a more intensive study in an intramural hospital setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Petitioner entered East Orange General Hospital on August 3, 1958 and remained until August 22, 1958, during which time there were tests and treatment. There she was observed not only by Dr. Becker and Dr. Eurst, but also by Dr. Medinets, a neuro-surgeon, and a Dr. Eoh. Dr. Becker diagnosed her condition as a cerebral encephalopathy, causing the disturbance of balance. The neurologists, including Dr. Flicker, respondent\u2019s expert, who subsequently examined her and the hospital records, described the condition as a demyelinizing process or multiple sclerosis, permanent in nature but with periods of exacerbation and remission, and disposed toward becoming progressively worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On the assumptions of an absence of the symptoms prior to the accident and their manifestation approximately two months after her fall, petitioner\u2019s treating physician and treating neurologists stated as their opinion that there was a causal relationship between the accident and the condition of multiple sclerosis. Dr. Eurst concluded, on the basis of the foregoing assumptions that \u201cthe injury had something to do with the precipitation of the neurological picture.\u201d He testified that multiple sclerosis can occur from a virus infection or from an allergic response or a deficiency disease \u201cor it may occur from trauma.\u201d Pre-existing viral infections, germ allergies and deficiency diseases, according to Dr. Eurst, might have \u201csensitized the individual\u2019s nervous system to the other factor, namely, trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">On cross-examination, Dr. Eurst admitted that if the onset of the symptoms antedated the accident his opinion of causal relationship would change. In view of that material concession, and the fact that Dr. Medinets first found no causal relationship on the basis of the hospital record which indicated the existence of the symptoms prior to her fall, respondent then adduced the following items of evidence to prove that petitioner\u2019s symptoms of multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>sclerosis had their onset prior to July 30, 1957, the date of her accident. <em>First, </em>Dr. Eurst testified that he took a personal history from petitioner on his initial examination of her on July 10, 1958 and he then recorded that she told him that she had the symptoms \u201cfor the past two years.\u201d <em>Second,, </em>the history recorded by Dr. Roh in the hospital record on consultation on August 5, 1958 notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">\u201cInsidious and gradual onset beginning 2 years ago\u2014becoming increasingly severe the past 6-8 weeks * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><em>Third, </em>on July 11, 1958 Dr. Eurst wrote to Dr. BeckeT stating that he had examined petitioner the previous day and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201c* * * she gave me a 2-year history of dizziness, unsteadiness, not feeling right, inability to see well, falling against doors, and in general has been experiencing a physical decline * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\"><em>Fourth, </em>the admitting, nurse made the following entry on August 3, 1958 in petitioner\u2019s hospital record on hex admission to the hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\u201cAdmitted female to room 420 via wheelchair. Complained of pain in left arm. Has noticeable limp of left side of body. States \u2018My equilibrium is off on my left side. I\u2019ve had this for a couple of years.\u2019 <em>\"\u25a0</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">These items of evidence created a sharp and vital conflict in the proofs as to when petitioner\u2019s symptoms of unsteadiness in gait and dizziness had first manifested themselves. Opposed thereto were her sworn testimony before the Division and that of Dr. Eorte and Dr. Becker, as noted above, tending to prove that the symptoms appeared two months after her fall. Since the opinions of her medical experts hinged on the absence of the symptoms before the fall and their first appearance about two months thereafter, resolution of this factual conflict became of prime importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Both the Division and the County Court recognized and weighed the conflict in proofs and resolved it in favor of the petitioner. The deputy director, who was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, took pains to record in his findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cThe petitioner impressed me by the honesty of her testimony. I found no occasion to suspect that she was not forthright and honest in her testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The deputy director concluded that the history notations ox Dr. Burst and Dr. Eoh were outweighed by her testimony to the contrary and the supporting testimony of Dr. Porte, who had treated her over a period of four or five years before her accident, to whom she never complained of any such symptoms and who never observed them during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The County Court disposed of the adverse notations in the medical entries and the hospital record in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201cReference is made to statements the petitioner is alleged to have made in July and August of 1958 to the effect that certain symptoms had manifested themselves, in the past \u2018couple of years.\u2019 These statements are so inexact as to have little probative value. Further, having been made twelve and thirteen months after the accident they appear to have been nothing more than offhand estimations of the duration of the symptoms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">It was only in the hospital entry by the admitting nurse that reference was made to \u201ca couple of years.\u201d We agree that that entry, standing alone, would have little probative value for lack of exactness. But we cannot brush it aside lightly when we find it illuminated by the more specific reference to an \u201conset beginning about 2 years ago,\u201d entered by Dr. Boh in the hospital record, and Dr. Burst\u2019s testimony and letter of July 11, 1958 in which lie noted, \u201cShe gave me a two year history of dizziness, unsteadiness, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Besolution of this grave factual question has not been free from doubt. Opposing inferences contend for recognition. When plaintiff consulted her several doctors for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>purposes of treatment and cure, there is a fair inference that she gave them a true history of her symptoms and the doctors made correct entries thereof in their records. The inference is especially compelling when we consider that all of these medical examinations were made before Mrs. Cohrs had any litigation pending. Her claim petition for compensation was filed on November 12, 1958, several months later. Yet, the history first given by petitioner to her personal physician of long standing, Dr. Eorte, about five months after the accident, and then to her next treating physician, Dr. Becker, that her swaying or movement to the left side as she walked commenced two months after her accident, is at variance with the history recorded by her later physicians, Dr. Eurst and Dr. Roh, if we accept their notations of \u201ctwo years\u201d literally, which they made in July and August 1958, because the latter would have related the symptoms back to 1956, prior to the accident. Hence, we are required, as was the Division and the County Court, to resolve this apparent conflict in her medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">There is also the assumption that the petitioner\u2019s sworn testimony was true, that she did not perjure herself. To this must be added the express affirmation of the deputy director in his findings that she was \u201chonest\u201d and \u201cforthright\u201d in her testimony. The admitting nurse\u2019s entry, referring to \u201ca couple of years,\u201d was lacking in definiteness and was based upon information probably obtained under strained circumstances from a sick, and perhaps somewhat distraught, woman at a time when she was being admitted to the hospital and brought to her room therein \u201cvia wheelchair.\u201d The nurse was not called as a witness, reliance being placed on the hospital record itself. We find this entry by the nurse to be inconclusive. Dr. Roh also was not called as a witness and the source of the information, upon which his entry was predicated, was not explored. He may have obtained it from the petitioner or by hearsay from others. There is no reason to doubt that Dr. Eurst made a true entry in his record, as he understood the situation to be from his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>versation with Mrs. Cohrs. However, we must recognize the possibility of a margin for error in the substance of that entry. If her unsteadiness had commenced about September 195?, as she testified and as she had already told two treating physicians before Dr. Eurst examined her in July 1958, her difficulty in walking had embraced parts of two calendar years, 195? and 1958. Her language in describing the time factor to Dr. Eurst may have lacked precision, or her memory, dimmed by the lapse of time and her suffering, may have induced a mistaken or erroneous statement. It is significant that Dr. Eurst\u2019s record does not specifically relate her report of the first manifestations of the symptoms as being prior or subsequent to her fall. We do not feel that more credence should be given to the entries made by Dr. Eurst, Dr. Eoh and the admitting nurse than to petitioner\u2019s statements under oath at the trial, supported as they were by the testimony of her earlier treating physicians, Dr. Porte and Dr. Becker. While the matter is not free from doubt, as noted above, the preponderance of probabilities induces us to resolve the issue in favor of the petitioner for the reasons expressed by the deputy director and his <em>imprimatur </em>as to \u201cthe honesty of her testimony,\u201d and our own analysis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Dr. Elicker, neurologist engaged by respondent to examine petitioner and to testify as to her condition, expressed the opinion that there was no causal connection between her fall and her subsequent disability. He declared that whether her symptoms first manifested themselves before the date of her fall or two or three months subsequent thereto', there was no causal relationship under either hypothesis. We need not explore his opinion based on the assumption that petitioner\u2019s symptoms manifested themselves a year prior to her fall, since her medical experts apparently do not disagree, if that fact be assumed. Moreover, wo find, as did the Division and the County Court, that these symptoms probably had their onset about two months after her accident. On the latter basis, Dr. Flicker still felt that petitioner\u2019s \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>myelinizing process is not associated with the described trauma.\u201d It was his view that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cThe only known direct physical trauma that will produce demyelinizing lesion is a violent trauma to the bead or spinal cord. It must be trauma of unquestioned violence. Minor traumata do not produce it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">After stressing that \u201cit takes a violent trauma to either initiate or bring it [a latent condition of multiple sclerosis] to the fore,\u201d Dr. Elicker asserted that the degree of trauma here could not have produced or accelerated the demyelinizing process because it \u201cwas insufficient to produce unconsciousness. That is my only yardstick.\u201d He also stated that \u201cwhere there is an acute emotional disturbance kicking loose the process, there is an immediate onset. It occurs within a matter of hours, certainly within a matter of a very few days,\u201d rather than within two or three months, as in Mrs. Cohrs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We have reviewed the conflicting medical opinions and agree with the conclusions reached by both the Division and the County Court that the petitioner sustained the burden of proving by the preponderance of probabilities that there was a causal relationship between the accident in question and her demyelinization or multiple sclerosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Whether the condition of multiple sclerosis was caused, precipitated, or accelerated by petitioner\u2019s fall, her disability is compensable. Eor multiple sclerosis cases, in all of which compensation was awarded, see <em>Galloway v. Ford Motor Co., </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>18 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>Schust v. Wright Aeronautical Corp., </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>54 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>Sanderson v. Crucible Steel Corp., </em>3 <em>N. J. Super. </em>309 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949); <em>Davis v. Lotz, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>615 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The employer also challenges the propriety of the County Court\u2019s allowance of 6% interest \u201cfrom the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>judgment of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation * <em>* </em>* 011 eacj1 week\u2019s award to the date of entry of judgment\u201d in the County Court.-</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">There is no provision in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act expressly authorizing the County Court to add interest to an award of compensation. The only reference to interest in the statute is <em>R. 8. </em>34:15-28, under which the \u201cbureau\u201d may, in its discretion, add interest at 5% when lawful compensation has been withheld for three months or more. If the paucity of reported cases is any indication, this power has been exercised very sparingly by the bureau. Interest was denied by the bureau in <em>Asbell v. Campbell Morrell &amp; Co., </em>12 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>707, 174 <em>A. </em>344 <em>(Dept. Labor </em>1934), and <em>Greenhaus v. Essbee Amusement Corporation, </em>13 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>656, 180 <em>A. </em>625 <em>(Dept. Labor </em>1935), because there was a <em>\"bona fide </em>dispute\u201d as to the cause of petitioner\u2019s disability, or \u201ca grave factual question,\u201d and the employer had not failed to make payment by reason of negligence or other wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">On appeal from the Division, the County Court hears the matter <em>de novo </em>on the record made below. <em>Harrison v. Foster, </em>51 <em>N. J. Super. </em>77 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1958); <em>R. R. </em>5 :2\u20145. In the instant matter, the County Court correctly stated in its opinion, 66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>526 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1961), that <em>R. S. </em>34:15-28 \u201chas no bearing on the application\u201d before it for interest. Hence, we need not decide whether the discretion expressly vested in the \u201cbureau\u201d by that statute is impliedly vested also in the County Court, which hears the matter <em>de novo </em>on appeal, because the County Court did not rely upon the exercise of any such discretion in allowing interest in this case. See <em>Atamanik v. Real Estate Managament, Inc., </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>357, 365 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952), upholding the County Court\u2019s discretion in denying interest on a compensation award. Parenthetically, if discretion were the factor in issue here, we would deny interest for the same reasons expressed in the <em>Asbell </em>and <em>Greenhaus </em>cases, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>In this case, the County Court allowed interest on the award at 6% on the broader concept that the issue was \u201ccontrolled by principles relating to the matter of interest on judgments.\u201d It is true that <em>judgments </em>of our courts do bear interest at 6% from the date of entry, but that is a matter of usage, not of statute. <em>Simon v. N. J. Asphalt &amp; Paving Co., </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>232 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939); <em>Erie Railway Co. v. Ackerson, </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>33 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1868) ; <em>Verree v. </em>Hughes, 11 <em>N. J. L. </em>91 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1829). Is the determination of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation a \u201cjudgment,\u201d or so much its equivalent as to be entitled to the benefit of that usage? It is referred to as a judgment in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-58, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-66 and <em>R. R. </em>5:2-5, and deputy directors who preside at the hearings are now called \u201cjudges.\u201d Such determinations by the Division have some qualities inherent in judgments, such as the attribute of <em>res adjudicata. Estelle v. Board of Education of Red Bank, </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>9, 25 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953); <em>Hull v. Hercules Powder Co., </em>20 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>168, 171, 26 <em>A. 2d </em>164 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942); <em>Temple v. Storch Trucking Co., 29 N. J. Super. </em>492 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">On the other hand, decisions of administrative agencies are not normally regarded as judgments in the technical sense of that term because they are not formal adjudications of an established court. Thus, an award by the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation is not enforcible by writ of execution, until it is converted into a judgment of a County Court by being docketed with a county clerk. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-58. Compare a District Court judgment, enforcible by writ of execution against personal property even before docketing, though docketing is necessary to make it a lien against land. The constitutional power of the Supreme Court under the <em>New Jersey Constitution of </em>1947, <em>Art. </em>VI, <em>Sec. </em>Y, <em>par. </em>1(d), to review directly by certification the judgment of all inferior courts does not, extend to decisions of administrative agencies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Mulhearn v. Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., 2 N. J. </em>356 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Furthermore, if an injured employee dies from a noncompensable cause during the period of payments for permanent disability and is not survived by dependents as defined in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the remaining amount due is not an asset of his estate, to be enjoyed by his creditors and next of kin, as would be the case of an unsatisfied judgment of a law court. Instead, recovery of the remaining amount due is limited by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:lo-12(e) to a sum not exceeding $400 to be paid to a proper person for his funeral expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The County Court cited <em>Simon v. N. J. Asphalt &amp; Paving Co., supra, </em>in support of its opinion, but there the employee was allowed interest on the unpaid installments of compensation only from the time the \u201cjudgment of the bureau\u201d was <em>docketed. </em>There was no claim of interest prior to the docketing and the court particularly noted that fact, thus indicating a long standing view, unaltered by subsequent decisions, that the bureau\u2019s award does not bear interest unless it is added by the bureau under <em>R. S. </em>34:15-28, or the bureau\u2019s determination is docketed with the county clerk pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The County Court stated (66 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>527) that \u201cthe allowance of interest, at least from the date of the award in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division, would seem to be inferentially approved in <em>Kasiski v. International Paper Co., </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>267 (1959).\u201d We find such an inference very dubious, particularly since <em>Kasiski </em>involved an interpretation of the Bureau\u2019s discretionary power to allow interest under <em>R. S. </em>34:15-28, which statute the County Court found \u201chas no bearing on the application\u201d before it for interest. The Supreme Court decided merely that the <em>deputy director </em>erred in allowing interest on the award commencing three months after the date of decedent\u2019s death and should have, under the facts of that case, allowed interest only from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>date when the last determination in favor of the petitioner was made in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"> We find no New Jersey statutory or case authority supporting the County Court\u2019s allowance of interest at 6% on the undoeketed award of the Division from the date of the decision of the Division. As stated in <em>Agnew Co. v. Paterson Bd. of Education, </em>83 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>49, 67 <em>(Ch. </em>1914), affirmed o. b. 83 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>336 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201cUnless a case be found which is conclusive authority establishing a precedent, the safest way for a court of law or equity is to decide all questions pertaining to interest according to the plainest and simplest considerations of justice and fair dealing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Guided by that principle, we conclude that the interest allowance was erroneous and unwarranted, particularly in this <em>\u201cbona fide </em>dispute\u201d as to the cause of petitioner\u2019s disability, where \u201ca grave factual question\u201d was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The County Court\u2019s judgment awarding compensation is affirmed but its allowance of interest is reversed. Ho costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
