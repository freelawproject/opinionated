J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AsL\">The New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board (hereinafter Fund) appeals from an order of the Superior Court, Law Division, dated June 16, 1961, directing the payment of $3,333.33 and costs of suit (part of the judgment hereinafter mentioned) to the attorney for the administrator <em>ad prosequendum </em>of the estate of Morris Eosenfield, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The facts have.been stipulated. Decedent, a resident of Pennsylvania, and 'a pedestrian at the time of the accident here involved, was fatally injured in Camden, New Jersey, on February 11, 1959, when struck by a car driven by one William H. Hazel, \u201can uninsured driver resident of New Jersey.\u201d Decedent was survived by his widow, a resident of Pennsylvania, and his minor son, Sherman L. Eosenfield, born of a former marriage. The latter was a New Jersey resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">A judgment of $5,000 damages, plus $83.75 costs of suit, was recovered by the administrator <em>ad prosequendum </em>against Hazel and one William P. Angerstein, owner of the car Hazel was driving. Subsequent to' the filing of notice with the Fund board, the aforesaid order was made. The propriety of that order is challenged on the present appeal. It is conceded that the widow, a nonresident of this State, has no right to recover from the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Appellant urges that it should not be required to make payment in the case at bar because decedent was not \u201ca qualified person\u201d under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:6-62, <em>i. e., </em>\u201ca resident of this State.\u201d On the contrary, respondent asserts that the residence of decedent is irrelevant and that the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>recovery under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39 :6\u201469 is dependent upon the residence of decedent\u2019s minor son for whose benefit, in part as aforesaid, the judgment under the statute relating to death by wrongful act, <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:31-1, against Hazel and Angerstein was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The challenged order of the trial court recited that, \u201cby virtue of the provisions\u201d of <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:31-4, \u201cthe amount recovered in this action is for the exclusive benefit of the widow and surviving minor son, in the proportions in which they are entitled to take the same\u201d; that the minor son by virtue of N. <em>J. S. 3A :4\u20142 </em>\u201cis entitled to two-thirds of the amount of said j udgment and is a qualified person within the meaning\u201d of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39 :6-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Plaintiff asserts that there \u201cappears to be no decision on the precise question here under consideration.\u201d He bases his argument in support of the trial court\u2019s action on the ground that as <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:6-61 to 91 \u201cis social, legislation and should be liberally construed,\u201d and that as any sum received under <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:31-4 by the administrator <em>ad prosequendum </em>is \u201cfor the exclusive benefit of the persons entitled to take any intestate personal property of the decedent,\u201d the minor son of decedent as one of such beneficiaries is the person whose status is the determinative factor in the case at bar; that, as he is a resident of this State, he meets the statutory requirements justifying reimbursement by the Fund. Specifically, he contends that the status of a decedent, whose death is caused by the operation of a motor vehicle, is not comprehended by the term \u201cqualified person,\u201d but that the status of the person who is the beneficiary of a judgment under the Wrongful Death Act is the criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We disagree and find definite authority in negation of plaintiff\u2019s contention in <em>Betz v. Director, Div. of Motor Vehicles, 27 N. J. </em>324, 331 (1958). Although the court in that case was dealing with a different section of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Law, <em>viz., N. J. S. A. </em>39 :6-78, and the basic question there involved was whether substantial similarity existed between the New Jersey act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>and the then existing New York Motor Vehicle Financial Security Act, Mr. Justice Proctor\u2019s opinion for the court has a direct bearing on the resolution of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In <em>Betz, supra, </em>after emphasizing the importance of the phrase \u201cqualified person who would have a cause of action,\u201d contained in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6\u201478, and the direct relationship of that phrase to the express intent of the Legislature that only a \u201cqualified person\u201d as defined by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39 :6-62 may avail himself of the benefits of the act (at <em>p. </em>328), the court, in concluding that the New York legislation did not meet the standard of substantial similarity contained in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:6\u201462, said at <em>p. </em>331, \u201cthat the <em>decedent </em>was not a \u2018qualified person\u2019 within the meaning of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>39:6-62 and that the plaintiff, as his administrator <em>ad prosequendum, </em>cannot maintain this action.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">. Based on the foregoing opinion it is clear that the <em>decedent\u2019s </em>status is the criterion. In the instant case the decedent was a nonresident. Therefore, under the facts here present, although we are dealing with a section of the aforesaid act other than the one before the-court in <em>Betz, supra, </em>we hold that decedent was not a qualified person and consequently that his minor son, as a beneficiary of his estate, cannot have recourse to the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The aforesaid order of the Law Division is reversed. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
