J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AKr\">Plaintiff Louis M. Carlini appeals from an order of the Superior Court, Law Division, which, on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, <em>R. R. </em>4:58, dismissed his complaint against his employer, defendant Curtiss-Wright Corporation (Curtiss). By said complaint plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages against said corporation as well as reinstatement in his job, from which he alleged he had been discharged unlawfully. In support of its motion defendant relied upon the pleadings and upon an affidavit and exhibits referred to therein while, in opposition thereto, plaintiff relied upon the complaint and his own affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Plaintiff had been an employee of defendant for a number of years prior to his discharge effective July 6, 1959. The complaint alleged that defendant breached its \u201ccollective bargaining contract\u201d with Local 669, UAW (hereinafter union), of which plaintiff was a member, in that it discharged him without \u201cjust cause.\u201d The complaint further alleged that plaintiff \u201chas duly sought the relief provided by the said collective bargaining contract and has exhausted all his remedies under the said collective bargaining contract.\u201d Damages, reinstatement, and payment of \u201cback\u201d wages were demanded on the theory that plaintiff was either a third-party beneficiary of the contract or that the union was his agent in executing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Plaintiff asserts in his brief on appeal that the \u201csubstantive issue involved in the cause is the legality of the discharge\u201d of plaintiff from defendant\u2019s employ \u201cfor alleged excessive absenteeism.\u201d However, it is clear from an examination of the record before us that the true issue was whether plaintiff, on the allegations contained in the complaint herein, may maintain such an action against his corporate employer based on an alleged breach of his rights flowing from the collective bargaining contract existing between the employer and the aforesaid union.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The aforesaid contract provides, <em>inter </em>alia, that \u201cNo employee shall be discharged without proper cause,\u201d and that all grievances from such alleged discharge \u201cshall be handled only in accordance with the * * * procedure\u201d therein specified. The stated procedure is a hearing before the labor relations manager whose decision, upon notice of appeal, is reviewable by the industrial relations manager. The decision of the latter is \u201cfinal unless notice of appeal to the Umpire is filed by the Union * * * within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date\u201d of the industrial relations manager\u2019s decision. Plaintiff\u2019s discharge was upheld by both the labor relations manager and the industrial relations manager. The union appealed the decision of the former and accepted the decision of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">With the record before it revealing the foregoing, the trial court, as recited in its order from which the appeal is taken, concluded that \u201cthe pleadings, together with the affidavits submitted in support of and in opposition to the motion of the defendant show palpably that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not state a cause of action.\u201d The order directed the dismissal of the complaint. Paradoxically, the order further provided \u201cthat plaintiff is granted leave to apply to this court for permission to file an amended complaint in this cause.\u201d The order imposed limitation on the time for the making of such application and the time for the service of the notice of motion therefor and the documents in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Apparently motivating the last mentioned portion of the aforesaid order was plaintiff\u2019s affidavit averring that the union \u201cfailed and refused to provide\u201d him \u201cwith the protections to which\u201d he was \u201centitled as a member of the union * * despite his repeated requests therefor, and characterizing the union\u2019s action as \u201cdiscriminatory, willful, and arbitrary.\u201d Although not specifically so stating, the affidavit suggests the existence of a conspiracy between defendant and the union designed to terminate plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>employment without justifiable cause and to deny him the safeguards afforded by the collective bargaining contract. It charged that the union \u201ccollaborated with the defendant in breaching the contract\u201d and also alleged that defendant \u201cacted, together with the union, to breach\u201d plaintiff\u2019s \u201crights under the contract. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Plaintiff elected not to apply for permission to \u201camend\u201d his complaint and appealed to this court from the summary judgment aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Plaintiff, in challenging the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action in granting judgment in favor of defendant upon the pleadings and affidavits, charges that such action was erroneous because of \u201cthe existence of numerous controverted issues of material fact.\u201d Assessment of justification for plaintiff\u2019s contention requires that in examining the record placed before the trial court on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we contrast the allegations contained in plaintiff\u2019s complaint with those presented in his affidavit in opposition to defendant\u2019s aforesaid motion. Moreover, the fact that plaintiff, as conceded on oral argument, deliberately refrained from availing himself of the opportunity to amend his complaint serves further to focus attention on the divergent allegations contained in the complaint and those contained in the aforesaid affidavit of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Following allegations that plaintiff was an employee of defendant and that an existing \u201ccollective bargaining contract\u201d between defendant and the aforesaid union covered the terms of his employment, the complaint alleged that said contract provided that, absent proper cause, plaintiff should not be discharged from such employment; that the contract prescribed the procedure for prosecuting the asserted grievance of an employee; that plaintiff\u2019s aforesaid discharge was without \u201cjust\u201d cause; that, despite demand therefor by plaintiff, defendant had \u201cfailed, neglected, and refused to reinstate\u201d him \u201cto his employment\u201d; that \u201cdefendant has breached the provisions of paragraph 81 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>aforesaid bargaining agreement [the provision barring discharge except for \u201cproper cause\u201d] and has unreasonably made its determination in the matter.\u201d Then followed an allegation that plaintiff had \u201cexhausted all his remedies under the said collective bargaining contract, without success in obtaining reinstatement to his employment with the defendant\u201d; and that because thereof he is entitled to compensatory damages, \u201creinstatement to employment with the defendant at the wages he was earning at the time of his wrongful discharge together with accumulative seniority and other benefits as provided for in the said collective bargaining contract,\u201d as well as payment of \u201cfull back pay * * * with interest.\u201d By a second count of the complaint plaintiff asserted defendant\u2019s actions \u201cin discharging the plaintiff were malicious, intentional, wrongful, unlawful, and without proper or justifiable cause,\u201d and upon such allegation punitive damages were demanded. The third count of the complaint, after asserting that the aforesaid labor contract was made by the union \u201cas agent of the plaintiff\u201d and that the plaintiff was \u201centitled to all the provisions, benefits, protections, and rights contained in the said collective bargaining contract and which the defendant barred him from receiving,\u201d made the aforesaid demand for damages, reinstatement and the \u201cpayment of full back pay\u201d with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Defendant\u2019s answer admitted the employment, the existence and applicability of the \u201ccollective bargaining agreement\u201d; alleged that plaintiff\u2019s discharge was \u201cfor proper cause\u201d and not in violation of the provisions of the \u201clabor contract\u201d; that it acted within its rights in refusing to reinstate plaintiff; that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s grievance relating to his discharge\u201d was \u201cprocessed in accordance with the provisions of said collective bargaining agreement,\u201d and that under the grievance procedure provided, defendant\u2019s discharge of plaintiff was \u201csustained and upheld\u201d and plaintiff was bound thereby. It admitted that plaintiff had exhausted his remedies under the aforesaid bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>agreement. It denied that \u201cit barred plaintiff from receiving any rights under the aforesaid labor contract\u201d and asserted that \u201cplaintiff has received all benefits, rights and protection to which plaintiff was entitled under the labor contract on which plaintiff relies.\u201d Defendant further pleaded affirmative defenses which included a detailed outline of the grievance procedure under the aforesaid contract; the exclusive nature of such procedure; the prosecution of the grievance under the contract provisions, the resultant decision adverse to plaintiff, which decision specifically sustained defendant\u2019s action in discharging plaintiff; and the finality of the determination thereunder. Among the affirmative defenses pleaded in the answer was an allegation that plaintiff\u2019s grievance, \u201cat the review step of the Discharge Grievance Procedure,\u201d was processed as provided in the aforesaid agreement; that \u201cthe decision of the employer\u2019s representative, dated October 14, 1959, sustained the discharge of plaintiff as proper\u201d; that said decision \u201cwas accepted by the Union bargaining agent on October 16, 1959,\u201d and that \u201cno notice of appeal to the Umpire was filed within the time limits provided in the contract.\u201d Defendant then alleged that the \u201caforementioned decision made by the defendant\u2019s representative in the review step of the Discharge Grievance Procedure is final and binding\u201d on plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On its motion for summary judgment aforesaid, defendant presented the affidavit of its industrial relations manager, incorporating exhibits, including the notice of discharge given to plaintiff, the outline of the various steps under the grievance procedure and the union\u2019s acceptance, on October 16, 1959, of the industrial manager\u2019s decision at the \u201creview step\u201d specified in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We find that the trial court properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In reaching that conclusion we do so on the basis that plaintiff was unjustified in seeking to rest his resistance to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on averments in his answer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ing affidavit which were not supportive of the allegations of his complaint. A completely new alleged cause of action was presented through the medium of plaintiff\u2019s affidavit. There was no charge in the complaint that the union\u2019s actions were \u201cdiscriminatory, willful and arbitrary\u201d and that it demonstrated \u201carbitrary and willful indifference\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s \u201crights as a [ujnion member\u201d in failing \u201cto insist upon arbitration\u201d of his discharge. The complaint was devoid of any allegations that defendant and the union unlawfully or improperly collaborated, to the detriment of plaintiff, in depriving him of his rights under the bargaining agreement aforesaid. Those allegations were outside the scope of the complaint and bear no true relationship to the issue framed by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to rest his opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on allegations in his affidavit, which are foreign to the issue presented by the pleadings and not supportive of the allegations of the cause of action set forth in the complaint, is rejected. Affidavits are not pleadings. Plaintiff will not be permitted by the submission of such an affidavit as was here presented, to expand the scope of the cause of action he asserted in his complaint, or, as he has here done, to present an entirety new cause of action. Plaintiff was given an opportunity to amend his complaint. He elected not to avail himself thereof. He chose to rest on his original complaint and affidavit. To do so was his privilege, but that election did not give him the right, through the medium of the filed affidavit setting forth new allegations, to contend that, because of the content of the affidavit, \u201cgenuine issues of material fact\u201d were raised. His conclusion, based on the aforesaid affidavit, that the particular issue raised was \u201cwhether the defendant employer and the plaintiff\u2019s collective bargaining representative had acted in bad faith and in unlawful collaboration in processing his grievance concerning the discharge,\u201d is not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The objective of the pertinent rule controlling motions <em>(R. B. </em>4:58) for summary judgment would be impossible of attainment if approval were given to the course of action here pursued by plaintiff. <em>B. B. </em>4:58\u20146 provides that supporting and opposing affidavits \u201c* <em>* </em>* shall set forth only facts which are admissible in evidence * * Necessarily, therefore, the affidavits must be limited to the allegations of the complaint and answer. They cannot, as attempted here, raise new claims under the guise of fortifying the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> At the time of the trial court\u2019s consideration of the motion for summary judgment the court had before it the pleadings, together with the affidavit and exhibits presented by the movant, whicli material demonstrated the absence of any breach of the bargaining agreement. It then became incumbent upon plaintiff to produce \u201ccompetent evidential material that a genuine issue of material fact\u201d existed. <em>New Jersey Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. v. Calvetti, </em>68 <em>N. J. Super. </em>18, <em>32 (App. Div. </em>1961); <em>Heljon Management Corp. v. Di Leo, </em>55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>306, 312 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959); <em>Robbins v. Jersey City, 23 N. J. </em>229, 241 (1957). Excluding plaintiff\u2019s affidavit for the reasons heretofore expressed, it is clear that he did not meet the duty imposed on him to \u201c \u2018go forward with controverting facts\u2019 \u201d <em>(Heljon, supra, </em>55 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>313), which failure precluded any action other than the entry of the summary judgment aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">In view of the foregoing conclusion we find it unnecessary to resolve the other points raised by plainitff on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
