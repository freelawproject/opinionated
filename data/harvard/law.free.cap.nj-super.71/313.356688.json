J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A5C\">Defendants Eairlawn Jewish Center (hereinafter Center) and Eandall Construction Co., Inc. (hereinafter Eandall) appeal from a judgment entered in a negligence action in the Superior Court, Law Division, on the verdict of a jury which awarded damages in the sum of $10,000 to plaintiff for personal injuries sustained on November 16, 1958. Plaintiff was injured when he fell while on property, owned by Center, on which property certain new construction and renovation work was being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>performed by Randall under contract with Center, to which contract reference is hereinafter made.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Although the respective defendants at trial vigorously contested the charge that they wore negligent, neither defendant on appeal challenges the resolution of that issue by the jury. Center\u2019s appeal is based on the contention that it was entitled to the charitable immunity provided by <em>L. </em>1958, c. 131, which, as it became effective July <em>22, </em>1958, and by its terms did not expire until June 30, 1959, was in effect at the time of the aforesaid accident. Randall, asserting that plaintiff \u201cwas guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law,\u201d contends that the trial court erroneously denied its motion for dismissal made on that ground at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case. Center also appeals from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of its cross-claim against defendant Randall for the alleged breach of one of the provisions of the aforesaid contract for construction and renovation of Center property.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On the date of the accident plaintiff Edwin L. Mayer was employed as the Regional Director of the Development Corporation for Israel, a New York corporation engaged in the sale of bonds issued by the government of the State of Israel for the economic development of that country. In his official capacity plaintiff attended a dinner held at the Center on the evening of November 16, 1958, for the promotion of bond sales. Arriving at the Center about <em>7 </em>:30 p. m., plaintiff entered the building through the main entrance. About an hour later plaintiff decided to go outside to \u201cget a breath of air.\u201d He walked to an exit where there were \u201cswinging doors.\u201d The doorway was not the one through which he had entered the room, nor was it identified by an \u201cexit\u201d sign visible from the interior of the room as were other doorways. Beyond the swinging doors was a short hallway leading to the kitchens. Plaintiff testified that on entering the hallway he asked one of Center\u2019s employees where he might exit from the building. The employee indicated a single door at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>end of the hall. Plaintiff proceeded outside through that door, which was unlocked and which had a lighted \u201cexit\u201d sign above it, visible from the hallway. It was dark outside. Plaintiff testified that after taking \u201ctwo,\u201d \u201cthree\u201d or \u201cfour\u201d steps, he turned to his left and fell into a stairwell, 9 to 11 feet in depth. He sustained substantial physical injury. The proofs established that there was no railing or other guard around the stairwell then under construction; the area was unlighted, and there were no warning signals or signs indicating the presence of the unfinished stairwell. On the date of the accident the stairwell and other portions of the Center property were under construction by Eandall pursuant to the aforesaid contract between Center and Eandall.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The president of Center testified that the Development Corporation, plaintiff\u2019s employer, was using Center\u2019s building free of charge pursuant to Center\u2019s offer. The Development Corporation made arrangements for the dinner and caused the tickets to be printed. The tickets were sold by lay leaders of the Center working under the supervision of the Development Corporation. The tickets were priced at $6 each. Plaintiff confirmed the fact that insofar as he knew \u201cthere was no direct charge\u201d by Center for the use of its hall on the evening in question, but that he believed that out of each $6 dinner ticket charge, 50 cents went to Center, which arrangement was explained in Center\u2019s answers to interrogatories (received in evidence) as a payment from the caterer to Center \u201cfor a kitchen charge.\u201d Plaintiff further testified that the Development Corporation made the arrangements for the dinner \u201cfor the benefit of the Pair Lawn Jewish Committee, headed by lay leadership \u2022\u2014the volunteers in the Jewish Center and community at large * * *; to benefit the State of Israel, but to involve the people, the Jewish people of Pair Lawn * * There is no doubt from the proofs that the sale of the bonds and the use of the hall therefor, represented a cooperative effort by Center and the Development Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tion to achieve a common objective, and that plaintiff\u2019s status, as determined by the trial court, was that of an invitee on the premises of Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We consider initially Ban (tail\u2019s claim that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s action on that ground. Appellant Band all stresses plaintiff\u2019s failure to leave the building through the same doorway which he used on entering. There was nothing in the proofs from which it might reasonably be concluded that he was required to do so. Moreover, his actions, on exiting from the building, definitely raised a jury question as to whether he was guilty of contributory negligence. In <em>Seipel v. Sevek, </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>593, 597 (1959), it was held that \u201cunless the contributory negligence is a necessarily exclusive conclusion from the facts, there is no warrant for removal of the issue from the consideration of the jury.\u201d See also, <em>Marty v. Erie R. Co., </em>62 <em>N. J. Super. </em>458, 465-466 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), certif. denied 33 <em>N. J. </em>387 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Under the evidence, the court would have been unjustified in holding that as a matter of law plaintiff should have foreseen the existence of the uncompleted and unguarded stairwell, of the presence of which, as above stated, there was no warning. Neither did the few steps he took in the dark, on leaving through the doorway which bore a lighted exit sign, and to which doorway he bad been directed by a Center employee, constitute contributory negligence as a matter of law. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant Bandall\u2019s motion for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">We turn to Center\u2019s claim of immunity stemming from the statute in effect at the time of the happening of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>accident with which we are here concerned. The pertinent portions of the statute (with emphasis supplied as to those portions on which Center places chief reliance) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201c[Immunity; exceptions; liability of agents or servants.] No nonprofit corporation, society or association organized exclusively for religious, charitable, educational or hospital purposes shall, except as is hereinafter set forth, be liable to respond in damages to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of any agent or servant of such corporation, society or association, <em>where such person is a beneficiary, io whatever degree, of the works of such nonprofit corporation, society or association; </em>provided, however, that such immunity from liability shall not extend to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of such corporation, society, or association or of its agents or servants where such person is one unconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions of such corporation, society or association; but nothing herein contained shall be deemed to exempt the said agent or servant individually from their liability for any such negligence. <em>IL. </em>1958, <em>e. </em>131, \u00a7 1]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">* * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">[Article deemed remedial.] This act [article] shall be deemed to be remedial and shall be liberally construed so as to afford immunity to the said corporations, societies and associations from liability as provided herein in furtherance of the public policy for the protection of nonprofit corporations, societies and associations organized for religious, charitable, educational or hospital purposes.\u201d (\u00a3. 1958, <em>o. </em>131, \u00a7 4) (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Center maintains that the effect of <em>Collopy v. Newark Eye and Ear Infirmary, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>29 (1958), decided April 28, 1958, was to eliminate, without qualification,' the then existing decisional law relating to charitable immunity. Center further maintains that the aforesaid statute, with specific reference to the above quoted phrase freeing the charitable organization from liability for injury suffered by any person who then was \u201ca beneficiary, to whatever degree, of the works\u201d of such organization, rendered it immune in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">On the contrary, plaintiff contends that the statutory enactment did no more than reinstate the substance of the former common-law immunity, that no enlargement thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>was intended and that, therefore, the principles enunciated in <em>Lindroth v. Christ Hospital, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>588 (1956), should be applied by us in resolving the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In <em>Lindroth, </em>the court held, at <em>page </em>595:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201c* * * Such test as our decisions supply for differentiating a beneficiary from a stranger leans heavily upon the element whether the suitor is one of the <em>\u2018direct </em>recipients of the charity\u2019s beneficence, an acceptor of its <em>benefactions,\u2019 </em>whose mishap occurs in the course of \u2018some of the continuous ministrations to the <em>direct </em>beneficiaries of its charitable contrilmtions\u2019; the public policy sought to be served by the immunity doctrine is said to be \u2018to avoid a diversion of trust funds from the <em>direct </em>object of their charitable donor by forbidding their application to damages for the negligence of the charity's servants <em>where the injured party participates in the charity\u2019s largesse,\u2019 Daniels v. Rahway Hospital, supra, </em>10 <em>N. J. Misc., </em>at <em>pages </em>587, 588.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The trial court in the case at bar held that plaintiff was not a beneficiary of defendant Center under the above quoted statute. In reaching the aforesaid conclusion, the court relied in part on <em>Lindroth, supra, </em>and concurred in plaintiff\u2019s contention that the reasoning expressed in the opinion in that case was of aid in properly interpreting the concept of \u201cbeneficiary\u201d as used in the pertinent statute above quoted. Although we are in accord with the trial court\u2019s holding that plaintiff was not a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the statute and that Center is not immune from suit in the case at bar, wo do not base our conclusion on <em>Lindroth. We </em>find no need to go beyond the language of the statute itself <em>(L. </em>1958, <em>a. </em>131, \u00a7 4), and to that extent agree with Center\u2019s aforesaid argument. We are in accord with Center\u2019s contention that <em>Collopy, supra, </em>eliminated the existing decisional law referable to the charitable immunity doctrine and that the aforesaid statute, in effect at the time of the happening of the accident, controls. However, we disagree with Center\u2019s claim that the statute immunizes defendant from plaintiff\u2019s suit. Center argues that it \u201cwas the direct result of the elimination of the common, law theory of charitable immunity by our Supreme Court that the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>lature of New Jersey, in order to protect charitable organizations, promptly passed\u201d the aforesaid statute; that the statute\u2019s \u201ccontent and meaning\u201d are clear; that no \u201cinterpretation by the Court\u201d is required; and that the trial judge erred in failing \u201cto apply the plain meaning of the statute to the facts\u201d of the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Center, asserting that it was rightly determined by the trial court to be \u201ca charitable organization\u201d within the statutory description aforesaid (a determination unchallenged by plaintiff on appeal), contends that plaintiff was present at Center\u2019s building on the night of the accident under circumstances which constituted him a iCbeneficiary\u201d of defendant. Center\u2019s counsel stresses the statutory designation of \u201ca beneficiary, <em>to whatever degree, </em>of the works\u201d (emphasis supplied) of a charitable organization as rendering Center immune from plaintiff\u2019s suit. Emphasizing the broad sweep of the italicized phrase, Center\u2019s brief asserts that \u201cplaintiff, in furtherance of his own job and the aims of his own employment through his own co-employees, sought and accepted the donation of the use of\u201d Center\u2019s iCbuilding for the purpose of selling State of Israel Bonds\u201d; that he \u201carranged for\u201d the speaker of the evening; \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d the sale of the dinner tickets and \u201cvoluntarily attended the dinner.\u201d Center then adds that plaintiff \u201cpersonally accepted the light, heat and use of the premises and the success of the bond sale in furtherance of his own job purposes.\u201d Because thereof, Center maintains, it is established that \u201cthe plaintiff personally accepted as a beneficiary, <em>to some degree, </em>the benefits of the defendant as a charitable organization, <em>i. e., </em>the charitable donation of the use of defendant\u2019s building for the furtherance of the plaintiff\u2019s purposes.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) It concluded that by the \u201cplain meaning of the act,\u201d which by its terms is \u201cdeemed to be remedial\u201d and is to be \u201cliberally construed,\u201d defendant is not liable to respond in damages to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>It is apparent that the phrase on which Center places so much reliance, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cwhere such person [the one injured] is a beneficiary, to whatever degree, of the works\u201d of such charitable organization, must be read in connection with the immediately succeeding phrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\u201c* * * provided, however, that such immunity from liability shall not extend to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of such corporation, * * * where such person is one <em>unconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions of such corporation </em>* * (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Plaintiff was not a member of Center. He had no concern or relation with its benefactions. He was not even a resident of the community. He was \u201coutside\u201d of its \u201cbenefactions.\u201d His attendance at the Center building on the night of the accident was in the performance of his job for his employer and not as a recipient of Center\u2019s beneficence or philanthropy. The \u201cpublic policy for the protection\u201d of nonprofit charitable organizations, stated by the terms of the act to be its objective, does not encompass the situation here presented. To hold that, because of his employment, plaintiff derived an indirect advantage from the activities of Center and that, therefore, he was a beneficiary of the \u201cworks\u201d of Center so as to render it free from liability at his suit, is to ascribe to the act a meaning completely foreign to its declared purpose and unwarrantedly to extend its protective scope. The trial court properly rejected Center\u2019s contention that it was immune from plaintiff\u2019s suit. The court\u2019s action, denying Center\u2019s motion for dismissal, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Center\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of its cross-claim against Kandall, to which we next direct our attention, is based upon the following provision (article 6) in the aforesaid contract between the parties, dated March 30, 1958:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cPROTECTION OE WORK, PROPERTY, AND PERSONS\u2014 The Contractor shall adequately protect the work, adjacent property and the public and shall be responsible for any damage or injury due to his act or neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Center\u2019s cross-claim alleged that Randall had breached the contract by failing \u201cadequately\u201d to \u201cprotect the work\u201d and the pretrial order reasserts the claim. The substance of the contention is that Center\u2019s loss by reason of the alleged breach is equal to the amount for which it might be held liable to plaintiff. Any intention of seeking recovery against Randall on a theory of <em>indemnification </em>is expressly disclaimed by Center. It contends that Randall and it \u201chad the right to agree as to who would protect the construction,\u201d and further to \u201cagree between themselves who would be responsible for injuries and damages\u201d if the work was not protected; that the issue in \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s suit against both defendants and the issue between the defendants as to the causation of plaintiff\u2019s injuries\u201d were identical, because, asserts Center, the \u201cuncontroverted proofs establish that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the result of the failure to guard an open stairwell under construction by the defendant,\u201d Randall.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Randall contends that Center, by its aforesaid claim, is in fact doing no more than seeking indemnification for its (Center\u2019s) own negligence determined by the jury\u2019s verdict to have been established by the proofs. Under the above quoted article 6 of the contract, Randall claims it was responsible only for its negligence, not Center\u2019s. Since the jury found both defendants negligent, Randall urges that it is responsible, as between itself and Center, for only one-half of the verdict. The trial court agreed with the argument advanced by Randall and dismissed Center\u2019s cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On this appeal, in challenging the propriety of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the cross-claim, Center relies exclusively upon this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rommell v. United States Steel Corp., </em>66 <em>N. J. Super. </em>30 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>support for its assertion of breach of contract. In Rommell, plaintiff was an emploj\u2019ee of Commercial Contracting Corporation, an independent contractor hired to install \u201ca shear line\u201d in one of defendant\u2019s (U. S. Steel) buildings in Pennsylvania. Paragraph 16 of the contract between Commercial and Steel, as set forth in Rommell, at <em>page </em>41, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201c* * * \u2018the safety of all persons employed by Contractor * * * on Owner\u2019s premises shall be the sole responsibility of Contractor\u2019; that the \u2018Contractor shall at all times maintain good order among his employees and shall not employ on the work any unfit person or anyone not skilled in the work assigned to him\u2019; that the \u2018Contractor shall take all reasonable measures and precautions at all times to prevent injuries to * * * any of his employees or any other person who enters upon Owner\u2019s premises\u2019; that these measures and precautions \u2018shall include * * * all <em>safeguards and warnings necessary to protect workmen </em>* * * <em>against any conditions on Owner\u2019s premises which could he dangerous </em>and to prevent accidents of any kind whenever work is being performed in proximity to any moving or operating machinery, equipment or facilities, whether * * * the property of or being operated by the Contractor * * the Owner or other persons.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The evidence indicated that while working at the plant plaintiff Kommell was injured when a vehicle of Steel passed over a \u201cloose floor plate\u201d causing it to bounce \u201cup\u201d and strike another plate suspended by Commercial\u2019s fork lift, whereupon the suspended plate fell on plaintiff\u2019s foot. Plaintiff, whose right to relief against Commercial was exclusively limited to the benefits of Pennsylvania\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation statute, sued Steel in tort. Steel joined Commercial as a third-party defendant contending that Commercial had breached the aforementioned contract. The parties agreed that Pennsylvania law should govern whenever in conflict with the law of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">In <em>Rommell </em>we remanded plaintiff\u2019s action for a new trial on the issues of both liability and damages and reversed the dismissal of the third-party complaint. Apart from indemnity, we recognized that a breach of contract by Commercial might form the basis of liability and em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>phasized that \u201cindemnity for liability incurred by the indemnitee due to his own fault and damages for breach of contractual duties must be clearly distinguished.\u201d <em>Rommell, supra, </em>at <em>page </em>46.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">It is apparent, however, that the decision in <em>Rommell </em>cannot support Center\u2019s cross-claim in the case at bar. Initially, it is to be noted from the above quoted portion of the contract between Steel and Commercial that in <em>Rommell </em>the obligation undertaken by Commercial was at variance with that assumed by Randall in the case at bar. Two phases of the respective obligations are emphasized: (A) In <em>Rommell, </em>the pertinent portion of Commercial\u2019s agreement was to take <em>\u201call </em>safeguards and warnings necessary to protect workmen * * * against <em>any </em>conditions on\u201d Steel\u2019s \u201cpremises which <em>could </em>be dangerous * * (Emphasis supplied) In contrast, in the instant case Randall\u2019s undertaking was <em>\u201cadequately\u201d </em>to \u201cprotect the work, adjacent property and the public.\u201d (Emphasis added) It is clear that Commercial\u2019s obligation was much broader and far more comprehensive than was Randall\u2019s. (B) The scope and extent of the responsibility of Commercial as to its employees (of whom Rommell was one) was evidenced by the aforesaid phrase <em>\u201csole responsibility.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added) In the case at bar the scope and extent of Randall\u2019s responsibility encompassed \u201cany damage or injury due to <em>his </em>[its] act or neglect.\u201d (Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">In <em>Rommell, </em>Commercial was not under a common-law duty to respond to plaintiff on the basis of a failure to exercise reasonable care, because plaintiff in that case was its employee and Commercial\u2019s obligation to plaintiff was measured by the provisions of \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 <em>P. S. </em>\u00a7 1, <em>et seq.\u201d </em>(66 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>39) Absent contract provisions, Steel\u2019s \u201cright of contribution against\u201d Commercial was \u201climited to\u201d Commercial\u2019s \u201cliability to pay workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.\u201d <em>(Rommell, </em>at <em>page </em>39) Consequently Commercial\u2019s contractual liability to Steel exceeded Commercial\u2019s pre-exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ing legal duty and was binding on it and enforceable at Steel\u2019s suit <em>based on the contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In contrast, in the ease at bar, Randall was under a common-law duty to exercise reasonable care towards plaintiff as an invitee on Center\u2019s property. The contractual obligation on which Center relies in support of its cross-claim was nothing more than the reiteration of Randall\u2019s aforesaid common-law duty, and a breach of the contract, therefore, cannot afford a basis for the recovery sought by Center on its cross-claim. It is clear that the language in the contract in the instant case, explicitly relating as it does to the consequences flowing from the acts of negligence of Eandall, is in sharp contrast to the terms and provisions employed in the <em>Rommell </em>contract. Consequently, the effect of the former contract is not to be resolved on the basis of the latter. It is manifest that Eandall and Center were contracting with reference to the law of negligence as interpreted and applied in this State. Such being the case it is evident that the parties were not contracting with reference to degrees of negligence as between themselves. Recognition in <em>Rommell </em>(at <em>page </em>47) that the respective degrees of negligence might be resolved by a jury stemmed solely from the specific contractual provisions there involved. Center\u2019s rights against Eandall, therefore, are limited to those afforded by the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law <em>(N. J. S. </em>2A:53A-1, <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The judgment in favor of plaintiff against Eandall and Center is affirmed. The judgment in favor of Eandall and against Center on the latter\u2019s cross-claim is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
