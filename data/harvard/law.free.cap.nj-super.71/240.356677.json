J. A. I).</author>\n<p id=\"ArX\">Plaintiff, a social visitor of defendants, was injured when she fell down the icy front steps of their home upon leaving. The trial judge dismissed the resulting action for personal injuries at the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was to the following effect: She left Newark by car at 9 i&gt;. n. on February 3, 1959 for defendants\u2019 home in Lyndhurst. At Newark the ground had been \u201csplotched with ice\u201d and \u201cslightly slippery.\u201d When she reached her destination 20 minutes later she found the front, steps of defendants\u2019 home in the \u201csame condition as it had been in Newark * * * splotchy, * * * not a sheet of ice.\u201d The sidewalk in front of the steps was \u201csplotchy * * * with ice.\u201d It was \u201csplotchy slippery.\u201d When she entered the house she told defendant Mrs. Souza \u201cthat their steps were starting to ice up.\u201d Thereupon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>latter, in plaintiff\u2019s presence, told her daughter \u201cCele\u201d to \u201cgo down the cellar and get the rock salt and put it on the steps.\u201d Cele said she would do so, and left the room a \u201cfew times\u201d during the approximate hour or so that plaintiff was there. In going from the premises, plaintiff \u201ctook one step,\u201d slid, and injured herself. At the time, the steps were \u201ca sheet of ice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In the pretrial order, plaintiff claimed: \u201cdefts. had knowledge of the treacherous condition of the front steps of the home and voiced their intention to perform certain acts to safeguard plaintiff, when she left the premises, but they negligently failed to do so effectively or at all.\u201d The trial court in dismissing the action stated that the defendant Mrs. Souza could not be charged with negligence in relation to telling her daughter to put rock salt on the steps. \u201cShe did nothing * * * so she did no negligent act.\u201d The court was not impressed with the argument submitted on behalf of' plaintiff to the effect that: \u201cIt' seems to\u2019 me that this telling her daughter to do this in the presence of the plaintiff is every indication that it would be done. * * * It tended to build up a sense of false security in the mind of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">It is our conclusion that a jury question was presented insofar as the liability of the female defendant was concerned on the theory of inferable reliance by plaintiff on the gratuitous undertaking by defendant to assure plaintiff\u2019s safety in traversing the slippery steps. Although plaintiff\u2019s brief does not make this point, assertedly through inadvertence, defendants\u2019 counsel commendably stated his willingness to face the issue as \u2022 presented on oral argument, and since the question was projected both in the pretrial order and at the trial, we are considering it in the interests of substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Where the defendant has gratuitously undertaken to do an act or perform a service recognizably necessary to another\u2019s bodily safety and there is reasonable reliance thereon, the defendant will be liable for harm sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the other resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to carry out the undertaking. <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 325, <em>p. </em>881 (1934), cited with approval in <em>Bauer v. </em>141-149 <em>Cedar Lane Holding Co., </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>139, 147 (1957); and see <em>Gudnestad v. Seaboard Coal Dock Co., </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>Super. 227, 233 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), affirmed 15 <em>N. J. </em>210 (1954); <em>Miller v. Muscarelle, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>305, 327, 330, 331 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certif. denied 36 <em>N. J. </em>140 (1961). Accord: 2 <em>Harper and James, Laws of Torts </em>(1956) \u00a7 18.6, <em>pp. </em>1044, 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In the present case a jury might not unreasonably infer reliance by plaintiff upon the undertaking of Mrs. Souza to eliminate or reduce the hazard of slipperiness on the front steps before she left the house. <em>Cf. Mistretta v. Alessi, </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>176, 181 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). On that hypothesis, Mrs. Souza would be liable for the consequences of the default of her daughter, whom she made her agent for the purpose, on the principle of <em>respondeat </em>superior. However, the defendant Joseph Souza, Sr. did not participate in the transaction. The question as to whether liability can nevertheless be laid to him on the basis discussed in conjunction with the theory of presumptive agency of a wife for her husband, has not been argued by the parties. This subject should be explored on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Apart from the foregoing analysis, defendants would not be liable to plaintiff by mere reason of the dangerous condition of the steps since no duty as landowners flowed from them to the plaintiff, a licensee, she being as fully aware of the condition. <em>Pearlstein v. Leeds, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>Super. 450 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), certif. denied 29 <em>N. J. </em>354 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Peversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
