S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"AuO\">(temporarily assigned). Defendant appeals from a judgment of $13,476.96 awarded plaintiff by the Superior Court, Law Division, in a nonjury trial for goods sold and delivered and labor performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">Plaintiff is an electrical contractor. Defendant is an incorporated nonprofit association which annually stages the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Yew Jersey State Eair. During 1942 to 1956, inclusive, plaintiff performed all the electrical work required by defendant for its annual fairs. The formula agreed upon by the parties to be used in determining plaintiff\u2019s charges was his cost for labor, material and insurance, to which were added overhead of 15% and a profit of 10%. Book accounts were maintained by plaintiff\u2019s bookkeeping department recording these transactions, thereby enabling him to determine the amount due and owing from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">One Donald H. Archer, plaintiff\u2019s bookkeeper during the year 1956, testified to the method of maintaining plaintiff\u2019s books of record. He explained that time cards were kept for employees, which cards were given to a foreman who summarized the working hours and turned them over to the bookkeeping department. The information contained thereon was then entered in the general ledger. He further stated that when defendant made payments, these were entered on a deposit ticket and the ledger balance reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s trial counsel then attempted to prove the disputed amount due and owing for the years 1955 and 1956 by offering the ledger prepared by Mr. Archer in the year 1956. The first entry thereon was an item in the amount of $4,488 \u201cbalance from 1955,\u201d which represented a balance that was carried forward from the previous year. Mr. Archer admitted that he had the 19'55 ledger sheet showing the details thereof but it was not a part of the proposed exhibit nor was it offered independently. Over the objection of defendant the court allowed the 1956 ledger sheet to be received in evidence. The witness then testified as to the individual charges and payments contained thereon, including the aforesaid 1955 balance. Thereupon, the court found the balance due to be $10,620.83 and rendered a judgment in favor of plaintiff for that amount plus 6% interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Defendant urges as grounds for reversal that the <em>1.955 balance </em>should not have been included as a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>1956 ledger received in evidence, and that by reason thereof the entire 1956 ledger was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>N. J. S. </em>2A:82-35 <em>(Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act) </em>is pertinent herein. It provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>record of an act, condition or event, shall, insofar as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of business, <em>at or near the time of the act, condition or event, </em>and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">To be \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d said books (lodger) must conform to the safeguards set forth in the act. <em>Watts v. Delaware Coach Co., </em>5 <em>Terry </em>283, 44 <em>Del. </em>283, 58 <em>A. 2d </em>689, 691 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948). One of these safeguards is that the entries therein must be made \u201cat or near the time of the act * * * or event.\u201d See <em>Tsibikas v. Morrof, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>102, 111 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). The \u201c1955 balance\u201d entry was not so made. Plaintiff\u2019s bookkeeper testified it was \u201ca ledger balance carried forward from the previous year\u2019s books,\u201d as heretofore noted. The latter was not a part of the exhibit in evidence noi was it offered independently. By reason thereof, the said \u201c1955 balance\u201d entry was not \u201ccompetent.\u201d Therefore, the receipt thereof in evidence, over the objection of defendant\u2019s counsel, was a \u201cmanifest abuse\u201d of discretion on the part of the court. <em>Cf. Webber v. McCormick, </em>63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>409, 415 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">However, we do not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that by reason thereof the entire \u201c1956 ledger\u201d was inadmissible. It was properly proved and competent. Numerous cases have been reported wherein an entire hospital report was offered as a business record under the uniform act, and a portion thereof, upon objection, was declared to be incompetent and excluded, but the remainder, otherwise competent, was received in evidence. See <em>Gilligan v. International Paper Co., </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>230, 238 (1957); <em>Green v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>City of Cleveland, </em>79 <em>N. E. 2d </em>676 <em>(Ohio Ct. App. </em>1948), affirmed 150 <em>Ohio St. </em>441, 83 <em>N. E. 2d </em>63 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948); <em>Watts v. Delaware Coach, supra; Allen v. St. Louis Public Service Company, </em>365 <em>Mo. </em>677, 285 <em>S. W. 2d </em>663, 55 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1022 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">By reason of the above, the principal amount of the judgment entered by the trial court is reduced by $4,488 and the balance thereof, amounting to $6,132.83 plus 6% interest from December 4, 1956, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Remanded to the Superior Court, Law Division, Mercer County for the entry of judgment in accordance herewith. FTo costs to either side.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
