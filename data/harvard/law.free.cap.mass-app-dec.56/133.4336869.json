There can be no review on appeal of a question of fact or discretion. <em>Bartley v. Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 42-3 (1944). Allowance of a motion to amend has long been discretionary under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 231, \u00a751, and now leave to amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Rule 15(a), Dist./Mun. Cts.R.Civ.P. The trial justice\u2019s action in this case comported with the law. Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
