(hereinafter called \"Consumer\u2019s\u201d) for an alleged failure to make a timely reinstatement of the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle insurance coverage. The answer is a general denial, payment and a denial of timely payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>At the trial there was evidence tending to show that </em>Consumer\u2019s held the plaintiff\u2019s note of December 28, 1972. The note provided in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">\"Upon failure to pay any installment when due . . . the entire unpaid balance shall become immediately due and payable and the holder may forthwith effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the cancellation of any of said policies. The maker hereby irrevocably appoints the holder the maker\u2019s true and lawful attorney to execute and deliver all documents and perform all acts necessary or appropriate to effect cancellation of the policies and to collect, receive and receipt for any return premium . . . which amounts shall be applied toward satisfaction of this note rendering any surplus to the person entitled thereto\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The plaintiff defaulted on the payments of his note, Consumer\u2019s exercised its power of attorney and on or about April 17, 1973 sent the plaintiff a cancellation notice effective May 11, 1973. On May 11, 1973 Consumer\u2019s sent a cancellation notice in a form prescribed by the Registry of Motor Vehicles to said Registry and a like notice to insurer General and to the plaintiff. In these notices the plaintiff\u2019s first name Domenic is spelled \u201cDominic\u201d; no middle initial appears; the last name and address is stated correctly; the registration number is stated accurately; the reason given for cancellation was \u201cdefault of payment in premium finance contract\u201d; the effective date of cancellation given was \u201cMay 11, 1973\u201d and in the space calling for the policy number the word \u201cunknown\u201d appeared. The Registry of Motor Vehicles under date of May 11, 1973, sent written notice of revocation of registration to \u201cDominic Paparo a/o Domenic L. Paparo, 28 Hull Street, Boston, Massachusetts.\u201d The notice stated accurately the registration number of the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle and the name of the insurer. The plaintiff denied receiving a copy of this revocation from the Registry. On May 17, 1973, Consumer\u2019s received from the plaintiff payment in full by a check dated May 2, 1973 and on the same day Consumer\u2019s requested reinstatement of the cancelled coverages from General. The request for reinstatement was not accepted by General who refunded a return premium of $186.55 on said policy to Consumer\u2019s on or about August 15, 1973. On October 29, 1973 the plaintiff suffered damages to his motor vehicle which would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>covered under the policy, in the amount of $1,106.00. He notified General of said accident and for the first time learned that his policy of insurance had never been reinstated. Consumer\u2019s returned to the plaintiff the return premium of $186.55 by check dated November 7, 1973. On December 11, 1973 the plaintiff commenced this action in contract. On December 17, 1973 the plaintiff cashed the return premium check that he received from Consumer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">On November 27, 1974 the Registry of Motor Vehicles, in written notices addressed to Dominic Paparo, 28 Hull Street, Boston, Massachusetts, and General, ruled that the notice of cancellation to become effective on May 11, 1973 was incorrect because notice was sent in the name of Dominic Paparo, whereas the name in the Registry application read Domenic L. Paparo and that it would be necessary to forward another notice of cancellation. These notices contained the correct registration number of the plaintiff\u2019s motor Vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The defendant Consumer\u2019s filed 7 requests for rulings and the trial justice acted on them and made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\"I find that the insurance policy of the plaintiff with the defendant General Accident Group (hereinafter called General) was effectively cancelled on May 11, 1973. I find that this cancellation was never annulled by the defendant, General. I therefore treat the defendant General\u2019s requests for rulings as waived and find for the defendant General on Count I of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\"I find that upon receiving notice of default dated April 17, 1973 and effective May 2, 1973<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in installment insurance premiums, the plaintiff, Paparo, on May 2, 1973 sent to the defendant Consumer\u2019s Financial Services, Inc., (hereinafter called \"Consumer\u2019s\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>a check in full payment of the unpaid premiums which was received by Consumer\u2019s on May 17, 1973. Thereafter the defendant, Consumer\u2019s, sent to the defendant General on May 17, 1973 a request for reinstatement which was received by the defendant General, after expiration of the grace period. G.L. c. 90, \u00a734K. G.L. c. 255C, \u00a731. The defendant, General, on or about August 15, 1973 sent to the defendant, Consumer\u2019s, the amount of unearned premium totalling $185.55. This money Consumer\u2019s accepted under a power of attorney granted it by the plaintiff. Subsequent to the acceptance, on October 29, 1973, the plaintiff was involved in an accident whereby his motor vehicle was damaged in the amount of $1,106.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff sought reimbursement for his damage from defendant, General, and was then notified for the first time that his policy of insurance had never been reinstated. On November 7, 1973 the plaintiff received a check representing unearned premium from defendant, Consumer\u2019s, in the amount of $186.55 which the plaintiff cashed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201cOn November 27, 1974, the Registry of Motor Vehicles ruled that Notice of Cancellation dated May 11, 1973 was incorrect because notice was sent in the name of Dominic Paparo whereas application read Domenic L. Paparo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\"Original notice from Registry dated May 11, 1973 reads Dominic Paparo a/o Dominic L. Paparo. Both original notice and invalidation notice of Registry purport to refer to vehicle bearing Mass. Reg. No. 2H0497, which is the registration number of the vehicle involved in the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\"I find that by virtue of the contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant Consumer\u2019s, the defendant was obligated either to secure the reinstatement of the insurance coverage on the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle or, in the alternative, to notify the plaintiff seasonably that he was without insurance coverage. This obligation the defendant breached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The court found for the plaintiff [against Consumer\u2019s] on Count II of his declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The defendant Consumer\u2019s claims to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s rulings on requests numbered <em>4, 6 </em>and <em>9.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The requests for rulings raise the following three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">(1) Whether at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s loss, his policy of insurance issued by General, was in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">(2) Whether the determination by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that a notice of cancellation is not in compliance with the provisions of G.L. c. 175, sec. 113A(2) invalidated such a notice of cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">(3) Whether the acceptance and cashing of a check for a return premium by the plaintiff, estopped him from bringing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\"> The trial justice was right in finding that the plaintiff\u2019s policy of insurance issued by General was cancelled on May 11, 1973 and was not in full force and effect at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>G.L. c. 90, \u00a734-0 made effective January 1, 1972 provided for compulsory property protection for all registered motor vehicles in the Commonwealth, thereby making the requirements prescribed by G.L. c. 175, \u00a7113A(2) applicable to the method of cancellation in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">G.L. c. 175, \u00a7113A(2) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">\"that said cancellation shall not become effective unless the company or an insurance premium finance agency duly licensed under the provision of chapter two hundred and fifty-five C has, immediately upon the intended effective date of the cancellation of the policy, whether proposed by the company or by the insured, forwarded to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles a notice, in such form as he may prescribe, containing such information to apprise the registrar of the particular motor vehicle registration on which the insurance is intended to be cancelled.\u201d The requirement that notice be given in such form as the Registrar of Motor Vehicles may prescribe is to make possible that he gets the information he requires so that he is informed that the insurance on a particular automobile registration is intended to be cancelled. <em>Gulesian v. Senibaldi, </em>289 Mass. 384, 387 (1935).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The defendant Consumer\u2019s relies on the <em>Gulesian case </em>in support of its argument that the notice of cancellation was not effective in the instant case. The case at bar is distinguishable from that case. In that case a notice of a proposed cancellation of a policy of compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance, sent to the insured and to the Registry of Motor Vehicles by the insurer, was held not to satisfy the requirements of G.L. c. 175, \u00a7113A(2) and not to have been effective to cancel the policy, in that the last name of the insured in the policy was \"Senibaldi\u201d, while the name stated in the notice was \"Senebaldi\u201d and the registration number of the motor vehicle covered by the policy was not stated in the notice. The court said at page 387: \"the necessity of giving the name accurately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>spelled is apparent in the absence of giving the registration number.\u201d From its language the court indicated that the notice of cancellation required by the statute would have been proper had the registration number been given in spite of the misspelling of the last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In the case before us, the notice of cancellation contained the correct motor vehicle registration number; the specific reason for cancellation; the name of the insurer; the effective date of cancellation; the date of the notice and the correctly spelled last name and address of. the assured. While the first name of the assured was misspelled in the notice; i.e. Domenic was spelled Dominic, and the name did not conform to the registry records in that the middle initial was omitted and did not contain the policy number, we think that the requirements of the statute have been met and the notice contained sufficient information to apprise the Registrar of the particular motor vehicle registration on which the insurance company intended to cancel the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We agree with the trial justice in his disposition of request number 6 which asked the court to rule that \u201cthe determination by the registrar that a notice of cancellation is not in compliance with the provisions of G.L. c. 175, \u00a7113A(2), invalidates such a notice of cancellation\u201d. After granting the request, the justice added, \u201cI find, however, that the notice of cancellation did comply with the provisions of the General Laws relating to cancellation of registration\u201d. It is apparent from the justice\u2019s ruling of this request that he meant that the determination made by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles on the notice of cancellation was binding only on the Registry of Motor Vehicles and not on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>court. In the matter before the court, the question of whether a notice of cancellation complied with the provisions of the statute raised a question of law and was properly a function of the court to determine. <em>Hawes Electric Co. v. Angell, </em>332 Mass. 190, 192 Mass. 190, 192 (1955); <em>Newton Constr. Co. v. West &amp; South Water Supply District, </em>326 Mass. 171, 176 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"> The court was not bound by the decision of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles and could make its own determination after finding facts and applying the law. This it did and found that the notice of cancellation met the requirements of G.L. c. 175, \u00a7113A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> The court acted properly in denying request number 9. The acceptance and cashing of the check representing a return premium did not estop the plaintiff from bringing this action. There was no evidence reported that the plaintiff\u2019s action in cashing the check induced the defendant to do anything different than it would have done, to its detriment, and thus the doctrine of estoppel is not applicable. <em>McLearn v. Hill, </em>276 Mass. 519, 524 (1931); <em>DeSisto\u2019s Case, </em>351 Mass. 348 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> Acceptance and cashing of a check which is not offered in satisfaction of a disputed claim, as this check was not, does not amount to a compromise and settlement. <em>Dedham Lumber Co. v. Hartung, </em>278 Mass. 488 (1932). At the time the plaintiff cashed the check he had already commenced an action against Consumer\u2019s and General and the matter was pending in court. There was no error by the trial justice when he considered the check as <em>pro tanto </em>payment and deducted it from the total damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of his accident. Report dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\"> Actually May 11, 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-11\"> \u201c4.
