Brien, Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London (Lloyd\u2019s) from a judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs Rena, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>and Peter Tyris and third-party defendants George Tyris, Michael Tyris and Peter Tyris (collectively \u201cTyris\u201d or \u201cthe Tyris parties\u201d). The judgment held Tyris entitled to payment on a fire insurance policy issued by Lloyd\u2019s covering property leased by Tyris from the owner, plaintiff-intervenor Forked River House, Inc. The trial judge determined that Lloyd\u2019s had failed to prove its arson defense to the Tyris parties\u2019 declaratory action for coverage and therefore awarded judgment to Tyris on the policy. Because the arson defense was submitted to the jury and the jury found that Lloyd\u2019s did prove that the Tyris brothers procured someone to set the fire, we reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of Lloyd\u2019s on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In the second part of this opinion, we address the appeal of Forked River House from a judgment in favor of defendant Sheldon, Matiack, Knipe Associates, Inc. (\u201cMatlack\u201d), the insurance broker who placed the policy, for failure to name Forked River as an insured on the Tyris fire insurance policy. At the close of all the evidence, the court dismissed Forked River\u2019s negligence claim. We affirm, although our reasons differ from those of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The issues in the appeals before us arise out of a fire on April 26, 1992, at a bar and restaurant known as the Forked River House, in Forked River, New Jersey. The fire broke out after 4 a.m. in the morning, the restaurant and bar having closed at about 2:30 that night. At the time, the restaurant was owned and operated by Tyris. However, the real estate was owned by an unrelated corporation, Forked River House, Inc., whose principal was George Mackres. Tyris had purchased the business from Mackres in 1978, signing a promissory note for a substantial portion of the purchase price and entering into a long-term lease on the premises. In 1985 Tyris sold the business and assigned the lease to a third-party. However, when that party was unable to pay under the terms of the sale, the business reverted to Tyris along with the lease. Tyris, either directly in the name of two of the brothers or through a newly-formed corporation named Rena, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Inc., continued to operate the restaurant business. However, the Tyris parties fell behind in their payments on the note as well as the lease. On March 17, 1992, Mackres and Tyris entered into a new agreement incorporating the Tyris parties\u2019 obligations under the 1978 promissory note and lease between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">When the insurance coverage case was tried, the evidence before the jury included the following. The insurance policy issued by Lloyd\u2019s to Tyris covered fire damage to the building in the face amount of $500,000 for the building and $100,000 for the contents. The policy, however, included an exclusion in the event of damage resulting from \u201cany fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act done by or at the instigation of any insured, partner or joint adventurer in or of any insured, an officer, director or trustee of any insured____\u201d It is undisputed that if the fire was intentionally caused by or at the direction of any of the Tyris parties, the resulting damage would not be covered under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The jury heard undisputed evidence that an accelerant was used to spread the fire, and that the fire had been set intentionally. In addition, the jury heard testimony that Peter Tyris was the last one out of the restaurant that night, that he took another employee home, and that when he returned, the restaurant was on fire. Two persons who lived on the premises, one the mother of the Tyris brothers and the other a cook in the restaurant, died in the fire. Local fire officials and the county prosecutor\u2019s office undertook an arson investigation. Lloyd\u2019s began its own investigation as well. There was substantial evidence that the Tyris brothers were actively engaged in several businesses, each of which had serious financial problems in the months before the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The jury also heard testimony from an employee at another restaurant owned by the Tyris brothers in Cherry Hill. The employee, Stephan Kotzker, testified that about six weeks before the fire, George Tyris asked him if he knew anyone who could help <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>with \u201cJewish lightening\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at his place at the shore. Kotzker ended the conversation and immediately repeated it to another employee, Ronald Banks. Banks testified at the trial, corroborating that Kotzker had told him of George Tyris\u2019s request. Kotzker also testified that shortly after the fire he heard Michael Tyris, in the presence of George and Peter at one of their restaurants, say \u201cOh my God my mother wasn\u2019t suppose [sic] to be there. Peter should have had them out of there. Oh, I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The parties stipulated that the damage caused by the fire exceeded the face amount of the policy, and that if Lloyd\u2019s was liable, the full $500,000 would be payable for the structure and $100,000 for the contents. There was also testimony offered both by Tyris and Mackres that the Tyris brothers did not set the fire, denied any involvement in the fire, were not in financial difficulty, had no motive to cause the fire, and that Kotzker\u2019s testimony was unreliable and untrue. Thus the facts surrounding the Tyris parties\u2019 responsibility for the fire, either by setting it themselves or by obtaining someone else to set the fire, were very much in dispute at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">At the close of all the evidence, and despite the disputed state of the evidence, the trial judge granted Tyris\u2019s <em>R. </em>4:40-1 motion for judgment against Lloyd\u2019s on the arson defense. The judge initially questioned whether Lloyd\u2019s was bound by the testimony of its adjuster, who had expressed the belief that Peter Tyris himself set the fire, to the exclusion of the alternate theory that one or more of the Tyris brothers arranged for someone else to set the fire. The judge does not appear to have ruled on this basis, and the record clearly reflects that throughout the pretrial and trial of this matter, Lloyd\u2019s maintained either that one of the Tyris brothers himself set the fire or that one or more of them arranged for the fire to be set.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>However, in granting the motion against Lloyd\u2019s, the trial judge improperly weighed the credibility of the Kotzker testimony. Tyris had objected to Kotzker\u2019s testimony about the Michael Tyris statement on the ground of surprise. Kotzker had been named in answer to interrogatories as a person with relevant knowledge. To the extent that the specific statement attributed to Michael Tyris had not been revealed in discovery, any prejudice was dispelled when the judge gave Tyris the opportunity to depose Kotzker before he testified in front of the jury. Tyris did not take his deposition, and after a hearing pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104, Kotzker was permitted to testify. Nevertheless, in ruling on the motion for judgment, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">This court had the opportunity to observe this witness during the Rule 104 hearing out of the presence of the jury and his contradictory statements presented to the jury. While the inconsistency was alluded to during the trial, the jurors did not have the opportunity to observe his demeanor during the Rule 104 hearing and compare it to that during the trial before the jury. This court had the unusual ability to make that observation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Only if all of the testimony against Tyris had been incredible, such that reasonable minds could not differ, would a motion for judgment have been warranted. That was hardly the case here, and it was error to weigh the evidence as the judge did.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">On a motion for judgment under <em>R. </em>4:40-1, the standard is the same as that for determining a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under <em>R. </em>4:40-2, or for determining a motion for involuntary dismissal under <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b). The court must accept as true all evidence supporting the position of the non-moving party, according that party the benefit of all legitimate inferences that can be deduced from such evidence. If reasonable minds could differ, the court must deny the motion. <em>See Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 535-36, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). In light of the procedural events in this case, it must be emphasized that <em>R. </em>4:40-2(a) specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">The court may reserve decision on a motion for judgment made at the close of all the evidence, submit the case to the jury and then decide the motion either before or within 10 days after the verdict, or if no verdict is returned, within 10 days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the jury\u2019s discharge. The court may enter judgment in accordance with the motion or in the interest of justice order a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">If the trial judge had substantial doubts about the sufficiency of the credible evidence, reserving decision would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">With respect to the substantive elements of arson as a defense to a civil claim for fire insurance coverage, the burden of proof upon the insurance company is to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, circumstantial or direct, \u201cthat plaintiff either set fire to the braidings or caused such to be done.\u201d <em>Crossley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>139 <em>MichApp. </em>464, 362 <em>N.W.2d </em>760, 762 (1984). The Michigan Court of Appeals in <em>Crossley </em>noted that judgment rendered by the court rather than by a jury is \u201cespecially suspect where motive and intent are at issue, or where the credibility of a witness or deponent is crucial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). That observation is equally applicable here, where the arson defense depends on circumstantial evidence and turns entirely on the credibility of such evidence. <em>See, e.g., Great American Ins. Co. v. K. &amp; W. Log, Inc. </em>22 <em>Wash.App. </em>468, 591 P.2d 457, 459-60 (1979) (holding that the arson defense can be proved by a preponderance of entirely circumstantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">This court has previously addressed the nature of the arson defense and the quality of the evidence necessary to support that defense. <em>See Italian Fisherman, Inc. v. Commercial Union Assurance Co., </em>215 <em>N. J.Super. </em>278, 521 A.2d 912 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>152, 526 A.2d 211 (1987); <em>Olesak v. Central Mutual Ins. Co., </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 160, 521 A.2d 849 (App.Div. 1987) (\u201cThe arson defense is most accurately viewed as an allegation that the insured purposely created the loss and therefore should not benefit from it.\u201d) <em>See also Alexander v. Tennessee Farmers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>905 S.W.2d 177, 179 (Tenn.Ct.App.1995) (\u201cTo succeed on a defense of arson, an insurance company must show by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that the loss was due to a fire of incendiary origin, (2) that the insured had an opportunity to set the fire, and (3) that he had a motive to do so.\u201d) It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>matters not whether the jury determines that the insured personally set the fire or did so through the acts of another. The key is that the insured caused the fire to be set. <em>See Don Burton, Inc. v. Aetna Life and Cas. Co., </em>575 F.2d 702 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Crossley, supra, </em>362 N.W.2d at 762. In <em>Don Burton, </em>the Ninth Circuit explicitly rejected \u201cthe notion that a defense of arson can be defeated by a failure to prove that the insured himself was the incendiarist____\u201d 575 F.2d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">After granting judgment against Lloyd\u2019s, the judge decided to submit the arson issue to the jury in two questions, asking first whether the Tyris brothers set the fire, and if not, whether they procured someone else to do so. The judge explained that in case the court\u2019s judgment of dismissal was in error, the case would not have to be retried. In that respect, the judge\u2019s decision was sound, and the jury was thereafter fully and correctly charged on the arson defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Plaintiff made a claim under the policy and some \u2014 Plaintiffs Tyris brothers \u2014 made a claim under the policy. And some months later, the Defendant insurance company refused to [make] payment claiming that the Tyris brothers conspired to set the fire to <em>the </em>Forked River House, which was accomplished <em>by </em>Peter Tyris or someone procured by the Plaintiff to commit arson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">That as a result of their action, that is, the actions of the Tyris brothers or the person procured by them, the Forked River House burned to the ground and resulted in the deaths of two people, one of whom was Kiki Tyris, the mother of the Tyris brothers, the other, as I understand it, was a baker on the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">Defendant has alleged that it\u2019s not liable to Plaintiff Tyris brothers because they arranged for or instigated the fire which damaged the property. On this issue, it is the insurance company\u2019s burden to prove to you by a preponderance of the evidence that the fire was set or caused to be set by Plaintiff. And there again, we\u2019re talking about the Tyris brothers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">You must be convinced from the evidence that either the Plaintiffs set fire to the premises or that it was done through their procurement or connivance. Any finding that the Plaintiffs intentionally set this fire must not rest on speculation or conjecture but must be based on logical deduction from the facts proven by the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>It is proper for you to consider circumstantial evidence to support your finding of arson by the Plaintiff. However, conjecture, guess, or suspicion standing alone are not sufficient for you to prove that they set the fire or that they procured others to set the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">In order to conclude that the insured caused or procured the fire, you the jury must believe by a preponderance or the greater weight of the evidence that one, that the fire was a result of arson, two, the insured had ample motive, and three, the insured had an opportunity to start the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">If you determine the fire was deliberately and intentionally set, you must next then determine whether or not the Plaintiffs in this case were responsible for the setting of this fire. Responsibility for the setting of the fire would include not only the situation where Plaintiffs actually set the fire themselves, but would also include the situation where the fire was set by someone else but with the knowledge, consent, and approval of the Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">In this case, Defendant Lloyd\u2019s claim that the fire that damaged the subject premises and its contents was caused willfully and maliciously by the Plaintiffs or by others with their knowledge, connivance, consent, or approval, and with the intention of getting the money for the policy from Lloyd\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">In order for Defendant Lloyd\u2019s Underwriters to prevail on the defense of arson, Lloyd\u2019s must prove to you by a preponderance of the evidence that the fire was intentionally set by or at the direction of the Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The jury answered three special interrogatories as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">1. Did defendant Lloyd\u2019s prove that Peter, Michael or George Tyris set the fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">Yes \u2014 No_X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">If no, go to next question. If yes, cease your deliberations and advise the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">2. Did defendant Lloyd\u2019s prove that the Tyris brothers procured someone to set the fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">Yes X No\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">Regardless of your answer go to question 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">3. Have plaintiffs proved defendant Lloyds exercised bad faith in refusing to pay the claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-17\">Yes \u2014 No_X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-18\">If your answer is no, cease your deliberations and advise the court. If your answer is yes, go to the next question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Thus the jury found that Lloyd\u2019s did not prove that any of the Tyris brothers himself set the fire, but did prove that the Tyris brothers procured someone else to set the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Lloyd\u2019s filed a post-trial motion for reconsideration of the judgment, which was denied. In a written opinion incorporating and reiterating the reasons given on the record for the decision to grant judgment to Tyris on the coverage issue, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">... there was insufficient evidence presented by [Lloyd\u2019s] which, taking all the facts and inferences and considering them most favorably to the defendant that a jury would find that the plaintiff Tyris brothers collectively or individually procured someone other than themselves to set fire to the Forked River House.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">It is thus clear that the judge\u2019s weighing of the Kotzker testimony impacted the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Even after granting judgment to Tyris, the judge had the opportunity to correct the error by granting the motion for reconsideration in light of the jury\u2019s answers to the special interrogatories. The jury after all was totally unaware of the judge\u2019s ruling, and the judge had given the correct jury instructions with respect to the arson defense. There was no prejudice occasioned by the proceedings up to that point, and the jury\u2019s verdict could have been molded promptly into the correct judgment. <em>See Almog v. Israel Travel Advisory Service, Inc., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 159-60, 689 A.2d 158 (App.Div.) <em>certif. granted, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>463, 700 A.2d 876 (1997), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>361, 704 A.2d 1297 (1998), where during jury deliberations, the trial judge erroneously concluded that Israeli law applied and that, because Israeli law allowed no jury, he would render a bench verdict. Because the judge did not interfere with the jury\u2019s deliberations, did not inform the jury of his actions, and allowed the jury to reach its own verdict, we concluded that the jury verdict should be deemed to constitute the final judgment. In <em>Almog </em>we addressed the question whether a so-called advisory jury\u2019s verdict \u201cis ever susceptible of elevation as the judgment in the cause,\u201d and recognized that the usual reasons for declining to do so were not present. <em>Id. </em>at 159-60, 689 A.2d 158. Those circumstances are equally absent here. Specifically, all parties tried the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>jury. Because the judge\u2019s decision to grant the motion came after the entire case had been presented, the decision could not have affected trial strategy in any way. Just as in <em>Almog,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">The lawyers proceeded tactically on the understanding that this was a jury trial, as did the court. Nor did the jurors have any inkling during their deliberations that their status was anything but that of ultimate finders of the facts. That was what the judge had told them, and that is how they proceeded____ Thus, nothing to the contrary said by the trial judge entered into or affected or tainted the way the lawyers tried the case to the jury or the way the jury deliberated. In effect, this jury never functioned as or was constituted or denominated as an advisory jury. Consequently, there is no prejudice we can perceive in accepting the jury\u2019s fact-finding as the final verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 160, 689 A.2d 158.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Moreover, the judge specifically explained that the arson question would be submitted to the jury to avoid the potential for a retrial in the event this court reversed the judgment for Tyris. No one objected to that procedure at the trial, and everyone understood that in the event of a reversal the jury\u2019s verdict would control, as it should.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">We therefore reverse the judgment for Tyris and against Lloyd\u2019s and remand for entry of judgment in favor of Lloyd\u2019s with respect to coverage for this fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Forked River appeals the judgment dismissing its claims against Matlack. Forked River\u2019s complaint alleges negligence against Matlack,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in that Matlack was a licensed insurance broker holding itself out as having the skill and knowledge of a professional in the field; that Matlack was engaged by Tyris to obtain fire and extended coverage for the premises \u201cincluding coverage, as an additional insured\u201d for Forked River; that Matlack \u201cknew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>or should have known of the necessity of including Forked River House, Inc. as the owner of the premises as an additional insured on the policy of insurance, and ... owed a duty of care to Forked River ... to exercise reasonable skill, care and diligence in securing the insurance policies in question, together with the appropriate coverages;\u201d that Matlack failed to include Forked River \u201cas a named additional insured;\u201d and that as a result, Lloyd\u2019s refused to pay Forked River under the policy. We are satisfied that judgment in favor of Matlack must be affirmed, although for different reasons than those expressed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Both parties to this appeal argue the proximate cause issue in terms of whether Forked River would or could have had any status greater than a \u201closs payee\u201d had Matlack complied with a request to \u201cname\u201d or \u201cput\u201d Forked River on the policy. As we said in <em>Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Kahlaid, Inc., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 497, 489 A.2d 1231 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>300, 501 A.2d 958 (1985)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">A loss payee is not an insured but only \u201ca mere appointee [of the insured] who may not recover if the insured has breached any provision of the policy which would prevent recovery by him.\u201d <em>Highway Trailer Co. v. Donna Motor Lines, Inc., </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>442, 447, 217 A.2d 617 <em>cert. den., </em>385 <em>U.S. </em>834, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>77, 17 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>68 (1966). If the loss is not payable to the insured, it is not payable to the loss payee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The proximate cause issue actually posed by this case is whether Forked River, even if it had been named as an insured on, the policy, could have collected the policy once Tyris\u2019 fraud by way of arson had been proved. Neither the parties nor the judge correctly identified that issue, which is resolved against Forked River by the insurance contract itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The judge dismissed Forked River\u2019s claim for lack of expert testimony to dispute Matlack\u2019s expert testimony with respect to loss payee status and the absence of proximate cause. In finding a lack of proof of proximate cause, the judge relied upon Michael Matlack\u2019s trial testimony that even if Forked River had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>named as an \u201cadditional insured\u201d on the policy, its status would have been no higher than that of a \u201closs payee\u201d and would therefore have been subject to the arson defense. In light of our decision today with respect to the arson defense, loss payee status clearly would not have protected Forked River.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The judge also relied on a misperception that Matlack\u2019s retained expert, John T. Klagholz, concurred in Michael Matlack\u2019s opinion. In fact Klagholz admitted on cross-examination that a landlord can be a named insured and not merely a loss payee on a tenant\u2019s policy. Although Forked River did not offer testimony, expert or otherwise, in support of the proposition that it could have been separately named as an insured on the Lloyd\u2019s policy, or more importantly, that as an innocent named insured its claim for coverage would not have been defeated by the co-insured\u2019s arson, Matlack\u2019s own expert, Klagholz, supplied the testimony the judge found lacking in plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Matlack originally moved for dismissal at the conclusion of Forked River\u2019s case pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:37 \u2014 2(b), arguing that (1) Forked River did not present expert testimony that Matlack owed any duty to inquire into the ownership of the restaurant premises; and (2) Forked River could not establish that a breach of such a duty, if it existed at all, was a proximate cause of injury because Forked River could only have been named as a loss payee. The judge rejected the first argument, saying \u201cwith respect to the duty in general, I think it was his duty to ascertain the interest of the parties.\u201d However, the judge also ruled \u201cwith the exception of that one issue as to loss payee or [additional insured], I\u2019m going to reserve on that____\u201d The Rules of Court do not permit reserving decision on a motion for judgment at the end of plaintiffs case, but only at the end of all the evidence. <em>R. </em>4:40-2(a). <em>See Joseph Hilton &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Evans, </em>201 <em>N. J.Super. </em>156, 165-66, 492 A.2d 1062 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>326, 501 A.2d 977 (1985); <em>Castro v. Helmsley Spear, Inc., </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>160, 375 A.2d 274 (App.Div.1977); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2 on <em>R. </em>4:37-2 (1998). The purported reservation must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>be deemed a denial. <em>Joseph Hilton, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 166, 492 A.2d 1062; <em>Castro, supra, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 164,375 A.2d 274. The judge explicitly chose to hear the testimony of Matlack\u2019s expert. Once defendant\u2019s evidence was heard, the court had to consider <em>all </em>the evidence supporting Forked River\u2019s claim, as the party resisting the motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Klagholz provided sufficient testimony, when combined with the policy application described by Michael Matlack, that Forked River could have been an additional named insured on the policy. The policy application itself included a space under \u201capplicant information\u201d for the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">Name <em>(first Named Insured &amp; Other Named Insureds)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">LEmphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">On direct examination, Klagholz testified that based on his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZD\">understanding of the facts in this case, both in terms of the testimony, as well as the objective documents, indicate that after the fact, after the fire, what was requested or would have been requested was loss payee. That would be perfectly appropriate and consistent with the designation of an additional interest under a property policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">Q. Hypothetically speaking, if somebody had said additional insured \u2014 Mr. Tyris had said additional insured, would your opinion change with respect to the landlord?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">A. No, because in practice what ordinarily happens is an additional insured, for purposes of a property insurance policy, is not a usual or may be even relevant term. There may be additional named insureds. There may be named insureds, you know, that are on the policy, a whole bunch of entities designated there. But additional insured is a liability term not a property term, so that in the completion of this application for property insurance, additional interest is the relevant term, and that would, based on the documents here, as I\u2019ve mentioned, be a loss payee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">On cross-examination, however, Klagholz clearly admitted that a landlord could be a \u201cnamed insured\u201d on a tenant\u2019s casualty policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQb\">Q. So both of those individuals, the owner as the landlord, and the tenant as a tenant, had the right as an insured to have an insurable interest and be named as a named insured on the policy. Isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">A. As a named insured. Yes. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">Q. And, as a matter of fact, if we look at DS-2 which is the commercial application, there\u2019s a reference on here on that form under applicant information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>It says quote on the printed form, \u201cName.\u201d \u201cFirst named insured,\u201d and \u201cOther named insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">Q. And that category on the form is there so that the applicant can give the names of anyone who would have an interest in the property. Is that correct? A. Anyone who has an interest in the property and is intended to be named on the policy. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Q. But, Mr. Klagholz, if I\u2019m the owner I could insist that I wanted to be named as a named insured, and not as a loss payee. Couldn\u2019t I?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In dismissing Forked River\u2019s claim against Matlack, the judge stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">We have now had 2 experts testify that in a situation such as this he would only be considered as a loss payee. There being no expert testimony to the contrary, and since he would be standing in the shoes, I\u2019m going to grant his motion for an involuntary dismissal based on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Thus the dismissal was based upon an inaccurate perception of Klagholz\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">For purposes of our analysis, we assume that Matlack\u2019s failure to recognize that his client\u2019s landlord could be a \u201cnamed insured\u201d established his failure to meet a \u201cgeneral level of competence.\u201d <em>See Bates v. Gambino, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>219, 225, 370 A.2d 10 (1977) (it is a principle of negligence law that \u201cthere exists a fixed standard of conduct irrespective of the actual conduct of others\u201d). The Court in <em>Bates </em>held that plaintiff was not required to prove \u201cany conceptualized standard of professional competence\u201d where the defendant insurance broker admitted he was unaware of the regulation requiring temporary fire insurance coverage to be made available under the circumstances in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 370 A.2d 10. If lack of expert testimony that Forked River could have been named as an additional insured were the only basis for the dismissal, we would be constrained to reverse. But the difference between a loss-payee and an additional named insured is actually of no significance here. Our conclusion that Matlack\u2019s failure to name Forked River on the policy did not cause Forked River\u2019s lack of coverage is based upon the policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In <em>Howell v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 355-56, 327 A.2d 240 (App.Div.1974), we held that arson by one spouse did not bar recovery by the innocent spouse under a general fraud exclusion. We then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">With respect to a fire insurance policy covering the interests of more than one insured, however, <em>there is much to commend the view that, unless the terms thereof are plainly to the contrary and in some fashion clearly called to the attention of the insureds, </em>the obligation of the carrier should be considered several as to each person insured, and the fraud or misconduct of one insured should not bar recovery by the innocent co-insureds to the extent of their respective interests in the property involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Indeed, coverage is determined by the terms of the insurance contract, and interpreting the contract is a legal question for the court. <em>Adron, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 473, 679 A.2d 160 (App.Div.1996) (\u201c[t]he interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law for the court to determine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The language of the Lloyd\u2019s policy exclusion was plain. It excluded coverage for damage resulting from \u201cany fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act done by or at the instigation of <em>any insured </em>____\u201d (emphasis added). There is no ambiguity. The exclusion applies to any insured once any other insured \u2014 in this case, the Tyris brothers \u2014 is found to have procured someone to set the fire that destroyed the restaurant. Forked River therefore could not prove that it would have recovered as an innocent insured even if it had been a \u201cnamed insured\u201d on the policy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag8\">An increasing number of courts, however, hold that the right of innocent coinsureds to recover after fraud or misrepresentation by an insured is based upon the language of the insurance policy. Thus, a provision voiding a policy for willful and fraudulent misrepresentation by \u201cthe insured\u201d before or after a loss voids the policy only for the person(s) responsible for the fraud and not for innocent coinsureds. On the other hand, a provision voiding a policy for fraud or misrepresentation by \u201cany insured\u201d expresses an intent to create joint obligations, therefore prohibits recovery by innocent eoinsureds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">[5A John Alan Appleman and Jean Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 3594 (Supp.1997) (footnotes omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-13\"><em>See also </em>5 Appleman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3113 (1970 and Supp.1997); 10A <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 42:680 (2nd rev. ed.1982 and Supp.1997); 18 <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 74:663 (2nd rev. ed.1983 and Supp.1997); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Note, <em>Property Insurance and the Innocent Co-Insured: Was It All Pay and No Gain for the Innocent Co-Insured? </em>43 <em>Drake L.Rev. </em>893, 899-902, 904 (1995); Larry D.

Contrary to Matlack\u2019s contention both at trial and on appeal, the trial judge correctly, though implicitly, found that Matlack owed a duty to Forked River once Matlack knew, or should have known, that Forked River was the owner of the property and that Tyris had a lease obligation to provide a casualty policy naming Forked River. Having found that Mat-lack\u2019s breach of that duty was not the proximate cause of harm to Forked River, we have considered whether Matlack\u2019s duty extended any further. We conclude it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Whether a professional owes a duty of care to another, and the scope of such duty, are legal questions that implicate \u201cbasic fairness under all of the circumstances in light of considerations of public policy.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 439, 625 A.2d 1110 (1993). \u201cThe principle that duty is defined not by the contractual relationship between the parties but by considerations of foreseeability and fairness is equally applicable in the insurance context.\u201d <em>Carter Lincoln-Mercury.

In holding an insurance broker liable to his client\u2019s father for failure to procure a liability policy that would cover the father, whom the broker should have known the client reasonably expected to be covered, the Court described the duty of an insurance broker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">One who holds himself out to the public as an insurance broker is required to have the degree of skill and knowledge requisite to the calling. When engaged by a member of the public to obtain insurance, the law holds him to the exercise of good faith and reasonable skill, care and diligence in the execution of the commission. He is expected to possess reasonable knowledge of the types of policies, their different terms, and the coverage available in the area in which his principal seeks to be protected. If he neglects to procure the insurance or if the policy is void or materially deficient or does not provide the coverage he undertook to supply, because of his failure to exercise the requisite skill or diligence, he becomes liable to his principal for the loss sustained thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">Thus, an insurance broker, in dealing with his clients, ordinarily invites them to rely upon his expertise in procuring insurance that best suits their requirements. It is not necessary for the client in order to establish a breach of duty to prove that he laid out for the broker the elements of a contract of insurance. It is sufficient to show that he authorized procurement of the insurance needed to cover the risks indicated and that the broker agreed to do so but failed or neglected to perform his duty. The terms of the contract to procure the insurance, the scope of the risk and subject matter to be covered, may be found by implication. The principal does not sue on a contract of insurance; he seeks recovery for the loss occasioned by the failure to procure such a contract or such a valid contract. Moreover, if the broker agrees to obtain or to try to obtain the coverage he knows or should know the principal seeks, and he finds that he cannot procure it, he is bound to notify his principal of that fact with reasonable dispatch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">[42 <em>N.J. </em>at 476-77,201 A.2d 561 (citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In <em>Carter Lincoln-Mercury, </em>the Supreme Court teaches that the duty described in <em>Rider </em>is not limited to potential third party claimants on the insured\u2019s liability coverage, but may extend as well to foreseeable victims on first party casualty losses. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Court there said \u201c[t]he duty owed to a loss-payee derives from the duty owed to an insured.\u201d 135 <em>N.J. </em>at 204, 638 A.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The 1978 lease between Forked River and the Tyris parties, later incorporated by reference into the March 17,1992 agreement between them, established Tyris\u2019 duty to Forked River with respect to insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">In addition to the monthly rental payments, the tenants shall pay fire and extended coverage insurance on the demised premises during the entire term of the lease in an amount equal to the full insurable value of all buildings and improvements thereon, but in no event less than the assessed value of said buildings and improvements for purposes of taxation, written by a reliable insurance company or companies authorized to do business in the State of New Jersey. <em>The policy shall be written in the names of and for the benefit of the Landlords and Tenants, as their respective interest [sic] may appear.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">There is no evidence, however, that Matlack was ever shown the lease. Nor does the record reveal any evidence, by expert testimony or otherwise, that the Lloyd\u2019s policy as written would not have satisfied the lease requirement, if Forked River had been identified as the landlord and named on the policy as an insured. Because we have concluded that Forked River would have been in no better position as a named co-insured on the policy, we consider whether Matlack owed a broader duty to Forked River.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Mackres\u2019 testimony was clear regarding his conversations with Lavene and/or Michael Matlack. Mackres testified that he repeatedly asked that Forked River be named on the Tyris policy as the landlord and property owner. Mackres and George Tyris both testified that they requested Martin Lavene to \u201cput\u201d Forked River on the policy as owner, and Chemical Bank as the mortgagee. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Mackres asked anything more of Lavene or Matlack. That is, he never asked for advice about the policy terms <em>or </em>the choice of <em>coverage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Assuming as we do that Matlack owed some duty to Forked River, we do not find a duty here to do more than name Forked River on the policy as requested. <em>See Weinisch v. Sawyer, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>333, 338, 587 A.2d 615 (1991), where the Court reinstated a verdict for the insurance company and its agent, based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>factual finding after a bench trial \u201cthat plaintiff did not rely on Sawyer as his insurance consultant to arrange for the highest coverages available; rather, plaintiff himself determined the extent of coverage and used Sawyer to implement the coverages plaintiff had selected.\u201d Nor do we find that Matlack had a duty on these facts to \u201ccall to the attention of [Forked River]\u201d the fraud exclusion in the Lloyd\u2019s policy, as we may have suggested in <em>Howell, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355-56, 327 A.2d 240. The situation here differs from cases such as <em>DiMarino v. Wishkin, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 479 A.2d 444 (App.Div.1984). There the evidence supported a finding that the broker \u201cundertook to procure the insurance,\u201d making .his \u201cfailure ... to produce the coverage <em>or else warn the client at once that coverage could not </em>be obtained [ ] a failure to exercise the requisite skill or diligence----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 479 A.2d 444 (emphasis added). By contrast, it is undisputed here that Matlack told Mackres he could not even put Forked River\u2019s name on the policy without instructions from Tyris, and Mackres knew he never received a policy naming Forked River as an insured. As we have already explained, naming Forked River would not have avoided the fraud exclusion in the Lloyd\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In <em>Carter Lincoln-Mercury </em>the broker\u2019s failure to properly investigate the financial stability of the insurance carrier was a dereliction of duty to the broker\u2019s insured and thus to the secured lender who was the loss-payee. Imposing a duty to warn the insured, if no stronger carrier offered the required coverage, is far different from imposing a duty to warn that the coverage provided would be void if -another insured were to commit fraud upon the insuror. We do not draw the boundaries of the \u201czone of a foreseeable injured party\u201d quite so broadly. <em>See Carter Lincoln-Mercury, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 198, 638 A.2d 1288 (quoting <em>Impex Agricultural Commodities Div. v. Parness Trucking Corp., </em>576 <em>F.Supp. </em>587, 591 (D.N.J.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We are satisfied that the result is not unfair or unjust under all the circumstances. Mackres himself was admittedly aware, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>least as of July or August 1991, that Tyris was in default on the lease, including the insurance provision of paragraph twenty-eight. In or about October 1991, a representative of Chemical Bank contacted Mackres requesting proof of insurance coverage. Indeed, Forked River\u2019s suit for possession filed in the Special Civil Part of Superior Court in the fall of 1991 alleged Tyris\u2019s default under paragraph twenty-eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Mackres clearly testified that he owned other properties; that he had insurance through another broker on those properties; that months before the fire, Peter Tyris showed him the declarations sheet for the Lloyd\u2019s policy, and he saw that neither Forked River nor Chemical Bank was named on the policy. Mackres also testified that he \u201cmade a conscious decision not to buy insurance ... because it was <em>their </em>obligation <em>to buy the </em>insurance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On cross examination, Mackres repeated his decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">Q. Didn\u2019t you also testify you didn\u2019t buy your own insurance because you had no money to buy insurance because they were behind on the rent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">A. Who had no money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">Q. You. Didn\u2019t you give that testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">A. When you say you don\u2019t have no money or you don\u2019t want to spend the money. It\u2019s something different. I can always go to the bank and borrow money, Mr. Leise, like I\u2019ve been doing for three and a half years to keep this place afloat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">Q. You\u2019ll agree, though, that that\u2019s the testimony you gave. You did not have money to buy your own insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-16\">A. What I meant was I didn\u2019t want to lay out the money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">We therefore conclude that as between Matlack and Mackres, <em>no </em>reasonable jury could find Matlack\u2019s negligence, if any, to be 50% or more responsible for Forked River\u2019s lack of coverage. <em>See N.J.S.A, </em>2A:15-5.1. Mackres\u2019s failure to consult his own insurance broker and to obtain separate coverage, after his repeated inability to obtain assurance of the coverage he claimed under the lease, satisfy us that a reasonable jury could reach no other conclusion but that Mackres\u2019 own conduct was more than 50% responsible for Forked River\u2019s lack of coverage. <em>See </em>Judge Baime\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Yun v. Ford Motor Co., </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>142, 160-61, 647 A.2d 841 (App.Div.1994), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>rev\u2019d, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>162, 669 A.2d 1378 (1996) (adopting the dissenting portion of Judge Baime\u2019s opinion). Recognizing that \u201c[o]rdinarily questions of proximate cause are left to the jury for its factual determination ... [and] [[likewise, questions of intervening cause are generally within the jury\u2019s domain,\u201d <em>id., </em>we nevertheless conclude that reasonable persons could not differ on these facts. Where the outcome is clear, there is no reason to put the parties or the court to the burden of a retrial. <em>See Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 541, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We affirm the judgment dismissing Forked River\u2019s claims against Matlack.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-14\"> The appeal in A-3311, which arose out of the same trial, was consolidated for oral argument. After argument, we were advised that the parties to A-3311 have reached an amicable settlement of all issues raised in that appeal. The appeal in A-3311 is therefore dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> The term Kotzker attributed to George Tyris was one Kotzker apparently understood to refer to intentionally setting a fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Matlack\u2019s notice of cross-appeal incorrectly refers to the \"ninth and tenth counts\" of Forked River\u2019s complaint. It is actually the twelfth count that alleges negligence against Matlack. The thirteenth count, also against Matlack, alleges third patty beneficiary status with respect to Matlack's \"contract\" with the Tyris parties. We find no need to separately consider such a claim, in light of our disposition of the negligence count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\"> There is no dispute that Lloyd\u2019s is a surplus lines carrier. It is therefore governed by the Surplus Lines Law, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>17:22-6.40 et. seq., and regulations enacted thereunder, <em>NJ.A.C. </em>11:1-34.1 et. seq., as well as the Commercial Insurance Deregulation Act of 1982, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>17.-29AA-1 et seq. We have confirmed with the Department of Insurance that Lloyd\u2019s was authorized to issue the policy in the form before us. See Letters of Steven M. Zalewitz, Assistant Chief Insurance Examiner, Surplus Lines Examining Officer dated March 4, 1998 and March 12, 1998, attached as Appendix A-l and A-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
