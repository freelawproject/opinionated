Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he had been denied due process of law because of the State\u2019s delay in investigating the crime and presenting the matter to the Grand Jury. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant subsequently pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to the armed robbery charge and the two counts of aggravated assault. The court sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea agreement to a twenty year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>term of imprisonment, with ten years of parole ineligibility, for armed robbery, and a concurrent ten year term, with three and one-third years of parole ineligibility, for the second degree aggravated assault. This sentence was made consecutive to a sentence defendant was already serving on another indictment. The court merged defendant\u2019s conviction for the fourth degree aggravated assault into his conviction for armed robbery. The court dismissed the remaining charges in accordance with the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On appeal, defendant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">I. SINCE DEFENDANT DEMONSTRATED THAT HE WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW BY THE STATE\u2019S FAILURE TO INDICT HIM FOR TWO AND ONE-HALF YEARS, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">A. The Prejudice to Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">B. Length and Reasons for Delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">II. THE IMPOSITION OF A TEN-YEAR PAROLE DISQUALIFIED ON COUNT ONE AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE SENTENCES ON THIS INDICTMENT RUN CONSECUTIVELY TO DEFENDANT\u2019S PRIOR SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">We reject defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm his conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">The crime occurred at a private residence in Jersey City on December 26, 1992. The two perpetrators, one of whom was wearing a mask, forced their way into the house, asked the owner where her safe was located, then ran upstairs and searched the bedrooms. While in the owner\u2019s bedroom, the masked perpetrator pulled her telephone from the wall. Continuing their search for the safe, they took the owner into her basement, where they encountered several other people playing cards. When one of them jumped up, the masked perpetrator shot him, inflicting non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>fatal wounds to his hand and head. The perpetrators then seized a strongbox containing $2,900 in cash and fled the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The police officers investigating the crime obtained a partial latent fingerprint from the telephone which the masked perpetrator had ripped out of the wall. However, the police simply placed the fingerprint in a file rather than sending it for analysis. Two years later, when the victim of the robbery inquired as to the status of the investigation of the crime, the police informed her that it was at a \u201cdead end\u201d because no one had identified the perpetrators. She then asked about the latent fingerprint. At this point the police found the fingerprint in the file and sent it for analysis, which resulted in a determination that the fingerprint on the telephone matched defendant\u2019s fingerprint. Four months later, defendant was indicted primarily based on this fingerprint identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In support of his motion to dismiss, defendant submitted his own affidavit which alleged that at the time of the crime, he was in the company of his brother Alvin Alexander, who subsequently died. Defendant also submitted a second affidavit which alleged that he had been in the victim\u2019s home on prior occasions and had used the telephone on which his fingerprint was found to call his cousin\u2019s beeper. In addition, defendant submitted a memorandum from the Bell Atlantic Company, which stated that his request for the victim\u2019s telephone records for 1992 could not be honored because such records are only retained for eighteen months. Based on this evidence, defendant argued that he had been severely prejudiced by the State\u2019s delay in completing its investigation and submitting the ease to the Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The trial court concluded that defendant had not been unduly prejudiced by the State\u2019s delay in completing its investigation. Therefore, it denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Because the delay upon which defendant based his motion to dismiss occurred before rather than after the return of the indictment and the right to a speedy trial protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution is not triggered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>until arrest or indictment, <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>783, 788-89, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2044, 2048, 52 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>752, 758 (1977); <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>307, 313-23, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>455, 463-64, 30 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 468, 474-80 (1971), defendant\u2019s motion was based solely on the due process guarantees of the federal and state constitutions. As we have previously noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">The due process inquiry focuses on whether the delay \u2018Violates those \u2018fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our sense of fair play and decency.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lovasco, [supra,] </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 790, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2049, 52 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 759 (citations omitted). Unlike analysis under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Speedy Trial Clause, which involves a four-factor balancing test and under which prejudice to the defense is presumed from an unusually long delay between indictment and trial, [citations omitted], claims under the Due Process Clause arising from undue preindictment or pre-arrest delay are measured by a far more rigorous standard. In order to prevail, a defendant must demonstrate \u201cboth that (1) there was no legitimate reason for the delay and (2) [defendant] was prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 515, 271 A.2d 905 (App.Div.1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\"><em>[State v.

Gouveia, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>180, 192, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2292, 2299, 81 <em>L.

Ed.2d </em>143, 151 (1983) (stating, also in dictum, that <em>Lovasco </em>holds that a due process challenge based on a delay in instituting criminal proceedings \u201c... can prevail only upon a showing that the Government delayed seeking an indictment in a deliberate attempt to gain an unfair tactical advantage over the defendant or in reckless disregard of its probable prejudicial impact upon the defendant\u2019s ability to defend against the charges.\u201d) Moreover, a majority of federal circuit courts of appeal have held that \u201cfor pre-indictment delay to violate the due process clause it must not only cause the accused substantial, actual prejudice, but <em>the delay must also have been intentionally undertaken by the government for the purpose of gaining some tactical </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>advantage over the accused in the contemplated prosecution or for some other impermissible, bad faith purpose.\u201d United States v.

Ed.2d </em>24 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">If pre-indictment delay can be found to violate the due process guarantees of the federal and state constitutions only if it is a product of intentional governmental action to gain some tactical advantage over the accused or for some other impermissible, bad faith purpose, the delay in this case would not provide a basis for the dismissal of defendant\u2019s indictment because defendant concedes that the delay was solely the result of the negligent failure of the police to check the fingerprint found on the telephone in the victim\u2019s bedroom. However, some federal circuit courts of appeal hold that pre-indictment delay may constitute a due process violation without a showing of improper prosecutorial motive. <em>See, e.g., Howell v. Barker, </em>904 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>1016, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>590, 112 <em>L.

Because the Supreme Court of the United States has never resolved the conflict among the circuit courts of appeali <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court of New Jersey has never addressed the issue, we assume for the purpose of this opinion, without deciding the issue, that a due process violation may be established by undue pre-indictment delay even though the cause of the delay is solely the negligence of the police or the prosecutor and proceed to the issue of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u201cThe law is well-settled that actual prejudice, not possible or presumed prejudice, is required to support a due process claim.\u201d <em>State v. Aguirre, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 133, 670 A.2d 583. \u201c[T]he defendant must show \u2018the delay caused \u201cactual and substantial prejudice\u2019 \u201d endangering his right to a fair trial and \u2018must present concrete evidence showing material harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 670 A.2d 583 (quoting <em>United States v. Anagnostou, </em>974 <em>F. </em>2d 939, 941-42 (7th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>1050, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>1943, 123 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 649 (1993)). \u201cVague assertions of lost witnesses, faded memories, or misplaced documents are insufficient to establish a due process violation from pre-indictment delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Beszborn, </em>21 F.3d 62, 67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>934, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 130 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 288 (1994). \u201cA mere loss of potential witnesses is insufficient absent a showing that their testimony \u2018would have actually aided the defense.\u201d <em>Crouch, supra, </em>84 F.3d at 1515 (quoting <em>Beszborn, supra, </em>21 F.3d at 66). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>fact, one federal circuit court has noted that \u201c[t]he task of establishing the requisite prejudice for a possible due process violation is \u2018so heavy\u201d that we have found only two cases since 1975 in which any circuit has upheld a due process claim [based on pre-indictment delay].\u201d <em>United States v. Huntley, </em>976 F.2d 1287, 1290 (9th Cir.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Barket, </em>530 F.2d 189 (8th Cir.1976) and <em>Howell v. Barker, supra, </em>904 F.2d 889). Thus, in <em>United States v. McGough, </em>510 F.2d 598, 604-05 (5th Cir.1975), the court held that \u201cthe death of some six potential defense witnesses\u201d faded to \u201cmeet the clear requirement of <em>[United States v. Marion, supra, </em>404 <em>US. </em>307, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>455, 30 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 468] that actual prejudice be shown\u201d because defendant\u2019s assertions concerning the testimony these witnesses could have given was \u201cspeculative.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Beszborn, supra, </em>21 F.3d at 66, the court concluded that the death of \u201cfive potentially material witnesses\u201d as well as the loss of alleged exculpatory documents was insufficient to establish actual prejudice. <em>See also United States v. Lovasco, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 789-90, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2048, 52 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 759; <em>United States v. West, </em>58 <em>F.3d </em>133, 136 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Applying the stringent standard of actual prejudice articulated in these cases, we conclude that the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Initially, we note that the record indicates defendant\u2019s brother was killed in August of 1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, it is highly improbable that defendant would have been tried before his brother\u2019s death even if he had been indicted shortly after the crime in December of 1992. Moreover, defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice resulting from the delay in completing the investigation is based solely on his allegations that he was with his brother at the time of the crime and that he made a call from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the telephone on which his fingerprints were found prior to the date of the crime. There is no direct evidence that defendant\u2019s brother would have recalled being with defendant at the time of the crime and would have been prepared to give such testimony at his trial. There is also no direct evidence that the telephone records would have reflected the call which defendant allegedly made from the victim\u2019s bedroom prior to the crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated and speculative allegations that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s delay in completing its investigation of the crime do not show the actual prejudice required to establish a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Finally, defendant\u2019s argument that his sentence was manifestly excessive is clearly without merit and does not require discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-13\"> In view of the prosecutor's apparent acquiescence in defense counsel's assertion at sentencing that defendant intended to appeal from the order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment, we reject the State's argument that defendant waived his right to appeal from this order by entering an unconditional guilty plea. <em>Cf. State v. Matos, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 15, 640 A.2d 1176 (App.Div. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> We note that a panel of the Fourth Circuit recently expressed disagreement with <em>Howell </em>but nevertheless followed that decision because \"only the <em>en banc </em>court may overrule a prior panel decision.\" <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Angelone, </em>94 F.3d 900, 905 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"><em> </em>In <em>Hoo v.
