Richard &amp; Son (\u201cthe employer\u201d or \u201crespondent\u201d) appeals from a partial permanent disability award of 25% for orthopedic and radial neuropathy \u201cresiduals of spiral fracture of the right humerus with scarification.\u201d It contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the injuries are not compensable. We agree and reverse the judgment of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Because we agree with the employer that the injury is not compensable even giving petitioner the benefit of all legitimate factual inferences favorable to his position, we incorporate petitioner\u2019s recitation of the facts adduced at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">On May 23, 1994, petitioner Nelson Quinones was employed by respondent P.C. Richard <em>&amp; </em>Sons as a stock person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">On the aforementioned date, petitioner reported to work at approximately 4:00 p.m. It was petitioner\u2019s intent to do his regular job which included replacement of stock items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">Petitioner was in the course of his usual job activities when his supervisor, [Ronald Landstrom], approached him. Petitioner\u2019s supervisor asked petitioner whether he wanted to arm wrestle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">Petitioner proceeded to arm wrestle with his supervisor. Petitioner sustained injury. The accident occurred during petitioner\u2019s working hours. At the time of the incident, the store was still open. The manager of the store was in the area, as were salespeople and customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">Petitioner had worked for respondent for approximately a year and one-half to two years. During that time, arm wrestling occurred on a regular basis. Many employees participated in this activity, including sales persons, stock persons, and managers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">Prior to the date of accident, petitioner had engaged in arm wrestling with his supervisor, Ronny. He had done so on approximately four to five times prior to the date of accident. Many employees arm wrestled and the competition at the store was like a tournament. Arm wrestling would occur both during breaks and during working hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">Many of the above facts were corroborated by respondent\u2019s assistant store manager, Ronald Landstrom, who admitted in his testimony at trial to having engaged in an arm wrestling match with petitioner on the date in question. Respondent\u2019s assistant store manager admitted that arm wrestling did occur at the store prior to the accident in question perhaps every couple of weeks or two to three times per month. Petitioner\u2019s supervisor indicated that \u201c\u00a3j]ust a few of the guys ... with the egos ... the strongest guy in the store type of thing\u201d were the employees who usually participated in the arm wrestling. Landstrom admitted that he had engaged in arm wrestling on prior occasions and had engaged petitioner in arm wrestling on prior occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-14\">During the incident on May 23, 1994, Petitioner sustained a serious spiral fracture of the right arm with residual scarification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">[ (Citations and footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">There was a dispute as to whether the store had closed before the arm wrestling began and as to whether petitioner or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>assistant store manager, Ronald Landstrom, initiated the contest. Landstrom testified that the activity commenced \u201cafter closing\u201d as petitioner was leaving and that petitioner initiated the contest. According to Landstrom, petitioner approached him, \u201csaid am I ready, and put his elbow up on the podium in the front of the store\u201d to start the contest. Landstrom also testified that arm wrestling occurred \u201conce every couple of weeks or two, three times a month,\u201d and admitted that he arm wrestled with petitioner \u201con prior occasions.\u201d Landstrom also testified that the activity was \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d \u201cendorsed\u201d or approved by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Petitioner claims that his \u201cinjuries are compensable\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7.1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">Horseplay or skylarking on part of fellow employees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">An accident to an employee causing his injury or death, suffered while engaged in his employment but resulting from horseplay or skylarking on the part of a fellow employee, <em>not instigated or taken part in by the employee who suffers the accident, </em>shall be construed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment of such employee and shall be compensable under the act hereby supplemented accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">[ (Emphasis added and footnote omitted).] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The statute provides for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries \u201cresulting from horseplay or skylarking\u201d only if the injured employee had \u201cnot instigated or taken part in\u201d the horseplay or skylarking. The judge of compensation, however, granted benefits noting that it has \u201cbeen consistently held that Section 7.1 does not bar recovery for injuries sustained by an employee who instigated skylarking where skylarking practices were known by the employer.\u201d The judge quoted extensively from <em>Secor v. Penn Service Garage, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>315, 117 A.2d 12 (1955), in ruling for petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>In <em>Secor, supra, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that injuries sustained by an employee who was burned when he lit a match after his clothes were \u201csplashed\u201d with gasoline while filling a gas tank arose out of and in the course of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 323-24, 117 A.2d 12. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>34:15-7. The parties disputed whether petitioner was lighting a cigarette or trying to impress his employer with his fearlessness when he lit the match and ignited his clothes. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 117 A.2d 12. In deciding that the injuries, under either party\u2019s version, were \u201csufficiently work-connected and may fairly be said to have been an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 324, 117 A.2d 12, Justice Jacobs noted that the trend in workers\u2019 compensation cases had \u201cbeen toward allowing compensation even to participating employees where their deviations may be said to be minor and attributable to normal human tendencies which men do not wholly shed simply because they are at work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320-21,117 A.2d 12. The <em>Secor </em>Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">The evidence does not warrant any inference of deliberate disobedience of an order of his employer, <em>cf. Green v. DeFuria, </em>[19 <em>N.J. </em>290, 116 A.2d 19 (1955) ]; <em>Waskevitz v. Clifton Paper Board Co., </em>[7 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 71 A.2d 646 (App.Div.1950) ], and even though his action in lighting the match for the assumed purpose be deemed grossly negligent and foolhardy it would nonetheless have been taken in the belief that it was in furtherance of the employer\u2019s interests. See <em>Green v. DeFuria, supra. </em>More troublesome is the question presented by the assumption that Secor was not motivated by either of the aforestated purposes but simply lit the match in a spirit of \u201cmock bravado.\u201d See [Secor <em>v. Penn Service Garage,</em>] 35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[59] at <em>page </em>61 [113 A.2d 177]. But even here, the compelling principles underlying the modem authorities, particularly the so-called \u201ccuriosity cases,\u201d lend adequate support for the compensation award to the employee. The evidence established that, in any event, Seeor\u2019s deviation from the course of his ordinary work was not an intentional abandonment of his employment but simply a \u201cmomentary or impulsive act\u201d \u2014 it was not a \u201cdeliberate and conscious excursion\u201d within <em>Robertson v. Express Container Corp., </em>[13 <em>N.J. </em>342, 99 A.2d 649 (1953)]. An employee is not an automaton, and, even when he is highly efficient, he will to some extent deviate from the uninterrupted performance of his work. Such deviation, if it be considered minor in the light of the particular time, place and circumstance, is realistically viewed by both the employer and the employee as a normal incidence of the employment relation and ought not in this day be viewed as legally breaching the course thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\"><em>[Secor, supra, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>at 323-24,117 A.2d 12.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Secor </em>did not involve nor consider <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7.1. However, language in another Supreme Court case cited by the judge of compensation supports his conclusion. <em>See McKenzie v. Brixite Mfg. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>1, 3, 166 A.2d 753 (1961), where the petitioner\u2019s \u201cplayful touching\u201d of an employee whose reaction injured petitioner was held compensable when the employer \u201cwas aware that such sportive touchings were common between these two employees as well as between other employees.\u201d But there the Court determined that the employer\u2019s \u201cknowledge of frequent playful touchings\u201d constituted \u201cacquiescence\u201d in a \u201ccourse of conduct ... and thus transformed an extra-employment skylark into an incident of employment.\u201d The Court further concluded in that setting that it was \u201cimmaterial that petitioner was an active participant rather than an innocent victim.\u201d 34 <em>N.J. </em>at 6, 166 A.2d 753.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Brixite </em>was concerned with the legislative intent evidenced by the statutory complex at the time N.J.S.A 34:15-7.1 was adopted in 1956. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8,166 A.2d 753. It held that that statute was designed to permit recovery by non-participant \u201c \u2018innocent victims\u2019 of skylarking and horseplay\u201d and was not intended to change the law permitting recovery for injuries resulting \u201cfrom skylarking activities within the knowledge of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 166 A.2d 753. Thus, while our statute permits a non-participant to recover for workplace injuries caused by \u201chorseplay\u201d and \u201cskylarking,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7.1; <em>see also Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation </em>(Desk Reference 1997) \u00a7 23.10, <em>Brixite</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>permits the instigator or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>participant to nevertheless recover if the accident is compensable under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In this case, the judge of compensation correctly understood the law governing skylarking and horseplay. However, his decision failed to recognize that different standards apply to \u201crecreational and social activities\u201d and that they control this ease. Unlike horseplay and skylarking which essentially deal with \u201ctwo or more employees fooling around with one another,\u201d <em>Trotter v. County of Monmouth, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 434, 365 A.2d 1374 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>42, 372 A.2d 308 (1976) (such as \u201cplayful touching\u201d <em>(Brixite, supra, </em>at 6, 166 A.2d 753), spraying water <em>(Diaz, </em>supra), or shooting staples, <em>(Clodgo v. Rentavision, Inc., </em>701 A.2d 1044 (Vt.1997)), \u201csocial and recreational activities\u201d) have an entirely different significance in the workplace. They are customary or planned activities occurring during the lunch hour, coffee breaks, recreational periods or outings. <em>Sarzillo v. Turner Constr. Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>114, 117-21, 501 A.2d 135 (1985). <em>See also Cotton v. Worthington Corp., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 468-69, 471 A.2d 56 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>301, 475 A.2d 593 (1984) (no recovery for injury sustained during softball game even though employer supplied the \u201cteam composed of Worthington employees ... with baseball caps with the Worthington logo----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In our view, this case involves a \u201crecreational activity\u201d and the work related injury is not compensable under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">In 1980 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7, which provides for workers\u2019 compensation for an injury \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d was amended to prohibit recovery for injuries suffered during \u201crecreational or social activities, unless such recreational or social activities are a regular incident of employment and produce a benefit to the employer beyond improvement in employee health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and morale____\u201d <em>See L. </em>1979, c. 283, \u00a7 1 (effective January 10, 1980). In <em>Sarzillo, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 121-23, 501 A.2d 135, the Supreme Court held that an employee could not collect for a torn Achilles tendon suffered during the course of a Ka-nocka<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> game played by employees during a lunch hour. The Court held that the amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7 was \u201cintended to tighten, clarify, or eliminate the availability of worker\u2019s compensation for injuries sustained during recreational or social activities,\u201d 101 <em>N.J. </em>at 120, 501 A.2d 135, and that to recover for such recreational or social activity, the petitioner had to show both that the activity was \u201ca regular incident of employment\u201d and produced \u201ca benefit to the employer beyond improvement in employee health and morale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 501 A.2d 135. <em>Sarzillo </em>satisfied neither prong, even though the employer knew about the activity and allowed it to continue on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">To be compensable, the work-related accident must occur both \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carise out of\u2019 the employment. <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 289-90, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986) (denying recovery when an employee during lunch hour ignited her hair while lighting a match because it did not \u201carise out of\u2019 the employment). Here, we recognize that this accident involving arm wrestling at work would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d petitioner\u2019s employment with P.C. Richards, <em>see Coleman, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 291, 520 A.2d 1341, and involved the active participation of the store manager oh duty. However, injuries which occur during a recreational activity, such as the arm wrestling involved in this case, must now meet both prongs of the <em>Sarzillo </em>test, and even assuming that the arm wrestling here qualifies as \u201ca regular incident of employment,\u201d it cannot fairly be said on this record that it produced \u201ca benefit to the employer beyond improvement in employee health and morale.\u201d <em>See Sarzillo, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 119, 501 A.2d 135. Accordingly, we reverse the award of compensation to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\"> \"Skylark\u201d means \"[t]o indulge in hilarious or boisterous frolic.\u201d <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls, International Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1978).
