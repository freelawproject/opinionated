The indenture at issue authorizes the trustee to \"pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes,\" and thus empowers that trustee to proceed at law and in equity to recover losses incurred by all noteholders from the unpaid notes. As such, the trustee may assert causes of action to recover pro rata losses caused by defendants' scheme to render\n   the note debtor insolvent. The trustee may also seek to pierce the corporate veil and impose corporate obligations on defendants under an alter ego theory of liability based on properly pleaded factual allegations-here that defendants created, for unlawful purposes, a corporate structure over which they exercised complete control and domination, and which they used to incur corporate debt so they could distribute the loan proceeds to themselves through fraudulent transfers, leaving the corporation unable to pay its creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Procedural and Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendants on the appeal before us are private equity investment funds and their individual partners (collectively the private equity defendants) who are part of a consortium controlled by the global private equity groups Apax Partners, L.L.P. (Apax) and TPG Capital Management (TPG).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2005, these private equity defendants created a group of shell companies incorporated in Luxembourg to acquire TIM Hellas Telecommunications (TIM Hellas), which at the time was the third largest cellular telephone company in Greece, profitable and nearly debt-free. The multicompany corporate group of shell companies (Hellas Group) include Hellas Telecommunications, S.a`.r.l. (Hellas), the parent company of Hellas Telecommunications Finance, S.C.A. (Hellas Finance), Hellas Telecommunications I, S.a`.r.l. (Hellas I), and Hellas Telecommunications II, S.C.A. (Hellas II).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By the end of 2005, the Hellas Group carried \u20ac1.6 billion in debt but only \u20ac38 million in equity and zero retained earnings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Hellas Group continued to borrow heavily, and by mid-2006 the Hellas Group's long-term debt had increased to almost \u20ac1.94 billion, as against shareholders' equity of \u20ac11.4 million. Notwithstanding this heavy debt to equity ratio, in December 2006, as part of Hellas Group's recapitalization, Hellas Finance issued \u20ac200 million in PIK (payment-in-kind) notes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   guaranteed by Hellas I, and governed\n   by the indenture at issue in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simultaneously, as part of the recapitalization, Hellas redeemed convertible preferred equity certificates (certificates)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   that had been held by the private equity defendants for approximately \u20ac973.7 million, which the private equity defendants pocketed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two months after the redemption of the Certificates, defendants sold the Hellas Group to an investor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Less than three years later, during the global financial crisis in 2009, Hellas Finance and Hellas I defaulted on the PIK notes, leading to litigation to recover on behalf of the noteholders. Plaintiff Wilmington Trust Company (WTC), as the successor to the original indenture trustee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   brought the instant action against several Hellas entities and the private equity defendants to recover payment due on the PIK notes from the assets allegedly looted by defendants from Hellas Finance and Hellas I, including the \u20ac973.7 million in certificate redemptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   WTC claims that the recapitalization was not intended as a traditional restructuring of debt and equity, but in actuality was a scheme designed to distribute the loan proceeds to the private equity defendants by redeeming securities from the Hellas Group, including the certificates, and-in effect, paying out unlawful dividends-even though the Hellas Group was in considerable debt. The complaint alleges defendants adopted this scheme to \"bleed-out\" the Hellas Group, whereby:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"With an initial investment of \u20ac50 million, in 2005, TPG and Apax organized a group of interrelated companies to acquire a profitable, nearly debt-free company, then called Tim Hellas Telecommunications, S.A. ('TIM Hellas'), creating a complex multi-company group. Under the control of Apax and TPG, the newly formed Hellas entities borrowed heavily, paid the loan proceeds to Apax and TPG and their investment funds, and were left debt-laden\n   and insolvent to the detriment of their creditors.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As against the private equity defendants, the complaint asserts causes of action for breach of contract, fraudulent conveyances, unlawful corporate distribution, and unjust enrichment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to the various causes of action to hold liable the parties named for their own conduct, the complaint further seeks to pierce the corporate veil on the theory that the private equity defendants are the alter egos of the Hellas Group and therefore liable for the corporate debt. For each cause of action, WTC requests payment of the \u20ac268 million owed on the PIK notes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   plus interest, trustee's fees, attorneys' fees, and the costs and disbursements of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As relevant to this appeal, Supreme Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, concluding that WTC lacked standing because the indenture did not permit the trustee to sue the private equity defendants for what the court considered \"entirely separate claims\" that could have been brought well before default (\n   <em>\n    Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp. v. Hellas Telecommunications, S.a`.r.l.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154459\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc3d/47/544/#p569\">\n    47 Misc.3d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154459\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc3d/47/544/#p569\">\n    996 N.Y.S.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Sup. Ct., New York County 2014] ). The court dismissed the cause of action based on the alter ego theory of liability for the same reason, but noted that, in any case, it was inadequately pleaded and duplicative of the fraudulent conveyance causes of action that the trustee is not authorized to maintain (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154459\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc3d/47/544/#p569\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 572 n 11 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On WTC's appeal, the Appellate Division modified on the law and denied the motion to dismiss the complaint, insofar as asserted by WTC as indenture trustee, and otherwise affirmed the orders (\n   <em>\n    Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp. v. Hellas Telecommunications, S.a`.r.l.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787675\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/833/\">\n    142 A.D.3d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787675\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/833/\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ). The Court concluded that the relevant language of the indenture \"confers standing on the trustee to pursue ... the fraudulent conveyance and other ... claims, which\n   seek recovery solely\n   of the amounts due under the notes, for the benefit of all noteholders on a pro rata basis, as a remedy for an alleged injury suffered ratably by all noteholders by reason of their status as noteholders\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787675\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/833/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 833-834 ). The Court also found that the complaint sufficiently states a cause of action against these defendants under a veil-piercing theory (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787675\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/833/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 834 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellate Division granted defendants leave to appeal and certified the question whether the court properly modified the order of Supreme Court.

As a partial solution to the collective-action problem presented by a fluctuating group of securities-holders with diverse interests, an indenture trustee \"is appointed to act as a type of agent on behalf of the [securities-holders] collectively\" (Steven L.

The indenture further provides that those remedies may be pursued \"to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.\" The plain meaning of section 6.03, then, is to authorize a trustee to pursue any lawful means of enforcing the noteholders' rights, against any individual or entity, based on any viable theory of recovery in order to secure repayment upon the event of a default on the debt to noteholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Interpreting \"any available remedy to collect ... on the Notes\" to include causes of action to recover noteholders' pro rata losses also gives effect to other sections of the indenture. Section 7.01(a) provides that a trustee in ''an Event of Default ... will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture.\" Under section 4.01, an event of default includes\n   the failure of an issuer to \"pay or cause to\n   be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes\" as prescribed in the notes and the indenture. In such a case, the trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment due, not for its own benefit or for some of the noteholders, but for all the noteholders, under a common claim of default (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kolbe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289340\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/344/#p353\">\n    22 NY3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289340\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/344/#p353\">\n    980 N.Y.S.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289340\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/22/344/#p353\">\n    3 N.E.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants argue section 6.03 should be read narrowly, so that a claim for payment \"on the Notes\" is construed to mean solely a claim for payment due \"under the terms and conditions of the Notes.\" The trustee, they argue, is therefore not permitted to assert third-party actions based on defendants' alleged fraudulent conduct and may only bring claims against the parties who actually agreed to make payments on the PIK notes: the issuer and guarantor. Defendants' arguments are unsupported by law and the language of the indenture. The words actually used in the indenture are dispositive; not, as defendants would have it, a phrase found nowhere in the document (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quadrant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p555\">\n    23 N.Y.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   559-560 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nevertheless, defendants' assert that persuasive authority from other jurisdictions stands for the proposition that a trustee may not sue third parties in actions such as this one. A careful reading of the cases cited by defendants in support of its construction of section 6.03 makes clear that courts do not, in fact, limit the trustee in such way.\n   <em>\n    Regions Bank v. Blount Parrish &amp; Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20726989\">\n    2001 WL 726989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill., June 27, 2001), heavily relied upon by defendants, is illustrative.\n   <em>\n    Regions\n   </em>\n   involved a remedies clause with almost identical language to that contained in section 6.03.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, the court concluded that the clause did not give the trustee power to protect all rights of the bondholders or to pursue a bondholder's tort claims (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20726989\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *5 ). The case, however, turned on the nature of the specific claims at issue. The trustee in\n   <em>\n    Regions\n   </em>\n   brought a suit for fraudulent inducement-specifically, for misrepresentations and nondisclosures in the offering memorandum about the actual risks of the underlying technology in which the bondholders invested, and, as a consequence, the risk of entering the agreement-in violation of various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act (15 USC \u00a7 78a et seq.) and Illinois common law. Unlike the appeal here,\n   <em>\n    Regions\n   </em>\n   involved a pre-agreement fraudulent act to induce the bondholders' purchase. It could not have uniformly affected the bondholders' reliance when undertaking the investment. In contrast, WTC is not stepping into the shoes of particular noteholders to assert their claims, but rather seeking to remedy the post-agreement collective loss that springs from the issuer and guarantor's failures to satisfy payment of the PIK notes. In other words, the trustee is attempting to collect payments due on the notes. This difference is decisive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   WTC's fraudulent conveyance claim does not suffer from the flaw identified by\n   <em>\n    Regions\n   </em>\n   and other courts as a \"carte blanche\" to sue on common law and securities claims (see\n   <em>\n    Regions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20726989\">\n    2001 WL 726989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5, quoting\n   <em>\n    Continental Bank, N.A. v.

Those cases, also cited by defendants, similarly focus on fraudulent inducement and securities claims, rather than claims seeking recovery\n   of the actual monies the issuer was\n   obligated to pay on the notes, and are similarly distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Continental Bank\n   </em>\n   , the court held the indenture did not authorize a trustee to pursue an action against an underwriter for fraudulently representing a bond's financial condition and viability (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20129452\">\n    1990 WL 129452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ). The court noted there was no \"language giving the trustee the unrestricted authority to enforce any 'legal or equitable right' of the bondholders' \" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20129452\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).

Moreover, even where a trustee seeks to pursue securities fraud claims, broad indenture language has been held to allow the trustee to bring suits like that at issue here (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Washington Pub.

Mass. 1991] [same] ). The persuasive logic of these decisions supports our conclusion that section 6.03 empowers the trustee to pursue causes of action to remedy an injury common to all noteholders arising from the failure to pay the PIK note obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We find unpersuasive defendants' argument that section 6.06 of the indenture-the \"no-action clause\"-supports its interpretation of section 6.03 and limits the trustee's power here. That clause provides, in relevant part, that in the event of default, the trustee is \"under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense'' (\u00a7 6.06 [a] ). It also provides that noteholders may not pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the notes \"[e]xcept to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   unless the noteholder has given notice to the trustee of default, noteholders having at least 25% of the outstanding notes have requested the trustee pursue the remedy, the noteholders have offered the trustee security or indemnity, the trustee has not complied with the request within 60 days after receiving the offer of security or indemnity, and the majority noteholders have not directed the trustee otherwise (id.). Defendants ignore the primary purpose of a no-action clause, which we have explained \"is to protect issuers from the expense involved in defending individual lawsuits that are either frivolous or otherwise not in the economic interest of the corporation and its creditors\" (\n   <em>\n    Quadrant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p555\">\n    23 N.Y.3d at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p555\">\n    992 N.Y.S.2d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p555\">\n    16 N.E.3d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks, brackets and citation omitted] ).

The cases do not stand for the proposition, however, that such claims could not be brought by the indenture trustee. Quite the contrary. In\n   <em>\n    Feldbaum\n   </em>\n   , the court found that \"[g]iven the derivative character of these claims, it is clear that they can be prosecuted by the trustees representing the bondholders as a group, provided the trustees are in a position in which they can represent plaintiffs fairly\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20119095\">\n    1992 WL 119095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8 ). In\n   <em>\n    Lange\n   </em>\n   the court went further, noting explicitly that, since the complaint sought \"redress for harm suffered by all [holders] on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis,\" it \"may be pursued by the Indenture Trustee on their behalf\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%202005728\">\n    2002 WL 2005728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While the plain language of the indenture is dispositive, we also note that our construction of section 6.03 is in line with the intended meaning of nearly identical language from the Revised Model Simplified Indenture, also numbered section 6.03, and, given the similarities between the two, apparently the model for the agreement at issue in this case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Revised Model Simplified Indenture\n   </em>\n   , 55 Bus L 1115, 1137 [2000] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the American Bar\n   Association commentaries to the Revised Model Simplified Indenture explain: \"In authorizing the Trustee to 'pursue any available remedy' for collection on the Securities or enforcement of the Indenture, the Model Simplified Indenture subsumes all of the customary phraseology: 'actions, suits or proceedings,' 'at law or in equity,' 'under this Indenture or otherwise by law,' etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%202005728\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1189 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significantly, the commentary observes that the language in section 6.03 \"does not empower the Trustee to pursue claims which may be available to purchasers or sellers of Securities under state or federal securities law or the common law for misrepresentations inducing them to purchase or hold the securities\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%202005728\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1190 ). As the commentary explains, these sorts of fraud claims may create conflicts for the trustee: first, fraud claims may be held by persons who no longer hold the securities and who sold after the fraud was discovered, as well as by those who still hold the securities; second, holders may have different rights depending on when they purchased and whether they can prove reliance on the fraud; third, recoveries by holders of fraud claims may prejudice collections by current holders; and fourth, securities fraud claims may be subordinated to other holders under bankruptcy laws (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%202005728\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1190 ). This rationale, although sound as applied to most claims related to securities fraud as, for example, under Securities Exchange Commission Rules rule 10b-5 for acts or omissions resulting in fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, where individual noteholders will be in different positions and are best positioned to bring their own suits, has no purchase here. WTC seeks recovery solely of the amounts due under the notes, for the benefit of all noteholders on a pro rata basis, as a remedy for an injury suffered ratably by all noteholders by reason of the issuer and guarantor's default. Such action protects the collective interest of the noteholders in repayment of the PIK notes, without prioritizing one noteholder over another or placing a noteholder's rights at risk because of the actions of a minority of noteholders. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Quadrant\n   </em>\n   ,\"parties sophisticated and well versed in this area of the law-like the parties here-are well aware of these commentaries\" (\n   <em>\n    Quadrant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p555\">\n    23 N.Y.3d at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p555\">\n    992 N.Y.S.2d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223209\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/23/549/#p555\">\n    16 N.E.3d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the preceding reasons, the language of section 6.03 of the indenture permits the kind of third-party action at issue here. If the parties to the indenture intended to limit the trustee to actions against the issuer and guarantor only-as defendants maintain-the signatories to the indenture could have easily said so. They did not. Therefore, WTC is empowered under section 6.03 to pursue causes of action to recover pro rata payment for all noteholders against those who WTC alleges bled dry the issuer and guarantor for defendants' profit, to the detriment of the noteholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Alter Ego Theory of Liability to Pierce the Corporate Veil\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The complaint also asserts liability based on the theory that individual defendants acted as the alter egos of the issuer\n   and guarantor, and caused those entities to divest the funds that would have otherwise been available to pay the notes. WTC thus seeks to persuade the court to pierce the corporate veil and impose corporate liability on these defendants. Defendants argue that the complaint is deficient because it fails to allege adequate facts, and in any event, WTC's claim should be dismissed as duplicative of the fraudulent conveyance causes of action that underlie WTC's alter ego theory. Defendants are wrong on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As discussed above, \"[o]n a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211, the pleading is to be afforded a liberal construction. We accept the facts as alleged in the complaint as true, accord plaintiffs the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\" (\n   <em>\n    Leon v.

These factual allegations are sufficient to support WTC's claim that Hellas Finance and Hellas I are liable for repayment plus interest.

The complaint further alleges that the private equity defendants misused the corporate form and describes a borrowing scheme that employed the Hellas Group shell companies to acquire long-term debt which dwarfed shareholder equity, all the while distributing the PIK loan proceeds and certificate redemptions to the private equity defendants.

The consequence of these actions, according to the complaint, is that the scheme \"forced\" the Hellas corporations \"to commit business suicide by paying borrowed funds to private equity defendants that the Hellas Defendants could not repay.\" The complaint describes the precarious financial status of the Hellas Group when the private equity defendants took the corporate assets for themselves, setting forth how and when the business acquired debt, and how that debt continued to grow despite the shareholders disproportionately low equity at the time. The complaint sets forth the alleged fraudulent conveyances, providing the dates and amounts of the PIK note proceeds and certificate redemptions distributed to the private equity defendants and their principals. These factual allegations, along with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, support a cause of action that Hellas Finance and Hellas I defaulted on payment to the noteholders because the private equity defendants used their control of the corporate form for the unlawful purpose of intentionally divesting the corporate assets through fraudulent conveyances, under the guise of dividends and redemptions, which in turn rendered these companies insolvent and unable to pay their creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants argue that the complaint is inadequate because it fails to plead with\n   specificity the conduct alleged against each defendant that would support alter ego liability.

It points to various individuals and entities tasked with directing Apax and TPG's day-to-day activities at the time of the fraudulent conveyances, it lists their titles and management positions, and it also identifies specific transferees of the fraudulent conveyance proceeds.

The language in section 14.07 of the indenture, namely, \"for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation\" is an addition to the language that states there is no liability for the notes-evincing that the first provision is on the notes, which is exactly what the plaintiff pursues here. The same is true of section 14.09. All that these provisions establish is that the parties included language for claims that are not for recovery triggered by an event of default. Here, the action is in response to and for recovery on an event of default, i.e., the failure to pay the debt on the notes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Section 6.03 of the Revised Model Simplified Indenture reads: \"If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of Principal or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture\" (\n    <em>\n     55 Bus Law\n    </em>\n    at 1137 ).
