Appellant was also banned for two years from fishing in the Lake Erie sport fishing district. Because we find that the conviction was supported by sufficient evidence and the sentence was not contrary to law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The relevant facts of this case are not in dispute. On March 28, 2016, appellant and two other individuals were cited under R.C. 1531.02. The three men were also cited under Ohio Adm.Code 1501:31-13-01(F), fishing in a closed zone. In addition, appellant was cited under Ohio Adm.Code 1501:31-13-09(B), taking a walleye less than 15 inches in length in the Lake Erie sport fishing district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant entered not guilty pleas to the charges and the matter proceeded to a jury trial. At trial, testimony was elicited from sole witness Ohio Division of Wildlife officer Austin Dickinson. Officer Dickinson testified that on March 28, 2016, at approximately 3:00 p.m., the office received a tip that a violation was occurring in Fremont, Ohio. Dickinson responded to the call. Upon arrival he observed three men fishing below the Ballville bridge; he witnessed them cast and reel in multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officer Dickinson approached the men and asked to see their fishing licenses. The two men with appellant produced their licenses. Appellant indicated that he did not have his on his person; Officer Dickinson was able to verify that he did have an active license. The men were informed that they were fishing in a closed zone and were asked to go up the bank to Officer Dickinson's vehicle so he could observe the fish they had caught.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Officer Dickinson explained that the area was a \"closed zone\" during a period in the spring because the walleye from the lake use adjacent rivers and streams to spawn, or lay their eggs. Dickinson explained that the area closes due to the sheer number of walleye spawning in the area and the risk of anglers catching and keeping more than the legal limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dickinson stated that the closure is \"publicly known\" and is posted in the written regulations, online, and on signage in the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer Dickinson testified that one of appellant's three fish measured at 14 and one-half inches, one-half inch short of the 15-inch state minimum. Photographic evidence of the fish was admitted into evidence. Citations were then issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Following closing arguments and jury deliberations appellant was convicted on the counts charged and was immediately sentenced. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant now raises three assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. It is an error of law for the trial court to decide that ORC \u00a7 1531.02 is a strict liability statute. Therefore, appellant's conviction is against the sufficiency of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. ORC section 1531.02 is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. Trial court abused its discretion by sentencing defendant disproportionately harsher compared to other defendant's in identical situations with a sentence that is inconsistent with principles of misdemeanor sentencing ORC section 2929.21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In appellant's first assignment of error, he contends that because a mens rea was not proven at trial, his conviction under R.C. 1531.02 was against the sufficiency of the evidence. We note that the question of whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction is one of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Hymore\n   </em>\n   the appellant's case proceeded to a jury trial following which he was found guilty. On appeal, appellant argued, in part, that the trial court erred when it denied his request for certain jury instructions. After examining the language of the statute which included the phrase \"[n]o person shall,\" we noted that such language evidence the intent of the legislature to impose strict liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3, quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Moody\n   </em>\n   , the court first acknowledged that the statute contained no mental state.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. The court concluded, however, that there was no plain indication that the General Assembly intended to impose strict liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court then determined that the recklessness mental state applied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Acknowledging\n   <em>\n    Moody\n   </em>\n   yet reaching a different conclusion, the Tenth Appellate District determined that a violation of the sex-offender registration statute, former R.C. 2950.05, was a strict liability offense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court first noted that the statute at issue did not contain a mental state element.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. The court then considered whether the offense was a crime merely because it was prohibited by statute (malum prohibitum) versus whether the act itself was immoral (malum in se). The court found that because the act of failing to provide a change of address was malum prohibitum, it supported the argument that it was a strict liability offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Finally, the court determined that the General Assembly had taken a\n   \"strong stance\" against sex offenders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. The court then concluded that the statute was a strict liability offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    State v. Bowersmith, supra,\n   </em>\n   involving wildlife division regulation, the court proceeded through the analysis first finding that the statute, R.C. 1533.11, did not include a mens rea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. The court then noted the prohibitive language contained in the statute: \"Every person * * * shall carry the person's permit * * *. Failure to do so and exhibit such permit constitutes an offense under this section.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Finally, the court observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [T]he General Assembly has assumed a strong stance in support of the protection and preservation of our natural resources through stringent licensing and regulation of activities affecting those resources. Moreover, varying degrees of culpability and exceptions for unintentional violations have been provided within other sections of the Chapter. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume, based upon the fact that this is a regulatory statute enacted in furtherance of the public welfare and that the offense herein is\n   <em>\n    mala prohibita\n   </em>\n   , that the inclusion of scienter requirements and exceptions within other sections of the Chapter and the unconditional mandates within and exclusion of a scienter requirement from R.C. 1533.11, plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict liability for failing to carry and display a special permit while hunting upon the lands of another.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Reading\n   <em>\n    Moody\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Blanton\n   </em>\n   , in conjunction with\n   <em>\n    Bowersmith\n   </em>\n   , we find that the violations of the statute and regulations at issue were strict liability offenses. Thus, a mental state element was not required to be proven at trial. As to the remaining elements of the offenses, appellant neither contests that he was fishing in a closed zone nor that the fish he caught was undersized. Accordingly, we find that appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In appellant's second assignment of error he contends that R.C. 1531.02 is void for vagueness. Appellant argues that the statute fails to specifically state what is prohibited. This argument has been previously raised and rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Seymour\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist. Ross No. 1499,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%2098496\">\n    1989 WL 98496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 22, 1989). The\n   <em>\n    Seymour\n   </em>\n   court first noted that the legislature could properly delegate to an administrative agency, including the Division of Wildlife, the authority to \"promulgate rules and regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%2098496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court then noted that R.C. 1531.02, prohibits doing anything contrary to a division rule or order and that the specific prohibitions are contained in the Ohio Administrative Code. Thus, the prohibition at issue was specifically set forth and not vague.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20N.E.2d%20908\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In the present case, appellant was cited under the general statute, R.C. 1531.02. Appellant was also charged with violating specific Ohio Administrative Code sections. When issuing the citations, the Ohio Division of Wildlife officer wrote out a description of each violation. Based on the foregoing, we find that R.C. 1531.02 is not unconstitutionally vague. Appellant's second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In his third and final assignment of error, appellant contends that his harsh sentence was contrary to the principles and purposes of misdemeanor sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.21 and 2929.22. Appellant bases his argument on the fact that the two other individuals issued citations were given less severe sanctions. Specifically, appellant contends that his sentence was disproportionate to the other two individuals\n   charged as they were only sentenced to fines after entering guilty pleas; he was issued a suspended jail sentence, non-reporting community control, higher fines, community service, and was ordered not to fish in the Lake Erie sport fishing district. The state asserts that the sentence was within the trial court's discretion and within the range of sentences permitted by law. The state further notes that appellant, unlike the other individuals, was additionally charged with possessing a walleye of less than 15 inches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} We agree that we review a misdemeanor sentence for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Cossack\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

In imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor offense, a trial court must consider the purposes and principles of misdemeanor sentencing as set forth in R.C. 2929.21, as well as the sentencing factors set forth in R.C. 2929.22. The failure to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Dominijanni\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

Nevertheless, when a misdemeanor sentence is imposed within the statutory limits, a reviewing court will presume that the judge followed the statutes, absent evidence to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further the $50 value imposed as a fine for each violation is specifically set forth in the regulations.
