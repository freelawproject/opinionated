On appeal, Snyder argues that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea because (1) his conviction is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Snyder argues that his conviction is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because he was convicted of an unclassified felony when the indictment charged him with a first-degree felony. However, Snyder waived any defects in the indictment by failing to object to the indictment and pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Snyder also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for allowing him to plead guilty to an unclassified felony and then allowing the trial court to convict him of an unclassified felony. However, Snyder's ineffective assistance of counsel claim could have been raised on direct appeal and is therefore barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On June 30, 2014, a complaint was filed in the Pike County Court charging Snyder with one count of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A). Snyder was subsequently indicted by a Pike County Grand Jury on the same charge, along with an attendant firearm specification. Snyder entered a plea of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Through discovery, the following facts were uncovered. On June 13, 2016, police received a call about a dispute on Fairview Road in Peebles, Ohio. Deputy Cottrell of the Pike County Sherriff's Office responded to the scene and spoke with the caller, Kim Snyder (\"Snyder's wife\"). Snyder's wife stated that her neighbor's son, Tylor Tong (\"Tylor\"), was threatening her and her husband. Apparently, the threats related to an ongoing property-line dispute between the two families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Snyder told Deputy Cottrell that he was going to shoot anyone who trespassed onto his property. Deputy Cottrell advised Snyder that that was against the\n   law. After the situation diffused, Deputy Cottrell left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Later that day, however, police received a call that Tylor's father, Kenneth Tong (\"Tong\"), had been shot. Once on scene, police discovered Tong lying in a field with a single gunshot wound to the head. Tong was taken to the hospital where he later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} When police approached Snyder, he admitted to shooting Tong. Eyewitness later confirmed that the shooting occurred during a heated altercation between Snyder, Tong, and Snyder's stepson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On February 2, 2015, a change-of-plea hearing was held. At the start of the hearing, the trial court brought up an error in the indictment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court: All right. * * * The indictment itself says, uh, murder, a felony of the first degree. * * * Technically, murder is not a felony of the first degree. It's an unclassified felony under, uh, Ohio's law. Both the State and defense understand that, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [The Prosecutor]: Correct, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Oh, we do, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court: And so, we're proceeding then, uh, with the understanding that the charge of murder is an unclassified felony. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Feb. 2, 2015, Hrg., p. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After waiving his rights, Snyder pleaded guilty to one count of murder, an unclassified felony, and was immediately sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Snyder timely appealed; but his appeal was dismissed shortly thereafter upon his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} After approximately twenty-two months, in December 2016, Snyder moved to withdraw his guilty plea. First, he argued that the trial court and trial counsel erred in failing to inform him that the State would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he purposely killed Tong. Snyder maintained that if he had known the alleged culpable mental state, he would have gone to trial because he did not act purposely. In that regard, he maintained that the trial court failed to comply with Crim.R. 11 and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Second, he argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the defense of accident. Third, Snyder argued that the State failed to properly indict him for the offense of murder. Specifically, he argued that he was never put on notice that he was charged with an unclassified felony. Finally, he argued that trial counsel was ineffective for advising him to plead guilty to an offense other than first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On December 12, 2016, the trial court denied Snyder's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Snyder timely appealed the denial of the motion to withdraw guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Snyder assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Assignment of Error No. 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial courts [sic] December 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2016 decision and corresponding judgment entry overruling and denying the defendants [sic] Pre Sentence Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea was a prejudicial error as a result of the courts [sic] failure\n   to correct a manifest injustice' [sic] as contemplated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Assignment of Error No. II:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court erred in finding defendant guilty and imposing sentence upon charges for which the court did not have jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Assignment of Error No. III:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Ineffectiveness of trial counsel when a defendant is entering a guilty plea can be a manifest injustice to withdraw a guilty plea and/or counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Crim.R. 32.1 provides that \"[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" \"A defendant who seeks to withdraw a plea of guilty after the imposition of sentence has the burden of establishing the existence of manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
