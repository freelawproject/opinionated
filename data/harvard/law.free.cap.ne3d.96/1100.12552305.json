Angerbauer, M.D., appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas affirming an order of appellee-appellee, State Medical Board of Ohio (\"board\"), which permanently denied appellant's application to practice medicine and surgery in Ohio. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court of common pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In December 2013, appellant applied for a license to practice medicine and surgery in the state of Ohio. In his application, appellant disclosed that the Medical Quality Assurance Commission (\"commission\") of the state of Washington had initiated an investigation into his medical practice and stated his understanding that the commission initiated the investigation based on a concern raised by a third party\n   that someone may have been forging his signature on prescription scripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In June 2014, appellant and the commission agreed to resolve the matter by way of an \"agreed order\" that included stipulated findings of fact and conclusions of law. According to the stipulated findings of fact in the agreed order, between summer 2011 and February 2013, appellant worked as an occupational medicine physician where his practice was \"limited to treating federal employees for work-related medical issues.\" (Agreed Order at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Earlier, in June or July 2011, appellant met a 28-year-old female, \"Patient A,\" at the place of her employment, which the order characterizes as a \"Gentlemen's Club.\" (Agreed Order at 2.) Patient A told appellant she had chronic lower back pain, did not have money, insurance, or a physician, and needed help. Appellant maintained a record for Patient A at his home; the record did not document any inquiry into her medical and mental health history, which, according to Patient A, included significant mental health issues and a history of substance abuse. Appellant examined Patient A at a coffee house, at his home, at a mall tattoo shop where the patient worked, and at a local gas station. Appellant diagnosed Patient A with chronic lower back pain. He did not determine the cause of the pain or order imaging or diagnostic tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} From August 2011 to February 2013, appellant prescribed hydrocodone with acetaminophen 10mg/500mg to Patient A on a regular basis. In the first several months of this period, appellant prescribed 35 to 60 tablets per month to Patient A, an amount that increased to 80 to 120 tablets per month. When Patient A asked for Percocet, appellant told her he could not prescribe Percocet to her because he would have to sign a prescription. To prescribe the hydrocodone, appellant called in the prescription to a pharmacy and, rather than speaking to the pharmacist on duty, always left a voice message. After learning that the commission initiated a complaint, appellant stopped treating and prescribing for Patient A. At some point, appellant gave Patient A $20 and she used his credit card to pay for one night in a hotel. Appellant offered to pay for her books when Patient A expressed interest in finishing her GED, and appellant gave Patient A the food in his refrigerator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the agreed order, appellant stipulates that he failed to meet his standard of care in his treatment of Patient A, that Patient A's records did not justify the long-term prescribing of hydrocodone, that he repeatedly prescribed hydrocodone in significant amounts without performing an adequate physical examination or formulating a treatment plan, that he failed to order diagnostic tests or determine the medical cause of her pain, and that he failed to have her sign a pain management agreement or take other steps to prevent diversion of the medication. As a finding of fact, appellant agreed that he violated pain management administration rules in several respects and breached the standard of care by violating appropriate physician-patient boundaries in his relationship with Patient A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} According to the agreed order, the parties agreed as \"conclusions of law\" that appellant violated two sections of the state of Washington's \"unprofessional conduct\" statute-Section 4, involving incompetence, negligence, or malpractice which results in injury to a patient or which creates an unreasonable risk of harm, and Section 7, involving a violation of any statute or administrative rule regulating the profession-and violated several sections of Washington's administrative code involving patient evaluation, treatment plans, informed consent, and written agreements for treatment. (Agreed Order\n   at 4, 5.) Washington R.C. 18.130.180; Washington Adm.Code Sections 246-919-853 to 856.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} These violations provided grounds for imposing sanctions under Washington R.C. 18.130.160, \"Tier B,\" as appellant's care of Patient A \"created a risk of moderate to severe harm.\" (Agreed Order at 8.) After finding appellant's record of no prior discipline and his expressed remorse as mitigating factors, the commission imposed sanctions at the minimum range under Tier B, including: monitoring of appellant's license for a period of two and one-half years, course work on ethics, physician-patient boundaries, medical record keeping, opioid prescribing, registration with the Washington Prescription Monitoring Program on his license renewal, and a fine. The agreed order states that if appellant violates the order in any respect, \"the Commission may initiate further action against [appellant's] license.\" (Agreed Order at 7.) Furthermore, the agreed order states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Protection of the public requires practice under the terms and conditions imposed in this order. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this order may result in suspension of the license after a show cause hearing. If [appellant] fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this order, the Commission may hold a hearing to require [appellant] to show cause why the license should not be suspended. Alternatively, the Commission may bring additional charges of unprofessional conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Agreed Order at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In July 2014, appellant sent an e-mail to an enforcement attorney for the board asserting that \"[w]ith respect to Patient A, the Commission's allegations were not based on any improper treatment or care with narcotics, but rather were based solely on the lack of strict medical record compliance with [Washington's new] pain management guidelines,\" indicating that his treatment of Patient A was reasonable and \"resulted in substantial amelioration,\" and \"[c]learly, Patient A benefitted greatly from her treatment and care, and was not harmed in any manner.\" (July 17, 2014 E-mail/State Hearing Ex. 4.) Appellant then contends that \"[t]hrough this process, I have realized how I could have more appropriately managed the care of Patient A within the strict scope of the pain management guidelines\" and the situation \"has been a valuable learning experience.\" (July 17, 2014 E-mail/State Hearing Ex. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} By letter dated August 13, 2014, the board sent appellant a notice of opportunity for hearing, alleging that the board had reason to believe the action taken by the state of Washington on his license was a violation of R.C. 4731.22(B)(22). On April 15, 2016, a hearing on the matter was held.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant did not personally appear at the hearing but instead submitted a 17-page written statement pursuant to R.C. 119.07. In his written statement, appellant states that the discipline imposed by the commission centered on his violation of physician-patient boundaries and violations of \"newly enacted pain management rules.\" ( [Appellant's] Ex. 1.) In regard to the physician-patient boundaries, appellant noted that, at the time he was treating Patient A, he honestly believed he was acting in the best interest of his patient\n   \"exemplifying the ideal physician virtues of caring, sympathy, compassion, understanding, respect, empathy, accommodation, availability, personable, approachable, non-bias, and self-effacement,\" and now he realizes he should have referred her to other resources. ( [Appellant's] Ex. 1.) In regard to prescribing, appellant writes \"I was at fault [in record keeping] because I did not keep up on the changes in Washington law that occurred while I was treating Patient A.\" ( [Appellant's] Ex. 1.) Appellant asserts in his letter that he was not under any restriction against treating patients outside of his employment so long as no conflict of interests were present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On June 10, 2016, the hearing examiner issued a report and recommendation finding that the Washington agreed order established a violation of R.C. 4731.22(B)(22). Appellant filed objections to the report and recommendation of the hearing examiner. The board considered appellant's application at the July 13, 2016 board meeting and, thereafter, the board issued its entry of order permanently denying a license to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant appealed to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and moved the court for a finding in his favor under R.C. 119.12(I) alleging the board intentionally failed to provide a copy of the transcript of the July 13, 2016 board meeting rather than minutes of the hearing (which were provided by the board). On October 25, 2016, the common pleas court denied appellant's motion. On January 5, 2017, the common pleas court affirmed the board's entry of order permanently denying appellant's application for an Ohio medical license. In doing so, the common pleas court determined that the agreed order \"limited\" and imposed \"probation\" on appellant's license under R.C. 4731.22(B)(22) and that appellant's argument regarding receiving a harsher sentence than similarly situated individuals lacked merit. (Jan. 5, 2017 Decision at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant filed a timely appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant presents five assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [1.] The common pleas court abused its discretion when it denied Dr. Angerbauer's request to enter a finding in his favor because the Board intentionally failed to file a transcript of the July 13, 2016, proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [2.] The common pleas court abused its discretion when it determined the Board's Order was in accordance with law because the Washington Agreed Order does not give the Board the authority to pursue disciplinary action under R.C. 4731.22(B)(22).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [3.] The common pleas court abused its discretion when it determined the Board's Order was based on reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, and in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [4.] The common pleas court abused its discretion when it determined the Board's Order was based upon reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [5.] The common pleas court abused its discretion because the Board's Order is not in accordance with law. The Board treated Dr. Angerbauer's actions in the State of Washington differently than it has treated physicians in Ohio, in violation of the equal protection clause and the commerce clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Under R.C. 119.12, a common pleas court, in reviewing an order of an administrative agency, must consider the entire record to determine whether reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\n   supports the agency's order and the order is in accordance with law.\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Cincinnati v.

The Supreme Court of Ohio has defined the concepts of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (1) \"Reliable\" evidence is dependable; that is, it can be confidently trusted. In order to be reliable, there must be a reasonable probability that the evidence is true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) \"Probative\" evidence is evidence that tends to prove the issue in question; it must be relevant in determining the issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (3) \"Substantial\" evidence is evidence with some weight; it must have importance and value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Our Place, Inc. v.

An agency is not required to make a stenographic record of every adjudication hearing.

The common pleas court denied appellant's R.C. 119.12(I) motion, finding that the July 13, 2016 meeting is clearly not an \"adjudication hearing\" which would impose a duty on the board to provide a transcript and that no authority supports appellant's claim that the board minutes were not sufficient.

According to appellant, the board was required to transcribe the meeting and file it as part of the certified record under R.C. 119.09 because the board meeting on July 13, 2016 fits the definition of an \"adjudication hearing\" under R.C. 119.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 22} First, by failing to object to the absence of a court reporter at any time prior to or during the board meeting, appellant has waived this issue.\n   <em>\n    Ferrari v.

Failure of the certificate holder to comply with the conditions of probation may result in further disciplinary action being imposed by the board.

The agreed order states that if appellant violates the order in any respect, \"the Commission may initiate further action against [appellant's] license.\" (Agreed Order at 7.) Furthermore, the agreed order states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Protection of the public requires practice under the terms and conditions imposed in this order. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this order may result in suspension of the license after a show cause hearing.

Furthermore, the agreed order specified that appellant's ability to practice medicine could occur only under conditions specified by the board and that failure to comply with the conditions may result in further disciplinary action being imposed by the board. As such, we find the language of the agreed order can reasonably be interpreted as a limitation or probation for purposes of R.C. 4731.22(B)(22) to support the board's action in this case. Therefore, the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion when it determined the board's order was in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Accordingly, we overrule appellant's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Under this assignment of error, appellant essentially argues that a due process violation occurred because he was denied a meaningful and fair hearing due to incorrect and improper evidence that was presented to the hearing examiner and board members.

He first contends evidence that is more prejudicial than probative, specifically Patient A's age and employer, was used against him and that a case the board referenced at the board meeting that involved a sexual relationship with a patient should not have been used as a point of comparison. To appellant, this left \"the impression that this case dealt with a physician who had sex with a twenty-eight-year old female who worked at a gentleman's club.\" (Appellant's Brief at 26.) However, Patient A's age and employment were facts stipulated to in the agreed order, and, as appellant himself states, the prosecuting attorney was quick to point out that this case did not involve a sexual relationship with a patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellant next contends he was \"berated in absentia\" for not appearing at the adjudication hearing, and the board used his silence to prejudice the board against him, when the law clearly allows for a hearing held in his absence and a written statement pursuant to R.C. 119.07. (Appellant's Brief at 26.) Relatedly, appellant contends the board misspoke by saying it could not subpoena appellant because he lived out of state. Appellant believes this left the board with the impression that he must come before the\n   board, otherwise his application should be permanently denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 38} We agree that appellant was within his rights to submit a written statement instead of appearing at the hearing himself and that at the board meeting, the board expressed frustration with receiving a written statement five minutes prior to the hearing when, in the board's view, that hearing was planned to accommodate appellant's presence, and the board compared his silence to invoking the Fifth Amendment in a civil case. However, nothing in the record suggests the board was unaware of appellant's right to submit a written statement, based its finding of a violation of R.C. 4731.22(B)(22) on anything but the agreed order and the language of that law, or believed that appellant's lack of personal appearance at the hearing demanded a sanction of permanent denial of his license. To the contrary, the board expressly considered non-permanent options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant further contends that several prejudicial mistakes were made about the evidence. For example, appellant believes the board incorrectly stated that appellant failed to inquire into Patient A's medical history. However, appellant made this argument to the board, and a board member commented that appellant's inquiry into Patient A's medical history without accompanying documentation would arguably be worse, wondering \"why a physician would not document such a compelling mental health and substance abuse history if he or she is contemplating a long-term prescription of narcotic medication.\" (Board Minutes at 23355.) In other words, even if the board's characterization of this point of evidence was not precisely in line with the agreed order, it was not prejudicial. Appellant also takes issue with the board suggesting appellant would contribute to the prescription drug epidemic, when the Washington agreed order was based only on appellant's conduct with one patient. We do not agree that this statement would constitute a mistake about the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Relatedly, appellant contends that one board member swayed the other members to believe appellant was an example of someone who should never practice medicine in Ohio. The board member at issue expressed his opinion that appellant is an example of a person who should never practice medicine in Ohio based on evidence in the agreed order that appellant is a calculating individual with no problem prescribing up to 120 tablets per month to a patient with a history of substance abuse and mental health issues and based on appellant's written statement comparing his conduct with ideal physician virtues. However, other board members were free to form their own opinions regarding appellant's case, and even if they were swayed, appellant fails to explain how one board member's persuasive opinion amounts to a due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The board minutes indicate the board members based their decision on the facts in evidence and not on alleged \"inaccurate\" and \"unreliable\" evidence, \"misconceptions\" and \"sensational characterizations,\" or appellant's lack of personal appearance. (Appellant's Brief at 32.) Considering all the above, we find that contrary to appellant's argument, he was afforded a hearing consistent with due process, and the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion when it determined the board's order was based on reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Accordingly, we overrule appellant's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Fourth Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellant's fourth assignment of error, although phrased nearly\n   identically to the third assignment of error, challenges the common pleas court's review of the board order. For the following reasons, we disagree with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellant specifically argues that the common pleas court created facts to support its decision to support the board's order. He argues that he was not an occupational medicine physician who worked for the federal government but, rather, worked for HPM Corporation treating employees of the federal government and that nothing in the agreed order states he was contractually limited by this employment. Appellant takes issue with the common pleas court's characterization of his examinations of Patient A as \"cursory,\" that she \"purportedly\" suffered from \"lower back pain,\" and it emphasized that appellant \"only\" stopped treating Patient A when a complaint was filed. (Appellant's Brief at 33, 34.) Appellant further believes that the common pleas court suggests the state of Washington found appellant knew he was doing something improper and states that appellant did not admit to calling pharmacies at a time when he would not have to speak with anyone. Finally, appellant takes issue with the common pleas court's \"position that this was more than just a record keeping case\" and its \"inappropriate\" characterization of appellant's written statement as a \"multipage treatise on self-delusion or an artful attempt to sound contrite while purposefully not admitting to any personal fault or mistake.\" (Appellant's Brief at 34, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Even if, for the sake of argument, appellant's characterizations of the common pleas court opinion are true, nothing raised by appellant constitutes reversible error. As explained below, none of the evidence referenced above is relevant to the board's order finding a violation of R.C. 4731.22(B)(22) but, rather, bears on mitigation and aggravation of the sanction imposed by the board, considerations outside the scope of the common pleas court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Under Ohio law, if the common pleas court concludes that the board's order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, it is precluded from modifying the penalty imposed if the penalty was authorized by law.\n   <em>\n    Demint v.

Fifth Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Under the fifth assignment of error, appellant contends the board violated the Equal Protection Clause by treating him, an out-of-state applicant, differently than similarly situated in-state licenses. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The equal protection clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions prohibit \" ' \"governmental decision makers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Pickaway Cty.

Where a plaintiff maintains that a statute constitutional on its face nonetheless has been applied in a discriminatory manner in his case, the plaintiff must allege both that the state treated the plaintiff differently from others similarly situated and that no rational basis exists for such difference in treatment.\n   <em>\n    Myers v. Columbus Civ. Serv. Comm.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 07AP-958,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-3521\">\n    2008-Ohio-3521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202751225\">\n    2008 WL 2751225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18. In this first step, a plaintiff must produce evidence that the relevant comparison employees are similarly situated in all relevant respects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Once a showing of discriminatory treatment is made, the plaintiff next must demonstrate the government action against him lacks a rational basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 52} As the basis for his equal protection claim, appellant points out several cases where physicians allegedly received more lenient discipline from the board. The common pleas court determined that no case cited to by appellant showed a similarly situated individual, and no \"standard sanctions\" were revealed by the cases provided as a comparison point. (Jan. 5, 2017 Decision at 11.) We agree that the cases cited by appellant fall short of demonstrating the requisite relevant comparison: in addition to factual differences in the physicians' conduct, none of the cases cited by appellant involve applicants for a medical license.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Vaughn\n   </em>\n   (finding that where a physician offers no evidence to support a claim of discrimination other than a list of other physicians who received lesser sanctions, no equal protection violation is shown). We likewise note that the board presented its own cases showing it acted similarly in the past. Moreover, even had appellant been able to prove he was treated differently from those similarly situated, he failed to demonstrate his treatment lacked a rational basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Accordingly, we overrule appellant's fifth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Having overruled appellant's five assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   TYACK, P.J., and BRUNNER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The board initially considered appellant's application on December 10, 2014 and permanently denied his application based on the agreed order. Appellant appealed to the common pleas court asserting that he had timely requested a hearing, and the parties agreed to settle that appeal. The common pleas court thereafter remanded the matter back to the board for an administrative hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
