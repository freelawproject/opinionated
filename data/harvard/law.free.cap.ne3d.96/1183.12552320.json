Appellant Corey Parker (\"Parker\") challenges the trial court's denial of his motion to vacate his conviction and mandatory eight-year sentence for aggravated robbery, with a notice of prior conviction stemming from a juvenile delinquency adjudication, and having\n   a weapon while under disability.

The question in this case focuses on the trial court's jurisdiction to consider Parker's motion. Because the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider the motion, we cannot resolve the merits of the arguments presented-the trial court was without authority to review the merits of the claim in the first instance. Parker has exhausted the appellate review of his conviction. Thus, the trial court's jurisdiction to consider the postconviction motion is paramount. In this case, Parker had two options to invoke the trial court's continuing jurisdiction: file a motion to vacate a void conviction, or file a successive petition for postconviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Parker filed a motion to vacate a void sentence based on\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , but Parker has not argued, let alone demonstrated, that his conviction is void. Instead, Parker claims his conviction was based on a statute deemed to be unconstitutional under a newly announced Ohio Supreme Court decision.

As a result, the trial court correctly denied Parker's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The only other basis to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction is under the postconviction relief statutory framework. We could construe Parker's motion as being a successive petition for postconviction relief, but R.C. 2953.23 only permits a successive petition for postconviction relief (1) if the defendant was unavoidably prevented from discovering facts upon which the petition must rely, or (2) if the\n   <em>\n    \"United States Supreme Court\n   </em>\n   recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively.\" (Emphasis added.) Neither exception applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Parker is relying on an Ohio Supreme Court decision, which is not a basis for a successive petition.\n   <em>\n    State v.

One of the reasons that the legislature may have provided an exception for changes announced by the United States Supreme Court, and not subsequent Ohio Supreme Court decisions, is because the defendant has an opportunity to seek relief from the Ohio Supreme Court in his direct appeal, as Parker had unsuccessfully attempted in this case. Parker had an opportunity to have this issue heard, and the Ohio Supreme Court's decision denying jurisdiction should be final. I would affirm. Parker's petition for postconviction relief is untimely, and no statutory exception applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In addition to the above-noted conflict, the majority's decision conflicts with\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist.

Regardless of the differences between this case and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the Second District determined that\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   is not retroactive, and the majority concludes otherwise. These interdistrict conflicts should be resolved. At the least, I would sua sponte certify a conflict on both issues for the Ohio Supreme Court's resolution.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
