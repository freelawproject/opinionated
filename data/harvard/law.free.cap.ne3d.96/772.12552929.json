Defendant got off the elevator, observed the police officers-who were approximately eight feet away with shields displayed-and immediately retreated into the elevator. Defendant ignored an officer's request that he hold the door and instead \"kept pushing the button\" and the elevator doors closed. In light of this behavior, as well as the building's history of narcotics and trespass activity, the police followed defendant to determine whether he lived in the building. Rather than respond to the officer's questions, defendant turned away from the police to face the wall, held his head down with the hood of his sweatshirt over his head, and kept his hands hidden inside his sweatshirt. The officer immediately noticed a large bulge in defendant's right arm, which defendant held stiffly and straight down from his body in an unnatural position. The officer testified that defendant's behavior in conjunction with his refusal to respond to the officer's repeated requests for defendant to indicate whether he had any weapons, and to show his hands, led him to feel compelled for his safety to confirm whether defendant had a weapon by conducting a limited search of defendant's wrist area. When the officer touched the defendant's wrist, he felt a metal object,\n   lifted the sleeve of the defendant's shirt, saw the point of a blade, and ordered him to \"drop it.\" Defendant did not comply and officers had to pull the weapon-a two-foot-long machete-from defendant's shirt. Minutes later, the officer learned of a recent robbery in the area involving a machete-wielding suspect wearing clothing matching that worn by defendant. Defendant was charged and convicted in connection with that robbery.\n   The trial court, after hearing a police officer's testimony regarding the encounter, applied our framework for evaluating the propriety of police-initiated encounters with private citizens (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778572\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/410/#p415\">\n    142 A.D.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415-416,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778572\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/410/#p415\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ).

(dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On this appeal, we must determine whether further police action during an encounter with an individual in a residential building is justified where the individual fails to respond to police questions and merely stands motionless\n   and silent. The majority's conclusion that the record supports defendant's forcible detention and frisk is inconsistent with our established law. Absent reasonable suspicion that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime, the police may not stop and detain them (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637425\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/6/496/\">\n    6 N.Y.3d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637425\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/6/496/\">\n    814 N.Y.S.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637425\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/6/496/\">\n    847 N.E.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2006] ;\n   <em>\n    People v.

Reasonable suspicion cannot be based on a person's failure to answer police questions absent other indicia of criminal activity. Nor may forcible police action be based on a person's efforts to avoid confrontation, which defendant clearly sought to do here by turning around and facing the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The case before us is particularly startling because the police approached defendant to ascertain whether he lived in the building, which he in fact did. He chose not to tell that to the police when asked-a choice the law protects. In my view, nothing about defendant's encounter with the police supports the erosion of his \"right to be let alone\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4376662\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/50/583/#p590\">\n    50 N.Y.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=430%20N.Y.S.2d%20578\">\n    430 N.Y.S.2d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20N.E.2d%20908\">\n    408 N.E.2d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1980] ). Accordingly, I would reverse and grant defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The People's sole witness at the suppression hearing, Officer Rodriguez, described\n   how he and three other police officers encountered defendant in a New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) residential apartment building\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   during their \"vertical patrol\": a procedure by which the police \"check the whole building from the roof top to the first floor to see if there's any loitering-basically any violations.\" The officers first spotted defendant, wearing a T-shirt over a hoodie, riding in an elevator that had just stopped on the seventh floor. After the other passengers exited the elevator, defendant took a step out, then, according to Officer Rodriguez, stepped back inside when the officer looked at him. The police were dressed in plainclothes, with their badges exposed. Officer Rodriguez called out to defendant, \"Can you hold the door, police, hold the door?\" Officer Rodriguez observed defendant continuing to press a button and the elevator doors closed. He explained that the officers then\n   decided to pursue defendant \"because he wanted to come out, had the hoodie up and there's a lot of stuff going on, so I just wanted to make sure he lived in the building because usually there's a lot of narcotic traffic in the buildings. So just, you know, to verify that he was supposed to be there.\" Officer Rodriguez did not explain what he meant by \"a lot of stuff going on\" or why the officers assumed defendant might not be a tenant. On cross examination, the officer confirmed that the police had no information that defendant was involved in criminal activity or was a suspect in any police investigation occurring within the NYCHA building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The officers followed the elevator, climbing to the eighth and then ninth floor, where they saw defendant in the hallway. During direct examination by the Assistant District Attorney, Officer Rodriguez described the interactions that eventually led to defendant's arrest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[ADA:] Now, when you got up to the ninth floor, what did you see?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] Well, I saw him, he was in the hallway. I identified myself again. I asked him, 'Do you live in the building?' He didn't say anything. He turned and faced the wall. He had his head down with his hoodie. I asked him, 'Do you live in the building?' He wouldn't say anything. Then I noticed there was a bulge in his right arm. I asked him, 'Do you have any weapons?' He didn't say anything again. Once I saw the bulge I grabbed his wrist area and I felt the machete. I pulled up his sleeve, you know, just to see the tip of the machete, and definitely I was like, 'drop it, drop it.' He wouldn't drop it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[ADA:] Let me stop you right there. Just before you grabbed the bulge, did you say anything else to him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] I asked him, does he live in the building.

I usually like looking at people. And I noticed-I like to talk to people and have them thinking something else, because I saw the bulge, I knew there was something there because I asked him, 'Do you have any weapons?' And he refused to tell me anything. Plus he didn't show me his hands after I asked him to show me his hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[ADA:] Now, how was he holding-first of all-beg your pardon-which arm, left or right, did you see the bulge in?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] Right arm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[ADA:] And how was he holding his right arm?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] It was stiff and I couldn't see his hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[ADA:] When you say 'stiff,' do you mean like straight out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] Straight out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The Court[:] It wasn't like normally the way you stand with the arm a little bent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Are you saying his arms were at an angle to his body?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] No, straight down.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On cross examination Officer Rodriguez further explained why he grabbed defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] ... After that I asked him,\n   let me see your hands, because they were covered. I asked him several times, he didn't do it. At that point I decided, let me feel his arm, his wrist area.

Pulled it back and that's when I saw the tip.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel:] Because the sleeve on one arm did not resemble the other arm?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[Officer Rodriguez:] Thickness.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Officer Rodriguez immediately placed defendant in custody. The officer soon discovered that defendant lived in the building with his mother, on that same floor, approximately three doors away from where he was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant moved to suppress the fruits of Officer Rodriguez's search, namely the weapon and some money, on the grounds that the officer improperly stopped and grabbed him in the hallway. The court denied the motion. Defendant was subsequently convicted of robbery in the first degree and sentenced as a second felony offender to a term of 15 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction and sentence in a 3-2 decision, and, as relevant to this appeal, concluded that the police had a credible reason to follow defendant and that the police intrusion was\n   justified (\n   <em>\n    People v.

At the third level, a forcible stop and detention is justified in those cases where the officer has \"a reasonable suspicion that a particular person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a felony or misdemeanor\"; \"[a] corollary of the statutory right to temporarily detain for questioning is the authority to frisk if the officer reasonably suspects that he is in danger of physical injury by virtue of the detainee being armed\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20N.E.2d%20562\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   [citations omitted] ).

We need not decide the propriety of the initial inquiry, however, because, as discussed by the Appellate Division dissent, there is no legal support for the defendant's subsequent detention and frisk. Regardless of whether Officer Rodriguez had \"an objective, credible reason\" to follow defendant simply because defendant pushed the button after the officer asked him to keep the elevator door open, when the officer approached defendant on the ninth floor, he had no information that defendant was involved in criminal activity, and defendant did nothing to provide reasonable suspicion that he had or was about to commit a crime. Thus, there was no justification for the officer's use of physical force-in other words, there was no support for a level three intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Where, as here, police have no advance information about any criminality ascribed to an individual, and that person stands motionless and silent when approached, the police may not stop and detain, nor grab and place the person under arrest,\n   even if his shirtsleeve has a nondescript bulge. To illustrate the point, if defendant had been standing on a public street-in the heart of a \"high crime area\"-wearing a hoodie, with his arms pointed straight down, his hands covered by his sweater cuffs, and with one arm of his sleeve appearing \"thicker\" than the other as in an unshaped bulge, the police would have had no basis to approach and demand he answer questions. If there were no response from defendant in that hypothetical situation, they would also have had no right to grab his wrist and push up his sleeve. Such a level three intrusion is no less prohibited when an individual is in a residential building if the officers have no basis upon which to suspect that the person is involved in criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nevertheless, the People and the majority of this Court take the position that the circumstances of the encounter support a level three forcible intrusion. What are those circumstances? That the building was known for crime?

There has been recent interest in whether the approach\n    <em>\n     De Bour\n    </em>\n    sanctions should be reevaluated by the legislature or the courts. At a New York City Bar Association event marking\n    <em>\n     De Bour\n    </em>\n    ' s four-decade anniversary, former Chief Judge Sol Wachtler,\n    <em>\n     De Bour's\n    </em>\n    author, was quoted as stating, \"that's too long for a precedent of this sort, when you consider the change in communities, the change in morality, [and] the change in our sense of justice \" (Andrew Denney,\n    <em>\n     After 40 Years, 'De Bour' Author Sees Need for a Fresh Look\n    </em>\n    , NYLJ, May 23, 2016). Tellingly, many have critiqued\n    <em>\n     De Bour\n    </em>\n    as encouraging abusive police practices (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Emily J.

In practice, the possibility of classifying a stop as Level 2 or even Level 1 may lead police to perform a large number of stops-in the ordinary sense of the word, but inevitably often in the\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    sense as well-without the minimal foundation in reasonable suspicion required by the U.S. Constitution\"]; Dasha Kabakova,\n    <em>\n     The Lack of Accountability for the New York Police Department's Investigative Stops\n    </em>\n    , 10 Cardozo Pub L Pol'y &amp; Ethics J 539, 562-63 [2012] [\"in precincts in which blacks are less than 10% of the population, 'blacks remained over two times (2.17) more likely to be 'stopped' on suspicion of committing a violent crime than whites ...

While \"police officers have fairly broad authority to approach individuals and ask questions relating to identity or destination,\" that intrusion is only permissible where \"the officers do not act on whim or caprice and have an articulable reason not necessarily related to criminality for making the approach (\n    <em>\n     Hollman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4424157\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/181/#p189\">\n     79 N.Y.2d at 190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20N.Y.S.2d%20619\">\n     581 N.Y.S.2d 619\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n     590 N.E.2d 204\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , citing\n    <em>\n     De Bour\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2326325\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/40/210/\">\n     40 N.Y.2d at 219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20N.Y.S.2d%20375\">\n     386 N.Y.S.2d 375\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20N.E.2d%20562\">\n     352 N.E.2d 562\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). Officer Rodriguez, therefore, was prohibited from acting as he did when he approached and asked defendant questions simply because defendant exercised his constitutional right not to engage with the police. In fact, there is even some question as to whether that was defendant's intent when he pushed the elevator button, since he only traveled up two floors, unlikely to be sufficient for escape. Then, when he was approached by officers on the ninth floor, rather than flee, he merely sought to avoid interaction and potential conflict. In that tense situation, in which a body movement, or even eye movement, could be misinterpreted as \"furtive,\" \"sudden,\" or \"dangerous,\" raising alarm in the officers and potentially costing an individual their life, it was, at the very least, not suspicious for defendant to turn around and face the wall, remaining silent and motionless.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Since the People's evidence does not satisfy the \"minimum showing necessary\" to warrant a level three forcible detainment and frisk (\n    <em>\n     McRay\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4381628\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/51/594/#p601\">\n     51 N.Y.2d 594\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20N.Y.S.2d%20679\">\n     435 N.Y.S.2d 679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=416%20N.E.2d%201015\">\n     416 N.E.2d 1015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ),\n    <em>\n     a fortiori\n    </em>\n    , under the majority's mixed question analysis there is no record support for the lower courts' determination that the police acted appropriately.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
