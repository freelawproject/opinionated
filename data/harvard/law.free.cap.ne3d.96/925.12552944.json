Gardner contends that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. He also contends that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay costs that it did not impose at the sentencing hearing. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Gardner's convictions for aggravated menacing and obstructing official business and vacate his conviction for having weapons while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 15, 2016, a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Gardner on seven counts-one count of domestic violence, one count of aggravated menacing, one count of obstructing official business, one count of having weapons while under disability, one count of trafficking, one\n   count of drug possession and one count of possessing criminal tools. The charges arose out of a January 26, 2016 incident in which Gardner allegedly hit his girlfriend, Tierra Mosey, in the face during an argument, then threatened to shoot her, her children and the police. Police officers apprehended Gardner in the backyard of his parents' house and, during a search incident to his arrest, found a bag of suspected crack cocaine in his hat. When police conducted a search of the area after they apprehended Gardner, they recovered a gun that had been hidden in the bottom of a fire pit in the backyard, a few feet from where Gardner was apprehended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Gardner waived his right to a jury trial. At trial, the state presented testimony from five witnesses-Mosey, CMHA police officers Robert Lenz, Aaron Luther and Ashley Jaycox and Detective Darren Reeves with the Cleveland Police Department's domestic violence unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mosey testified that on the evening of January 26, 2016, she and Gardner got into an argument when Gardner, Gardner's friend Devotie Cobb, III and Gardner's sister, Tiffany Gardner (\"Tiffany\"), were moving Gardner's belongings out of Mosey's apartment. Mosey claimed that Gardner was drunk and that Gardner \"back-smacked\" her, i.e., hit her with the back of his hand, in the side of the face, causing her to fall down a short flight of stairs. Mosey testified that after Gardner hit her, she was \"mad\" and that the side of her face was \"a little numb for a minute\" but that she \"didn't have no bruises,\" \"did not hurt nothing\" and was not treated for any injuries as a result of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mosey ran out of the apartment, told Tiffany she was going to call the police and then went over to an aunt's house from where she called 911. After calling the police, Mosey returned to her apartment. Gardner left before the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} CMHA police officers Lenz, Luther and Jaycox responded to the call and began questioning Mosey about the incident. While Mosey was talking with the police, Gardner called her ten or more times on her cell phone. At the direction of one of the officers, Mosey ultimately answered the phone and activated the speaker function so that the officers could hear their conversation. Mosey testified that Gardner said, \"B* * * *, I'm about to come shoot you and your kids.\" When Mosey informed Gardner that she was with the police, Gardner responded that he \"didn't care\" and that he \"got one for them, too.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Officers Lenz, Luther and Jaycox overheard Mosey and Gardner's conversation. Officer Lenz testified that he heard Gardner state \"several times\" that \"he couldn't believe she called the cops on him,\" that he would shoot her and her two sons and that if any law enforcement officials \"came out to him,\" he was going to \"shoot it out with them,\" too. Officers Luther and Jaycox offered similar testimony, i.e., that Gardner was upset that Mosey had called the police, that he threatened to kill Mosey and her children and that he stated that if the police came to his location, he would shoot them, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After hearing Gardner's threats, Officer Luther identified himself to Gardner and asked Gardner his location. After several requests for the information, Gardner told the officer that he was at his parents' house on Project Avenue in Cleveland and gave the officer the address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Officers Luther and Lenz proceeded to Gardner's parents' house while Officer Jaycox stayed behind with Mosey and continued to interview her. Officer Jaycox testified that Mosey told her that she had previously seen Gardner with what Mosey described as a silver and black .38 caliber firearm and that \"about a month prior,\n   whenever he had carried the firearm,\" Gardner \"would store\" it in his parents' backyard \"in the vicinity between a parked car and a fire pit.\" Officer Jaycox testified that she relayed this information to the other officers who were attempting to apprehend Gardner; however, Officer Luther denied that he received the information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When Officers Luther and Lenz arrived at Gardner's parents' house, Gardner was in the front yard in an \"aggressive stance.\" Gardner ignored the officers' commands to get on the ground and, instead, told the officers to \"[c]ome on,\" then ran into the house through the front door out the side door and into the backyard. Officer Luther followed Gardner into the house while Officer Lenz went around the side of the house towards the backyard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Officer Lenz testified that when he made contact with Gardner in the backyard, he told Gardner \"several more times to get on the ground\" before Gardner finally complied. He testified that, at this point, additional officers arrived on scene who assisted in handcuffing Gardner and placing him in the zone car. During a search incident to his arrest, officers discovered a bag of suspected crack cocaine hidden in the brim of a winter hat Gardner was wearing. Police also recovered a .22 caliber revolver in the bottom of a fire pit in the backyard, a few feet from where Gardner was apprehended. Detective Reeves testified that the gun was analyzed for fingerprints but that \"[n]o latent prints of value were detected.\" The suspected drugs were tested and determined to be crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After the state presented its case, Gardner moved for a dismissal of all counts under Crim.R. 29. The state conceded that it had not presented sufficient evidence on the trafficking count. The trial court granted Gardner's motion for acquittal on the trafficking count and denied the motion as to the remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In his defense, Gardner presented testimony from his sister Tiffany and his friend Cobb who were helping Gardner move out of Mosey's apartment at the time of the alleged incident. Tiffany claimed that Mosey was begging Gardner not to leave and denied that Gardner struck Mosey. Tiffany testified that she was peering through the screen door the entire time Gardner was in the apartment retrieving his belongings and that \"ain't nobody touch her.\" Tiffany claimed that this was not the first time Mosey had lied, but rather, that \"she do this all the time.\" Tiffany described a prior incident in which Mosey had posted a photograph on social media claiming that Gardner had given her a black eye, then, five minutes later, posted another photograph without it, saying that she \"was just playing\" and that she had used makeup to create the \"black eye.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Cobb likewise denied that Gardner hit Mosey. He testified that he was sitting at the bottom of the stairs waiting for Gardner to come back with more of his belongings when Mosey stopped Gardner on the stairs asking why he was leaving her. Cobb testified that Gardner told her that their relationship was over and that the couple argued for approximately 20 minutes before Gardner eventually went up the stairs \"to go past her.\" Cobb testified that Gardner \"brushed up on [Mosey]\" as he went up the stairs then came back down and handed Cobb a bag to take to the car. Cobb testified that before he left the porch, Mosey ran past him, telling Tiffany that Gardner had hit her. Cobb testified that he asked Mosey when Gardner had hit her. Mosey did not answer his question but said that they \"better hurry up and leave\" because she was calling the police. At the close of all the evidence,\n   Gardner renewed his Crim.R. 29 motion. The trial court, once again, denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court found Gardner guilty of aggravated menacing in violation of R.C. 2903.21(A), obstructing official business in violation of R.C. 2921.31(A), having weapons while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) and drug possession in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). The trial court found Gardner not guilty on the remaining counts. Gardner was sentenced to two years of community control sanctions on each count. Although the trial court did not mention costs at the sentencing hearing, on June 1, 2016, the trial court issued a sentencing journal imposing costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Gardner appealed, raising the following three assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Assignment of Error I:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Appellant's convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and the trial court erred by denying his motion for acquittal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Assignment of Error II:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Assignment of Error III:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court erred by imposing costs where it found appellant indigent, did not impose costs in open court and failed to consider his inability to pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In his first and second assignments of error, Gardner contends that the trial court erred in denying his Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal and that his convictions for aggravated menacing, obstructing official business and having weapons while under disability lack sufficient evidence and are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although they involve different standards of review, because they involve interrelated issues, many of the same arguments and a review of the same evidence, we address Gardner's first and second assignments of error together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} A Crim.R. 29(A) motion for acquittal tests the sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In support of his argument, Gardner points out that when he threatened to shoot Mosey and her children, the police were already at her apartment, that Gardner thereafter disclosed his location to the police and that the police immediately went to Gardner's location and apprehended him. He also points to testimony by his sister which he contends shows that \"lying was typical behavior for Mosey\" and that Mosey had previously falsely accused Gardner of hurting her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The state presented competent, credible evidence from which the trial court could have reasonably found that Mosey subjectively believed that Gardner would carry out his threat and cause serious physical harm to her or her children. Mosey testified that Gardner was drunk and agitated and that, earlier that evening when they were at her parents' residence, she had to take him outside to \"try to calm him down\" \"[b]ecause he go crazy.\" Mosey further testified that after Gardner left her apartment and while she was talking with the police, Gardner called her cell phone ten times before she answered it. Heedless of the consequences, and notwithstanding Mosey's statement to him that she was with the police, Gardner threatened to shoot not only Mosey and her children but also the police. Mosey testified that she had previously seen Gardner with a gun. She further testified that when she heard Gardner's threats, she was \"scared\" because \"you never know what he will do\" and because \"you never know what a drunk person will do.\" Officer Jaycox testified that when she interviewed Mosey after the incident she was \"[v]ery upset,\" was crying and \"appeared to be afraid.\" Further, Mosey testified that Gardner had struck her earlier that evening. Although the trial court determined that the state did not prove its domestic violence charge beyond a reasonable doubt, Mosey's testimony that Gardner had acted out violently against her earlier that evening was nevertheless probative of her state of mind and could support the trial court's finding that Mosey believed Gardner would seriously harm her or her children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 24} With respect to Gardner's challenges to Mosey's credibility, including Tiffany's testimony regarding Mosey's \"propensity to lie,\" even assuming what Tiffany said was true, it would not preclude the trial court from believing all or part of Mosey's testimony in this case. The trial court was in the best position to weigh the evidence and assess the witnesses' credibility and was entitled to believe or disbelieve all, part or none of each witness' testimony. Based on the record here, we cannot say that the trial court \"clearly lost its way\" or \"created a manifest miscarriage of justice\" in convicting Gardner of aggravated menacing under R.C. 2903.21(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Obstructing Official Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} R.C. 2921.31(A) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   No person, without privilege to do so and with purpose to prevent, obstruct, or delay the performance by a public official of any authorized act within the\n   public official's official capacity, shall do any act that hampers or impedes a public official in the performance of the public official's lawful duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Gardner challenges his conviction for obstructing official business on sufficiency and manifest weight grounds because (1) he did not flee from Mosey's apartment, rather, he was moving out, (2) he told the police, when asked, where he was and (3) he was \"readily apprehended\" once police arrived at his parents' house. Although Gardner acknowledges that Officer Lenz testified that Gardner's actions made it \"a little harder\" for police to apprehend him, he contends that such evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction for obstructing official business.

Based on that evidence, it could be reasonably inferred that Gardner knew, when the police arrived at Gardner's parents home, that they were there to apprehend him. Officer Lenz and Luther testified that when they arrived at Gardner's parents' house, Gardner was in the front yard, in an \"aggressive stance.\" They stated that Gardner ignored the officers' repeated commands to \"get on the ground, show us your hands\" and, instead, threw his hands up in the air, screaming, \"Come on. Let's do it\" and \"things of that nature,\" before retreating into the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Gardner entered the house through the front door then ran out the side door into the backyard where he was again confronted by Officer Lenz.

The evidence does not weigh heavily against Gardner's conviction. The officers' testimony was consistent and credible. It is common sense that Gardner's actions in running from the police-first into the house and then out of the house and into the backyard-instead of complying with the officers' commands to \"get on the ground,\" delayed and hindered his arrest. There is no dispute that the police officers who responded to Gardner's parents' house and attempted to apprehend Gardner were public officials \"in the performance of [their] lawful duties\" and that Gardner had no \"privilege\" to act as he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Having Weapons While Under Disability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Although we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support Gardner's convictions for aggravated menacing\n   and obstructing official business, we find that there was insufficient evidence to support Gardner's conviction for having weapons while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 32} R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [N]o person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if * * * [t]he person is under indictment for or has been convicted of any felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Gardner stipulated to a prior drug trafficking conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 33} To \"have\" a firearm within the meaning of R.C. 2923.13(A), a person must have actual or constructive possession of it.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Officer Lenz testified that when Gardner dropped to his knees, he reached towards his own body, away from the fire pit, \"towards like, either his waistband or his jacket pocket.\" Gardner then complied fully with the officer's directive and laid on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Gardner did not live with his parents at that time; he had lived with Mosey and had been living with her continuously for a year.

Gardner continued to make threats, saying that if the police came to find him, he would shoot them. As the police left to apprehend Gardner, the girlfriend told an officer that Gardner not only owned a gun, but kept it in the backyard of his father's house, near a fire pit. The police responded to the father's house with weapons drawn, ordering Gardner to the ground. An intoxicated Gardner refused, and taunted them by saying \"come on, come on.\" He then ran into the house. One officer followed him; the other officer ran around to the back of the house. Gardner emerged from the house into the back yard, within arm's reach of a fire pit (\"less than three feet away\"). An officer intercepted Gardner and ordered him to the ground. After Gardner was arrested, the police found a firearm stashed inside the fire pit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 60} From these facts, a rational trier of fact could infer that Gardner was running toward the fire pit with the intention of retrieving the gun. Importantly, the facts proved that the girlfriend not only correctly said that Gardner owned a firearm, but that he kept the gun outside of his father's house near the fire pit. The path that Gardner took when running from the police placed him just a few feet from where the firearm was found. Gardner was plainly trying to elude the police and he took a path that led him to the very spot where the police had been told the firearm was hidden. Given that Gardner had threatened to shoot the police and was belligerent when they responded to the house, a rational trier of fact could find his actions consistent with those of a person who constructively possessed the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 61} The majority observes that the girlfriend's description of the gun did not exactly match the gun found in the fire pit.

Viewing the testimony most favorably to the state showed that Gardner, who had just threatened to shoot his girlfriend, her children, and the police, was apprehended within three feet of the fire pit where the girlfriend specifically told police Gardner kept a weapon hidden. Based on these facts, I find that the state presented sufficient evidence that Gardner was in constructive possession of a weapon while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Gardner does not challenge his conviction for drug possession.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Although Gardner contends that \"[b]y rendering a not guilty verdict on the domestic violence charge, the court demonstrated that it did not find Mosey's testimony or allegations against Gardner credible,\" that contention is contradicted by the record. In issuing its verdict on the domestic violence charge, the trial court specifically stated that \"there was credible evidence from the victim in this case.\" The trial court, however, indicated that because \"[t]here was contrary evidence about possible motivation,\" the state did not meet its high burden of proving that offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Officer Luther was not the officer who discovered the firearm.
