This is one of those cases. In another of those cases,\n   <em>\n    Rental Prop. Mgt.

We also held that, to the extent that he was acting as the agent of the property owner, Basile engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by signing and filing the complaint because he was not an attorney.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553184\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/319/#p546\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553184\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/319/#p546\">\n    . at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, we held that Basile's conduct on its own did not constitute an unfair or deceptive practice in violation of G. L. c. 93A.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553184\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/319/#p546\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553184\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/319/#p546\">\n    . at 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In 2016, Basile filed a summary process complaint in the Housing Court to evict Shavonna Williams from her home. Where the complaint form asked for the name of the \"PLAINTIFF/LANDLORD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   /OWNER,\" Basile wrote the name of his sole proprietorship: \"Rental Property Management Services.\" Where the complaint asked for the name and signature of the \"Plaintiff or Attorney,\" Basile printed and signed his own name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Williams asserted counterclaims against Basile for the unauthorized practice of law and violations of G. L. c. 93A. In answer to Williams' request for admissions, Basile admitted that he is neither the owner nor the lessor of the\n   property in which Williams resides,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he is not an attorney. He also admitted that since 2007, he has initiated over ninety summary process cases in his own name or in the name of Rental Property Management Services with respect to properties that he does not own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Williams moved for partial summary judgment on her c. 93A counterclaims, arguing that by commencing a summary process action against her when he was neither the owner nor the lessor of the property, and was not an attorney, Basile had committed an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of c. 93A. Loretta Hatcher, the tenant in\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553184\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/319/#p546\">\n    479 Mass. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , brought a similar motion, based on the same conduct by Basile, and both motions were argued in the same hearing. Although the cases were not consolidated, the judge ruled on both motions in a single order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judge found that it was undisputed that Basile was not the owner or the lessor of the properties at issue, and therefore concluded that both cases were subject to dismissal. The judge enjoined Basile from commencing summary process actions in his own name or in the name of Rental Property Management Services with respect to properties he does not own or lease. However, the judge denied the tenants' motions for partial summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of Basile on the tenants' c. 93A counterclaims, for reasons summarized in detail in\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12553184\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/97/319/#p546\">\n    479 Mass. at 545-546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .
