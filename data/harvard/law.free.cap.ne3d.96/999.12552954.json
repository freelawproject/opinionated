For the following reasons, we reverse and remand the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS, CASE HISTORY AND JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Boyland alleges that on July 30, 2013 while at a Giant Eagle grocery store, she was struck in the back and knocked down by defendant, Emmanuel Enofe. Enofe was pushing a Giant Eagle shopping cart filled with boxes that he was delivering to the store. As a result of the incident, Boyland claims back and neck pain and seeks damages for past and future medical expenses and non-economic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Boyland avers that Enofe was an employee of defendants-appellees, Prestige Delivery Systems, Inc. (hereinafter \"Prestige\") and Giant Eagle. Boyland states in the complaint that Enofe, acting in the course and scope of his employment, was negligent. (Compl. at \u00b6 4.) The complaint alleges that Prestige and Giant Eagle were aware of Enofe overloading his cart and obstructing his own vision such that his collision with Boyland occurred. Prestige and Giant Eagle filed a motion for summary\n   judgment arguing that Enofe was an independent contractor and they were not liable and that Boyland failed to allege that Enofe's negligence could be imputed to Giant Eagle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On August 18, 2016, the trial court granted Prestige's and Giant Eagles' motion for summary judgment. The trial court found that Boyland made no allegations that liability should be imputed to Giant Eagle on the basis that Giant Eagle was the owner of the subject property and therefore these arguments should fail as a matter of law. The trial court also found that Boyland made no argument of liability under apparent agency or agency by estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court concluded that there is no evidence in the record that Giant Eagle or Prestige controlled or retained the right to control the mode and manner of Enofe's work. The trial court found that Boyland failed to establish any genuine issue of material fact that Enofe is an employee of Prestige or Giant Eagle. Prestige's and Giant Eagles' motion for summary judgment was granted and all claims against them were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On January 23, 2017, Boyland dismissed her complaint only as to Enofe, pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). Boyland then filed a notice of appeal on February 20, 2017 from the August 18, 2016 decision granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The August 18, 2016 interlocutory summary judgment order dismissing Giant Eagle and Prestige was converted into a final appealable order when Boyland dismissed defendant Enofe from the lawsuit pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). \"[A] Civ.R. 41 dismissal dismisses all claims against the defendant designated in the dismissal notice and does not apply to defendants named in the complaint who are not designated in the notice of dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Denham v.

Thus, a person employed to perform certain work is not necessarily a mere servant because the contract provides that the work shall be subject to the approval or satisfaction of the employer.

Enofe had a working relationship with Prestige since December 2010. (Mot. for Sum. Jgmt. at Ex. A.) Enofe had a contract with Prestige that he believed made him an independent contractor. (Enofe dep., at 19; Orlando Hill dep. at 8.) Enofe was not told by Prestige to carry insurance other than car insurance. (Enofe dep. at 5-6.) Enofe was required by his contract with Prestige to carry car insurance, which he apparently had at the time of the incident. (Hill dep. at 16.) The contract with Enofe contains an indemnification clause. (Hill dep. at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 27} It is not clear whether Enofe received a 1099 or W-2 tax form from Prestige:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. All right. You did not receive any type of a W-2, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. Yeah. I receive it, every year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. You receive a 1099?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. Every year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. Okay. A 1099?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Enofe dep. at 20.) Enofe believes that there was money removed from his weekly pay check that covered some sort of insurance, other than car insurance, but after the incident at Giant Eagle he was told that this insurance was not used within the work premises:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q. Did they ever request you to get any other type of insurance apart from your auto coverage?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. Yeah. There was a second time, you know, I thought about-they just-they sent a paper around that day. From today, we need to give you some insurance because according to our paycheck, every week they take about, $33 a week from our paycheck, that $33, plus for the office, paperwork and everything, that's what they use-that is my mind. After that, the same, at about that same time, they came, they say we put-maybe, like, $10 off or $10 a week from your paycheck. They said this one is going to be for insurance. This is insurance. This is for your insurance because of an eventuality. But when this incident happened, I talked to my boss about my insurance, they told me that insurance is not-is not insurance that you use within the work premises in case you have any problem, that's all they told me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. And did you ever get a copy of that declaration page for that insurance that they take money from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A. No, they did not give us nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Q. Did you ever get a copy of any policy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Enofe dep. at 24-25.) It is clear that Enofe is unsure of what insurance his paycheck is being deducted for. Further he uses language that would be more typical of an employee when talking about his \"boss\" and \"paycheck.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Enofe goes to the Prestige warehouse everyday as many other people go to their office. \"[O]ur warehouse is our office, it's our everything, that's where we go, everybody go there every day.\" (Enofe dep. at 27.) It is clear that Enofe receives all of his deliveries from the Prestige warehouse. Prestige brings a large delivery to its warehouse location where \"the independent contractor shows up to that location, goes to the area where his particular area may be in that facility, verifies he has everything and proceeds to make deliveries.\" (Hill dep. at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Enofe said that Prestige gave instructions as how to do his job and to deliver stuff in the way that they asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. Okay. Did Prestige Delivery in any way give you instruction as to how to do your job?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q. And what instruction did they give you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A. When the employee-they told us they give us stuff to deliver, you have to deliver it in the way we ask you do it, but if you go to a store, let them sign for whatever you deliver. We have a plan on how to print out everything at the time we deliver the stuff and send it to the warehouse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (Enofe dep. at 20.) Prestige goes into more detail in describing Enofe's work:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A. He would have shown up to an area in the warehouse where his freight would have been staged. He would have gotten everything for that particular area and proceeded to make deliveries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. I want to know how he gets the information where to go, that's what I'm-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A. The routes are staged in the same place every day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q. So you put paperwork in a place where he goes to check to see if he got any deliveries?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A Typically, an individual that provides the service, he does freight every day, may not be the same customer, may not be the same address.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A. His freight would be at a location inside the Columbus warehouse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. Okay. And do you take that document from Giant Eagle and somebody\n   take that document to the warehouse and stick it into his box?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. It could have even been uploaded into scanners. The independent contractors rent scanners also.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (Hill dep. at 21-22.) Prestige's representative further describes the operation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A. Our operation is somewhat like UPS, where the same individual covers the same group of zip codes, sort of speak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Q. And how was the guy paid? Was he paid per volume or per trip or what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A. It-it varies depending on what customer he services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Q. Is it based on time or amount of product?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   A. No, it could-it's probably based on the delivery and the number of pieces. So the delivery address, and maybe up to a certain amount of pieces.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   (Hill dep. at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Some of the deliveries for Prestige did not have a time frame. (Enofe dep. at 20.) It seems that Enofe can refuse to do a delivery if he is sick and cannot do the job that day:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Q. Did you say that you have the option of saying, no, I'm not going to make that delivery or no, I'm not going to do it today?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A. When they give your route, the option you have is if you are not okay or if you are sick, you can say, I'm sorry. I'm sick. I can't do this job today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Q. Okay. And then-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A. And if I'm sick, not today because somebody have to do it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   (Enofe dep. at 30, 32.) Enofe was required to provide his own equipment and vehicle in making deliveries. (Enofe dep. at 21.) Prestige did not provide any delivery equipment to physically remove the deliveries like a dolly or a cart. Enofe determined the route he was to take to make deliveries. (Enofe dep. at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Enofe was previously asked to make the delivery to customer service at the front of the Giant Eagle store. (Enofe dep. at 7.) It is not clear whether Giant Eagle or Prestige directed where Enofe was to place the signs he was delivering. Enofe delivered the signs with a Giant Eagle shopping cart. (Enofe dep. at 7.) The testimony is unclear what directions Prestige would give in making a delivery other than having someone sign for the delivery. (Enofe dep. at 21.) Prestige's representative, Hill, states that Giant Eagle gives directions on where to pick up the products that are to be delivered. (Hill dep. at 6-7.) Prestige claims that the information on where in the store to deliver the items are passed on from Giant Eagle to Enofe. (Hill dep. at 13.) Giant Eagle corporate would tell the delivery man what to pick up and where to deliver the weekly advertisement signs. (Glenda Taylor dep. at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 32} As to the central question of who controls what Enofe is doing, or who tells him what to do, the answer from the deposition is not clear. Nor is there a clear description of the general process in which Enofe works that would clearly delineate him as an independent contractor. Further on the crucial question of who told Enofe to make the delivery to Giant Eagle's customer service station at the front of the store seems to indicate that Prestige gave that instruction but that certainly is not the only conclusion from a plain reading of the deposition. (Enofe dep. at 31-32.) The depositions of Taylor and Marcus Rogan certainly indicate that Giant Eagle directed where the sign deliveries were to be placed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The impression from reading the deposition of Enofe is that Enofe did not fully understand all of the questions being\n   presented to him. A simple reading of the transcript allows for multiple interpretations of the answers that were given. It is clear that at certain points, there was a failure to communicate and not every miscommunication was properly clarified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Taking the totality of the depositions and exhibits in the record and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of Boyland, reasonable minds cannot come to but one conclusion, that Enofe was an independent contractor. The material fact of whether Enofe was an employee of Prestige or an independent contractor remains to be litigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. APPARENT AGENCY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Boyland has also sought to establish apparent agency of Enofe with a principal of either Giant Eagle or Prestige. \"In order to establish apparent agency, the evidence must show that the principal held the agent out to the public as possessing sufficient authority to act on his behalf and that the person dealing with the agent knew these facts, and acting in good faith had reason to believe that the agent possessed the necessary authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081845\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/118/119/\">\n    118 Ohio St.3d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-1809\">\n    2008-Ohio-1809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20N.E.2d%20827\">\n    886 N.E.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 36} As stated, we find that operative facts were alleged to support a claim of negligence through apparent agency. The evidence does not support a motion for summary judgment. Reasonable minds can come to more than one conclusion on whether Enofe was held out as the apparent agent of either Giant Eagle or Prestige. Appellees have failed to meet the burden of their initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of Boyland's claim.\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   at 292,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=662%20N.E.2d%20264\">\n    662 N.E.2d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Summary judgment is not appropriate as to a claim of negligence through apparent agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. NONDELEGABLE DUTY OF ORDINARY CARE TO BUSINESS INVITEES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Boyland also has claimed that Giant Eagle is liable as it owes a duty to business invitees to warn of dangerous conditions known to the proprietor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 38} An employer is generally not liable for the negligent acts of independent contractors. There are exceptions to this general rule, several of which stem from the nondelegable duty doctrine. \"Nondelegable duties arise in various situations that generally fall into two categories: (1) affirmative duties that are imposed on the employer by statute, contract, franchise, charter, or common law and (2) duties imposed on the employer that arise out of the work itself because its performance creates dangers to others,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , inherently dangerous work.\"\n   <em>\n    Pusey v.

Enofe was delivering cardboard boxes loaded with signs. (Enofe dep. at 7.) The boxes in the cart were taller than the cart itself. (Enofe dep. at 8.) The store was busy at the time. (Enofe dep. at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The boxes were normally larger than what would fit in a shopping cart that Enofe would get from the Giant Eagle. (Taylor dep. at 8.) Enofe was delivering three or four boxes about five feet tall each at the same time, none of which fit in the grocery cart he was using. (Enofe dep. at 16.) The cart was filled with either three or four boxes with dimensions about three feet wide and four feet tall that contained the display items. (Taylor dep. at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 44} The deliveries to the front of the store had been occurring weekly for a long time. Display items were being delivered to Giant Eagle. (Hill dep. at 8.) Deliveries are made to this Giant Eagle on a regular basis. (Hill dep. at 19.) Giant Eagle indicates that Enofe had always delivered the boxes in the same way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q. Okay. And he had them stacked in a normal ordinary grocery cart, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   A. Correct\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q. Is that the way he always delivered them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   A. Yes, that I have seen, that's the way they always bring them in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Q. Did you ever note when that obscured his vision?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   A. Honestly, I don't know that I've seen them bring them in that often. They just come in at night, drop them off, and then leave. They don't need a signature or anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   (Taylor dep. at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Giant Eagle clearly knew about these regular deliveries and had directed Enofe to make these deliveries in the front of the store amongst the patrons. There is no evidence that they took reasonable precautions to address that danger. The delivery man would place the advertising box in the same place in the front of the store to the back of the service deck in front of the cash office. (Taylor dep. at 7, 15.) The boxes are normally large which could not fit in the cart that Enofe would get from the Giant Eagle. (Taylor dep. at 8.) Giant Eagle manager Taylor was unaware of any Giant Eagle employee asking Enofe to move the cart in such a way that he could see where he was going. (Taylor dep. at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Giant Eagle had many employees in the front of the store that regularly saw the deliveries being made. There are \"call coordinators\" that monitor the area of the\n   accident. (Taylor dep. at 7.) Giant Eagle had a Columbus police officer working special duty when the accident happened. (Taylor dep. at 9.) Marcus Rogan the manager on duty the day of the incident indicated that if an employee saw Enofe delivering merchandise in such a manner that he could not see where he was going they would tell him to stop. (Rogan dep., at 11.) Glenda Taylor who acts as a manager for Giant Eagle said that if an employee, whether working the checkout lanes or not, saw a carrier pushing a cart with signs piled so high they could not see where they were going it would be their responsibility to inform management. (Taylor dep. at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Viewing the evidence most favorably to Boyland, we find that the weekly delivery of the advertisement signs represented a danger that Giant Eagle was well aware of and did nothing to mitigate or take reasonable precautions against and that Giant Eagle had a duty to warn patrons of this dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Summary judgment is not appropriate. Viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of Boyland, we find that there are genuine issues of material fact that remain to be litigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The sole assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellees could find themselves in a conflict of interest situation. Enofe could be found by a factfinder to be an employee and Giant Eagle could be found liable for allowing a dangerous situation to continue to take place on their property. It is apparent that Giant Eagle and Prestige shared the belief that Enofe should be found to be an independent contractor and that would shield them both completely from liability. This assumption at this stage of the proceeding is in error. Liability could attach other ways and Enofe might be found to be an employee. These two parties might wish to detangle themselves as litigation proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   BRUNNER and HORTON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
