Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 16, 2016, Officer John Koehler of the Uniontown Police Department responded to a disturbance call at 1349 Sugarbush Avenue. The call reported two irate females knocking on doors in the early morning hours, claiming to have been abducted, injected with drugs and possibly chased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Officer Koehler met the females outside the residence of the caller. The females were identified as Ashley Hutchison and Kayla Hill. Officer Koehler observed the women appeared to be under the influence of either drugs or alcohol. The females claimed to have been abducted by a man, identified as \"Josh,\" who \"shot them up\" with something. They maintained they were being chased by a man with a flashlight, and feared they would be raped or killed. Neighbors also reported seeing a man with a flashlight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Officer Koehler asked the females to direct him to the house. The women pointed to the residence at 13425 Sugarbush Avenue Northwest. The women told the officers they had gone to the residence in the evening to hang out and play pool with Davis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After ingesting the methamphetamine, the women stated they felt paranoid and suffered from a headache. Ashley Hutchison showered, and afterwards heard Kayla Hill and Davis arguing over a purse Hill found. The purse contained a gun, and Hill told Davis the purse did not belong to her. The women further reported observing a shotgun inside the residence. Believing someone else was inside the house based upon the purse being found there and the shotgun, the women left carrying a knife with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Chief Howard Britt of the Uniontown Police Department arrived on the scene. The officers together approached the front door of the residence and knocked numerous times. No answer was received. Davis's car was identified in the driveway. The officers then walked to the rear of the residence to attempt to make contact at a rear, sliding patio door. A light was on inside. The officers entered through a fenced in backyard, although they testified the gate was open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At the basement patio door, Officer Koehler again knocked, and received no answer. The patio sliding glass door was partially covered by a blanket. However, the officers could see the components of a meth lab inside. Officer Koehler noticed the door was unlocked and entered. Officer Koehler then observed Davis, unconscious on the couch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Due to the nature of methamphetamine labs, the house was evacuated and the Stark County Metro Drug Unit and fire department arrived at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Davis was indicted on one count of illegal manufacture of drugs, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A)(C)(3) ; illegal assembly or\n   possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs, in violation of R.C. 2925.041(A) ; aggravated possession of drugs, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(1)(b) ; and possession of drug abuse instruments, in violation of R.C. 2925.12(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On April 19, 2016, Davis filed a motion to suppress.

We agree that the officers had a substantial, legitimate law enforcement objective that permitted intrusion into the curtilage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Additionally, the trial court found competent, credible evidence that the gate was unlocked and open at the time the officers approached on the walkway,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the defendant testified that he believed the gate would have been closed, the Court finds the testimony of Officer Koehler that the gate was open, coupled with the testimony of Chief Britt who did not recall even seeing a gate, to be credible and consistent with each other as well as consistent with the defendant's acknowledgement that he was unsure if the girls may have left the gate open when they fled. As such, the Court finds this walkway access to the patio to be significant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Supp. T. at n. 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The officer testified the sliding glass door, which opened on to a deck, looked like a customary entry, and the jury necessarily found the officer restricted his movement to places where visitors could be expected to go.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592389\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/348/#p350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592389\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/348/#p350\">\n    at 349, 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the case at bar, the officers had no reasonable belief the sliding door in back of the house was used by visitors in approaching the home. The area was fenced in, near a pool, and under an upper deck with another sliding door, accessing the main living area of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hardesty v. Hamburg Twp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672706\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/646/#p653\">\n    461 F.3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2006), officers saw lights go off inside the house as they approached. In this case, the officers did not point to activity inside the house which led them to believe Appellant was inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 33} I find the evidence does not support a reasonable belief Appellant was inside the house sufficient to extend the \"knock and talk\" to the back sliding door, inside the fenced area. The neighbors reported to police they saw a flashlight coming\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   the house, but not specifically from\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   the house. Tr. 9. The girls indicated Appellant was chasing them\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   with a flashlight. Tr. 35. Officers did not point to any signs from inside the residence that would lead them to believe Appellant was inside the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Further, I do not find exigent circumstances for the entrance into the curtilage of the house. During his investigation and prior to entering the residence, Officer Koehler learned the women had voluntarily gone to the residence to hang out with Appellant. They consented to his injecting them with methamphetamine. Officer Koehler conceded the girls were not in any danger of imminent harm at the time the officers entered the residence. Tr. 26. He further conceded he was not given any information Appellant himself injected methamphetamine or overdosed from the injection of methamphetamine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672706\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/646/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The women claimed to fear they would be raped or killed by Appellant, but were clearly no longer in danger upon the arrival of law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} While the women stated they found a purse containing a gun inside the residence and a shotgun in one of the bedrooms, they did not observe another person in the residence, and did not claim to be in harm or afraid of another person. Rather, they claimed to be afraid of or in danger from Appellant alone. I would find the exigent circumstances exception does not apply herein as the officers did not have reason to believe Appellant was in imminent danger or posed an imminent danger to another person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Accordingly, I would conclude the evidence is not admissible under the plain view exception as the officers were not\n   lawfully on the premises at the time the evidence was in view. I would sustain the assignment of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court overruling Appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
