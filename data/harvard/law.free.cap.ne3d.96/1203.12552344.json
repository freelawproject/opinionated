As is relevant herein, Lewis was charged with aggravated murder, murder, attempted murder, three counts of felonious assault, all containing various one-year and three-year firearm specifications, criminal gang activity specifications, repeat violent offender specifications and a notice of a prior conviction, as well as discharging a firearm near prohibited premises, and having a weapon while under disability. Lewis pled not guilty and the matter proceeded to a jury trial on June 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Elder testified that a number of his friends are members of ATM Jack Boyz gang, but that he is not in a gang. During the evening of April 15, 2013, while Elder and Neal were walking from Neal's home on East 134th Street near Caine Avenue, to a store near Beachwood Avenue, all within an area considered ATM Jack Boyz territory, they were suddenly fired upon. Elder was struck in the leg. Neal was shot in the head and abdomen, and died from her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Elder determined that the shots came from behind them. It was \"kind of dark,\" but when he looked back, he saw a man four or five houses away, wearing a \"red hoody that was tied tight, you could only see the nose and the mouth of the person.\" As Elder's friends, \"Diaz\" and Jermaine Cottrell, a.k.a. \"Mane,\" arrived in response to the gunfire, Elder observed the man in the red hooded sweatshirt driving by in a small white car. Elder told police that the assailant was short, stocky, with a \"big nose and big lips.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Elder testified that he \"felt like [he] did recognize him\" and he believed the assailant was Lewis, a J-Park gang member, who had a prior altercation with Elder's brother. Elder conceded that he may have not immediately given Lewis's name to police, but he testified that in the days or weeks that followed, he provided police with the name of Jamall Lewis as the person he \"thought\" was a suspect in\n   the shooting. Additionally, Elder listed Lewis's name as a possible suspect on a Victim of Crime Compensation application. Shortly before trial, Elder identified Lewis in a photo array, then again in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Cleveland police subsequently learned the name of the owner of the vehicle that Elder observed immediately after the shooting, but they excluded him from involvement in the shooting. However, Cleveland Police Detective Tim Entenok (\"Det. Entenok\") testified that early the next morning, Elder informed police that Jamall Lewis was a suspect. (Tr. 111.) The police also recovered 16 fired bullet shell casings from the area, including .40 caliber, .45 caliber and 9 mm caliber shells, linked to three specific handguns. Using the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (\"NIBIN\"), the police linked the .40 shell casings to a Taurus pistol that was seized during an arrest in Bedford Heights. However, the caliber of the pellet recovered from Neal's body could not be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} By March 2015, S.L. was being detained in the juvenile detention center, pending mandatory bindover for aggravated robbery with a firearm specification, and he decided to cooperate with law enforcement. Cleveland police detectives interviewed him twice before obtaining a proffer statement on March 6, 2015. S.L. stated that at the time of the proffer, detectives did not know that he would address this matter, and that he, and not the police, initiated discussion of this shooting. Before the proffer, the state had not offered him any plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} S.L. admitted that prior to his proffer, he was facing mandatory bindover and indictment for aggravated robbery with firearm and gang activity specifications, as well as a charge of having a weapon while under disability. As a result of his proffer, the state agreed that S.L. would serve ten months in a juvenile facility for his offenses, so \"long as he came in and testified truthfully\" against Lee, Shropshire, and Lewis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} S.L. testified that he is a member of the J-Park gang, and that ATM Jack Boyz gang members are their enemies. On the afternoon of April 15, 2013, while S.L. was walking past the Lee Harvard Plaza, ATM Jack Boyz gang member \"Mane\" shot at him. S.L. met with other J-Park members Lewis, Shropshire, and Lee at Shropshire's house, and told them about the shooting so that they \"would fight or shoot at them\" in retaliation. After nightfall, the group assembled in a silver SUV owned by a friend of Shropshire, then Lee drove them to East 134th Street between Caine Avenue and Beachwood Avenue, looking for Mane. Lewis was armed with a .40 caliber semiautomatic weapon, Shropshire had a .45 caliber semiautomatic weapon, and Lee and S.L. were unarmed. S.L. also testified that Lee was wearing a red hooded sweatshirt, Lewis was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, and Shropshire was wearing a blue jacket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} According to S.L., as they circled the block, they noticed a group of people standing outside. They parked a few streets over so they \"could get ready to do something to the ATM Jack Boys.\" Lee parked about a block away and the J-Park members quickly discussed that Lewis and Shropshire would \"[do the] shooting\" and Lee and S.L. would remain in the car. Lewis and Shropshire then left the vehicle, each with a weapon. A few minutes later, S.L. heard ten to twenty gunshots, then Lewis and Shropshire ran back to the car with their weapons in their hands. Lee drove the group back to Shropshire's house. The next day, S.L. learned from social media that a man and woman were hit during the shooting. After that, Lewis and Shropshire got rid of the weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   S.L. admitted that he later obtained the .45 firearm that was \"going around\" the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Cleveland Police Det. Colin Ginley (\"Det. Ginley\") testified that he interviewed S.L. twice before the proffer. According to Det. Ginley, the police do not \"guarantee anything but we're going to give this information to the detectives and * * * see if it's truthful and see if it can be corroborated [then prosecutors will] consider it but nothing is guaranteed.\" If truthful testimony is then provided, the information provided in the proffer cannot be used against the maker of the statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Det. Ginley testified regarding the substance of S.L.'s proffer, including the earlier shooting and the planned retaliatory shooting. Det. Ginley also testified that he confirmed that there was a report of gunshots earlier in the day in the area of Lee and Harvard, and that S.L. correctly identified the caliber of the weapons used during the shooting later that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After the presentation of the state's case, the trial court denied Lewis's motion for acquittal. Lewis was subsequently acquitted of the charge of discharging a firearm near prohibited premises, but was convicted of all remaining charges and specifications. He was sentenced to 44 years-to-life imprisonment, with parole eligibility after 30 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Weight of the Evidence Supporting a Conviction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In the first assigned error, Lewis argues that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence because Elder and S.L. are not credible and there were discrepancies in their accounts of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In examining a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence supporting a conviction, this court weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, Elder testified that in the days or weeks that followed the shooting, he \"gave [police] a name\" and description. Additionally, about a month after the shooting, he listed Lewis's name on a Victim of Crime Compensation form as the person he \"thought\" was the shooter. Later, in a photo array and at trial, he identified Lewis as the assailant. Reviewing the record as a whole, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Elder's identification of Lewis was consistent, credible, and reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Additionally, S.L. testified regarding the incident leading up to the shooting, and the planning of a retaliatory shooting. According to S.L.'s testimony, the group drove to ATM Jack Boyz territory and observed individuals on East 134th Street. The group parked nearby and planned that Lewis and Shropshire would shoot the individuals on East 134th Street, and S.L. and Lee would remain in the SUV. S.L. also testified that he observed Lewis and Shropshire leave the vehicle with weapons. A few minutes later, he heard gunshots, and the men then ran back to the vehicle. The next day, he learned the identities of the victims. S.L. was then extensively cross-examined regarding the leniency of his plea agreement, his subsequent possession of the .45 caliber weapon used in the shooting, the clothing worn by the J-Park members at the time of the shooting, and the type of vehicle used in the shooting. Additionally, the jury was also cautioned, under R.C. 2923.03(D) that because S.L. was an accomplice to the shooting, they were required to view his testimony with \"grave suspicion.\" However, he remained consistent that the shooting was the result of the earlier altercation with Mane and that Lewis and Shropshire were the shooters. His claims regarding the earlier shooting and the caliber of the weapons were corroborated. Therefore, after reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that although there were discrepancies in portions of S.L.'s testimony, the jury reasonably could have concluded that this identification was credible and reliable. In weighing the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and considering the credibility of witnesses and resolving conflicts in the evidence, we cannot say that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Lewis in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Moreover, although Elder's testimony and S.L.'s testimony differed on several points, including the color of the shooter's clothing and the color and model of the vehicle, following our own review of the record, we cannot say that the jurors acted unreasonably in finding their testimony regarding Lewis's involvement to be credible.\n   <em>\n    Rudd\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} From all of the foregoing, we cannot say that the convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. This assigned error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Witness's Prior Statement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In the second assigned error, Lewis asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that Det. Ginley's testimony regarding the content of S.L.'s proffer of evidence was admissible as a prior consistent statement. Lewis argues\n   that under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b), such statement must be made before an alleged motive to fabricate, whereas in this instance, the statement was made after S.L. was charged with delinquency in connection with an aggravated robbery and was motivated to avoid a bindover and imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (D) Statements which are not hearsay.

Moreover, the record demonstrates that S.L. brought up this matter to police during the pendency of another investigation.

Therefore, we find this testimony to be cumulative to S.L.'s own trial testimony, so it is doubtful that it deprived Lewis of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
