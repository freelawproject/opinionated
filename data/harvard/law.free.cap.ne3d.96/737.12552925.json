The district court entered judgment in favor of Paramount Pictures Corporation-the defendant in that action-and that judgment was affirmed on appeal. Paramount-now the plaintiff-subsequently initiated this state court action. In this appeal, defendants assert that Paramount's claim is barred by res judicata because it should have been asserted as a counterclaim in the earlier federal action. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2004, Melrose Investors LLC was formed as a special purpose vehicle to facilitate investment in certain films produced and distributed by plaintiff Paramount Pictures Corporation. Defendants Allianz Risk Transfer AG, Marathon Structured Finance Fund, L.P., Newstar Financial Inc., and Munich Re Capital Markets New York, Inc. (the investors) invested in Melrose's debt and equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to investing, the parties exchanged and executed a number of documents, including a private placement memorandum (PPM) and a subscription agreement. The subscription agreement contained a number of representations and warranties, including, among others, a waiver provision and a covenant not to sue. Section 4(s) of the subscription agreement provided that Paramount had not \"made any express or implied representation, warranty, guarantee or agreement, written or oral\" to the investors regarding a number of specified matters-for instance, the manner of distribution of any films. The next paragraph, section 4(t), provided that each investor \"waives and releases all claims against Paramount\" or any of its affiliates \"arising out of, or in connection with, the offering of the Securities,\" and further \"waives and releases Paramount\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   and its affiliates from \"liability arising out of the matters described in paragraph (s) above, and agrees that in no event shall it assert any claim or bring any action contradicting the acknowledgements and agreements in this paragraph or in Paragraph (s) above.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2008, the investors brought suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, asserting claims for securities fraud (a federal question), common-law fraud (a state-law cause of action), and unjust enrichment (a state-law cause of action).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The investors alleged that they had relied on \"Paramount's knowing misrepresentations and omissions of information material to [the investors'] decision to invest in securities.\" In particular, the investors claimed that Paramount had induced them to invest through \"disclosures in the PPM stating that Paramount regularly employed specific risk mitigation techniques when producing and distributing films,\" but that, \"contrary to the specific and repeated representations in the PPM,\" Paramount \"materially altered its production and distribution plans\" with regard to the Melrose investment so as to \"dramatically reduce the use of a key risk mitigation technique described in the PPM.\" In its answer, Paramount asserted, among other things, (i) that the investors' claims were barred because, contrary to the allegations, they had \"relied on documents and information apart from the PPM in making their investment decisions,\" and (ii) that one of those documents, the subscription agreement, contained an \"express waiver\" barring those claims. Paramount did not assert any counterclaims or otherwise allege that the investors had breached the covenant not to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a bench trial, Paramount moved for entry of judgment in its favor. The district court granted Paramount's motion, finding \"no basis for disregarding the [S]ubscription [A]greement\" and \"no legal reason why th[e] claim waiver would\n   not apply as a matter of law.\" Because the waiver was \"valid and enforceable,\" the court determined that \"plaintiff investors waived their claims.\" The court further noted: \"In paragraph 4\n   (t) [of the subscription agreement] there is a waiver. And there is an agreement by the plaintiffs in no event to bring any claim. As I said, I do find that is binding.\" The investors appealed and the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the investors \"failed to establish the factual premise of their claims, and the district court correctly dismissed the complaint\" (\n   <em>\n    Marathon Structured Finance Fund, LP v. Paramount Pictures Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=622%20Fed.%20Appx.%2085\">\n    622 Fed.Appx. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 [2d Cir. 2015] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the investors' appeal was pending in the Second Circuit, Paramount commenced this action in Supreme Court, alleging that the investors had breached the covenant not to sue in the subscription agreement by filing the federal action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paramount seeks compensatory damages of not less than $8 million-the attorneys' fees it allegedly incurred in the federal action, plus interest. The investors moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing, among other things, that Paramount's state court action was barred by res judicata because Paramount was required, and failed, to raise its claim as a compulsory counterclaim in the federal suit. Paramount opposed the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Supreme Court denied the investors' motion to dismiss. The court \"decline[d] to apply FRCP 13(a)'s compulsory counterclaim rule to support [the investors'] res judicata defense,\" reasoning that New York \"has a permissive counterclaim rule that was enacted by the legislature,\" and it would \"not be proper\" to ignore that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Appellate Division unanimously reversed, granting the investors' motion and dismissing Paramount's complaint (\n   <em>\n    Paramount Pictures Corp. v.

While noting that \"New York's permissive counterclaim rule would save [Paramount's claim] from the traditional bar of res judicata,\" the court determined that \"the inquiry does not end there where the prior action was adjudicated in a compulsory counterclaim jurisdiction\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789126\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/464/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789126\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/464/\">\n    at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789126\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/464/\">\n    36 N.Y.S.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court then determined that Paramount's claim was compulsory under rule 13(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because \"[i]t existed at the time [Paramount] served its answer to the complaint in the federal action and 'arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter' of defendants' federal claim(s)\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789126\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/464/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   [citations omitted] ). Though it\n   found no \"binding precedent ... hold[ing] that state courts must apply Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 13(a),\" the Appellate Division determined that \"the later assertion in a state court action of a contention that constituted a compulsory counterclaim in a prior federal action between the same parties is barred under the doctrine of res judicata\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789126\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/464/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789126\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/464/\">\n    at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789126\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/464/\">\n    36 N.Y.S.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [citation omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We granted Paramount's motion for leave to appeal (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12284290,12284165,12284429,12284304,12284178,12284316,12284191,12284447,12284327,12284459,12284207,12284342,12284474,12284222,12284357,12284488,12284235,12284370,12284502,12284248,12284513,12284386,12284263,12284401,12284277,12284415\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/909/\">\n    28 N.Y.3d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206840114\">\n    2016 WL 6840114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2016] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The viability of Paramount's instant claim hinges on the preclusive effect of the parties' prior federal judgment.

Given those objectives, the Supreme Court has been unequivocal: Though \"no federal textual provision addresses the claim-preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment in a federal-question case,\" the Court has \"long held that States cannot give those judgments merely whatever effect they would give their own judgments, but must accord them the effect that this Court prescribes\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 552 U.S. at 891,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20S.%20Ct.%20317\">\n    128 S.Ct. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, where federal preclusion principles would operate to preclude a claim-and state law principles would yield a conflicting outcome-the \"federal courts' interest in the integrity of their own processes\" justifies the displacement of New York law as the federally prescribed rule of decision (\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    531 U.S. at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   18B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4472, Effect of State Law on Federal Res Judicata Rules [2d ed 2011] ).

Specifically, rule 13(a) provides, in relevant part, that a counterclaim is compulsory if it \"arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim\" ( Fed Rules Civ Pro rule 13 [a][1][A] ). Although the text of rule 13(a) does not explain the consequences for failure to plead a compulsory counterclaim, \"virtually all courts agree that a party who fails to plead a compulsory counterclaim cannot raise that claim in a subsequent action\" in federal court (Michael D. Conway, Narrowing the Scope of rule 13[a],\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%20141\">\n    60 U Chi L Rev 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141 [1993] ; Charles Alan Wright et al., Compulsory Counterclaims-Effect of Failing to Plead a Compulsory Counterclaim, 6 Fed Prac &amp; Proc Juris \u00a7 1417 [3d ed 2010] ).

Prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, courts embraced \"[t]he old theory of narrowing the issue down ... to one single limited matter,\" thereby \"forcing the parties to bring separate actions\" (American Bar Association, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Proceedings of the Institute on Federal Rules, 247 [1938];\n   <em>\n    Williamson v.

Claims were litigated in a fragmented manner, favoring narrow and discrete issues over more comprehensive proceedings (American Bar Assn, Proceedings at 247; Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). Procedural constraints, including inflexible pleading and joinder rules, reflected the common-law attitude opposing (and in some cases, preventing) the consolidation of claims ( Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1225938\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/186/464/#p469\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 22, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Funny Guy, LLC v.

Underlying this policy was, in part, the notion that \"[a] defendant should not be required to assert his claim in the forum or the proceeding chosen by the plaintiff but should be allowed to bring suit at a time and place of his own selection\" ( Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 22, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ); though antithetical to the policies underlying res judicata, a defendant's autonomy was thought to outweigh countervailing interests in convenience, efficiency, and judicial economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The common law doctrine of claim preclusion mirrored these limitations. For purposes of res judicata, case law focused on the precise \"cause of action\" asserted in the two suits (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, \"in the days when civil procedure still bore the imprint of the forms of action and the division between\n   law and equity, the courts were prone to associate claim with a single theory of recovery, so that, with respect to one transaction, a plaintiff might have as many claims as there were theories of the substantive law upon which he could seek relief against the defendant\" ( Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 24, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ).

Increasingly, modern practice has placed a premium on the policies underlying res judicata-notions of efficiency, finality, and judicial economy, among other things. The earlier common law rule favoring claim isolation and party autonomy has been gradually supplanted by a new \"general philosophy\"-one of \"limiting the number of law suits possible over one controversy\" (American Bar Assn, Proceedings at 247). In response to these evolving procedural ideas, courts have broadened preclusion principles to \"apply in contexts not formerly recognized at common law\" (\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p94\">\n    449 U.S. at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p94\">\n    101 S.Ct. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and \"[t]he scope of claims barred has expanded\" (Conway, 60 U Chi L Rev at 145 ).

By incorporating compulsory counterclaims statutes and rules-adopted in all federal jurisdictions, and in the vast majority of states-the Restatement employs the transactional approach embodied in those statutes and rules to broaden the scope of a \"cause of action\" to which res judicata applies (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Wright, 6 Fed Prac &amp; Proc Juris \u00a7 1417 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 22 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In a \"modern procedural system\"-which \"permits the presentation in [one] action of all material relevant to the transaction\"-\"[t]he\n   <em>\n    transaction\n   </em>\n   is the basis of the litigative unit or entity which may not be split,\" irrespective of the variant legal theories available ( Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 24,\n   Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   [emphasis added] ).

In their federal suit, the investors predominantly alleged that, through material misrepresentations and omissions, Paramount induced them to invest in the Melrose investment. These\n   fraud-type allegations necessarily implicate the negotiations surrounding the Melrose investment-namely, the representations, warranties, and disclosures made by Paramount in connection with the transaction. The investors' claims therefore required the district court to consider the scope and validity of the various documents exchanged and agreements executed in connection with the Melrose investment, including the PPM (cited frequently in the investors' federal complaint) and, as relevant here, the subscription agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Indeed, in its ruling, the district court reached issues that would likely prove dispositive to Paramount's instant claim: the court noted that the waiver provision of the subscription agreement also contained \"an agreement by the plaintiffs in no event to bring any claim\"-i.e., a covenant not to sue-and held that those provisions were \"binding\" on the investors. This overlap of essential facts is exemplified most poignantly by Paramount's offensive assertion of collateral estoppel in the instant case with respect to the district court's factual and legal findings concerning the subscription agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At bottom, Paramount's covenant not to sue claim is based on the \"same transaction\" as the federal action (the Melrose investment); it involves much of the \"same evidence\" (the subscription agreement and surrounding negotiations); and its essential facts (the scope and validity of the subscription agreement's provisions) were present in the first action (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9960344\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/275/#p285\">\n    214 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   285 ).

However, I reach that conclusion without the need to determine, as the plurality does here, whether a federal court would agree that state law provides the proper analytic framework. We have no reason to opine on an open question of federal law-namely, what rule of res judicata applies to claims asserted in state court where there has been a prior federal judgment predicated on \"mixed\" subject matter jurisdiction and not solely on the existence of a federal question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paramount's claim is barred regardless of whether federal or New York State res judicata rules apply, because it arises out of the same transaction as the defendants' federal claim which was litigated to its conclusion in the prior federal action. Since the result is the same, the plurality's discussion is essentially an advisory opinion, and one that may prove mistaken (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc. v.

Several investment entities (investors) sued Paramount in federal district court for the Southern District of New York for securities fraud, arising from Paramount's alleged misrepresentations and omissions. In that lawsuit, Paramount argued that the investors waived their right to sue for fraud under a waiver clause contained in section 4(t) of the parties' subscription agreement. Section 4(t) also contains what the parties refer to as a \"covenant not to sue,\" by which each investor \"agree[d] that in no event shall it assert any claim or bring any action contradicting the acknowledgments and agreements in this paragraph.\" After a bench trial, the district court dismissed the complaint, determining, in relevant part, that the investors waived their claims and failed to establish the alleged fraud, and further noting that the investors made a binding agreement \"in no event to bring any claim.\" The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the investors failed to establish the underlying facts of their claims and thus that the district court properly dismissed the complaint (\n   <em>\n    Marathon Structured Finance Fund, LP v.

Although the plurality reaches its judgment after what is ostensibly a \"federal res judicata\" analysis, it mirrors the analysis under our state law and leads to the same conclusion: Paramount's claim is clearly part of the same transaction, and\n   so barred.

As explained, and notwithstanding Paramount's exhortations to the contrary, Paramount's state claim is transactionally related to the investors' federal claim and should have been raised in the federal\n   lawsuit. Since Paramount did not assert the claim when it had the chance, it may not avoid the consequences of its choice simply by crossing the street and filing in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Paramount maintains that this ordinary analysis should not apply because New York is a permissive counterclaim jurisdiction, which reflects a legislative preference to maximize party forum selection. Paramount's argument misses the mark and distracts from the central question in this case, namely what preclusive effect to give the prior federal court judgment. We answer that question by looking to the rules that define the scope and consequences of the litigants' claims and the final judgment entered. Where the prior litigation took place in a different jurisdiction, our law requires that we begin by looking to the law of the issuing forum to determine the judgment's scope in its home jurisdiction. Here, the final judgment in the prior action was entered by a federal court, under a system which has adopted a compulsory counterclaim pleading requirement (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 13 [a] ). We give res judicata effect to the prior federal judgment as it stands under that pleading regime, with its attendant consequences for future litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, because the federal court would bar Paramount from filing a second action to pursue its breach of contract claim, that same claim is barred under res judicata in our New York courts. As Judge Fuld explained over 50 years ago:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"[W]hen the Federal suit was commenced, it is indisputably clear that the plaintiffs now before us should have interposed as counterclaims in the earlier litigation the very causes of action now sued upon.

'To the extent to which a judgment\n   of a federal court operates as\n   <em>\n    res ajudicata\n   </em>\n   in that court, it operates as\n   <em>\n    res adjudicata\n   </em>\n   in the courts of this state.'

That observation was made in the context of analyzing a prior New York state court judgment's preclusive effect on a subsequent New York state court action. Here, however, New York's pleading rules have no place, as the prior action was not brought in New York state court. Instead, Paramount was faced with defending itself in federal court, where it was subject to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including rule 13(a), when it decided not to assert its transactionally-related counterclaim. It cannot now seek to escape the consequences of the tactical decision it made in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To the extent Paramount suggests that it appropriately relied on New York's permissive pleading requirement, it is mistaken. To refrain from asserting a claim carries risks even under New York's law. Even if the investors had initially brought suit in New York state court instead of federal court, it is not clear that Paramount's state claim would be permitted, as under our jurisprudence New York will not always allow a previously unasserted claim to proceed in a future state action. As the Court has explained, our permissive counterclaim rule \"does not ... permit a party to remain silent in the first action and then bring a second one on the basis of a preexisting claim for relief that would impair the rights or interests established in the first action\" (\n   <em>\n    Henry Modell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2347857\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/68/456/\">\n    68 N.Y.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   462 n. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20N.Y.S.2d%2063\">\n    510 N.Y.S.2d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=502%20N.E.2d%20978\">\n    502 N.E.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Paramount unpersuasively claims this state court action could not possibly impair rights or interests established in the prior federal case, since Paramount won in that lawsuit. Nothing in our case law limits the reach of a holding to the victorious party. If the federal decision established the rights and interests of the investors too, New York courts would be required to respect that decision as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, Paramount's approach would encourage simultaneous litigation in two jurisdictions and promote forum shopping,\n   contrary to the well-recognized policies underlying res judicata. \"Res judicata is designed to provide finality in the resolution of disputes to assure that parties may not be vexed by further litigation\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338177\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/45/24/#p27\">\n    45 N.Y.2d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=407%20N.Y.S.2d%20645\">\n    407 N.Y.S.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=379%20N.E.2d%20172\">\n    379 N.E.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [italics removed] ). \"[A] party who has been given a full and fair opportunity to litigate a claim should not be allowed to do so again\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"618750\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/4/260/#p269\">\n    4 N.Y.3d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"618750\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/4/260/#p269\">\n    794 N.Y.S.2d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"618750\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/4/260/#p269\">\n    827 N.E.2d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Applying our state res judicata rules as I have described furthers these policies by promoting judicial economy and closure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This case illustrates the point. Although Paramount could have filed its claim in the prior action, it filed its state action while the federal appeal was pending, after the parties had litigated in federal court for seven years, in the hopes of vindicating a claim that might have been impossible to establish under controlling Second Circuit precedent (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Artvale Inc. v.

To permit Paramount's use of the state courts in this way undermines the goals of finality and efficiency, in support of a litigant who had every opportunity to bring the claim in federal court but chose not to. Res judicata is one of the cornerstones on which the stability of our legal system rests and New York will not lend its courts or laws to undermine the settled decisions of other legitimate tribunals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, under state res judicata principles, Paramount's claim is barred, requiring dismissal of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Hundreds of reported cases bifurcate rule 13(a) compulsory counterclaims from the plaintiffs' claims; sometimes, courts even bifurcate defenses, as rule 42(b) allows (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Seiko Epson Corp. v.

Here too, traditional principles of res judicata (claim splitting)-not some \"expanded\" form of res judicata-barred her claim.

(dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I begin with a proposition as to which I believe the plurality and I agree: New York is a \"permissive counterclaim\" jurisdiction, so that, had Allianz Risk Transfer AG's initial lawsuit been filed in New York State court, without a federal securities law claim, Paramount Pictures Corporation would not have been required to file as a counterclaim thereto its claim that Allianz breached the contract's covenant not to sue. New York's legislature has adopted a different rule from rule 13(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, driven by its judgment about the efficiency of the two different approaches (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPLR 3019 ). In that regard, there is no right answer: the Federal Rules rest on a rebuttable presumption that trying all claims-including claims the defendant may have against the plaintiff-in a single action is the most efficient way to proceed, even if that complicates, slows, and enlarges that lawsuit, because there will be no second lawsuit. New York, like several other states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut), has made a different calculation, permitting defendants to choose not to litigate counterclaims as part of the initial action, so that the initial action may proceed more simply and expeditiously. The second action may be obviated because of settlement or substantially\n   reduced or eliminated by operation of issue preclusion arising from the first action. Indeed, the procedural difference between New York's permissive counterclaim rule and the Federal Rules is not stark. Despite the requirement of rule 13(a), federal district courts often end up in the same place that a New York court would because of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 42(b), which expressly permits federal district courts to bifurcate any counterclaims from the plaintiffs' claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the real difference in procedure is\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   (the court on motion of\n   a party, rather than the defendant) makes the decision to try separately a counterclaim arising from the same transaction or occurrence. From that starting point, I believe the plurality has made two wrong turns, either of which, if righted, would independently produce a different result here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Semtek Int'l Inc. v.

The plurality concludes that, so long as a federal court's judgment is entered in an action that raised a federal claim, the preclusive effect of all claims disposed of in that lawsuit must be determined by federal res judicata law. The Supreme Court has not directly decided that question, but I believe the Supreme Court would decide the question differently, holding that the claim-preclusive effect of each claim in the federal action should be determined by the res judicata principles of the jurisdiction whence each claim sprung.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legal source of each claim, not the source of the federal court's jurisdiction, should determine the applicable claim-preclusion law. Here, under my approach, the claim-preclusive effect of the dismissal of Allianz's federal securities law claim would be determined by federal res judicata principles,\n   but the claim-preclusive effect of the dismissal of Allianz's New York State law claims would be determined by New York's res judicata principles.

The plurality misinterprets federal claim-preclusion law and reaches the wrong result in its application. Neither the Supreme Court nor the Federal Courts of Appeals have decided whether a covenant not to sue can be separately litigated in state court as a matter of federal res judicata. In federal courts, it is rule 13(a) -not federal claim preclusion doctrine-that bars litigants from separately filing what should have been a compulsory counterclaim. rule 13(a) is a procedural rule expressing the policy choice of the federal courts as to how best to operate efficiently, and cannot impose that choice on state legislatures that have made a different judgment. Federal res judicata principles would not bar subsequent litigation in state court unless that litigation would nullify the original judgment or impair the rights of the parties established in the first action, neither of which is true here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As the plurality explains, the preclusive effect of a judgment of a federal court is determined by federal common law, which, in turn, is ultimately pronounced by the United States Supreme Court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    531 U.S. at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Nothing remotely like that comes into play simply because a state, as here, has made a choice that differs from the choice made in rule 13(a). There is no question that rule 13(a) would bar the separate filing in federal court of a claim that should have been filed as a compulsory counterclaim, but there is no incompatibility-or even federal interest implicated-by a state's choice to allow that claim to be filed in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The plurality's answer is not the answer I predict the Supreme Court will eventually give. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Semtek's\n   </em>\n   rationale requires us to analyze the claim-preclusive effects of the federal claim and the state law claims separately. In the present case, the claim-preclusive effect of the judgment dismissing the federal 10b-5 claim should be determined by the \"uniform federal rules of res judicata\" (\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p891\">\n    553 U.S. at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674228\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/880/#p891\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted] ).

And indeed, nationwide uniformity in the substance of the matter is better served by having the same claim-preclusive rule (the state rule) apply whether the dismissal has been ordered by a state or a federal court. This is, it seems to us, a classic case for adopting, as the federally prescribed rule of decision, the law that would be applied by state courts in the State in which the federal diversity court sits\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    531 U.S. at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) With that rationale in mind, it becomes important to recall that the claim-preclusive effect of any judgment is determined by the claims in which the merits were actually adjudicated. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   held that despite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure rule 41(b)'s specification that an involuntary dismissal operates as an \"adjudication on the merits,\" claim-preclusive effect is not given to all claims nominally disposed of \"on the merits,\" but only to those \"in which the merits of [a party's] claim are in fact adjudicated [for or] against the [party] after trial of the substantive issues\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, if a complaint contains two causes of action, and a court dismisses one without prejudice (or in some other manner in which the merits are not decided) and adjudicates the other to conclusion, only the second claim will have preclusive effect, not the first. If the first is a claim based on federal law, and the second a claim based on state law,\n   <em>\n    Semtek's\n   </em>\n   rationale would require the claim-preclusive effect of the state law claim to be determined by state-law res judicata principles, not federal. Taking the example one step further, if both the federal and state-law claims are adjudicated on the merits, the claim-preclusive effect of the federal claim would be determined by federal common law, as per\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , but the claim-preclusive effect of the state-law claim would be determined by state res judicata principles, as per\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As was true in\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   ,\"any other rule would produce the sort of 'forum-shopping ... and ... inequitable administration of the laws' that\n   <em>\n    Erie [R.

Under the plurality's rule, some parties would be similarly incentivized to forum shop by including a federal claim-related or not, colorable or not-along with state law claims. Put differently, the claim-\n   preclusive effect of a federal court's judgment should not turn on the court's subject-matter jurisdictional basis, but on the source of each claim's underlying substantive law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In a case heard in federal court, where both a federal claim and a state-law claim are present, the claim-preclusive effect of the federal claim will be determined by federal claim-preclusion doctrine, as\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   requires, and the claim-preclusive effect of the state-law claim will be determined by state claim-preclusion doctrine, as\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   provides. Again, the plurality and I agree that, if the claim-preclusive effect of either one would bar a subsequent claim, it does not matter what the effect of the other would be-the subsequent claim is barred. That is, each claim adjudicated on the merits by the federal court will have its own claim-preclusive effect, independent of the others. Take, as an example, a plaintiff who sues for a declaration of patent invalidity (federal claim) and for unfair competition by the patent holder, based on deceptive marketing of the patented product (state-law claim). Each claim, if decided on the merits, will have a different claim-preclusive effect, based on the nature of the claim itself. The patent claim, if decided in the plaintiff's favor, would preclude the patent holder from bringing a later infringement action against the plaintiff (under federal res judicata rules). The unfair competition claim, if decided on the merits, would not bar a subsequent claim by the patent holder for patent infringement. My analytical difference with the plurality (if a federal claim is present, the plurality would apply federal common-law claim preclusion doctrine to determine the effect of all claims in the case, whereas I would apply federal claim-preclusion doctrine to the federal claims and state claim-preclusion doctrine to the state claims) is not the source of our disagreement as to the result here; that disagreement arises from our divergent views on whether the federal court's judgment rejecting Allianz's federal securities fraud claims operates to preclude Paramount from bringing its claim for breach of the covenant not to sue, discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   If, as I believe, the Supreme Court would direct us to apply New York res judicata principles to determine whether Paramount's claim is barred by the prior judgment on the state-law claims, then it would not be barred. (I do not want to read too much into the plurality's opinion but, by deciding this case on the basis of a difficult and unsettled proposition of federal\n   law, the plurality implicitly agrees that the result would be different under New York law.) Under New York rules of claim preclusion, Paramount's covenant-not-to-sue claim should proceed. When asking whether a litigated claim precludes the defendant in the action from bringing a claim against the original plaintiff, New York's \"decisive test\" is \"whether the substance of the rights or interests established in the first action will be destroyed or impaired by the prosecution of the second\" (\n   <em>\n    Schuykill Fuel Corp. v.

As the plurality correctly notes, it cannot be by means of FRCP 13(a)\"by itself\" (plurality op. at 72, 73 N.Y.S.3d at 478, 96 N.E.3d at 742).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The federal rule cannot prescribe the preclusive effect of a federal judgment on a second, state court action without violating the Rules Enabling Act (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   at 503,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p507\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"(I)t would be peculiar to find a rule governing the effect that must be accorded federal judgments by other courts ensconced in rules governing the internal procedures of the rendering court itself.

There is similarly no question that Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 13(a) does not merely codify federal rules of res judicata. If it did, the rule would be superfluous (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Painter v. Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526393\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/863/329/#p333\">\n    863 F.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 [4th Cir. 1988] ), and nothing in the legislative history suggests that the drafters meant rule 13(a) as a codification of federal res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Instead, the plurality suggests a novel theory: although at the time rule 13(a) was enacted, it barred (as a procedural rule applicable only to federal courts) actions that would not have been barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion, federal common law of claim preclusion has \"systematically widened\" over the years to the point that it is now coterminous with rule 13(a). The plurality's conclusion is completely unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As a general matter, the federal cases on which the plurality relies for the proposition that federal common law has expanded to be coterminous with rule 13(a) do not support any such proposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Neither the Supreme Court nor any federal Court of Appeals has held that rule 13(a) has been rendered superfluous by the evolution of federal common law\n   of res judicata, nor could the courts reach that issue except in the context present here, because in cases brought in federal court, rule 13(a) would govern the result, rendering any incidental discussion of federal common law pure\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Second, and much more fundamentally, the doctrine of claim preclusion, which derives from the doctrines of merger and bar, protects the finality of a judgment; courts could not exist unless their judgments meant something, and to mean something, the same essential claim cannot repeatedly be retried by the losing party, in hope of winning someday. Therefore, a plaintiff cannot bring the same or related claims over and over, and the defendant cannot try to attack the original judgment by bringing his or her own claims later. A counterclaim rule, on the other hand, reflects a judgment about whether it would be more efficient to litigate a different claim by a different party in the original lawsuit or a separate lawsuit. A litigant in federal court who chooses not to file a compulsory counterclaim is barred from filing that claim later in federal court, because the federal courts have made a procedural choice that efficiency and fairness would best be served by hearing all claims at once if they arise from the same transaction or occurrence, unless the district court bifurcates the claim for efficiency's sake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The efficiency determination by federal courts is not implicated when a suit is later brought in state court, because a federal court is in no way burdened by the filing of the state court action. With its permissive counterclaim rule, New York\n   has made a different efficiency choice\n   about procedure, and its courts will bear whatever burden there is in hearing a second case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Of course, a federal court judgment would preclude a defendant from bringing a state court action that would nullify that federal judgment or impair the rights established in the first action; that is the purpose of claim preclusion. Additionally, because of the procedural choice made in rule 13(a), a defendant would be barred from bringing his or her counterclaim-even if it would not be barred by claim preclusion-in a separate federal court action, because the Federal Rules have made an efficiency judgment about how cases will proceed, and the procedural rules of the federal courts apply to the second action if attempted in federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would be quite strange, though, for the federal court to \"extend\" the preclusive effect of its judgment to a subsequent claim, arising from the same transaction or occurrence, brought by a defendant seeking to litigate a\n   <em>\n    state-law\n   </em>\n   claim and have his or her own day in\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   court, where the state has made the choice to allow a defendant that option. Unless a judgment on the separately-filed claim would nullify or undermine the federal judgment, federal courts have neither a res judicata interest nor an efficiency interest in that outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The plurality relies on the history of what constitutes a \"claim\" for purposes of federal claim preclusion to support its conclusion that federal res judicata now encompasses the compulsory counterclaim law. However, the plurality fails to recognize the different effects of claim preclusion on plaintiffs and defendants. The \"expansion\" the plurality refers to-what constitutes a claim for purposes of claim preclusion-relates to restrictions on plaintiffs' \"claim splitting.\" When a final judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot later bring an action on the original claim or any claims that\n   arose out of the same transaction or occurrence, because his or her claims \"merged\" into the original judgment. Such a rule protects \"the interests of the defendant and of the courts in bringing litigation to a close\" ( Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 24 cmt b [1982] ). Contrary to the plurality's contention, procedural changes (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , rules about joinder of parties)\n   <em>\n    allowed for\n   </em>\n   such an expansion to take place, but the expansion was not a necessary result of such changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Claim preclusion restricts the defendant, too, but in different ways. Absent a compulsory counterclaim rule, there are two situations where a defendant in the first action may be barred from bringing a second action on a claim that could have been raised in the first action: where successful prosecution of the counterclaim in a subsequent action would (1) nullify the original judgment or (2) impair the rights of the parties established in the first action (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley View Angus Ranch, Inc. v.

It does not matter that the facts relevant to a counterclaim are also relevant to a defense asserted: \"[A]fter litigation of the defense judgment is given for the defendant, the defendant is not precluded by the rule of merger from maintaining a subsequent action against the plaintiff based upon these facts. In the subsequent action, the rules of issue preclusion will apply to issues litigated and determined in the first action\" ( Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 22 cmt d). Nor does it matter that the counterclaim itself could also have been raised as a defense: \"The failure to interpose a defense to the plaintiff's claim precludes the defendant from thereafter asserting the defense as a basis for attacking the judgment. But the defendant's claim against the plaintiff is not normally merged in the judgment given in that action, and issue preclusion does not apply to issues not actually litigated. The defendant, in short, is entitled to his day in court on his own claim\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   cmt b;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley View Angus Ranch,\n   </em>\n   at 1101 n. 6 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Under both federal and state claim preclusion law, Paramount's claim is not barred. Neither precludes a defendant from bringing a claim arising from the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's claim, unless doing so would nullify the judgment or impair the rights established in the first action. In federal court, rule 13(a) would prevent the defendant from filing separately. This case is not in federal court, our rules-not federal rules-apply, and whether wisely or unwisely, New York has made a different procedural choice. Thus, the only question is whether litigation of Paramount's covenant-not-to-sue claim would nullify the federal court judgment or impair the rights of the parties from the first action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although Paramount's claim for breach of the covenant not to sue arises from the contract, it does not in any way attack the judgment or impair Allianz's rights from the first action. How could it when Paramount was victorious in the first action? Issue preclusion would prevent Allianz from relitigating issues it lost, but neither federal nor New York rules of claim preclusion restrict Paramount from bringing its claim for breach of the covenant not to sue in a separate state court action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   I therefore dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Order, insofar as appealed from, affirmed, with costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Judges Stein and Fahey concur; Judge Rivera concurs in result in an opinion, in which Chief Judge DiFiore concurs; Judge Wilson dissents in an opinion; Judge Feinman took no part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    In a \"mixed\" subject matter jurisdiction case, jurisdiction is not predicated exclusively on either a federal question under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n     28 USC \u00a7 1331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    or diversity under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 USC \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

A court could even have a procedural rule barring the bringing of counterclaims (other than those that would be barred by res judicata).
