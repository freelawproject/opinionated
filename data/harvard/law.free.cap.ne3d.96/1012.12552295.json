For the reasons which follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Jim David, Jr., Administrator of the Estate of Jim David, Sr., deceased, and appellee, the decedent's spouse, brought a wrongful death action against appellants, two city of Bellevue police officers who shot and killed James David, Sr. in 2010 while they were responding to a call about a man with a gun. Appellee also alleged a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, which is the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellants moved for partial judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C), seeking judgment in their favor on the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim because, on its face, it is a negligence claim and appellants are protected against negligence claims by statutory immunity under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6). Appellee opposed the motion on the ground that she had also alleged that appellants had acted recklessly, which would preclude statutory immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court found that while appellee did not include allegations of reckless conduct within the negligence claim, there were such allegations elsewhere in the general allegations of the complaint. Therefore, the court concluded that appellee had made a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress based on alleged reckless behavior, which would overcome the immunity granted to appellants by statute. Therefore, the trial court denied appellants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On appeal, appellants assert the following single assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT DENIED DEFENDANTS/APPELLANTS JEFFREY MATTER AND ERIK LAWSON THE BENEFIT OF IMMUNITY UNDER OHIO REVISED CODE CHAPTER 2744 (T.D. 12, RULING ON DEF.S' MOT.

The prima facie elements of a claim for intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress are: (1) the defendant intended to or recklessly caused the plaintiff serious emotional distress; (2) the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; and (3) the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause of plaintiff's serious emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Phung v.

We think the latter is appropriate. Appellee must assert that appellants acted recklessly in order to overcome the general grant of immunity. In one sense, the heightened intent allegation converts the negligence-based tort into an intentional/reckless tort. But that result does not place a burden on the plaintiff to allege an intentional/reckless tort in the first place.
