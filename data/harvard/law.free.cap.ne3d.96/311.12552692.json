The parcel number of the residential lot is 24-1611274-000. The parcel number of the vacant lot is 24-1611577-000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2001, the Fraziers applied for a mortgage with National City Bank. The Fraziers completed a Uniform Residential Loan Application that (1) listed the property address as \"918 Lunbeck Rd., Chillicothe, OH 45601,\" (2) indicated the purpose of the loan was to refinance, (3) stated that the property would be the primary residence, (4) documented that the property was acquired and \"[b]uilt\" in 1974, (5) that improvements in the form of \"deck, decorating, [c]arpet\" were made, and (6) that the property was \"1Fam.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} An appraisal report similarly reflected that the property involved residential property. The appraisal (1) describes the property as consisting of 1.02 acres, with electricity, water, and a septic system, (2) states that an interior and exterior\n   inspection were performed, (3) describes the property as a one-story, detached building consisting of \"WD, ALUM, BRK,\" with a \"COMP SHGL\" roof surface, and (4) includes the parcel number of the residential lot. The appraisal also includes photographs of the \"subject property\" that show the appraised property is a building. The appraisal also includes a floorplan that illustrates the layout of the building, with square footage calculations. The building consists of three bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, a dining room, a living room, a deck, and a patio. The square footage is listed as \"1100.\" The appraisal estimated the property value as $138,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Fraziers also signed a \"Survey Affidavit.\" Their affidavit states that they own 918 Lunbeck Road as shown on the attached survey and that the survey \"correctly represents the layout and improvements on the Property.\" The attached survey lists two parcels: (1) a 1.02 acre tract; and (2) a 0.559 acre tract. The illustration of the 0.559 acre tract includes the following writing: \"Per owner 0.559 acre tract not included in mortgage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Fraziers signed a note that listed the property address as \"918 Lunbeck Rd., Chillicothe, Ohio 45601\" and that promised to repay $107,000. The mortgage stated that the Fraziers agreed to \"mortgage, grant and convey * * * the following described property * * * 918 Lunbeck Rd., Chillicothe, Ohio 45601.\" The parcel identification number was left blank. The mortgage included an occupancy covenant that stated the Fraziers would use the mortgaged property as their \"principal residence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The legal description attached to the mortgage reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   EXHIBIT A-LEGAL DESCRIPTION\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Situate in the State of Ohio, County of Ross, Township of Scioto, being part of the remainder of a 23 acre tract and all of the remainder of a 0.71 acre tract as conveyed to Timothy L.

Thus, in 2009 National City filed a foreclosure complaint. National City attached to its complaint the mortgage with the above legal description. A preliminary report revealed, however, that the metes and bounds description\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   attached to the mortgage described the vacant lot. National City later amended the complaint to request that the court reform the mortgage to include the metes and bounds description of the residential lot. National City alleged that the legal description is \"incomplete\" and resulted from a \"scrivener's error and mutual mistake of fact.\" National City thus asserted that it is entitled to have the mortgage reformed in order to include the metes and bounds description of the residential property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 10} National City subsequently filed a summary judgment motion and argued that the evidence shows that the parties intended to encumber both the residential and vacant lots, but by mutual mistake, the metes and bounds description attached to the mortgage did not describe both properties. National City (1) pointed out that the Fraziers' loan application clearly indicates that both the vacant lot and the residential parcel were intended to be encumbered by the mortgage; (2) claimed that the property appraisal shows that both parcels were intended to be encumbered by the mortgage; and (3) asserted that the amount of the mortgage-$107,000-demonstrates that the parties intended to encumber the residential lot. National City argued that a $107,000 mortgage for a 0.559 acre vacant parcel is not reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The case later was stayed pending bankruptcy proceedings. During the stay, Mrs. Frazier died. On December 11, 2015, shortly after the court reactivated the proceedings, the Fraziers' counsel filed a notice of suggestion of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In January 2016, the Fraziers filed a combined memorandum in opposition to National City's summary judgment motion and a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Although the Fraziers did not dispute National City's right to judgment on the note and to foreclose upon the mortgage, they did however dispute National City's reformation claim. The Fraziers asserted that no genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether National\n   City's failure to include the legal description of the residential property constitutes inexcusable negligence so as to preclude its reformation claim. They thus claimed that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to National City's reformation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Fraziers attached appellee's affidavit to support their cross-summary judgment motion. In his affidavit, appellee attests that he and Mrs. Frazier \"were aware at the closing that [National City] apparently chose to omit the residential parcel from the property described in the mortgage deed and that thereafter they quit-claimed their interest in the residential parcel to their children as part of their estate planning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In response, National City argued that the evidence shows that the parties obviously intended to encumber the residential property. National City asserted that the mortgage includes the property address and the parcel number for the residential parcel. National City recognized that the metes and bounds description attached to the mortgage appeared to describe only the vacant parcel, but claimed that the mortgage clearly and unambiguously includes the street address and the permanent parcel number for the residential parcel. National City thus contended that the mortgage shows that the parties intended to encumber the residential parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On October 7, 2016, appellee filed a motion to dismiss National City's complaint based upon its failure to comply with Civ.R. 25(A). Appellee asserted that National City's failure to file a motion to substitute within ninety days of the notice of suggestion of Mrs. Frazier's death mandated a dismissal of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On November 3, 2016, appellant (PNC Bank) filed a combined motion for leave to file instanter a motion to substitute and a memorandum in opposition to appellee's motion to dismiss. Appellant asserted that the trial court should permit it to substitute the correct party in place of Mrs. Frazier instead of dismissing the complaint. Appellant argued that Civ.R. 6(B) permits the court to extend the ninety-day time period set forth in Civ.R. 25(A) upon a showing of excusable neglect. Appellant contended that it did not file a motion to substitute within ninety days of the notice of suggestion of death because the parties had been engaged in settlement negotiations. Appellant also asked the court to substitute PNC Bank, National Association as the plaintiff in place of National City Real Estate Services, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court granted appellant's motion to substitute PNC Bank as the plaintiff, but denied appellant's request to substitute the proper party in place of Mrs. Frazier. The court found that appellant did not file the motion to substitute in a timely manner and dismissed appellant's claims against Mrs. Frazier. The court did not address appellant's claim of excusable neglect in failing to file the motion within the ninety-day time period set forth in Civ.R. 25(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The trial court also entered summary judgment in appellant's favor regarding its foreclosure claim, but denied it summary judgment on the reformation claim. Rather, the court determined that appellee is entitled to summary judgment on the reformation claim. The court found\n   that even if genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether there was a mutual mistake, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to appellant's inexcusable negligence. The court therefore determined that appellant's inexcusable negligence precluded reformation and granted appellant summary judgment with the right to foreclose upon the vacant property only. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In its first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by overruling its summary judgment motion concerning its claim to reform the mortgage. Appellant claims that no genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the court should reform the mortgage. Appellant argues that the evidence demonstrates that the parties were mutually mistaken as to the legal description attached to the mortgage. Appellant contends that both parties mistakenly believed that the legal description attached to the mortgage described the residential lot, when the metes and bounds description actually described the vacant lot. Appellant thus claims that the trial court should have reformed the mortgage so as to include the metes and bounds description of the residential property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellee argues that the trial court correctly entered judgment in his favor regarding appellant's reformation claim. He contends that even if genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the parties intended to encumber the residential parcel, appellant's inexcusable negligence in failing to recognize the mistake precludes reformation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 21} As we explain below, we (1) agree with appellant's argument that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding its reformation claim, and (2) disagree with appellee's argument that appellant's conduct constitutes inexcusable negligence so as to preclude reformation of the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 22} We initially note that appellate courts conduct a de novo review of a trial court's summary judgment decision.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Argabrite v.

Daniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , illustrates how these principles apply in the deed reformation context. In\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   , the trial court concluded that reformation of a deed was appropriate when the evidence showed that the parties were mutually mistaken as to the property conveyed. In\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   , the grantors conveyed a lot to the grantees by warranty deed. The deed described the property conveyed as the entire lot, which included a hay field in the northeast corner of the lot upon which sat a barn. The grantors asserted that the parties did not intend the real estate transaction to include the hay field and barn, but the grantees disputed this assertion. The deed also described property that was owned by a third party, Lucy McClung. The grantees conceded that the parties did not intend McClung's property to be part of the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 34} A survey plat showed that the hay field and barn were not part of the lot, and neither was McClung's property. The grantees claimed that the survey plat accurately depicted the property the parties intended to convey. Testimony existed that the grantees were aware of the lot boundaries, but the grantees disputed this fact. The grantors stated that they showed the grantees the boundaries before closing the real estate transaction and explicitly informed the grantees that the disputed property was not included. The record also contained evidence to show that the grantees acted inconsistently with their claim to the disputed property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 35} After the trial court entered judgment granting the grantors' request to reform the deed, the grantees appealed. On appeal, the grantees argued that (1) the grantors failed to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parties were mutually mistaken as to the land conveyed, and (2) any mistake in the deed resulted from the grantors' negligence, which precluded their reformation claim. The court of appeals, however, disagreed with the grantees and affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The appellate court first determined that the evidence, although conflicting, supported the trial court's finding that the parties were mutually mistaken as to the land that the deed conveyed. The court pointed out that the credibility of the parties' assertions was a matter reserved to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The court further recognized that, at trial, the grantees disputed that a mutual mistake occurred, but stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"[T]he mere fact that the parties at the time of trial testify differently as to what their agreement was does not necessarily mean that there was no agreement between them, nor does it necessarily mean that they were not mutually mistaken concerning the expression of their agreement in the instrument; in this respect, it has been pointed out that if the fact alone that the parties testify differently at the trial would prevent a finding that there was an agreement between the parties, a court could never determine whether there was a contract in a lawsuit where the parties disagree and testify differently.\" 13 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1979) 363, Cancellation, etc. of Instruments, Section 76.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Thus, where an action in reformation is commenced, credible testimony concerning the conduct of the parties, any course of dealing between them, and the method of handling the specific transaction in question are entitled to great weight in determining the ultimate facts; to wit, the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Neff v.

We thus determined that the lender's inexcusable negligence precluded reformation. In\n   <em>\n    Mowery\n   </em>\n   , as part of a divorce, a husband and wife agreed that the wife would receive the parties' residential lot, and that the husband would receive the parties' vacant lot. However, the transaction did not occur as expected, but instead, the parties inexplicably and mistakenly transferred the residential lot to the husband and the vacant lot to the wife. Neither party apparently was aware of the mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Sometime after the parties' divorce, the wife obtained a mortgage on what she thought was the residential property. The legal description attached to the mortgage, however, described the vacant lot, which was the property the wife actually owned. The lender also apparently believed that the mortgage applied to the residential lot. The record did not contain any evidence that the lender performed a survey, but an appraisal of the residential lot, including information about the house, was completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Wells Fargo later acquired the note from the original lender, and the wife continued making payments until her death. Before Wells Fargo acquired the note, it did not order a survey of the mortgaged property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Shortly after the wife's death, the mortgage went into default, and Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure action. Before the sheriff's sale occurred, a sheriff's deputy visited the property and discovered that the property was a vacant lot. The sheriff's office then notified Wells Fargo of its discovery. Wells Fargo ordered a survey of the foreclosed property, which confirmed that the mortgage described the vacant lot. Wells Fargo subsequently filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and reformation of the mortgage. The trial court denied Wells Fargo's request for equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 46} On appeal, we concluded that the original lender's negligence, which we imputed to Wells Fargo, was not excusable and thus precluded reformation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%20149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38 and \u00b6 39. We explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The mortgage included the legal description of the undeveloped parcel, and [the original lender] was in the mortgage business. Therefore, it was not excusable for [the original lender] to have believed the mortgage actually applied to any property other than the undeveloped parcel. A sheriff's deputy discovered that the undeveloped parcel is a vacant lot simply by visiting the property. Had [the original lender] undertaken even a cursory amount of due diligence, it would have discovered the true nature of the undeveloped parcel. A mortgage company's failure to learn the most basic facts about a mortgaged property cannot be excusable negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 47} We recognized that our holding meant Wells Fargo would receive less from foreclosing upon the vacant lot than it had expected it would receive if it had been permitted to foreclose upon the residential lot. We nevertheless determined that \"the situation is not entirely inequitable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. We pointed out that the heirs would lose their rights to the vacant lot and that Wells Fargo still would receive funds upon sale of the vacant lot. We further determined that \"Wells Fargo purchased a bad deal from [the original lender]\" and that \"a party is not entitled to equitable relief simply because of a bad bargain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 48} After our review of the case sub judice, we do not believe\n   <em>\n    Mowery\n   </em>\n   controls the outcome here, but rather, we find it distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Mowery\n   </em>\n   , the original lender had not performed a survey and a sheriff's deputy discovered the mistake simply by visiting the property. In the case at bar, however, the original lender performed an appraisal of the property, and the Fraziers signed a survey affidavit with an attachment that illustrated the scope of the property intended to be encumbered. The attachment very clearly depicts the residential property and explicitly states that the vacant lot is not included in the mortgage \"per the owner.\" For appellee to claim otherwise thus appears specious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Furthermore, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Mowery\n   </em>\n   does not reveal what other descriptors the mortgage contained. For instance, it is not clear whether the mortgage included the correct street address or parcel number of the residential lot and simply mistakenly attached the metes and bounds description of the vacant lot, or whether the mortgage did not list any street address or parcel number. The absence of either the street address or parcel number would appear to lend greater support to our conclusion in Mowery that the lender was inexcusably negligent. Additionally, although we pointed out that Wells Fargo did not order a survey before obtaining the note from the original lender, we do not believe that our decision means that a lender is inexcusably negligent simply because it fails to conduct a survey of each property subsequently obtained from another lender. We thus believe that\n   <em>\n    Mowery\n   </em>\n   is limited to the specific factual situation presented and that those same facts do not exist in the case sub judice. Thus, we do not believe that appellant's negligence in the case at bar falls within the class of \"extreme cases\" involving a mortgage lender's inexcusable negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Williston,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, we do not believe that\n   <em>\n    Mowery\n   </em>\n   controls the outcome of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Instead, we believe that\n   <em>\n    Castle v. Daniels\n   </em>\n   demonstrates that, even though the bank may have been negligent in failing to notice that the metes and bounds\n   description attached to the mortgage described the vacant land, the bank's negligence is not so inexcusable that reformation is barred. We first observe that metes and bounds descriptions of property, by nature, rarely are clear and concise, but instead \"often contains somewhat confusing language making repeated references to various landmarks and directions which cannot be fully comprehended without the aid of a plat map.\"\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6708382\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/16/209/#p212\">\n    16 Ohio App.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%20149\">\n    475 N.E.2d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, we do not find that the metes and bounds description attached to the mortgage is so clear that anyone reviewing it would have known that it referred to the vacant lot and not the residential lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Next, we point out that the legal description attached to the property, while describing the metes and bounds of only the vacant land, also lists the parcel numbers for both the residential and vacant lots and states that the property is \"Commonly Known As: 918 Lunbeck Road, Chillicothe, Ohio 45601.\" Unlike a metes and bounds description, identifying property by parcel number and street address ordinarily \"lends itself to easy comprehension.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%20149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, from those numerical identifiers, one might reasonably conclude that the metes and bounds description describes the residential and vacant parcels. Consequently, both appellant and the Fraziers \"may have been misled into believing\" that the metes and bounds description encompassed the residential property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Appellee nevertheless claims that he and Mrs. Frazier did not intend to mortgage the residential property. As\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   makes clear, however, simply because a party testifies differently at the time of trial as to the agreement does not \"necessarily mean that the[ parties] were not mutually mistaken concerning the expression of their agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%20149\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%20149\">\n    at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20N.E.2d%20149\">\n    475 N.E.2d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Moreover, the Fraziers' outward manifestations during the mortgage application process lends significant support to appellant's argument that they intended to mortgage the residential land. The Fraziers signed a Uniform\n   <em>\n    Residential\n   </em>\n   Loan Application that lists the property address as \"918 Lunbeck Road.\" Next to the box titled, \"Year Built,\" is written \"1974.\" Obviously, vacant property is not \"built.\" Thus, this document seems to clearly refute appellee's assertion that he did not believe he was applying for a loan to mortgage the residential premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Additionally, the loan application states that the property will be the \"Primary Residence.\" The loan application thus indicates that the Fraziers did not sign an application for a loan on vacant property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Furthermore, the property was appraised, and the appraisal describes a house, not vacant property. The appraisal (1) states that the site area is 1.02 acres (the size of the residential lot), (2) indicates that an interior and exterior inspection were performed, (3) describes the property as a one-story with exterior walls consisting of \"WD, ALUM, BRK\" and a roof surface of \"COMP SHGL,\" (4) contains a floorplan sketch of the residence that includes a deck, patio, kitchen, three bedrooms, dining room, bathroom, and living room, (5) lists square footage calculations, (6) shows pictures of a house and references an in-ground pool and a large deck, and (7) lists the parcel number as 24-1611274000, which is the residential lot. Obviously, this is not an appraisal of the vacant lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 56} A \"Survey Affidavit\" that the Fraziers signed also attests that they owns 918 Lunbeck Road, as shown on the attached survey. The attached survey illustrates a 1.02 acre tract that contains an asphalt drive way, a pool, a deck, and a 0.559 acre tract that \"per owner * * * [is] not included in [the] mortgage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Additionally, the mortgage that the Fraziers signed stated that the premises would be occupied as their principal residence. Thus, appellee's assertion that he and Mrs. Frazier did not believe the mortgage covered the residential property is questionable. While we note this case is before us upon appeal from a summary judgment motion and we do not judge the credibility of the evidence at this stage, ample items of documentary evidence appears to refute appellee's statements that he did not intend to mortgage the residential property. Nevertheless, we must remand this matter to the trial court so that it may engage in further proceedings in light of our decision. We believe that it would be inequitable to allow homeowners to escape mortgage obligations due to errors in a metes and bounds property description when all parties obviously knew what property was being mortgaged.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irwin v.

On appeal, the Betteleys, the homeowners, asserted that their mortgage was void and not subject to reformation due to an inadequate legal description of the property. The appellate court determined that although \"the bank's drafting failures * * * were careless and substantial,\" the failures did not \"preclude reformation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   The Bettelys were not innocent, subsequent lien holders without notice of [the bank's] encumbrance as a result of its scrivener's errors. Instead, the Betteleys are seeking to avoid their obligations in spite of receiving the benefit of [the bank's] loan. Although the mortgage continued to include the erroneous parcel number, it always identified the correct mailing address and included the legal description for the residential parcel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Further, the testimony and evidence presented at trial clearly and convincingly establishes that [the bank] and the Betteleys intended to encumber the same property, i.e., their residential parcel with mailing address 5012 River Road and parcel number 03A-079-0-00-044-0.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34-35.

Rather, the existence\n   of genuine issues of material fact require that we overrule this assignment of error, but recognize that this matter will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 71} In its third assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion to substitute Mrs. Frazier's estate and by dismissing its claims against Mrs. Frazier. Appellant recognizes that it filed the motion to substitute outside of the Civ.R. 25(A) ninety-day time frame, but asserts that the trial court should have permitted it to substitute the correct party outside of the ninety-day period under the authority of Civ.R. 6(B). Appellant contends that under Civ.R. 6(B), the court could permit the substitution to occur outside of the ninety-day period upon a showing of excusable neglect. Appellant thus alleges that it did not file the motion within ninety days due to excusable neglect. Appellant claims that the parties were engaged in settlement negotiations for several months and, thus, its decision not to seek substitution was reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Civ.R. 25(A)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court shall, upon motion, order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the successors or representatives of the deceased party and shall be served on the parties as provided in Civ.R. 5 and upon persons not parties in the manner provided in Civ.R. 4 through Civ.R. 4.6 for the service of summons. Unless the motion for substitution is made not later than ninety days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death as provided herein for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 73} A party who fails to file a motion to substitute within the ninety-day time frame \"may move for an enlargement of time pursuant to Civ.R. 6(B).\"\n   <em>\n    Perry v.

It is not clear, however, whether the trial court recognized that it could extend the time under Civ.R. 6(B) if appellant established excusable neglect. Here, the trial court's decision did not refer to Civ.R. 6(B) and did not find that appellant failed to establish excusable neglect.
