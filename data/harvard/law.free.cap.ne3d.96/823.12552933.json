WRIGHT, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellants, Attorney Brian D. Spitz and the Spitz Law Firm, LLC (collectively Spitz), appeal the trial court's decision awarding Lake Hospital System, Inc. and Maria Creagh $22,926.72 in attorney fees and expenses. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In February 2014, Spitz filed a complaint on behalf of Linda Keith-Harper against Lake Hospital System, Inc. and Maria Creagh (collectively appellees). Keith-Harper worked for the hospital as an LPN and thereafter an RN for more than 15 years. Creagh became Keith-Harper's supervisor and department manager in 2012 until Keith-Harper was terminated in September of 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The complaint alleges seven causes of action against appellees arising from Keith-Harper's termination, including age discrimination, wrongful termination based on age discrimination, disability discrimination based on Keith-Harper's knee replacement, wrongful termination based on disability discrimination, unlawful FMLA retaliation, workers' compensation retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellees filed their motion for summary judgment in December 2014. The trial court granted summary judgment on all claims in appellees' favor on May 27, 2015. No appeal was filed from this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellees subsequently filed a motion for sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11 against plaintiff's counsel Brian D. Spitz and the Spitz Law Firm, LLC. The trial court held a frivolous conduct hearing, and thereafter concluded in its seven-page decision that \"Spitz's conduct after December 16, 2014 met the criteria of frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2) * * *.\" The trial court found Attorney Brian D. Spitz and the Spitz Law Firm LLC jointly and severally responsible for $22,926.72 in expenses and attorney fees the hospital incurred after most discovery had ended. The court did not find a Civ.R. 11 violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Spitz's amended appellate brief asserts six assignments of error. We address his first two assignments together for ease of analysis, which assert:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"The trial court committed reversible error by finding frivolous conduct in prosecuting Keith-Harper's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"Because Brian Spitz did not engage in any frivolous conduct, the trial court erred in sanctioning him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} R.C. 2323.51(B)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"[A]ny party adversely affected by frivolous conduct may file a motion for an award of court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the civil action or appeal.

She had received workers compensation benefits for eight years with no problems from defendants. * * * [Keith-Harper] never testified that she was directly targeted because of her age. Creagh testified that she was more than forty years old herself. At this point in discovery, defendants turned over a considerable amount of material documenting plaintiff's declining performance and disciplinary actions for insubordination, violation of hospital protocol and unsatisfactory performance.

Spitz and the Spitz Law Firm, LLC. Thus, the firm was on notice that the claim was against it as well as individually against Attorney Spitz. Accordingly, we find no plain error in the trial court's decision holding the Spitz Law Firm jointly and severally liable with Attorney Brian Spitz for the R.C. 2323.51 award. Spitz's third assigned error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Spitz's fourth assigned error asserts,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 39} \"The trial court committed reversible error by holding that appellees were adversely affected by having to pay standard defense costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Spitz claims the trial court never addressed how appellees were adversely affected by its frivolous conduct and claims that appellees simply incurred \"normal defense costs\" to defend the suit. We disagree. The trial court found in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 41} \"The court finds that Spitz's conduct after December 16, 2014 met the criteria of frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2) in that plaintiff's allegations or other factual contentions had no evidentiary support and were not likely to have evidentiary support particularly after the first deposition of Keith-Harper which failed to provide evidence supporting her claims. Defendants' lead attorney * * * immediately after the deposition, * * * contacted * * * an attorney then working for Spitz Law Firm, and asked her to dismiss the lawsuit. This was not done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Thereafter, appellees filed their motion for summary judgment, opposed Spitz's motions to extend the deadline, filed a reply brief to plaintiff's motion in opposition, and also began preparing for trial filing a trial brief and a motion to bifurcate. Spitz likewise submitted a settlement demand after the unfavorable deposition testimony. The trial court did not issue its summary judgment decision until May 27, 2015, 20 days before trial was scheduled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Thus, the trial court found that Spitz's continued pursuit of Keith-Harper's claims after the key discovery depositions adversely affected appellees. The trial court did not award attorney fees for the entirety of the case. Spitz's fourth assigned error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Spitz's fifth assignment of error asserts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 45} \"The alleged billing records were not properly before the trial court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Spitz argues that appellees' defense firm's billing invoices were not formally submitted or admitted into evidence at the sanction hearing. The billing invoices, marked as defendant's exhibit 1, were introduced and identified as the monthly billing invoices Lake Hospital System, Inc. received from the law firm of Brennan, Manna &amp; Diamond, LLC in defending the Keith-Harper lawsuit. Although the written record does not reflect that this exhibit was offered or admitted into evidence at the hearing, the official court reporter indicates in her certification that defendant's exhibit 1 was admitted into evidence and is to be included with the official hearing transcript of proceedings. The trial court also relies on the invoices in its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 47} \"It is well-established that the admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The hospital's vice president of human resources confirmed that he reviewed these billing statements upon receipt and authorized their payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Further, Attorney Congeni confirmed his firm's hourly rates, explained that these costs were directly related to the defense of Keith-Harper's complaint, and verified that he reviewed each monthly statement before it was mailed to the hospital. Congeni stated that his firm's fees and expenses were reasonable and necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Spitz attempted to point out minor conflicts in the defense billing statements, but did not introduce evidence generally challenging the amount or reasonableness of the firm's billing statements as a whole. Spitz never argued that the defense bills were unnecessary or that the amount was unreasonable. Spitz likewise did not submit evidence disputing the veracity or authenticity of the billing statements. Thus, absent a showing of material prejudice, we cannot find the trial court abused its discretion in relying on defendant's exhibit 1 in fashioning its award. Spitz's fifth assignment is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Spitz's final assignment of error alleges:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 52} \"The trial court erred when it improperly awarded fees charged by law clerks and staff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Spitz argues the trial court erroneously included appellees' defense firm's law clerk and staff time in its R.C. 2323.51 award. Spitz complains that the statute only permits an award for attorney fees and does not authorize the payment of law clerk and other staff time. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 54} R.C. 2323.51 clearly authorizes a \"motion for an award of court costs, reasonable attorney's fees,\n   <em>\n    and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the civil action or appeal * * *\"\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added.) Thus, assuming the trial court's award in this case included time billed for\n   defense counsel's law clerk and other staff members' time billed for time spent in defending Keith-Harper's claims, there is no error since the same constitutes \"other reasonable expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    All Climate Heating &amp; Cooling v.
