When citizens are faced with meritless retaliatory lawsuits designed to chill their constitutional rights of petition or free speech, also known as Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP), Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute provides a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, two minors and their parents filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against a doctor who reported suspected medical child abuse to the Department of Child Services (DCS). The doctor claimed the lawsuit was a SLAPP and her report to DCS was protected speech shielded by Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute. The trial court agreed and dismissed the lawsuit. We reverse, finding the anti-SLAPP statute inapplicable in this case because to be protected under Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute a person's actions must be \"in furtherance of\" his or her right of petition or free speech and \"in connection with a public issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-7-7-5\">\n    Ind.

Since birth, A.V. has suffered from several medical conditions, including gastrointestinal (GI) issues, requiring many procedures and medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2013, Dr. Susan Maisel, A.V.'s doctor, became concerned that Stacey was exaggerating A.V.'s GI symptoms. Dr. Maisel recommended admitting A.V. to the hospital for observation. Dr. Maisel then contacted Dr. Cortney Demetris, a board-certified doctor in pediatrics and child-abuse pediatrics, about her concerns that A.V. was a victim of medical child abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2013, A.V. was admitted for observation, and Dr. Demetris was her attending physician. After two days, Dr. Demetris noted in her medical files that A.V. was \"a well appearing child\" without \"any significant medical complaints.\" Appellants' App. Vol. 2, p.127. Based on video surveillance from A.V.'s room, conversations with A.V.'s other physicians, and interactions with A.V.'s parents, Dr. Demetris concluded that A.V. suffered from medical child abuse. A hospital social worker then reported Dr. Demetris's diagnosis to DCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Less than a week later, DCS removed A.V. and M.V. from their parents and filed a petition alleging they were children in need of services (CHINS). Ultimately, A.V. and M.V. were returned to their parents. However, because Stacey worked\n   with children, DCS conducted a Child Care Worker Assessment Review (CCWAR).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the CCWAR, DCS substantiated the allegations of abuse. Eventually, DCS dismissed the CHINS petition, but the VanWinkles sought administrative appeal of the substantiated allegations. After a hearing, an administrative law judge substantiated the neglect allegations as to A.V. only. This finding was ultimately reversed by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The VanWinkles, individually and on behalf of A.V. and M.V., then filed a proposed medical malpractice complaint with the Indiana Department of Insurance, alleging Dr. Demetris's diagnosis of medical child abuse fell below the standard of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before the medical review panel could consider the complaint, Dr. Demetris moved for a preliminary determination of law and dismissal, arguing that her report to DCS was protected by Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court agreed and dismissed, finding \"Dr. Demetris spoke upon a matter of public concern or public interest when she reported her diagnosis of medical child abuse to [DCS]\" and therefore her report was protected speech covered under the statute. Appellants' App. Vol. 2, pp.15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The VanWinkles appealed and our Court of Appeals reversed, concluding the anti-SLAPP statute did not apply.\n   <em>\n    Gresk v.

Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute is inapplicable in this case.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Demetris argues that, as a matter of first impression, Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute should be broadly construed to afford protection to reports of suspected child abuse. The VanWinkles respond that the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to these facts, which concern a statutory duty to report involving a private, confidential matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   SLAPPs can be difficult to identify. But for the anti-SLAPP statute to apply, the statutory requirements of Indiana Code section 34-7-7-5 must be satisfied. Upon receiving an anti-SLAPP motion to dismiss, the court must determine three things: (1) whether an action was \"in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech;\" and, (2) if so, whether the action was \"in connection with a public issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20Ind.%20Acts%201403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34-7-7-5(1). If both requirements are satisfied, the court then analyzes (3) whether the action was \"taken in good faith and with a reasonable basis in law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20Ind.%20Acts%201403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 34-7-7-5(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, we find the anti-SLAPP statute inapplicable because Dr. Demetris's report was not made pursuant to her right of petition or free speech. Normally, this would end the analysis because all three requirements must be met.

The VanWinkles argue that child abuse\n   <strong>\n    generally\n   </strong>\n   is of concern to the public, but specific, individual reports are not. They find the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Kadambi\n   </em>\n   persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304466\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/86/900/#p909\">\n    86 F.Supp.3d at 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding practice of medicine and pharmacy are of great public interest on a macro level, but the case's narrow issue involving denied patient prescriptions was not significant to the public).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As required by the anti-SLAPP statute, Dr. Demetris identified the specific public issue that prompted constitutionally-protected acts in this case as \"Dr. Demetris reporting her suspicions that her patient,\n   A.V., was the victim of medical child abuse.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants' App. Vol. 2, p.33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With this in mind, we note that this Court has not addressed what is or is not a \"public issue\" under Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute, and we are doubtful an all-encompassing definition can be given. Regarding the First Amendment, we have said that speech is in connection with a matter of public concern if it is addressed to \" 'any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community,' as determined by its content, form, and context.\"\n   <em>\n    Love v.

We think this is a sufficient guide to determining what is a \"public issue,\" and courts should analyze the narrow statements at issue, avoiding a sweeping view of what is \"public.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While child abuse in certain instances may be an issue of public interest, it is not in this case. Here, the form of Dr. Demetris's report was confidential, including content specific to one minor, A.V., and potential abuse by her parents. We agree with Dr. Demetris that child abuse reporting is of general public interest and, indeed, to further that interest the legislature has provided immunity to those who report. But that does not make every report a newsworthy event, particularly when the substance of the report is confidential and concerns a private matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v. Prewett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8353078\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/860/1234/#p1248\">\n    860 N.E.2d 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1248 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007). Thus, based on the narrow content, form, and context of this report-medical child abuse of one child-it was not a matter of public concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Indiana's anti-SLAPP statute was adopted in response to the discrete problem of retaliatory lawsuits aimed at chilling constitutional rights. The VanWinkles' lawsuit \"is not the type of lawsuit that the anti-SLAPP statute was enacted to prevent\" because it was not filed to stifle Dr. Demetris's \"speech on a public issue or an issue of public interest,\" but to recover damages for alleged medical malpractice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8353078\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/860/1234/#p1248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, we reverse, and remand for consideration of the stayed issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Rush, C.J., and David and Goff, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Slaughter, J., not participating.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Medical child abuse, formerly called Munchausen syndrome by proxy, is a form of child abuse where a child receives unnecessary and potentially risky medical treatment due to false symptom reporting by a parent or caregiver.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    A CCWAR is required when a \"child care worker,\" as defined in 465 Indiana Administrative Code section 3-1-5, has allegations of child abuse and/or neglect filed against them as an employee or personally.
