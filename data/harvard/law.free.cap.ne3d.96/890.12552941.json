For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Edwards and S.K. met in October 2012 and began dating shortly thereafter. Edwards and S.K.'s family got along well during their relationship. Consequently, Edwards had contact phone numbers for S.K.'s family including her brother and father, B.K. The relationship ended on January 30, 2015. On that day, S.K. went to Edwards' apartment to retrieve some personal items. When S.K. told Edwards she no longer wanted to be in a relationship with him, Edwards shoved her and\n   she fell. No report was made of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Thereafter, S.K. and B.K. began receiving threatening text messages and emails from unknown senders. S.K. changed her phone number on two separate occasions in an attempt to avoid the messages. Edwards called S.K.'s place of employment in Independence, Ohio, multiple times, identifying himself as a police officer in order to successfully obtain S.K.'s new phone number. S.K. reported the calls to Officer Murphy of the Independence Police Department as well as an incident where she discovered her tires were slashed. Edwards subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of impersonating a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} S.K. and B.K. continued to receive threatening messages and reported the threats to Officer Bell of the City of Stow Police Department. Edwards subsequently pleaded guilty to telecommunication harassment in the Stow Municipal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Nonetheless, S.K. and B.K. continued to receive threatening messages. The messages, however, came from unfamiliar or unidentified phone numbers and email addresses and the senders identified themselves as \"Valerie,\" \"Andrew Peters,\" \"John Wick,\" \"Felix Franse,\" and \"DeQuinn Jones.\" Many of the threatening messages included death threats toward S.K., B.K., and the rest of their family. Through a joint investigation, Officer Bell and Officer Murphy were able to link the threatening messages to Edwards' IP address. In May 2015, S.K. was granted a civil protection order against Edwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 8, 2015, a call was made from Edwards' mother's phone number to the Stow-Munroe Falls High School (\"Stow High School\"). The caller told the Stow High School receptionist that there was a bomb in the school and that it was \"going to go boom.\" Consequently, Stow High School was evacuated and searched. No bomb was found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Summit County Grand Jury subsequently indicted Edwards on the following six charges: (I) inducing panic in violation of R.C. 2917.31(A)(1) /(C)(5), a felony of the second degree; (II) telecommunications harassment in violation of R.C. 2917.21 (A)(4), a felony of the fifth degree; (III) telecommunications harassment in violation of R.C. 2917.21 (A)(3), a felony of the fifth degree; (IV) aggravated menacing in violation of R.C. 2903.21, a misdemeanor of the first degree; (V) aggravated menacing in violation of R.C. 2903.21, a misdemeanor of the first degree; and (VI) violating a protection order in violation of R.C. 2919.27, a misdemeanor of the first degree. Edwards pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded through the pretrial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Following trial, a jury returned \"guilty\" verdicts as to Counts I, II, III, IV, and V. However, the jury returned a \"not guilty\" verdict as to Count VI. For sentencing purposes, the trial court merged Count II into Count I. The trial court then sentenced Edwards as follows: Count I, inducing panic: a definite term of four years; Count III, telecommunications harassment: a definite term of eleven months; Count IV, aggravated menacing: a definite and local term of six months; and Count V, aggravated menacing: a definite and local term of six months. The trial court ordered Edward to serve the sentences imposed on Counts I and III consecutively with each other, but concurrently with Counts IV and V, for a total sentence of four years and eleven months incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Edwards filed this timely appeal, raising six assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Spirlin Edwards' due process was violated by the denial of a mistrial due to false testimony, contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 1, 10, and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In his first assignment of error, Edwards contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a mistrial when the State knowingly presented false and misleading testimony that was unduly prejudicial.

During that testimony, the State sought to authenticate certain phone records as well as introduce testimony concerning the inability to spoof a particular type of telephone line. Edwards's trial counsel objected to the testimony, arguing that the Time Warner supervisor was not qualified to testify on the subject of spoofing. The trial court initially overruled Edwards's objection, noting that the witness was \"a supervisor in the department that investigates these things.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} However, based upon testimony elicited during cross-examination, the trial court subsequently determined that the Time Warner supervisor was indeed not qualified to testify on the issue and that his testimony on direct examination had been hearsay. The trial court then ordered the testimony to be stricken and a jury instruction was given as to the same. Edwards later moved for a mistrial, arguing that a jury instruction to disregard the supervisor's testimony was insufficient. In denying Edwards's motion, the trial court stated that Edwards' trial counsel's cross-examination of the Time Warner supervisor \"was so withering\" that the trial court did not trust that \"the jury really believes that the [supervisor] knows what he was talking about on the technical issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} After a thorough review of Edwards' cross-examination of the supervisor, we determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Edwards' motion for mistrial. Specifically, we agree with the trial court's determination that the following exchange between Edwards' trial counsel and the Time Warner supervisor regarding landlines was indeed \"withering:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: You call this a landline but, in fact, it's actually a voice over IP, isn't it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A: Either/or, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q: Well, it's not an either/or.

I said we're all trained in those different capacities. We all have some knowledge, in order to investigate throughout our entire company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   After that exchange, trial counsel then questioned the supervisor about his technical knowledge on spoofing as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q: So, in fairness, how-do you even know how spoofing works?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A: I'm not an expert.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Q: Is that a yes or no?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   A: I have some history of dealing with it, but no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Edwards' motion for mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Spirlin Edwards' due process and confrontation rights were violated by an unqualified witness authenticating business records, contrary to the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article 1, 10, and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In his second assignment of error, Edwards contends that the trial court erred and abused its discretion when it allowed an unqualified witness to authenticate phone records relevant to Count I, inducing panic, and Count II, telecommunications harassment.

Although the docket entry shows that a subpoena was issued to AT&amp;T, the subpoena is not in the record. In order to authenticate the records, the trial court allowed the State to present testimony from a witness employed as an assistant sales manager at AT&amp;T Mobility's Akron-Fairlawn location. During his testimony, the sales manager stated that his \"position is to coach the sales reps into having the same behaviors [he] had when [he] was in their position.\" He also stated that AT&amp;T keeps certain records in the regular course of business, that the information is stored electronically, and that he could look up and print documents associated with a specific customer. When asked if he could identify a record the State sought to publish to the jury, he stated the document was \"subscriber information on a wire line account.\" Included in the document was a record of call logs that the sales manager recognized as being recorded and kept in the electronic data records of AT&amp;T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 23} When the State attempted to publish the records to the jury, Edwards objected, arguing that the State had not established a foundation sufficient to publish to the jury. The trial court then allowed the State to ask additional questions in order to lay \"more foundation\" as to the sales manager's qualifications. During this questioning, the State asked the sales manager if he had access to the records at issue or if he was able to get caller records in his position. The sales manager replied that he did not have the authority to look through client records, but that he was able to review the documents before testifying. However, he did state that he was aware that the documents were \"official documents\" or \"real documents of AT&amp;T.\" The sales manager further stated that in order to get documents in such detail, \"especially if it's from a date that far back,\" there \"would have to be a subpoena or a request from law enforcement for that information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 24} After the State's additional questions, Edwards again objected. At that\n   time, the trial court allowed Edwards to cross-examine the sales manager out of order \"on the issue of his qualifications as custodian of the records for AT&amp;T.\" Upon cross-examination, the sales manager stated that he had not retrieved the records himself. Rather, AT &amp; T's legal department had provided them to him. When Edwards' trial counsel asked the sales manager, \"[a]nd this is not anything that's commonly * * * or regularly kept within your store or within your job description, isn't that correct?\", the sales manager replied, \"Correct.\" Although the trial court noted Edwards' trial counsel's continued objection, the court found the sales manager was qualified to authenticate the records and to testify as to their contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 25} This Court has stated, \"[t]he witness whose testimony establishes the foundation for a business record need not have personal knowledge of the exact circumstances of preparation and production of the document.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-4637\">\n    2003-Ohio-4637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022047697\">\n    2003 WL 22047697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 11, citing Evid.R. 803(6). \"However, the witness must 'demonstrate that he or she is sufficiently familiar with the operation of the business and with the circumstances of the preparation, maintenance, and retrieval of the record in order to reasonably testify on the basis of this knowledge that the record is what it purports to be, and was made in the ordinary course of business.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022047697\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Keeva J.

The receptionist at Stow High School testified she had received the threatening phone call between 10:55 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. She also stated that based on the tone and pitch of the caller's voice, she believed the caller was a male in his late twenties. Edwards' mother testified that Edwards had been staying with her for about a week prior to the date of the threatening phone call and was at her home the day on the day of the call.

Officer Murphy testified that he first came into contact with Edwards when investigating property damage (four slashed tires) to S.K.'s vehicle while it was parked at her place of employment in Independence, Ohio. Although Edwards was named as a suspect, no charges were ever filed. Later, when multiple phone calls were made to S.K.'s place of employment wherein the caller identified himself as a police officer in order to get S.K.'s phone number, the\n   Independence police department began another investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 33} During that investigation, Officer Murphy retained the phone records from S.K.'s place of employment as well as Edwards' phone records. Officer Murphy testified that from those records he was able to ascertain that Edwards' phone number appeared on the incoming records of S.K.'s place of employment and that number appeared on Edwards outgoing records. Concurrent with that investigation, S.K. and B.K. continued to send Officer Murphy information about threatening contacts they received via email and text messages. A number of the messages referenced the damage to S.K.'s car. As such, Officer Murphy believed if he could determine who was sending the messages about the slashed tires, he might be able to charge that person. Officer Murphy described his ensuing investigation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   So, both those numbers, I was able to-I Googled those numbers and it came back to a company called level 3 Communications on both of those numbers.

Accordingly, the doctrine precludes Edwards from asserting as error on appeal the admittance of S.K.'s testimony elicited during cross-examination.

Upon objection, the trial court allowed B.K. to \"answer from his understanding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Officer Bell testified that he first became acquainted with S.K. and B.K. when B.K. called the Stow Police Department to report that his daughter's tires had been slashed in Independence, Ohio, because B.K. wanted them \"to be aware of any problems that might follow him home.\" Approximately two weeks later, Officer Bell was dispatched to their residence for a report of telecommunications harassment. That evening, Officer Bell was able to ascertain that Edwards was contacting S.K. through a white pages application (\"app\") S.K. had installed on her phone. That app showed several phone calls from Edwards to S.K. At that time he also learned that Officer Murphy was conducting a parallel investigation in Independence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Officer Bell then contacted Officer Murphy to inquire about the status of his investigation and learned that Officer Murphy had completed subpoenas for information on Edwards' apartment phone and \"had obtained a lot of information based off of that subpoena.\" Officer Bell testified over objection that through a joint investigation with Officer Murphy, he was able to learn that Edwards had created an account through textPlus under the name of Felix Fanse by providing the contact email of johnwick34@yahoo.com. Additionally, Officer Bell learned that \"a subpoena to WOW [Cable] revealed that all [of] this information returned to the IP address-the router number used by the-that local computer to actually call the Internet, if you will-and the phone number and address for Spirlin Edwards.\" Upon objection to this testimony, the trial court noted that the question posed to Officer Bell was in reference to the results of a joint investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Although Edwards' trial counsel did object to B.K.'s and Officer Bell's testimony regarding how they were able to link the threatening messages to Edwards' IP address through the unadmitted unauthenticated records, we need not decide whether their testimony was testimonial hearsay.

As such, Edwards contends that \"the trial court's entry of sentence conflicted with its findings at the sentencing hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 56} During the sentencing hearing, but prior to imposing sentence, the trial court addressed Edwards and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [B]egining a year ago, February of 2015, you got convicted for telecommunication harassment after you broke up with your girlfriend. You got convicted for impersonating a police officer to find her identity. You got convicted for either\n   domestic violence or disorderly conduct. And now you've been convicted of these felony offenses. And something terrible has gone wrong, and the Court has to address that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The trial court proceeded to advise Edwards that a report from the Psycho-Diagnostic Clinic recommended counseling. However, the trial court then found that it could not \"manage\" Edwards in the community because he was \"still too much of a threat to the community.\" However, the trial court disagreed with the State that eight years was an appropriate sentence, noting that Edwards had not accepted responsibility for his actions. Then, after imposing sentence, the trial court stated that it was imposing consecutive sentences \"based on the severity of the crime, based on the effect on the public, and based on the need to protect the community from further acts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Although \"this Court encourages trial courts to refer to the language of the statute when making findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C), after reviewing the sentencing transcript in light of the language of the statute,\" we are able to discern that the trial court in this case \" 'engaged in the correct analysis' and made the requisite findings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
