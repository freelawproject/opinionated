Further, on this record, there was no reasonable view of the evidence that defendant could not safely retreat at the time that deadly physical force was used (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Penal Law \u00a7 35.15[2][a] ;\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Y.K.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    87 N.Y.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    639 N.Y.S.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    663 N.E.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1996] ).\n  </p>\n  <author id=\"p-10\">\n   WILSON, J. (dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The majority acknowledges that we must view \"the record in a light most favorable to the accused\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Thus, when a defendant requests a justification charge, as Mr. Sanchez did here, the\n   trial court must give it \"if any reasonable view of the evidence would permit the fact finder to decide that the conduct was justified\" and, \"[u]nder such circumstances, refusal to charge that the People must disprove the alleged justification is reversible error\" (\n   <em>\n    McManus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4402893\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/67/541/#p549\">\n    67 N.Y.2d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=505%20N.Y.S.2d%2043\">\n    505 N.Y.S.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=496%20N.E.2d%20202\">\n    496 N.E.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The majority accepts, at least for the purpose of its analysis, that Mr. Sanchez had a reasonable\n   <em>\n    subjective\n   </em>\n   belief that he was responding to a threat of deadly force, but concludes that whatever Mr. Sanchez may have believed, no reasonable person-with Mr. Sanchez's \"background and experiences\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. Wesley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2350241\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/76/555/#p559\">\n    76 N.Y.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=561%20N.Y.S.2d%20707\">\n    561 N.Y.S.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=563%20N.E.2d%2021\">\n    563 N.E.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1990] )-could have believed that Mr. Sanchez's actions were justified as self defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following is the evidence most favorable to Mr. Sanchez. (True, there is contrary evidence, much of which would likely have caused a trier of fact to reject Mr. Sanchez's defense had the court given a justification charge, but that weighing of evidence is the function of the jury, not this Court.) Ask whether, were you a reasonable juror accepting the following evidence as true and disregarding all contrary evidence as false, you would nevertheless reject Mr. Sanchez's justification defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Sanchez was stabbed in the abdomen in a bar, and was hospitalized for 10 days. The \"word on the street\" was that the attackers had not \"finished the job.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Two months after his release from the hospital, Mr. Sanchez and four friends (two men and two women) were at a restaurant in Poughkeepsie. While in the bathroom, three men beat up Mr. Sanchez while the bouncer stood by watching. Mr. Sanchez had a purple eye and a sharp pain in the location of his prior stab wound. Mr. Sanchez feared his stomach wound had been reopened, and was afraid of being stabbed again. The attackers said they would kill him if he ever came back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Returning to his friends, Mr. Sanchez asked one of his female friends to go open the car because he wanted to leave \"real quick\" so that he could get medical help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 As Mr. Sanchez and his friends were leaving, 10-15 people, including his attackers, followed them outside with threats, saying not to come back and that they would kill them. Mr. Sanchez and his friends testified that they were afraid of\n   being attacked by the group. One of Mr. Sanchez's male friends, Mr. Martinez-Mendoza, told Mr. Sanchez to go to the car and get another friend's gun. Mr. Sanchez retrieved the gun and walked back to where his two male friends stood.\n   \u2022 Mr. Sanchez then saw one of his bathroom attackers reach into the waist of his pants for \"something shiny\" that appeared to be a knife. Mr. Sanchez also heard beer bottles being broken for use as weapons. The decedent, one of the threatening group, said something to another of the bathroom attackers, began taking off his belt, and grabbed Mr. Sanchez's other male friend (Mr. Ramirez). At that point, Mr. Martinez-Mendoza took the gun from Mr. Sanchez's hand and shot in the direction of the group, striking and killing the decedent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Martinez-Mendoza, the shooter, told the police he fired the gun because he felt threatened and afraid because a crowd of people had come after him and his friends. At Mr. Sanchez's trial, Mr. Martinez-Mendoza testified that that the reason he had the gun and was aiming it at the people outside El Molino was to protect his friends, and that he was fearful for his and his friends' safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Sanchez, of course, had a duty to retreat without the use of deadly force, but only if he \"kn[ew] that with complete personal safety, to [him]self and others\" he would be able to retreat from the confrontation ( Penal Law \u00a7 35.15[2] ). However, even if Mr. Sanchez might have been able to leave in safety at some earlier time that night, that is irrelevant; the question is whether safe retreat was available to him when deadly force was employed, which is when the duty to retreat arises (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Y.K.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    87 N.Y.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    639 N.Y.S.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    663 N.E.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1996] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   If you believe, on the above version of the facts, that no reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Sanchez's actions were justified, then the majority is correct, and Mr. Sanchez should have been denied the justification charge he requested. But if you believe that you might have done the same as Mr. Sanchez under the circumstances, to protect yourself and your friends, then these facts, along with the many contrary facts, must be submitted to the jury for determination of Mr. Sanchez's claim of justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lurking somewhere beneath the majority's opinion is the thought that you mustn't bring a gun to a knife fight. We\n   should keep in mind that, although there is no evidence that the group threatening Mr. Sanchez and his friends was armed with guns, courts of this state have held that the threat of deadly force may exist when a group of people attacking an individual is not armed at all (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Y.K.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    87 N.Y.2d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    639 N.Y.S.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8594611\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/430/#p434\">\n    663 N.E.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) or when, in a one-on-one altercation, an unarmed victim \"grabs\" at a defendant's gun (\n   <em>\n    People v. Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20A.D.3d%2039\">\n    160 A.D.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20N.Y.S.3d%20422\">\n    71 N.Y.S.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2018] ). The use of broken glass and glass bottles may also constitute deadly force (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.
