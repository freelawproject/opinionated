This Court reverses and remands for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On the morning of March 18, 1985, Purk called for emergency assistance and reported that his wife, who was nine months pregnant at the time, had tried to hang herself from the railing surrounding the stairwell in their two-floor apartment. Purk greeted the police when they arrived and directed them to his wife, who was lying on her back at the foot of the stairs. Purk indicated that he had found his wife hanging, had used a knife to cut her down, and had attempted CPR before calling for assistance. The paramedics responded only minutes after his call and were able to restore the victim's heartbeat. They then transported her to a hospital where she received further treatment and her son was delivered via a cesarean birth. Despite their best efforts, both the victim and her son died. Following an autopsy, the victim's death was ruled a suicide, and the case was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In March 2009, Sergeant Ken Mifflin began investigating a house fire that occurred at Purk's home in Stow. During his investigation, Sergeant Mifflin learned that Purk's first wife had died of an apparent suicide, but that there were individuals who found the circumstances surrounding her death suspicious. He then spent the next few years investigating her\n   death, requesting the original police reports and interviewing various individuals. Eventually, he approached the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office to ask for an opinion. After listening to him and viewing the original autopsy photos and results, the Medical Examiner's Office agreed that it was appropriate to exhume the victim's body for the purpose of conducting a second autopsy. The second autopsy occurred in September 2011. As a result of the second autopsy, the victim's death was ruled a homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Subsequently, a grand jury indicted Purk on one count of murder and one count of tampering with evidence. Four days before trial, Purk moved to dismiss his indictment on the basis of unconstitutional, pre-indictment delay. The court heard arguments from the parties on the first day of trial, and denied the motion. The matter then immediately proceeded to trial, following which the jury found Purk guilty on both counts. The court sentenced him to a total of 18 years to life in prison to be served consecutively with a sentence Purk was already serving in an unrelated matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Purk now appeals from his convictions and raises four assignments of error for our review. For ease of analysis, we consolidate several of the assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE 28-YEAR DELAY BETWEEN MARGARET PURK'S DEATH AND SCOTT PURK'S INDICTMENT DEPRIVED MR. PURK OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW, AND REQUIRES REVERSAL OF HIS CONVICTIONS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Purk argues that he was denied due process when the trial court denied his motion to dismiss and allowed him to stand trial for conduct he allegedly committed 28 years before his indictment. Because the record reflects that the trial court failed to apply the correct legal standard when considering Purk's motion to dismiss, we reverse and remand this matter for the trial court to apply the correct standard in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \" 'In reviewing a decision on a motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay, we accord deference to the trial court's findings of fact but engage in a de novo review of the trial court's application of those facts to the law.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, he asserts that he was prejudiced because the following evidence was not available to him at the time of trial: (1) the rope that his wife allegedly used to hang herself; (2) the knife that he allegedly used to cut her down; (3) the original photographs that the police took at the Purks' apartment; (4) records from the hospital where the paramedics brought the victim for treatment; (5) records from a psychiatric clinic at which the victim allegedly sought treatment at some earlier point; and (6) maintenance and leasing records for the Purks' apartment. Purk argues that the foregoing evidence was material to his defense because it would have shown the exact manner\n   in which his wife hung herself and would have allowed comparisons between the rope she used and the impressions on her neck. He further argues that the evidence would have shown whether the rope left impressions on the wooden railing at the apartment or whether the landlord had replaced or repaired the railing after the incident. As to the medical records, he argues that they would have established whether several of his wife's injuries were the result of resuscitative efforts and whether she had a history of suicidal ideations. Purk contends that the State's delay in bringing charges against him was unjustifiable because its case rested on the same evidence that it had available to it in 1985.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Before turning to the merits of Purk's argument, we must first consider whether the trial court applied the correct legal standard in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saxon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-6905\">\n    2009-Ohio-6905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205150341\">\n    2009 WL 5150341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 12.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280595\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/148/167/\">\n    148 Ohio St.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280595\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/148/167/\">\n    2016-Ohio-5105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20N.E.3d%20688\">\n    69 N.E.3d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 29-30.

The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   And even though that evidence may not be admissible, there was new evidence, where based upon Mr. Purk's more recent convictions for the arson, it caused the State to take a different look at him. * * * [T]hat's not admissible evidence, but it is evidence to justify the delay in the proceedings of this matter, caused the State to take a different look at him.
