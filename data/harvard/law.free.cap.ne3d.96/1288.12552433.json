Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In March 1992, Otte was charged with four counts of aggravated murder, in violation of both R.C. 2903.01(A) and 2903.01(B), for the murders of Robert Wasikowski and Sharon Kostura. The aggravated murder charges contained two death penalty specifications that (1) Otte committed the murder while committing aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary, as described in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and (2) the aggravated murder of Sharon Kostura was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons, as described in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). In addition to the murder charges, the indictment charged Otte with two counts each of aggravated burglary, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A three-judge panel found Otte guilty of four counts of aggravated murder with both death specifications. The panel also found Otte guilty of two counts of aggravated robbery and two counts of aggravated burglary, but acquitted him of the kidnapping charges. At the conclusion of the penalty phase of trial, the panel found that the aggravating circumstances of the crimes outweighed any mitigating factors and sentenced Otte to death. His convictions and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal to this court and the Ohio Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    State v. Otte\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Once the appeals of these claims were exhausted, the Ohio Supreme Court scheduled Otte's execution for March 15, 2017. Governor John Kasich issued two reprieves that postponed Otte's execution date to September 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 21, 2017, Otte filed a complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaration that R.C. 2929.03, Ohio's death penalty statute, violates the Eighth Amendment's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. Otte alleged that \"[b]ased on the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments' evolving standards of decency, the death penalty is now a disproportionate punishment for any offender who committed his capital crime before turning age twenty-one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The state filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), arguing that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. While the case was pending, Otte filed a motion to stay the execution date in the Ohio Supreme Court, which was denied. The trial court subsequently granted the state's motion to dismiss Otte's complaint. In its journal entry, the trial court held that \"a declaratory judgment action cannot be used to collaterally attack a conviction or sentence in a criminal case.\" Otte now appeals the dismissal of his declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his sole assignment of error, Otte argues the trial court erred in concluding that his Eighth Amendment proportionality claim is not justiciable as a declaratory judgment action. He contends his claim is a justiciable controversy appropriate for declaratory judgment because it is not cognizable as a postconviction claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} We review an order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim for relief de novo.\n   <em>\n    Perrysburg Twp. v.

Indeed, R.C. 2953.21(K) states that with the exception of direct appeals, the relief set forth therein \"is the exclusive remedy by which a person may bring a collateral challenge to the validity of a conviction or sentence in a criminal case * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that although the Declaratory Judgments Act is intended to declare rights in the face of uncertainty, a declaratory judgment is not a proper vehicle for challenging a criminal sentence.\n   <em>\n    Lingo v.

He contends his claim, that the death penalty is unconstitutional as applied to offenders who were under 21 years of age at the time they committed their capital offenses, is only now ripe for review as the result of (1) recent scientific discoveries concerning human cognitive development, (2) intervening legal developments, and (2) society's evolving standards of decency for defining cruel and unusual punishments. (Appellant's br. 6, 9.) Otte cites\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v. Bredhold\n   </em>\n   , Ky. Fayette Cir. 7th Div. No. 14-CR-161 (Aug. 1, 2017), to support his argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   , a common pleas court declared Kentucky's death penalty statute unconstitutional insofar as it allows capital punishment for those who were under 21 years of age at the time they committed their offenses.

Based on these statistics, the\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   court concluded that American society viewed juveniles as categorically less culpable than the average criminal for three reasons (1) the lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility were found in youth more often than in adults and were more understandable among the young (2) juveniles were more vulnerable or susceptible to\n   negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure, and (3) the character of a juvenile was not as well formed as that of an adult.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 569-570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   , the Kentucky court noted that since\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   was decided in 2005, six states have abolished the death penalty, and 30 states no longer execute offenders who were under 21 years old when they committed their capital offenses.\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these statistics, the\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   court concluded that there is a \"clear national consensus trending toward restricting the death penalty, especially in cases where defendants were between the ages of 18 and 21 at the time of the offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Based on\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   and the scientific research cited therein, Otte contends he had no right to assert a claim for cruel and unusual punishment within the statutory limitations period for filing petitions for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21 et seq. because no such claim existed until\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   was decided. He also argues he is precluded from filing a successive petition for postconviction. R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) allows convicted defendants to file a successive postconviction petition at any time where both of the following apply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner's situation, and the petition asserts a claim based on that right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable fact finder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). The problem for Otte is that his newly claimed Eighth Amendment right, as defined by\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   , has not been recognized by the United States Supreme Court as required by R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a).\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   is a state court decision from Kentucky and is not binding on Ohio courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Indeed, the United States Sixth Circuit recently observed that \"no authority exists at the present time,\" to support the argument that the defendant in that case, Ronald Phillips, was ineligible for the Ohio death penalty because he was 19 years old at the time he committed the capital offense.\n   <em>\n    In re Ronald Phillips\n   </em>\n   , 6th Cir. No. 17-3729 (July 20, 2017), *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The issue in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   was whether Phillips could maintain a successive petition for habeas corpus to challenge his death sentence. The criteria for maintaining successive petitions for habeas corpus are similar to the criteria needed to prevail on a successive petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. 2244.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the court in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   recognized that there was no constitutional prohibition against the death penalty for offenders who were under 21 years old when they committed their capital offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The court in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   also found it significant that although Phillips relied on case law that developed since the time of his capital conviction, \"the purported defect, his age at the time of the offense, remains unchanged from that time.\" The same holds true for Otte. Yet, Otte argues that recent developments in science and caselaw, including\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   , are akin to newly discovered facts. However, nothing prevented Otte from making that argument with scientific evidence in a successive petition for habeas corpus at some earlier point in time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Otte nevertheless asserts that \"[b]ecause the United States Supreme Court has not yet extended\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   to bar the execution of offenders under the age of 21, the successive post-conviction statute is an inadequate vehicle for Mr. Otte to present his Eighth Amendment claim.\" (Appellant's br. 9, fn. 1.) Therefore, Otte argues, that dismissing his declaratory judgment action would deny him access to the courts. (Appellant's br. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} However, Otte has not been denied access to the courts. He filed petitions for habeas and postconviction relief, and numerous appeals. He has exhausted every available remedy. And he was a party to a recent action brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 to challenge Ohio's lethal injection protocol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ohio Execution Protocol Litigation\n   </em>\n   , S.D.Ohio No. 2:11-cv-1016,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203954295\">\n    2017 WL 3954295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sept. 8, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Otte's complaint for declaratory judgment is an attempt to circumvent the requirements of R.C. 2953.23(A) for postconviction relief because he cannot meet those requirements. To allow Otte to pursue a declaratory judgment would set a dangerous precedent whereby common pleas courts would be asked to review the convictions and sentences of other common pleas courts. The courts would be inundated with declaratory judgment actions. The postconviction relief statute was enacted to provide \" 'the best method of protecting constitutional rights of individuals, and, at the same time, provide a more orderly method of hearing such matters.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kott v. Maxwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1457973\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-2d/3/337/\">\n    3 Ohio App.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=210%20N.E.2d%20746\">\n    210 N.E.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965), paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting R.C. 2953.21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Therefore, because Otte has no right to file a declaratory judgment action to challenge his death sentence, the trial court properly dismissed Otte's complaint. The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J., CONCURS;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, J., CONCURS WITH SEPARATE ATTACHED OPINION\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    According to the court in Bredhold, the following six states abolished the death penalty since Roper was decided: Connecticut (2012), Illinois (2011), Maryland (2013), New Jersey (2007), New Mexico (2009), and New York (2007).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Bredhold court also cited recent research in psychology and neuroscience indicating that individuals in their late teens and early twenties are less mature than older adults in several ways, including impulse control, risk-taking, and emotional development.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    To maintain a successive petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2244, the petitioner must establish either that (1) a new rule of constitutional law applies to his case that the Supreme Court made retroactive to cases on collateral review, or (2) a newly discovered factual predicate exists that, if proven, sufficiently establishes that no reasonable factfinder wold have found the petitioner guilty of the underlying offense but for constitutional error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-44\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, J., CONCURRING:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The facts that form the basis of the original charges made in this case reflect\n   grotesque, barbaric, unimaginably horrific acts of depravity of human against victimized human. Stretching the medical, ethical, and legal mind to formulate the development of an effective and fitting remedy to such distorted violence tests our disciplines. Surely it is fully understandable that formulating a remedy short of an equal measure of violence against the perpetrator falls far short of satisfactory retribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The convicted murderer in this case is not as a matter of right entitled to our compassion as it relates to his sentence. The specific issue raised by the appellant in this appeal is whether, based on 2017 knowledge and values, persons who were less than 21 years of age at the time of their criminal violations should be dealt with differently than fully mature men and women who commit the worst of crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} I understand and concur with the majority's solid legal analysis. Procedurally, Otte cannot successfully utilize a declaratory judgment action to collaterally attack his criminal sentence. However, as major, medical, academic, and legal studies move forward and, as the\n   <em>\n    Bredhold\n   </em>\n   case demonstrates, scientific evidence concerning youth brain development continues to evolve. Given the immediacy of the Otte case, justice may well be best served by openly considering physical and mental youthfulness at the time of violations, including Otte's. Otte is now left, though, with few or no tools with which to successfully argue the legal status of the application of the death penalty to his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 30} There is now pending before our high court the very issue of whether capital punishment is appropriate for youthful offenders. For these next several months, as the Ohio Supreme Court deliberates this issue of age-appropriate punishment, respectfully, I would suspend implementation of capital punishment for those who committed capital crimes before 21 years of age.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
