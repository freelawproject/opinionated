One of the co-workers took a photograph, and another took two videos of Ms. Dunn. The matter was reported to Ms. Dunn's supervisor, who in turn reported it to GOJO's human resources department. The following day, Ms. Dunn was questioned about the incident. She denied being asleep, stating that she had closed her eyes and leaned her head back for a few minutes to deal with a migraine headache. Ms. Dunn had not previously informed GOJO that she suffers from migraine headaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ms. Dunn was suspended, and her employment with GOJO was terminated on March 16, 2015.

Following Ms. Dunn's termination, her former officemate, who was in her late 20s, was assigned the duties previously fulfilled by Ms. Dunn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ms. Dunn sued GOJO alleging disability and age discrimination in violation of R.C. 4112.02. Following discovery, GOJO moved for summary judgment. Ms. Dunn responded in opposition.

In support of its motion for summary judgment, GOJO presented affidavits from two of its human resources employees. Both employees averred that sleeping on the job is grounds for termination at GOJO and that multiple other individuals had their employment with GOJO terminated for sleeping on the job. One of the human resources employees detailed the scope of her investigation into the allegation that Ms. Dunn was sleeping on the job on the date in question. The human resources manager explained that she decided to terminate Ms. Dunn's employment based on the facts gathered in that investigation. Thus, the burden shifted to Ms. Dunn to demonstrate that GOJO's proffered reason was a pretext for disability discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} To demonstrate pretext, \"the plaintiff must show one of the following: (1) that the proffered reasons had no basis in fact, (2) that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate the adverse employment action, or (3) that the employer's reasons were insufficient to motivate the adverse employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Chiancone v.

Later, in her affidavit, she explained, \"If I was snoring in the video it is because I have a well documented problem with asthma and that restricts my airways and makes me snore when I rest my head, face and jaw as I was in the video and [a] migraine can trigger my asthma and make my breathing difficult.\" Thus, Ms. Dunn contends she was not in fact sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Even if Ms. Dunn were not actually sleeping, but merely appeared to be sleeping, that would not negate GOJO's good faith belief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowie v.

In\n   <em>\n    Cutrera\n   </em>\n   , the employee was not being investigated for misconduct prior to informing her employer that she was seeking an accommodation. Rather, she informed her supervisor that she was having difficulties due to a vision impairment and met with a vocational rehabilitation counselor.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 112-113. When she \"could not immediately identify a workable accommodation,\" the employer terminated her employment.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In\n   <em>\n    Maley\n   </em>\n   , the employer had previously granted the plaintiff leave under the Family Medical Leave Act for migraine headaches and depression.\n   <em>\n    Maley\n   </em>\n   at *1. Thus, the employer was aware of the plaintiff's condition.\n   <em>\n    Maley\n   </em>\n   is similar to the present case in that both plaintiffs had migraines and both employers terminated their employment for allegedly sleeping on the job.

When asked about the incident, Ms. Dunn responded in writing on March 13, 2015. She wrote: \"Regarding [the] charge of sleeping at my desk on 3-12-2015, I was not sleeping.

Construing the evidence in Ms. Dunn's favor, she may have informed GOJO that she believed she suffered from a disability, but she did not make a request for an accommodation at that time. She did not describe the extent of her alleged disability or what limitations it caused. She did not state that she needed or desired an accommodation. Finally, she did not even mention her alleged disability until after she engaged in the conduct that GOJO gave as the reason for her termination. Ms. Dunn did not request an accommodation; rather, she requested that her prior conduct be excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Ms. Dunn's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT PREJUDICIALLY AND REVERSIBLY ERRED WHEN IT [ ] GRANTED DEFENDANT-APPELLEE GOJO'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM FILED BY PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT KRISTINIA DUNN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In her second assignment of error, Ms. Dunn claims that the trial court allowed GOJO \"to rest its defense on conclusory opinions that it did not discriminate that contradict its admission [that Ms. Dunn] has a prima facie case,\" that the court erred in relying on evidence from GOJO's disability discrimination defense, and that whether she was sleeping remained as a fact issue for the jury.

GOJO further argued that Ms. Dunn could not demonstrate pretext. GOJO pointed to Ms. Dunn's deposition wherein she testified that she believed she was terminated because of her age because \"GOJO replaced [her] with [her former officemate] who was trained by [her] to handle the job in [her] absence.\" When asked if she had any other facts to support her claim, Ms. Dunn testified, \"No, because [her former officemate] was the only one trained to cover in my absence in that department.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In her opposition brief, Ms. Dunn noted that GOJO had conceded that she had established a prima facie case of age discrimination.

(requiring an appellant to support its argument with citations to authority). Moreover, given that an employer may rebut a prima facie case of disability or age discrimination by presenting its legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action, it is logical that its defense against one claim would mirror its defense against the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 44} GOJO's asserted reason for terminating Ms. Dunn was that she was sleeping on the job. This reason was not, and logically would not be, different when addressing the disability and the age discrimination claims. It is axiomatic that when reasserting its earlier argument, GOJO relied on the same evidence, including the affidavits from its two human resources employees stating that Ms. Dunn was discharged for sleeping on the job and that GOJO discharged six other employees, ages 21 to 50, for sleeping on the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Ms. Dunn also argues that whether she was sleeping on the job was a fact issue to be decided by a jury.
