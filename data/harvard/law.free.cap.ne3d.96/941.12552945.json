For the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Steven Korossy was employed as a police officer for the village of Put-In-Bay in Ottawa County, Ohio. On July 15, 2015, Korossy was indicted on 14 counts of unauthorized use of the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway, a violation of R.C. 2913.04(D), a fifth-degree felony, and one count of falsification, a violation of R.C. 2921.13, a first-degree misdemeanor. Korossy initially entered a plea of not guilty to all counts, but ultimately reached an agreement with the state whereby he would enter a plea of no contest to counts 2, 7, 10, 13, and 14, which would be amended to attempted unauthorized use of the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway, a first-degree misdemeanor, and dismissal of the remaining counts of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court conducted a plea change hearing on May 18, 2016. The state mistakenly told the court that Korossy would be entering a guilty plea, and the trial court began its examination of Korossy with this misinformation. Korossy corrected the court and clarified that he was entering a plea of no contest. Several times during the plea colloquy, however, the court misspoke, referring to the plea as a \"guilty\" plea, then correcting itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court accepted Korossy's no contest plea, and with Korossy's consent, it found him guilty. The court continued the matter for sentencing on August 15, 2016. At that time, it imposed a sentence of 30 days in the Ottawa County Detention Facility on each count, to be served consecutively, for a total period of incarceration of 150 days. It suspended 75 days conditioned on Korossy remaining law-abiding for two years. Korossy was required to forfeit his Ohio peace officer training certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Korossy appealed the trial court judgment, and he assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I.

Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Korossy's five assignments of error all revolve around the same purported defect: the trial court's failure to elicit an \"explanation of the circumstances\" before finding Korossy guilty on his no-contest plea. That is, before relying upon a no-contest plea to convict a defendant for\n   any misdemeanor, the court \"shall call for explanation of circumstances of the offense from the affiant or complainant or his representatives\" together with \"any statement of the accused.\" R.C. 2937.07. Because the explanation of circumstances serves as evidence upon which the trial court may use to base its finding of guilty or not guilty, it must include a recitation of facts that support all of the elements of the offense.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lloyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-331\">\n    2016-Ohio-331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20N.E.3d%20520\">\n    58 N.E.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23 (6th Dist.). Thus, if the transcript of a no-contest plea proceeding does not contain the required explanation of circumstances or an explicit waiver of the required explanation of circumstances from the accused, the resulting conviction lacks sufficient evidence and must be overturned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20N.E.3d%20520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Korossy argues that R.C. 2937.07, Crim.R. 11, and his right to due process were violated when the court found him guilty without eliciting an explanation of circumstances. In his second and third assignments of error, he argues that he was not properly sentenced and that his sentence was contrary to law given the failure to elicit an explanation of circumstances. In his fourth assignment of error, he argues that double jeopardy attached to the charges, thus the proper remedy for the error is complete discharge. And in his fifth assignment of error, he argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure compliance with R.C. 2937.07 and Crim.R. 11. Given that all five assignments of error concern the trial court's failure to provide an explanation of circumstances, we address all assignments of error together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} As explained further below, we agree with Korossy and find that the trial court failed to elicit the explanation of circumstances required by R.C. 2937.07, Korossy did not expressly waive this requirement, and Korossy's conviction therefore lacks sufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt and Korossy has a substantive right to be discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Korossy Did Not Waive an Explanation of the Circumstances.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The state concedes that no explanation of the circumstances was presented, but it insists that Korossy waived this requirement. The state also maintains that Korossy consented to a finding of guilt, thereby rendering an explanation of circumstances unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"A defendant may plead not guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity, guilty or, with the consent of the court, no contest.\" Crim.R. 11(A). A no-contest plea is not an admission of guilt, \"but is an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment, information, or complaint.\" Crim.R. 11(B)(1). The court need not take testimony upon a plea of no contest, however, in misdemeanor cases, it \"may make a finding of guilty or not guilty from the explanation of the circumstances of the offense.\" R.C. 2937.07. We conduct a de novo review of a trial court's finding of guilt following a no contest plea.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown,\n   </em>\n   3d Dist.

The state claims here that Korossy waived the explanation of circumstances requirement during the following exchange with the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [The court]: You are intending to enter a no contest plea to five counts of attempted unauthorized use of the Law Enforcement Gateway, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Korossy]: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [The court]: Do you understand what the allegations are? Do you understand what the offense is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [Korossy]: I have read the indictment, yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court: Mr. Henderson, have you had the opportunity to explain to your client the concept of elements of an offense and what the elements of this offense are?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Henderson: Absolutely, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court: Would you waive any further explanation by the Court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Henderson: Yes, we would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Korossy denies that this dialogue evidences his waiver of the presentation of the explanation of the circumstances; rather, he insists, it evidences only a waiver of an explanation of the\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   of the offense to which he was entering a plea. We agree with Korossy's interpretation of this exchange with the court. The explanation that the court inquired about was an explanation of the elements of the offense. And as we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Kern\n   </em>\n   , a bare recitation of the statute constituting the offense is not an \"explanation of the circumstances\" for purposes of R.C. 2937.07.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, we agree with Korossy that he did not waive the R.C. 2937.07 explanation of the circumstances requirement by waiving an explanation of the\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The state also contends that the trial court was not required to call for an explanation of the circumstances here because Korossy consented to a finding of guilt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [The court]: Is there a consent to a finding of guilt in this matter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Mr. Henderson: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Contrary to the state's position, many Ohio courts have concluded that a defendant's stipulation of guilt upon pleading no contest does not by itself constitute a waiver.

We decline to address his remaining assignments of error. We reverse the trial court's November 18, 2016 judgment, vacate Korossy's conviction, and discharge him.
