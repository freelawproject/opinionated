Defendant-appellant, Glen Gilbert, pled guilty to one count of pandering obscenity involving a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(2), a felony in the second degree. The trial court sentenced Gilbert to 48 months in prison, and he appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Gilbert's original appellate counsel asserted that he could not find any non-frivolous issues for appellate review and moved to withdraw from the case, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967). Consistent with our duty under\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , we conducted an independent review of the record. We found that a potential error exists as to whether, under Crim.R. 11(C)(2), the trial court sufficiently advised Gilbert of the \"maximum penalty\" that would follow a guilty plea. Accordingly, we appointed Gilbert new appellate counsel for the purpose of briefing and presenting that issue, and any others, for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The facts of this case are not in dispute. Gilbert was indicted on four criminal counts: pandering obscenity involving a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(2), a second-degree felony; importuning, in violation of R.C. 2907.07(D)(2), a fifth-degree felony; attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.04(A) and 2923.02, a fourth-degree felony; and disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile in violation of R.C. 2907.31(A)(1), a fifth-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The charges stem from a personal advertisement Gilbert placed on \"Craigslist\" and the resulting online conversation he had with someone whom he believed was a 13-year-old girl, but was actually a Bellevue police officer posing as a young girl. Gilbert sent four pornographic videos, including child pornography, to \"the girl\" and arranged to meet her in a park for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct. The police arrested Gilbert in the park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Gilbert was appointed trial counsel. During the plea hearing, Gilbert agreed to plead guilty to the pandering obscenity charge, in exchange for the state's agreement to dismiss the remaining three counts. With regard to penalties he would face if convicted of a sexually oriented offense, the trial court advised Gilbert as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT: You also understand that you will be required to register as a sexual offender, as a Tier II sex offender, and that you would be required to register for 25 years?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: And that means verifying your address every six months, and you would do that through the Sandusky County Sheriff's Office if you're still residing in Sandusky County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court accepted Gilbert's plea and found him guilty. At a subsequent hearing, the court sentenced him to serve 48 months in prison, to pay certain costs, to register as a Tier II sex offender and to\n   verify his address for the sex offender notification requirements for 25 years. Through his newly appointed appellate counsel, Gilbert assigns a single assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: The trial court committed reversible error when it did not fully explain the reporting requirements of a Tier II sex offender prior to accepting Appellant's plea of guilty, in violation of Crim.R. 11(C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Crim.R. 11(C) governs guilty and no contest pleas in felony cases.

The underlying purpose of Crim.R. 11(C) is to ensure that the information a defendant needs to make a voluntary and intelligent decision about pleading guilty is conveyed to him.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Such punitive consequences include the registration requirements in R.C. 2950.03, the community notification requirements in R.C. 2950.11, and the residential restrictions in R.C. 2950.034.\n   <em>\n    Ragusa\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. If the trial court fails to inform the defendant of all applicable penalties, the plea is invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203219595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding that where the court failed to inform Tier III sex offender of two of the three penalties, the court \"must find that there was a complete failure to comply with the notification duties and the plea is invalid.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} At the plea hearing in this case, the trial court informed Gilbert of the registration obligations that would be required of him as a Tier II sex offender, but did not inform him of any community notification requirements or residential restrictions. Gilbert argues that these omissions render his plea invalid because he was not advised of all the punitive consequences he would face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} We begin with community notification. R.C. 2950.11 generally requires the county sheriff to provide certain individuals with written notice of the sex offender's name, address, offense and photograph. R.C. 2950.11(B). The sheriff's duty to notify extends to individuals living within 1000 feet of the sex offender's premises and to others, such as school superintendents, principals, building managers, executive directors, and administrators within a certain geographical area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2950.11(A)(1)-(10). The community notification requirement applies only to tier III sex offender/child victim offenders and to certain delinquent child tier III sex offender/child victim offenders. R.C. 2950.11(F). It does not extend to Tier II offenders, like Gilbert.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court, however, completely failed to inform Gilbert of the residential restrictions of R.C. 2950.034(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The state urges this court to find that \"based on the totality of the circumstances, [Gilbert] subjectively understood that his plea of guilty * * * would subject him to certain restrictions as a Tier II sex offender such as the inability to live within 1,000 feet of a school, or the inability to hold a state license as an auctioneer and/or cosmetologist or barber.\" In support, the state cites\n   <em>\n    State v.
