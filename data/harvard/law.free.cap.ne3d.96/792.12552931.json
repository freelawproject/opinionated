Ruble filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} First Ruble asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the detailed and graphic testimony of two state witnesses concerning his unwarranted use of force as a deputy sheriff against an arrestee. Although this incident was relevant to his motive for killing his supervisor, a sheriff's lieutenant whose investigation led to Ruble's termination from the sheriff's department, the trial court abused its discretion in determining that unfair prejudice from this evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value. The state could have established Ruble's motive for the murder-to kill the man whose investigation led to his firing-without introducing inflammatory details of the excessive use of force. Nevertheless, the trial court's error in admitting this evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because of the overwhelming remaining evidence of Ruble's guilt, including Ruble's own exhibit that contained most of the same \"other acts evidence\" he objects to on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Next Ruble contends that the trial court committed plain error when it violated his constitutional rights to due process, confrontation, and compulsory process by precluding him from calling witnesses who would have established that the key prosecution witness had twice been arrested for impersonating a police officer. Ruble's contention is meritless because the trial court allowed Ruble to cross-examine the witness about his purported arrests for impersonating a police officer. And the court properly applied Evid.R. 608(B), the validity of which the Supreme Court of the United States has implicitly approved in\n   reviewing analogous state evidentiary rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ruble also argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress his post-indictment custodial statement to law enforcement officers, failing to file a motion to redact parts of his statement, failing to object to part of an officer's testimony that was not based on his personal knowledge, and failing to raise objections concerning matters raised in his other assignments of error. We reject Ruble's argument because he cannot establish that those motions had merit or a reasonable probability of producing a different outcome, which would be necessary to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ruble additionally claims that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on aiding and abetting. We reject this assignment of error because a defendant who is indicted for aggravated murder in the language of a principal offense is on notice that evidence could be presented that he was either a principal offender or an aider or abettor. Thus, the jury was free to credit evidence that supported the complicity charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Finally, Ruble asserts that his conviction should be reversed because of the cumulative-error doctrine. This doctrine is inapplicable here in the absence of multiple findings of otherwise harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} We overrule Ruble's assignments of error and affirm his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In 1981, someone fatally shot Washington County Lieutenant Sheriff Ray Clark through a kitchen window of Clark's home. Over 33 years later, in September 2014, the grand jury charged Ruble with the aggravated murder. After he pled not guilty, the case initially proceeded in 2015 to a trial that resulted in a hung jury. In 2016, a second jury trial produced the following evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On the evening of February 7, 1981, an unknown assailant shot Lt. Ray Clark of the Washington County Sheriff's Office through a window in the kitchen of his home. Clark was transported to a hospital, where he died from a gunshot to his head. The investigating officers made a plaster cast of a shoe print, which resembled a military-style boot, from the area outside Lt. Clark's house. They also found a No. 4 buckshot shotgun shell casing at the murder scene. Multiple witnesses reported observing a blue Ford Pinto station wagon suspiciously driving and parking in different areas near the home at the time of the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ruble became a possible suspect shortly after the murder. He had a motive to kill Lt. Clark, who led an investigation into Ruble's excessive use of force against an arrestee in 1981 when Ruble was a deputy sheriff. The investigation led to Ruble's suspension and eventual termination from the sheriff's office. After a meeting with Lt. Clark in 1981, Ruble left, telling another deputy sheriff that \"the [SOB] fired me.\" Ruble told another deputy sheriff that he blamed Lt. Clark for his firing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Within the next few weeks the sheriff's department obtained statements from Ruble, Deputy Sheriff Robert Smithberger, and Penny Howard. Ruble said that he had left with Howard for Army Reserve drills in West Virginia the Saturday morning of the murder, returned that evening because Howard was sick, and drove his blue Ford Pinto to Smithberger's apartment to spend the night before going back to West Virginia the next morning for more drills. He admitted drinking wine on the drive back Saturday night, drinking beer at Smithberger's apartment later, and feeling the effects of the alcohol. He denied\n   any knowledge of Lt. Clark's murder. In a second statement Ruble admitted drinking a \"great big bottle of wine\" on the trip back home from West Virginia on the day of the murder. He advised the sheriff's department to talk to Howard and Smithberger to verify his alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Howard's statement to the sheriff's department mentioned that sometime near the day of the murder, Ruble called Lt. Clark \"two-faced\" and a \"back-stabber,\" that he would like to \"blow him apart,\" and that the sheriff's office would be better off if Lt. Clark were \"six-feet under.\" She confirmed that Ruble drank wine while driving her back to Marietta that afternoon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In statements to the sheriff's department and to a 1999 grand jury, Smithberger repeatedly verified Ruble's alibi, i.e. on the night of Lt. Clark's murder, Ruble was with Smithberger drinking and sleeping before they had to return to West Virginia for an Army Reserve drill early the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The initial investigation failed to result in any indictments. But in 2011, the Washington County Sheriff's Office opened a Cold Case Unit to focus on unsolved homicides in Washington County; the unit decided to focus on Lt. Clark's unsolved murder. In September 2014, investigators visited Smithberger and questioned him about his and Ruble's involvement in Lt. Clark's murder. Eventually, Smithberger decided to cooperate after he received immunity and witness protection. Ruble's indictment soon followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Howard testified that Ruble hated Lt. Clark and that on the way back to Marietta the day of the murder, Ruble went into a rant about Lt. Clark, declaring he'd like to blow him in half, but doing that would make Clark look like a martyr. She confirmed Ruble drank the bottle of wine while he was driving back from West Virginia. And according to Howard, Smithberger looked up to Ruble, who dictated everything Smithberger did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Smithberger testified that on the evening of February 7, 1981, Ruble showed up at his apartment, yelling \"let's go kill a certain lieutenant.\" Ruble appeared to be under the influence and asked Smithberger to drive Ruble's blue Pinto station wagon close to Lt. Clark's home, where Ruble got out and told Smithberger to wait for him nearby. Smithberger waited for a while, but eventually returned home and parked Ruble's car close by.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} According to Smithberger, Ruble subsequently called him to get picked up. Ruble told Smithberger he would kill him if Smithberger told anybody where he had been that night. Ruble stuck a big hunting knife against Smithberger's chest and described how he would kill him if he told anybody. Smithberger testified that he had lied to the police and the grand jury over the many years since Lt. Clark's murder because his life depended on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Other testimony established that Ruble wore military boots on the day of the murder and that he had told another deputy sheriff that if you had to shoot a person, you would want to use No. 4 buckshot. In addition, Detective Lieutenant Jeff Seevers of the Washington County Sheriff's Office testified that he overheard a conversation in which Ruble told the sheriff that he used to drink wine, but that it made him do crazy things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The state also introduced Ruble's custodial statement, which proclaimed his innocence and lack of involvement in the murder. Ruble chose not to testify on his own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} After the jury returned a verdict finding Ruble guilty of aggravated murder, the trial court sentenced him to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Ruble assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT ADMITTED TESTIMONY THAT APPELLANT, WHILE A DEPUTY SHERIFF, PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY ABUSED GARY BEAGLE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   II. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR WHEN IT PRECLUDED APPELLANT FROM ADDUCING TESTIMONY THAT THE STATE'S KEY WITNESS COMMITTED TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS IN WHICH HE HAD IMPERSONATED A PEACE OFFICER.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   III. THE UNREASONABLE ACTS AND OMISSIONS OF TRIAL COUNSEL PREJUDICED APPELLANT AND DENIED HIM THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   IV.

LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A. OTHER ACTS EVIDENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In his first assignment of error Ruble asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony that as a deputy sheriff, Ruble physically and mentally abused Gary Beagle, who Ruble had arrested. At trial Ruble objected on the basis of Evid.R. 404(B) and 403(A) to the state introducing detailed evidence from former Washington County Deputy Sheriff John Dake who testified that: (1) he and Deputy Ruble arrested Beagle and handcuffed him in the back of their cruiser; (2) Ruble ordered Dake to stop the cruiser, entered the back seat, grabbed Beagle's hair and hit him in the head; (3) Ruble stated that he would continue hitting Beagle without leaving any bruises; (4) Ruble threatened to take Beagle down to the river and throw him in; (5) Ruble walked Beagle down to the river; and (6) when they returned to the vehicle Beagle confessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Ruble also objected to Beagle's testimony that during his arrest, Ruble pulled back his head and hit him twice while he was handcuffed, walked him down to the river, put a gun between his eyes, and threatened to shoot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Based on the state's argument that Lt. Clark's investigation of Ruble's unwarranted use of force led to Ruble's termination from the sheriff's department, thus providing the motive for the murder, the trial court admitted this evidence over Ruble's objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In general \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person to show action in conformity therewith.\" Evid.R. 404(B). \"It may, however, be admissible * * * [to prove] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But evidence of other crimes and acts of wrongdoing are strictly construed against admissibility.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the evidence of Ruble's treatment of Beagle was relevant to his motive to kill Lt. Clark, the detailed facts regarding Ruble's treatment of Beagle after arresting him did not shed any additional light on Ruble's motive to kill Lt. Clark. The state could have proved that by testimonial and documentary evidence simply indicating that Lt. Clark led an investigation into Ruble's excessive use of force, which led to Ruble's termination from the sheriff's department. Instead, the state introduced graphic evidence of Ruble's assaulting and threatening Beagle with the manifest intent to inflame the jury by showing that Ruble was a bad actor without significantly adding anything of value to establish the state's case. Thus under Evid.R. 403(A) the unfair prejudice of the other acts evidence substantially outweighed its probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The state cites a solitary case in support of the trial court's Evid.R. 403(A) determination-\n   <em>\n    State v.

Conversely, the other-acts evidence here, which provides marginally relevant evidence concerning the basis for the investigation that ultimately led to Ruble's firing, is much more attenuated.

Clark who fired him, describes his termination from the sheriff's department. This exhibit detailed many of the same underlying circumstances of the excessive use of force incident. Thus any prejudice from admission of the state's other acts evidence was minimized by the details in Ruble's own exhibit, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   On December 6, 1979 after affecting the arrest of Gary Beagle on a charge of Breaking and Entering, while returning to Marietta, you ordered another officer, John Dake, to pull off the road, at which time you proceeded to question the Beagle subject, and when he did not respond you proceeded to slap him about the head and face, and then pull his hair while the subject remained handcuffed in the back seat of the patrol car and made threats to throw him in the Ohio River while handcuffed. In this manner you coerced a statement from the Beagle subject in violation of his constitutional rights. Such conduct, done in the presence of John Dake, a probationary officer who was in your charge, compromised Dake's position as an officer and made him an unwilling, if inactive participant to the assault, especially when you advised Beagle that there would be no witnesses to your conduct. Twice before you had been reprimanded by the Sheriff concerning alleged incidents of discourteous treatment of the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Therefore, the jury had most of the same other acts evidence before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 34} It also had Smithberger's testimony implicating Ruble in the murder, and Howard's testimony establishing that Ruble, who had been drinking heavily on the day of the murder, had threatened to kill Lt. Clark. And it had Ruble's own statement\n   that No. 4 buckshot was the load to use to kill someone. The discovery of just such an empty shell at the murder scene implicated Ruble. A car matching the description of Ruble's vehicle was observed near the crime scene and a military type boot, which Ruble would likely have been wearing in conjunction with his Army Reserve duty, left a print underneath the window in Clark's kitchen. Thus we conclude any error in admitting the other acts evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the remaining evidence established his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we overrule Ruble's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B. Extrinsic Evidence of Smithberger's Prior Arrests to Impeach His Character for Truthfulness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In his second assignment of error Ruble contends that the trial court violated his constitutional rights to due process, confrontation, and compulsory process when it precluded him from calling witnesses who would have established that Smithberger, the key prosecution witness, had been arrested twice for impersonating a police officer. Ruble objected to the trial court's ruling prohibiting him from introducing extrinsic evidence of these purported arrests to attack Smithberger's character for truthfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The court based its exclusionary ruling on Evid.R. 608(B), which provides that \"[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness's character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime as provided in Evid.R. 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if clearly probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Ruble concedes that Evid.R. 608(B) explicitly prohibited the admission of the extrinsic evidence even if Smithberger had denied the arrests on cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But he argues that his constitutional rights to confrontation, due process, and compulsory process were violated because the denial of the extrinsic evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 608(B) precluded him from effectively cross-examining Smithberger, the key prosecution witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 38} But as Ruble concedes on appeal, he did not specifically object to the trial court's ruling based on the claimed constitutional violations he now raises, so he forfeited all but plain error in that regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the totality of the circumstances support a finding that he voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his rights. On the DVD of Ruble's statement, he nodded his head affirmatively to the officer's statement \"You understand your rights.\" Ruble was an adult with a lengthy career in law enforcement, including as a sergeant in a sheriff's department and a corrections officer when he made the statement. Although the placement of his hands in the back while handcuffed initially caused him some discomfort, the officers relieved this discomfort by allowing him to have his hands in front on a table. At two or three hours the interrogation was lengthy, but it was not overly so, and although keeping him in handcuffs is troublesome, it was not unconstitutionally oppressive. There is nothing in the lengthy statement that indicates that Ruble did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his rights and continue speaking to the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Because a motion to suppress on this ground would have been meritless, Ruble's trial counsel was not deficient for failing to file one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We reject Ruble's first ineffective-assistance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   2. Failure to File Motion to Redact Parts of Ruble's Recorded Custodial Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Ruble next claims that his trial counsel was deficient for failing to move to redact certain portions of his recorded custodial statement. First he contends that his trial counsel should have moved to redact those parts of his custodial statement where officers questioned him about his purported misconduct as an officer. More specifically, Ruble now objects to: (1) officers questioning him about his improper use of force at the Beverly Police Department; (2) officers informing him that his own personnel record from the sheriff's department contradicted him about his violent tendencies; (3) officers informing him that his personnel file contained several incidents where it is claimed that he roughed up individuals in handcuffs; and (4) officers questioning him about whether he had a substance abuse problem-alcohol or drugs-at the time of the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Ruble analogizes these matters to the impermissible other acts evidence he objected to in his first assignment of error, but claims they are even further removed and are not admissible on the issue of motive. We reject Ruble's contention because unlike the evidence concerning his excessive use of force against Beagle, the state did not introduce testimonial extrinsic evidence concerning his other purported misconduct while employed as a law enforcement officer, or the use of drugs. Although the state did introduce testimonial evidence concerning Ruble's admission to a police officer that alcohol made him violent and to his use of alcohol on the same day of the murder, he does not generally argue that this testimony was inadmissible, except for his next ineffective-assistance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Moreover, Ruble's own exhibit referring to his termination as a Washington County Deputy Sheriff indicated that \"[t]wice before [he] had been reprimanded by the Sheriff concerning alleged incidents of discourteous treatment of the public,\" so that these other incidents would have also been relevant to his discharge and thus his motive for killing Lt. Clark. And as noted in resolving his first assignment of error, Ruble's prior misconduct regarding the use of force against Beagle incident was before the jury through this same exhibit. Ruble denied any substance abuse during his custodial statement. Evidence of his alcohol abuse was also already properly introduced in the form of Howard's testimony and his own earlier statement to law enforcement officers that he drank wine on his way back to Marietta on the evening of the murder. Ruble has not established that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request the redaction of these limited references in his post-indictment custodial statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Moreover, assuming his trial counsel's performance was deficient for failing to move to redact all or some of these limited instances of interrogation, Ruble has not established any resulting prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. As noted, most of Ruble's prior misconduct as a law enforcement officer had already been admitted. And Ruble denied any alcohol or drug abuse during his custodial statement. Evidence of alcohol abuse to contradict his custodial statement was admissible in the form of Howard's testimony and his own earlier statement to law enforcement officers that he drank wine on his way back to Marietta on the evening of the murder. He denied any drug abuse, and the state introduced no evidence to the contrary. Ruble has not established that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request the redaction of these limited references in his post-indictment custodial statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Next Ruble contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request the redaction of those portions of his custodial statement in which the interrogating officers expressed their opinions that he was guilty or lying. The following are illustrative of these questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   BS: Okay Let's you and I agree that we're not going to go backwards with any more lies, because you're sitting here and misrepresented some things.

We cannot discern any prejudice to Ruble from these statements and questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Ruble has failed to establish that his trial counsel's failure to redact portions of his post-indictment interrogation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   3. Failure to Object to Part of Law Enforcement Officer's Testimony that Was Not Based on his Personal Knowledge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Next Ruble claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because he failed to object to the testimony of Detective Lieutenant Jeff Seevers of the Washington County Sheriff's Office's Cold Case Unit concerning a conversation then-Sheriff Robert Schlicher had with Ruble in January 2004. Lt. Seevers described a meeting between Sheriff Schlicher and Ruble where Ruble said he used to drink wine, but it made him do crazy things; the sheriff mentioned to Ruble that on the night of Lt. Clark's murder, Ruble admitted he had been drinking wine heavily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Lt. Seevers testified that during the conversation, he and another employee stood outside the door, which was hollow, so they could overhear the conversation between the sheriff and Ruble \"quite easily\" and that the sheriff's report of it was \"accurate\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Q.

Notwithstanding Ruble's emphasis on the qualifiers in some of the questions to which Lt. Seevers responded, i.e., \"fairly accurate\" and \"as far as you could hear,\" his testimony was sufficient to establish that he had personal knowledge about the conversation between Sheriff Schlicher and Ruble because he overheard it, albeit remotely, from outside a hollow door through which he could hear \"quite easily.\" And he reviewed the sheriff's dictated statement regarding the conversation to \"make sure it was accurate.\" Therefore, Ruble's counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this meritless objection. We reject Ruble's third ineffective-assistance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   4. Failure to Preserve Issues for Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 66} In Ruble's final ineffective-assistance claim, he contends that his counsel performed unreasonably by failing to preserve the issues raised in his second (trial court's preclusion of extrinsic evidence of Smithberger's two prior arrests for impersonating a police officer) and fourth (trial court's jury instruction on aiding and abetting) assignments of error. For the reasons discussed in our decision overruling these assignments of error, we also reject Ruble's final ineffective-assistance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Therefore, Ruble has failed to establish that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. We overrule his third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   D. Jury Instruction on Aiding and Abetting\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 68} In his fourth assignment of error Ruble argues that the trial court committed plain error when it instructed the jury on aiding and abetting. Although Ruble's trial counsel objected to the state's requested charge on aiding and abetting, he did not renew the objection after the jury had been instructed, but before it retired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Although the parties proceed on the basis of plain error, we assume that Ruble's objection to the instruction before the parties' closing argument sufficiently preserved this issue for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim.R. 30(A) ( \"On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   {\u00b6 70} A jury instruction must present a correct, pertinent statement of the law that is appropriate to the facts.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The evidence included testimony that the murder weapon was a pump action shotgun that Smithberger once possessed, that Smithberger previously lied about his involvement\n   in the crime, that Smithberger looked up to Ruble, and that Ruble repeatedly told the police he did not shoot Lt. Clark. Under these circumstances, the jury could have reasonably determined that even if Ruble was not the shooter, there was sufficient evidence that he at least aided and abetted Smithberger in the commission of the aggravated murder. That is, the jury could have credited Ruble's statements to officers that he did not personally shoot Lt. Clark, but could have reasonably inferred that he directed Smithberger to do so. This is consistent with the general rule that the weight and credibility of evidence are to be determined by the trier of fact because it is in the best position to gauge the witnesses' demeanor, gestures, and voice inflections, and to use these observations to weigh their credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
