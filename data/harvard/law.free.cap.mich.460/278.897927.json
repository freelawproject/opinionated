Because the clear language of the implied consent statute requires an arrest as a triggering event, we hold that its provisions do not apply to defendant. Rather, the validity of defendant\u2019s consent to chemical testing is evaluated under the standards of US Const, Am IV, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">On October 10, 1995, defendant was involved in a two-car collision. Michigan State Police Trooper William Tyrrell was sent to the scene to investigate. Tyrrell spoke to defendant for approximately five to ten minutes. The trooper testified that defendant had facial injuries and \u201cseemed really lightheaded, pale\u201d and \u201cnot really completely coherent.\u201d In response to the trooper\u2019s inquiries, defendant indicated that she had been drinking. Because Trooper Tyrrell was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>cerned about possible head injuries, he did not request that defendant submit to a Breathalyzer test at the scene. While Tyrrell continued his investigation of the accident scene, defendant and the two passengers in the other vehicle were transported to the hospital.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">After Tyrrell completed his investigation, he went to the hospital. The hospital staff allowed Tyrrell to speak to defendant. Tyrrell testified that defendant was lying down when he approached her and described her demeanor as \u201cvery polite and courteous.\u201d In response to his request for a blood sample, defendant replied \u201cSure. Fine. No problem.\u201d Tyrrell testified that he did not inform defendant of her chemical test rights under the implied consent statute because she was not under arrest at the time the blood sample was taken.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Pursuant to Trooper Tyrrell\u2019s request, an emergency room nurse withdrew defendant\u2019s blood and placed it in a Michigan State Police evidence collection kit provided by Tyrrell. The nurse testified that defendant smelled of alcohol and admitted that she had been drinking. The nurse also testified that defendant was cooperative and consented to the blood test. After being treated for her injuries, defendant was discharged from the emergency room and went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The blood sample was mailed to the Michigan State Police Laboratory. The blood sample, drawn approximately two and one-half hours after the accident, revealed a blood alcohol level of 0.14 percent. Defendant was arrested on October 19, 1995, and charged with two counts of OUIL causing serious impairment of a bodily function, MCL 257.625(5); MSA 9.2325(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">At the preliminary examination, defendant moved to suppress the blood alcohol test results. Defendant claimed suppression was required because she had not been \u201cadvised of her chemical rights as required by MCL 257.625a(6)(b) [MSA 9.2325(l)(6)(b)] Defendant also argued that the results should be suppressed because she was not under arrest at the time she consented, and a \u201cprior valid arrest is mandatory\u201d before a motorist may \u201clegally consent to blood alcohol testing . . . .\u201d Defendant did not argue that her consent was involuntary under the constitutional standard. The district court granted the motion to suppress under the statute. The circuit court denied the plaintiffs application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the suppression of the blood alcohol evidence. 230 Mich App 166; 583 NW2d 247 (1998). Citing <em>McNitt v Citco Drilling Co, </em>397 Mich 384; 245 NW2d 18 (1976), and <em>People v Weaver, </em>74 Mich App 53; 253 NW2d 359 (1977), the Court held that blood alcohol testing is presumptively performed pursuant to the implied consent statute in the absence of an express disclaimer by the police made to both the defendant and the medical personnel administering the test that the request for testing was not pursuant to the statute. Because no express disclaimer was given in this case, and because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>blood was not obtained in conformity with the statute, the Court held that suppression was required. We granted leave to appeal. 459 Mich 928 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">H. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The implied consent statute, MCL 257.625c; MSA 9.2325(3), provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">[a] person who operates a vehicle upon a public highway . . . within this state is considered to have given consent to chemical tests of his or her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both in his or her blood or urine or the amount of alcohol in his or her breath in all of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(a) If the person is arrested for a violation of section 625(1), (3), (4), (5), or (6), section 625a(5), or section 625m</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">(b) If the person is arrested for felonious driving, negligent homicide, manslaughter, or murder resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle, and the peace officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating the vehicle while impaired by or under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or while having an alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine, or if the person is less than 21 years of age while having any bodily alcohol content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">(3) The tests shall be administered as provided in section 625a(6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">When a chemical test is \u201cadministered as provided in section 625a(6),\u201d the person subject to chemical testing is advised of certain rights and benefits as found in MCL 257.625a(6); MSA 9.2325(1)(6), which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>vides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">(b) A person arrested for a crime described in section 625c(l) shall be advised of all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">(i) If he or she takes a chemical test of his or her blood, urine, or breath administered at the request of a peace officer, he or she has the right to demand that a person of his or her own choosing administer 1 of the chemical tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">(ii) The results of the test are admissible in a judicial proceeding as provided under this act and will be considered with other competent evidence in determining the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">(iii) He or she is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of a test, sample obtained pursuant to his or her own request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">(iv) If he or she refuses the request of a peace officer to take a test described in subparagraph (i), a test shall not be given without a court order, but the peace officer may seek to obtain such a court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">(v) Refusing a peace officer\u2019s request to take a test described in subparagraph (i) will result in the suspension of his or her operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license and vehicle \u2022 group designation or operating privilege and in the addition of 6 points to his or her driver record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The rules of statutory construction are well established. The fundamental task of statutory construction is to discover and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. The task of discerning our Legislature\u2019s intent begins by examining the language of the statute itself. <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). Where the language of the statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent and this Court applies the statute as written. Judicial construction under such circumstances is not permitted. <em>Id. </em>Only where the statutory language is ambiguous may a court properly go beyond the words of the statute to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>mine legislative intent. <em>Luttrell v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>421 Mich 93; 365 NW2d 74 (1984). When construing a statute, the court must presume that every word has some meaning and should avoid any construction that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory. <em>Altman v Meridian Twp, </em>439 Mich 623, 635; 487 NW2d 155 (1992). If possible, effect should be given to each provision. <em>Gebhardt v O\u2019Rourke, </em>444 Mich 535, 542; 510 NW2d 900 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Following these principles of statutory construction, we conclude that the plain language of MCL 257.625c; MSA 9.2325(3), and MCL 257.625a(6)(b); MSA 9.2325(l)(6)(b), evinces a legislative intent that only those persons who have been arrested fall within the purview of the implied consent statute. The statute plainly requires arrest as an actuating event before a police officer is obligated to inform a person of his or her rights under the statute. Because the implied consent statute does not control the admissibility of blood alcohol evidence when a defendant is not under arrest,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Trooper Tyrrell did not err in failing to advise defendant of her rights under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Notwithstanding the plain language of the statute to the contrary, and in furtherance of the claim that the implied consent statute is applicable even when a defendant is not under arrest, defendant cites <em>McNitt, supra, </em>for the proposition that <em>all </em>chemical testing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>done pursuant to the statute <em>unless </em>the police expressly disclaim reliance on the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">A. THE <em>McNITT </em>DICTA</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">THE \u201cLEGAL PRESUMPTION AND DISCLOSURE RULE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In <em>McNitt, </em>plaintiff, decedent\u2019s personal representative, brought a wrongful death action against the owner of the other vehicle involved in an accident. In defense, the defendant sought to admit evidence showing that the decedent was intoxicated. Decedent was unconscious at the time his blood was drawn, and no consent was or apparently could have been given. In the companion case, <em>Gilbert v Leach, </em>plaintiff similarly brought a wrongful death action against the defendant involved in that automobile accident. Plaintiff sought to admit evidence that the defendant was intoxicated. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court held that the defendant did not consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>chemical testing. In both cases, the trial court precluded admission of the blood alcohol evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">1. THE <em>McNITT </em>HOLDING</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The <em>McNitt </em>Court framed the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">The common issue in these appeals concerns the admissibility of the result of a blood alcohol test in civil litigation, specifically actions for wrongful death commenced by the administrator of the estate of the allegedly drunken driver in <em>McNitt </em>and against the allegedly drunken driver in <em>Gilbert.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">We hold the results of tests administered pursuant to the statute cannot be used in civil litigation. <em>[Id. </em>at 388.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">At the time <em>McNitt </em>was decided, MCL 257.625a(l); MSA 9.2325(1)(1), limited the admissibility of blood alcohol evidence to \u201cany criminal prosecution for driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the statute did not permit the admission of blood alcohol evidence in civil actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">2. THE <em>McNITT </em>DICTA</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The language of the statute prohibiting the admission of chemical test results in civil actions was and should have been dispositive of the issue as framed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>by the <em>McNitt </em>Court. However, for reasons that are unclear, the <em>McNitt </em>Court chose to address additional arguments in dicta. It is this dicta that has given rise to the erroneous construction of the statute on which the Court of Appeals relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The proponent of the evidence in <em>McNitt </em>asserted that \u201cstatutory authority is not needed to authorize the administration of blood alcohol tests or to make test results admissible in evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. The Court rejected this argument, holding that the proponent\u2019s argument ignored \u201cthe fact that but for the statute the tests probably would not have been administered by the hospital personnel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A footnote in <em>McNitt </em>discussed the grant of civil and criminal immunity afforded medical personnel pursuant to the implied consent statute. The statutory language at the time provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201c[A]t the request of a police officer, [a qualified person] can withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content therein under the provisions of this act. No liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of withdrawing blood and related procedures attaches to a qualified person who withdraws blood or assists in the withdrawal in accordance with this act unless the withdrawal is performed in a negligent manner.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 391, n 9.][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>After quoting the statutory language, the <em>McNitt </em>Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">The exculpation from liability is we think triggered by \u201cthe request of a police officer.\u201d Absent disclaimer by the officer that he is acting under the statute, hospital personnel are protected in relying on such a request as authorization to proceed to administer a test under the statute without independent investigation and determination whether statutory requirements have been observed. <em>[Id,.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In sum, it appears that, in dicta, <em>McNitt </em>created a legal presumption that the requirements' of the implied consent statute apply to <em>any </em>chemical testing. This <em>McNitt </em>dicta can also be read to require that an officer seeking a blood alcohol test expressly disclaim reliance on the statute in order to overcome the presumption. Neither of these conditions originate from the plain text of the statute as it existed then or now. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals relied on this dubious presumption. To the degree that this <em>McNitt </em>dicta created a legal presumption with corresponding disclaimer obligations, it is erroneous and of no persuasive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">B. THE EXTENSION OF THE <em>McNITT </em>\u201cPRESUMPTION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In <em>People v Weaver, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals extended the erroneous <em>McNitt </em>presumption to the suspected intoxicated driver who <em>did </em>consent to chemical testing. Defendant Weaver was not formally arrested at the time a blood sample was requested, but he had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the defendant was not under arrest, the police attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>to comply with the implied consent statute. Before signing a written consent to the procedure, defendant was given an incomplete statement of chemical test rights under the statute. He was found guilty of negligent homicide. On appeal, defendant claimed that the test was administered under the implied consent statute and was not admissible in a negligent homicide prosecution. Relying on the analysis in McNitt, the Court of Appeals panel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">As the Supreme Court in <em>McNitt </em>held that a blood alcohol test is obtained pursuant to the statutory authority absent express disclaimer to the hospital personnel asked to administer that test, so do we hold that consent to a blood alcohol test obtained from a conscious driver will be considered to have been obtained under color of the statutory authority absent express disclaimer to the driver of reliance on the statute and upon statutory penalties, and advice that the statutory limits on the use to which such test results may be put is inapplicable. <em>[Id. </em>at 63.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The <em>Weaver </em>Court stated that the presumption was justified because the \u201ccoercive effect\u201d of the implied consent statute required a defendant to choose \u201cbetween submitting to a test and facing revocation of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62. The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">The possibility of the statute exerting such a coercive effect, and thereby aiding in the obtaining of the test results, is great enough to require that a request for a blood alcohol test made pursuant to authority other than the statute must expressly disclaim reliance on the statute and the statutory penalties for refusal. <em>[Id. </em>at 63.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">As explained above, any judicially created legal presumption found in <em>McNitt </em>is contrary to the plain language of the statute. The extension of this dubious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>legal presumption to a suspected intoxicated driver who is not under arrest and who consents to chemical testing is also erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Only those who are arrested and fall within the scope of the statute are subject to the statutory penalties for refusing a request for testing. Motorists who have not been arrested are not subject to the statute. They are not faced with the same predicament as those who are arrested, and may refuse chemical testing without being subject to license revocation and other statutory penalties. As explained below, a motorist\u2019s knowledge of the right to refuse to consent to chemical testing when requested other than under the statute is but one factor to be considered in determining whether the consent was voluntary under the applicable constitutional standards. Accordingly, the judicially created presumption created in <em>Weaver </em>is expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">C. THE <em>GALLAGHER </em>LIMITATION ON POLICE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST CONSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">As an alternative basis of affirmance, defendant argues that suppression is required because she was not under arrest at the time she consented to chemical testing. Defendant argues that a \u201cprior valid arrest is mandatory\u201d before a motorist may \u201clegally consent to blood alcohol testing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In <em>Gallagher v Secretary of State (On Rehearing), </em>59 Mich App 269; 229 NW2d 410 (1975), the defendant was arrested, but refused to take a Breathalyzer test. The Secretary of State initiated the statutorily prescribed procedure to revoke Gallagher\u2019s driver\u2019s license for refusing to take a Breathalyzer test. Gallagher\u2019s arrest was later held invalid because the drunk driving was not committed in the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the arresting officer. The trial court issued a permanent injunction against the appellant, enjoining it from interfering with Gallagher\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In upholding the injunction, the Court of Appeals held that a valid arrest is an \u201cabsolute condition precedent\u201d to a police officer\u2019s right to \u201crequest a person to submit to chemical tests of his blood, breath or urine or other bodily substances . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. Because the arrest was invalid, the request to submit to the test was also invalid and the implied consent statute could not be utilized to revoke the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\"><em>Gallagher </em>correctly observed that \u201cthe sine qua non to energize the statutory mandate of the \u2018implied consent\u2019 law is a prior valid arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276. Just as a defendant is not entitled to the benefits of the statute in the absence of arrest, neither is the defendant subject to the statutory penalties for noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">However, the <em>Gallagher </em>Court, while acknowledging that the statute did not apply, erroneously limited a police officer\u2019s authority to request chemical testing when the motorist was not arrested and did not come within the scope of the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nothing in the statutory language limits or abrogates the authority of the police to request voluntary chemical testing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>police officer\u2019s request is merely that \u2014 a request\u2014 which can be granted or denied. Indeed, the police need not have a reasonable suspicion to request to search. <em>United States v White, </em>81 F3d 775 (CA 8, 1996). Because nothing in the relevant statutory provisions purports to limit the authority of the police to request voluntary chemical testing where the suspect is not under arrest, we expressly overrule the contrary holding in <em>Gallagher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">D. CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Having determined that defendant falls outside the purview of the implied consent statute, we hold that the admissibility of the blood alcohol evidence is governed by the conventional constitutional standards against unlawful searches and seizures found in the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11. The taking of blood to determine alcohol content constitutes a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Schmerber v California, </em>384 US 757, 767; 86 S Ct 1826; 16 L Ed 2d 908 (1966). A defendant has a federal constitutional right to refuse to consent to a search, the assertion of which right cannot be a crime or evidence of a crime. <em>People v Stephens, </em>133 Mich App 294; 349 NW2d 162 (1984); <em>Camara v Municipal Court of the City &amp; Co of San Francisco, </em>387 US 523, 532-533; 87 S Ct 1727; 18 L Ed 2d 930 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">US Const, Am IV, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 guarantee the right of the people to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Searches and seizures conducted without a warrant are unreasonable per se, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>subject to several specifically established and well-delineated exceptions. <em>Schneckloth v Bustamonte, </em>412 US 218; 93 S Ct 2041; 36 L Ed 2d 854 (1973); <em>People v Champion, </em>452 Mich 92; 549 NW2d 849 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">One established exception to the general warrant and probable cause requirements is a search conducted pursuant to consent. <em>Schneckloth, supra </em>at 219. Whether consent to search is freely and voluntarily given is a question of fact based on an assessment of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 227; <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342; 224 NW2d 867 (1975). The presence of coercion or duress normally militates against a finding of voluntariness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">While an intoxicated motorist may not know of the right to refuse chemical testing without penalty, knowledge of the right to refuse consent is not a prerequisite to effective consent. Rather, knowledge of the right to refuse is but one factor to consider in determining whether consent was voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Schneckloth, supra </em>at 227; <em>People v Lumpkin, </em>394 Mich 456, 458; 231 NW2d 637 (1975). However, we note that the people need not prove that the person giving consent knew of the right to withhold consent. <em>Schneckloth </em>at 248-249.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Because the defendant did not challenge the constitutional validity of her consent, the district court did not consider the issue. Rather, the district court suppressed the blood alcohol evidence under the statute. On remand, defendant is free to raise this issue for the district court\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">in. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Because the clear language of MCL 257.625c; MSA 9.2325(3) requires arrest, its provisions are not appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>cable to defendant. Therefore, the trial court erred in suppressing the chemical test evidence on statutory grounds. Rather, the validity of defendant\u2019s consent must be evaluated pursuant to search and seizure principles under US Const, Am IV, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-4\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Taylor, and Corrigan, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> The two passengers in the other vehicle suffered serious injuries.

Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of withdrawing or analyzing blood and related procedures does not attach to a licensed physician or individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician who withdraws- or analyzes blood or assists in the withdrawal or analysis in accordance with this act unless the withdrawal or analysis is performed in a negligent manner. [MCL 257.625a(6); MSA 9.2325(1)(6) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">This case involves statutory interpretation, which is a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>Oakland Co Bd of Rd Co Comm\u2019rs v Michigan Property &amp; Casualty Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>456 Mich 590, 610; 575 NW2d 751 (1998). The primary purpose of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">When promulgating new laws, the Legislature is presumed to be familiar with rules of statutory construction and existing laws on the same subject. <em>Malcolm v East Detroit, </em>437 Mich 132, 139; 468 NW2d 479 (1991); <em>People v Tracy, </em>186 Mich App 171, 177; 463 NW2d 457 (1990). Consequently, silence by the Legislature following judicial construction of a statute sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>gests consent to that construction. <em>Craig v Larson, </em>432 Mich 346, 353; 439 NW2d 899 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As noted by the majority, we previously recognized that \u201c[t]est results obtained pursuant to the exercise of statutory authority are not admissible unless obtained in conformity with the requirements of the [implied consent] statute.\u201d <em>McNitt v Citco Drilling Co, </em>397 Mich 384, 393; 245 NW2d 18 (1976). In <em>McNitt, </em>we concluded that police officers obtained test results \u201cunder color of statutory authority\u201d when (1) the tests were administered by medical personnel pursuant to the request of a police officer, and (2) the medical personnel were not informed the request was being made other than under the statute. <em>Id., </em>391-392, 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We refused to permit the use of test results obtained under color of statutory authority but in violation of the statute. Our rationale was that it would deprive drivers of their statutory choice of submitting to a blood alcohol test or losing their driver\u2019s license. Our ruling in <em>McNitt </em>preserved this statutory choice. <em>Id., </em>394.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In <em>People v Weaver,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>our Court of Appeals applied this analysis to a suspected intoxicated driver who had consented to chemical testing. As in the case before us, the police had failed to formally arrest or charge the defendant before obtaining his consent, and to comply with the implied consent statute. <em>Id., </em>56-58. Citing <em>McNitt, </em>the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">[CJonsent to a blood alcohol test obtained from a conscious driver will be considered to have been obtained under color of the statutory authority absent express disclaimer to the driver of reliance on the statute and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>statutory penalties, and advice that the statutory limits on the use to which such test results may be put is inapplicable. <em>[Id., </em>63.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that the defendant might have refused to consent to the test had he realized that (1) the officer\u2019s request was not pursuant to the statute, and that (2) his refusal would not have resulted in revocation of his license. <em>Id. </em>Because the statute may have exerted a coercive effect over the defendant that aided in the acquisition of his blood sample, the Court of Appeals concluded that a \u201ctest made pursuant to authority other than the statute must expressly disclaim reliance on the statute and the statutoiy penalties for refusal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that the officer failed to expressly disclaim such reliance, the Court concluded that the trial judge had erroneously admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol test results. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">At the time <em>McNitt </em>and <em>Weaver </em>were decided, the existing version of the implied consent statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">(1) A person who operates a vehicle upon the public highways of this state is deemed to have given consent to chemical tests of his blood, breath, urine or other bodily substances for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">(a) He is arrested for driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, or while his ability to operate a vehicle has been impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Like the present version of the implied consent statute, the former version provided for the arrest of the driver. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, Michigan courts consistently held that blood alcohol test results obtained under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>color of statutory authority were inadmissible unless obtained in conformity with this statute. <em>McNitt, supra </em>at 393-394;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>People v McKinney, </em>88 Mich App 715; 278 NW2d 728 (1979); <em>Weaver, supra </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">However, with this decision, the majority repudiates this case law, finding that it contradicts a legislative intent that only persons who have been arrested fall within the purview of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Although citing \u201cwell established\u201d rules of statutory construction, the majority ignores the fundamental rule that silence by the Legislature following judicial construction of a statute evidences consent to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>construction. <em>Craig, supra </em>at 353.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature has failed to object to this construction for over two decades. Through several amendments of the implied consent statute, it has left the language in question essentially unchanged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence, the rationale of <em>McNitt </em>and <em>Weaver </em>are equally applicable today.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision. Defendant\u2019s blood alcohol test results were obtained under color of statutory authority, but in violation of the implied consent statute and, therefore, should be inadmissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Section 625a(6)(c) also limits individuals permitted to draw blood for purposes of determining blood alcohol content to medical personnel, authorized pursuant to a police officer\u2019s request. <em>Id. </em>In <em>McNitt,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we recognized that hospitals would be unlikely to permit medical personnel to draw blood for purposes of determining alcohol content without a request under then MCL 257.625a(2); MSA 9.2325(1)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>390-391. To do so, absent such a request pursuant to the statute, would subject medical personnel to liability by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>denying them the resulting statutory protection from civil and criminal liability. <em>Id., </em>391, n 9. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">Absent disclaimer by the officer that he is acting under the statute, hospital personnel are protected in relying on such a request as authorization to proceed to administer a test under the statute without independent investigation and determination whether statutory requirements have been observed. [Id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In this case, the nurse who withdrew defendant\u2019s blood for purposes of determining his blood alcohol content was not informed (1) that the officer requested defendant\u2019s consent without statutory authority, or that (2) she could be acting without protection from civil or criminal liability. MCL 257.625a(6)(c); MSA 9.2325(l)(6)(c). The majority disregards the statutory limitation on medical personnel authorized to withdraw blood for purposes of determining blood alcohol content under \u00a7 625a(6)(c). It references no independent authority authorizing medical personnel to withdraw blood pursuant to the request of a police officer acting without statutory authority and in violation of the implied consent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The majority additionally fails to address whether (1) the remaining provisions regarding chemical testing under \u00a7 625a are applicable under these circumstances, or (2) medical personnel acting under these circumstances are subject to liability. The opinion appears to create at least as many questions as it answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Because the majority permits officers to obtain consent for blood alcohol testing under color of statutory authority and in violation of the implied consent statute, I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and conclude that defendant\u2019s blood alcohol test results were inadmissible.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-6\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> 74 Mich App 53; 253 NW2d 359 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> I agree with <em>McNitt </em>and continue to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">appreciate that drunk drivers are a menace and that strict enforcement of drunk driving laws is in the public interest. The Legislature has, however, limited authority of police officers to request hospital personnel to withdraw blood or otherwise test for blood alcohol content without consent and has limited the use that may be made of blood alcohol test results obtained pursuant to exercise of that authority. <em>[Id., </em>394.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> The majority also discusses <em>Gallagher v Secretary of State (On Rehearing), </em>59 Mich App 269; 229 NW2d 410 (1975). In <em>Gallagher, </em>the defendant was arrested for drunk driving that occurred outside the officer\u2019s presence. <em>Id., </em>272. Concluding that the arrest was invalid, the Court of Appeals held that the defendant\u2019s consent to take a chemical test was also invalid. It explained that \u201cthe sine qua non to energize the statutory mandate of the \u2018implied consent law\u2019 is a prior valid arrest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>276. However, unlike the immediate case, <em>Gallagher </em>involved an officer attempting to arrest the defendant before requesting his consent, rather than an officer acting under color of authority to obtain consent. In addition, <em>Gallagher </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">Since the arrest in this case was invalid so was the request to submit to the test or suffer the consequences of refusal. To this extent and to this extent alone do we uphold the injunction against further proceedings emanating from the alleged drunken driving by [the defendant]. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Although the majority purports to endorse the \u201csine qua non\u201d analysis from <em>Gallagher, </em>it finds itself obliged to overrule yet another case to reach its unfortunate holding. <em>Ante </em>at 292-293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-4\"> See <em>Wikman v City of Novi, </em>413 Mich 617, 638; 322 NW2d 103 (1982), <em>Wehmeier v W E Wood Co, </em>377 Mich 176, 191; 139 NW2d 733 (1966), <em>In re Clayton Estate, </em>343 Mich 101, 106-107; 72 NW2d 1 (1955), <em>Baks v Moroun, </em>227 Mich App 472, 489; 576 NW2d 413 (1998), <em>Glancy v Roseville, </em>216 Mich App 390, 394; 549 NW2d 78 (1996), aff\u2019d 457 Mich 580; 577 NW2d 897 (1998), and <em>Generou v Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hosp, </em>192 Mich App 295, 304; 480 NW2d 638 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> The Legislature explicitly responded to the <em>McNitt </em>holding regarding the admissibility of blood alcohol test results in other prosecutions. By its response, it implicitly endorsed the holding that test results obtained under color of statutory authority are inadmissible, unless obtained in conformity with the implied consent statute. As Justice Boyle explained in her dissent from <em>People v Keskimaki, </em>446 Mich 240, 260-261; 521 NW2d 241 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">In apparent response to <em>McNitt, </em>the Legislature added subsections 9 and 10. See 1982 PA 310. Subsection 9 specifically responds to the rationale in <em>McNitt </em>[that \u201ca blood test taken in a hospital from an unconscious driver \u2018who did not consent\u2019 was not admissible as evidence,\u201d <em>Keskimaki </em>at 259], and squarely rejects it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201c[T]he results of a chemical [test] analysis of that sample shall be admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime described in subsection (1) . . . regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a chemical test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">In addition, and even more persuasive evidence of the legislative intention to facilitate admissibility, the Legislature also explicitly responded to another rationale advanced in <em>McNitt. </em>In <em>McNitt, </em>the Court rejected the argument that the results were admissible under common law. It instead concluded that statutory authority was necessary to authorize the administration of blood tests because hospital authorities had probably taken the blood at the request of a police officer, rather than for diagnostic purposes. In subsection 9, the Legislature specifically addressed this distinction between law enforcement and diagnostic purposes by providing for admissibility of a sample withdrawn \u201cfor the purpose of medical treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The Legislature instituted the amendments discussed by Justice Boyle. However, significantly, it did not alter the determination that blood alcohol test results obtained under color of statutory authority and in violation of the implied consent statute are inadmissible.
