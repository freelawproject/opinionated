The Court of Appeals further concluded that failure to address what it found to be error under <em>Bigge </em>would result in manifest injustice. The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with the Court of Appeals that there was no constitutional error in the use of defendant\u2019s silence. We further hold that the reference to defendant\u2019s silence did not implicate the rule of <em>Bigge, </em>because the silence did not occur in the face of an accusation. Rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s failure to confront Logue is conduct evidence, admissible to impeach defendant\u2019s testimony that he was an innocent bystander on the evening in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">In the early morning hours of August 13, 1991, undercover State Police Detective Richard Gilbert purchased cocaine from Patrick Logue. Logue later testified that defendant, William P. Hackett, was his supplier. Defendant was nearby when the August 13 sale occurred. Defendant claims that he was framed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Defendant and Logue were high school friends who renewed their friendship in 1991. In July 1991, Logue house-sat for defendant. Items were apparently missing from the defendant\u2019s home afterwards, and, when confronted by defendant, Logue admitted taking certain items. Logue returned the items taken, except, contends defendant, a Godiva chocolate box that ultimately reappeared on August 13, 1991, containing the cocaine sold to Detective Gilbert.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Logue also met Detective Gilbert in 1991. Detective Gilbert was participating in an undercover investigation of Logue\u2019s employer, Erotic Image, a company that provided strippers for parties. Logue worked for Erotic Image as a stripper, an escort for female strippers, and as a sales representative. Logue took the job at Erotic Image to be near women and drugs. He smoked marijuana on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Logue testified that defendant supplied cocaine for each of the sales Logue transacted with Detective Gilbert, although the cocaine Logue first sold to Detective Gilbert was actually intended for Logue\u2019s boss. Following the first sale, Logue made several drug sales to Detective Gilbert, through and including the sale on August 13. For that sale, Logue had initially agreed to exchange four ounces of cocaine and $1,500 for five pounds of marijuana in a parking lot. Logue testified that defendant modified the deal at the last minute to be an exchange of five ounces of cocaine for five pounds of marijuana and that defendant suggested changing the location of the transaction to a hotel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Logue testified that late in the evening on August 12, he went to defendant\u2019s house, where defendant asked for his keys. The prosecutor theorized that defendant placed the cocaine in Logue\u2019s trunk at that time. Logue then went to Kevin Hall\u2019s home where he again met with defendant. Logue then drove to a Knight\u2019s Inn in Sterling Heights where he was to meet Detective Gilbert. Following close behind Logue was defendant, riding in a car driven by Mark Boyle. A police officer testified that the car in which defendant was riding mimicked the lane changes of Logue\u2019s car and that defendant appeared to be checking behind Boyle\u2019s car periodically. The officer testified that he followed Boyle\u2019s car at distances varying from thirty to one-hundred yards. When Logue pulled into the motel, Boyle picked up coffee at a nearby drive through and parked at a restaurant near the motel. Police testified that defendant waited outside the car, looked under the hood with Boyle, and appeared nervous. He walked toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>motel a couple times, before stopping and remaining at Boyle\u2019s car. Defendant testified that Boyle\u2019s car was having trouble and he was helping Boyle look under the hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">At the motel, Logue took a bag from the trunk and placed it in a garbage can. He met with Detective Gilbert, tested the marijuana, and then retrieved the cocaine. The cocaine was in a plastic cellophane bag, inside the Godiva chocolate box, and inside a brown bag. Logue\u2019s fingerprint was later discovered on the brown bag and defendant\u2019s fingerprint on the foil interior of the Godiva box. Logue, Boyle, and defendant were arrested. A search of Boyle\u2019s car produced a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Logue, defendant, and Boyle were arraigned on August 14, 1991. The three posted bond on August 15, 1991, and were released. At the preliminary examination in October 1991, defendant claimed that the case against him should be dismissed because of the lack of a basis for his arrest. On May 29, 1992, the district judge agreed, dismissing all charges against defendant and Boyle. Logue, however, was bound over on one count of delivering 50 to 225 grams of cocaine. The circuit court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of charges against defendant, and the Court of Appeals denied the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In May 1993, Logue pleaded guilty to the August 13, 1991, drug sale, in exchange for dismissal of other cases. In September 1993, he pleaded guilty to a July 1991 drug sale to Detective Gilbert. After pleading guilty and before his sentencing, Logue agreed to testify against defendant. Consequently, another complaint was filed against defendant and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>warrant issued for his arrest. Defendant, with his attorney, surrendered to the police on November 8, 1993. On August 12, 1994, defendant was bound over on two counts of delivery. The defendant was ultimately tried on one count of delivering 50 to 225 grams of cocaine and one count of delivering less than 50 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The April 1995 trial of defendant lasted five days. During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\"><em>Q. </em>So, sir, there came a point in time when you must have found out you were you being implicated in this, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\"><em>A. </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">Q. And I\u2019ll bet you were just stark raving mad to find out you, the innocent man, had nothing to do with this, was being implicated in this; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\"><em>A. </em>I was quite concerned and upset, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\"><em>Q. </em>Well, I would hope so. You\u2019re an innocent man, been accused of a very serious offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\"><em>A. </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\"><em>Q. </em>And the first opportunity you got to tell Patrick to set the record straight, you did that, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-14\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\"><em>Q. </em>The first chance that you got to tell Mr. Logue to clear up any notion of your involvement in this case you did that, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-16\"><em>A. </em>I haven\u2019t had any contact with Patrick Logue since we were locked up after the arraignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-17\"><em>Q. </em>And, Sir, the first words out of your mouth to Mr. Logue were, tell them I didn\u2019t have anything to do with this; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-18\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t recall ever saying that to Mr. Logue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-19\"><em>Q. </em>That\u2019s because you never said it; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-20\"><em>A. </em>That\u2019s probably true. I don\u2019t even recall anything like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Defense counsel did not object to this testimony. Nor did defense counsel object when, during closing arguments, the prosecutor harkened back to this testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">[There] wouldn\u2019t be bars strong enough to keep persons falsely accused from trying to just get at the person that made that accusation. Tell him, tell the police, you tell those police I had nothing to do with this, and you know why it didn\u2019t happen? You know why it didn\u2019t happen? Because at the time they were arrested it could not, have been foreseen Mr. Logue would be giving testimony against Mr. Hackett. And another reason it didn\u2019t happen is because it is not true. Mr. Logue is not falsely accusing Mr. Hackett. He\u2019s truthfully accusing Mr. Hackett. Mr Hackett is involved. Mr. Hackett involved [sic] the cocaine and Mr. Hackett is guilty, and that\u2019s why Mr. Hackett did not act like a person falsely accused because he was not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The jury acquitted defendant of the lesser charge related to a July sale of cocaine by Logue to Detective Gilbert, but convicted defendant of delivering between 50 and 225 grams of cocaine in the early morning hours of August 13, 1991. Defendant was sentenced below the presumptive mandatory ten- to twenty-year sentence for a term of four to twelve years. Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was ultimately denied. On defendant\u2019s appeal of right, the Court of Appeals reversed. We granted the prosecutor leave to appeal and denied defendant\u2019s cross-application. 459 Mich 895 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">We address whether the prosecutor\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s silence was error. As a preliminary matter, the parties have never agreed on when the silence refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>enced by the prosecutor occurred. Indeed, up to and through oral argument before this Court, this question remained hotly contested. The timing of the referenced silence is critical to determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s silence constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The prosecutor first referred to defendant\u2019s silence during cross-examination of defendant. As the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination progressed, it focused specifically on the period after the 1991 arrest and after defendant\u2019s 1991 arraignment, when Logue and defendant were incarcerated together. This is clear from the following excerpt of the cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\"><em>Q. </em>And <em>the first opportunity </em>you got to tell Patrick to set the record straight, you did that didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\"><em>Q. The first chance that you got </em>to tell Mr. Logue to clear up any notion of your involvement in this case you did that, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\"><em>A. </em>I haven\u2019t had any contact with Patrick Logue <em>since we were locked up after the arraignment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\"><em>Q. </em>And, Sir, the first words out of your mouth to Mr. Logue were, tell them I didn\u2019t have <em>anything to do with this; isn\u2019t that </em>right? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">While the prosecutor may not have initiated this line of questioning in reference to the time defendant and Logue were incarcerated together, he continued to pursue that moment in time after the defendant stated that he had not seen Logue since then. Indeed, appellate defense counsel acknowledged twice during oral argument that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of defendant referenced the time in 1991 when Logue and defendant were incarcerated together.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s second reference to defendant\u2019s silence appears similarly directed to the time during defendant\u2019s incarceration with Logue. The prosecutor argued in closing that there</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">wouldn\u2019t be bars strong enough to keep persons falsely accused from trying to just get at the person that made that accusation. Tell him, tell the police, you tell those police I had nothing to do with this .... You know why it didn\u2019t happen? Because at the time they were arrested it could not have been foreseen Mr. Logue would be giving testimony against Mr. Hackett.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We acknowledge that the timing of the referenced silence in the prosecutor\u2019s closing is somewhat ambiguous. The statement seems to presume that defendant knew that Logue was his accuser in 1991 when they were arrested together, although it is clear from the record that defendant could not have foreseen that Logue would testify against him at that time. Despite this initial ambiguity, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s closing, like the cross-examination, ultimately focuses on the time \u201cwhen they were arrested.\u201d The only time that defendant could have confronted Logue was when he and Logue were arrested and incarcerated together in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Defendant continues to argue that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his silence implicates constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His constitutional claims assume that the silence at issue occurred in 1993, rather than 1991. First, defendant argues that speaking to Logue would have violated a condition of his bond and, therefore, that use of his silence violated due process. However, in 1991, defendant\u2019s bond did not include the condition that he not contact Logue. Second, defendant argues that Logue was an agent of the police, and, therefore, that comment on his silence in Logue\u2019s presence violated both due process and his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. While it may be arguable that Logue was an agent of the police in 1993, there is no indication that Logue was an agent of the police in 1991 when he was incarcerated with defendant. Because the predicates of defendant\u2019s constitutional claims were not fulfilled during the relevant period, we need not address these claims here.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">After concluding correctly that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s silence, the Court of Appeals held that the prosecutor violated the rule of <em>People v Bigge, supra. Bigge </em>concerns adoptive or tacit admissions and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">precludes admissibility of a defendant\u2019s failure to say anything in the face of an accusation as an adoptive or tacit admission under MRE 801(d)(2)(B) unless the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cmanifested his adoption or belief in its truth <em>. \u201d [People v </em>McReavy, 436 Mich 197, 213; 462 NW2d 1 (1990).][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Applying the rule of <em>Bigge, </em>the Court of Appeals reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">In this case, the evidence at trial did not indicate that defendant either adopted or believed the accusation. Therefore, the evidence should not have been admitted, and the prosecution should not have been permitted to base its argument on that evidence. [Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued February 24, 1998 (Docket No. 195698).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We disagree with the Court of Appeals application of the <em>Bigge </em>rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">We take this opportunity to clarify the role of <em>People v Bigge </em>in ascertaining the admissibility of evidence regarding a defendant\u2019s silence. Although <em>Bigge </em>preceded the enactment of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, the rule of <em>Bigge, </em>like MRE 801(d)(2)(B), concerns tacit admissions. \u201cThe <em>Bigge </em>rule denies admissibility [of tacit admissions] because the inference of relevancy rests solely on the defendant\u2019s failure to deny.\u201d <em>McReavy </em>at 213. <em>Bigge </em>precludes the admission of a defendant\u2019s silence in the face of accusation as substantive evidence of his guilt. This Court has clarified that a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence is admissible for impeachment purposes. <em>People v Cetlinski (After </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Remand), </em>435 Mich 742, 757; 460 NW2d 534 (1990). <em>Cetlinski </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cSilence, when the assertion of another person would naturally call for a dissent if it were untrue, may be equivalent to an assent to the assertion. This, however, fixes the party, by adoption, with the other person\u2019s assertion, and thus it ceases to be a question of conduct evidence, and involves a genuine admission in express words. [2 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadboum rev), \u00a7 292, pp 229-230.]\u201d [Id]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>[NJonverbal conduct by a defendant, a failure to come forward, is relevant and probative for impeachment purposes when the court determines that it would have been \u201cnatural\u201d for the person to have come forward with the exculpatory information under the circumstances. <em>[Id. </em>at 760.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The issue of prearrest silence is one of relevance. <em>Id. </em>at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\"><em>Bigge </em>involved a prosecution for embezzlement. The silence referenced by the prosecutor in <em>Bigge </em>occurred when the defendant in <em>Bigge </em>failed to respond during a business conference to his brother-in-law\u2019s comment, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of going over this matter again. Charles [defendant Bigge] is guilty as heh.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\"><em>Bigge </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">The time has not yet come when an accused must cock his ear to hear every damaging allegation against him and, if not denied by him, have the statement and his silence accepted as evidence of guilt. There can be no such thing as confession of guilt by silence in or out of court. The unanswered allegation by another of the guilt of a defendant is no confession of guilt on the part of a defendant. <em>[Id. </em>at 420.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The Court in <em>Bigge </em>concluded that the admission of the brother-in-law\u2019s statement and the defendant\u2019s silence in response to it as evidence of defendant Bigge\u2019s guilt was error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bigge\u2019s application is limited to tacit admissions, in the form of a defendant\u2019s failure to deny an accusation. Tacit admissions under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Bigge </em>rale may not be used as substantive evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt. A criminal defendant\u2019s failure to respond to an accusation is not probative evidence of the truth of the accusation. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We conclude that <em>Bigge </em>is inapplicable to the resolution of this case. The silence referenced by the prosecutor did not occur in the face of an accusation. There is simply no statement that defendant\u2019s silence can be construed as tacitly adopting. Thus, the rule of <em>Bigge </em>is not violated by the admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Further, we agree with the prosecutor\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s failure to confront Logue while they were incarcerated together in 1991 is conduct evidence that impeaches defendant\u2019s testimony that he was merely following Logue to a party and was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>innocent bystander to the drug transaction. It would have been natural for defendant, under such circumstances, to confront Logue regarding the reason for his arrest when they were incarcerated together in 1991. Therefore, we hold that the evidence was relevant and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Finally, while there is some merit to defendant\u2019s suggestion that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument strayed from use of defendant\u2019s silence as impeachment to substantive evidence of his guilt,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the silence referenced, as discussed above, was neither constitutionally protected nor in violation of the rule of <em>Bigge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">If any error arose from the prosecutor\u2019s closing reference, we would find it harmless under any standard. The prosecutor convincingly demonstrated ample direct evidence to convince the jury of defendant\u2019s guilt. The direct evidence includes: Logue\u2019s testimony, defendant\u2019s fingerprint on the interior of the Godiva chocolate box, his incriminating conduct as observed by surveillance police, and his proximity to the drug transaction on August 13, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The silence referenced was also of limited probative value, as demonstrated by the defense\u2019s strategic decision during re-direct examination and closing, to demonstrate that it would not have been normal and natural for defendant to confront Logue. On re-direct examination of defendant, the defense attorney queried, \u201cAfter you ended up getting arrested on the evening of August 12, 13, 1991, did you want to say anything or hear anything at all from Patrick Logue period?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cNot particularly. I was, you know, looking at, I\u2019m starting law school in a week and this guy has practically destroyed my life.\u201d During closing argument, the defense again sought to explain defendant\u2019s failure to confront Logue, again in a parallel format to that offered by the prosecution. The defense argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">[The prosecutor] said gee, if [defendant] was falsely accused there wouldn\u2019t be bars strong enough at getting at Pat Logue, saying tell them I didn\u2019t do it. Well, he is missing the point completely in that respect. Frankly, you put yourself in [defendant\u2019s] shoes; you\u2019re on your way to a party; you\u2019re about to start law school, worked hard presently, been planning, got everything in order, and all of [a] sudden you find yourself arrested because it turns out Pat Logue was involved in a drug deal. What is to talk to him about? He\u2019s the last thing in the world you want anything to do with, period. Not only that, if you\u2019re a person with respect for law and order, you end up in this horrible situation, you having to defend yourself, you don\u2019t go and do something\u2014 you don\u2019t go and have contact with him individually, you have respect for the process of law; you have respect for trust for the judgment of juries. This is all frightening, and I\u2019m scared, and it\u2019s very weird, but I\u2019m going to trust and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>I\u2019m going to respect the process of law. [Defendant\u2019s] response was exactly the response you want from somebody who had lived their life right and has respect for the law ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Because the prosecution presented ample direct evidence against the defendant, the references to defendant\u2019s silence were minimal, and because the defense used the same silence in a rehabilitative way, we conclude that any error was harmless under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We denied by order entered November 3, 1998, defendant\u2019s cross-application for leave to appeal, and, therefore, our review has been limited to the admission of testimony regarding defendant\u2019s silence. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-8\">Taylor, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Weaver, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> Defense counsel did not object to the admission of testimony regarding defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(iii); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i\u00fc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> <em>As </em>noted above, the Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s constitutional claims, and this Court denied leave on his cross-application.

After 1991, MRE 801(d)(2)(B) is no longer subject to the rule announced in <em>People v Bobo, </em>390 Mich 355; 212 NW2d 190 (1973). <em>Bobo </em>had applied <em>Bigge </em>broadly, stating that \u201cIf silence in the face of specific accusation may not be used, it would be a strange doctrine indeed that would permit silence absent such an accusation to be used as evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Bobo </em>at 361. <em>Bobo </em>had held that a criminal defendant\u2019s silence could never be used against him, whether in the face of accusation or not. <em>People v Collier, </em>426 Mich 23, 39; 393 NW2d 346 (1986), limited <em>Bobo, </em>holding that <em>Bobo </em>remained viable only to the extent that it precluded \u201cimpeachment for and comment on silence at the time of arrest in the face of accusation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> The prosecutor argued in closing that \u201cMr. Hackett involved [sic] the cocaine and Mr. Hackett is guilty, and that\u2019s why Mr. Hackett did not act like a person falsely accused because he was not.\u201d One reading of this statement, even within the context of the entire closing argument, see below, is that it suggested, intentionally or not, that defendant was involved in the drug deal because he did not confront Logue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b304-9\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Any\">(dissenting). I would hold that the trial court\u2019s admission of testimony regarding defendant\u2019s silence was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">I disagree with the majority for three reasons. First, I would find that the prosecution improperly made reference to defendant\u2019s silence during lock up in violation of defendant\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to silence under the federal constitution. US Const, Ams V, XIV. Moreover, I also agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the Court of Appeals that, under the facts of this case, the prosecutor\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s silence violated the rule of <em>People v Bigge, </em>288 Mich 417; 285 NW 5 (1939). Finally, the trial court should have excluded this evidence under Michigan Rule of Evidence 403, as this evidence was highly prejudicial and utterly lacking in probative value. Because the trial court\u2019s error was not harmless, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">As the majority correctly notes, the parties have never agreed on when the silence referenced by the prosecutor was to have occurred. The majority implicitly admits that a reference to defendant\u2019s silence during the 1993 period of incarceration would have violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent. However, even if the prosecution\u2019s argument can fairly be said to refer to defendant\u2019s 1991 incarceration, the prosecutor\u2019s comment on his silence still violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Logue was not a state agent during the 1991 period of incarceration. Because of that, the majority maintains that the prosecution was free to use defendant\u2019s silence while in the presence of Logue as impeachment evidence against him. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>610; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976); <em>Fletcher v Weir, </em>455 US 603; 102 S Ct 1309; 71 L Ed 2d 490 (1982); <em>Wainwright v Greenfield, </em>474 US 284; 106 S Ct 634; 88 L Ed 2d 623 (1986). In <em>Doyle, </em>for example, the United States Supreme Court laid down the following rule: a prosecutor may not impeach a defendant\u2019s inculpatory stoiy, told first at trial, by cross-examining the defendant about his failure to have told the story after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Use of a defendant\u2019s silence in this manner violates due process because \u201cevery post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.\u201d <em>Doyle, supra </em>at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The facts of the instant case are similar to those in <em>Doyle </em>and its companion case, <em>Ohio v Wood. </em>The defendants in both <em>Doyle </em>and in this case were in custody, but were not being interrogated at the time the prosecutor argues that they should have professed their innocence. In <em>Doyle </em>the questioning was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>[By the prosecutor.] . . . You are innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>[By Doyle.] I am innocent. Yes Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>That\u2019s why you told the police department and Kenneth Beamer when they arrived . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201c(Continuing.) . . . about your innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>... I didn\u2019t tell them about my innocence.

That\u2019s what I didn\u2019t know. I knew that I was trying to buy, which was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know what was going on. I didn\u2019t know that Bill Bonnell was trying to frame me, or what-have-you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>All right, \u2014 But you didn\u2019t protest your innocence at that time?\u201d <em>[Doyle, supra, </em>426 US 614, n 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\"><em>Doyle </em>was consolidated with <em>Ohio v Wood </em>where the defendant was also impeached, not for his failure to answer questions implicating <em>Miranda, </em>but for his failure to profess his innocence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>[By the prosecutor.] Mr. Beamer did arrive on the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">\u201cA. [By Wood.] Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And I assume you told him all about what happened to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Mr. Wood, if that is all you had to do with this and you are innocent, when Mr. Beamer arrived on the scene why didn\u2019t you tell him?\u201d <em>[Doyle, supra, </em>426 US 613-614.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Similarly, defendant in the instant case was cross-examined and impeached for his failure to confront his accuser, and for his failure to profess his innocence to his accuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Court\u2019s broad pronouncement in <em>Doyle </em>was somewhat limited by <em>Fletcher v Weir, supra. </em>However, under <em>Fletcher, post-Miranda </em>silence continued to be inadmissable to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility. <em>Id., </em>455 US 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Further support for this proposition is found in <em>Wainwright v Greenfield, supra. </em>In that case, the defendant argued a defense of insanity. His postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>warnings silence was then used by the prosecutor as evidence of sanity. The Supreme Court held that this violated due process. The source of the violation was the implicit assurance contained in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201cthat silence will carry no penalty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>474 US 290 (citation omitted). The Court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">The point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony. <em>[Id., </em>474 US 292.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">In this case, it would be as fundamentally unfair to punish defendant for electing to remain silent under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">In each of these, the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d was in the physical presence of police officers or other recognizable state agents. The majority maintains that that condition is a prerequisite to finding a constitutional violation. I disagree. The United States Supreme Court has articulated no such explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>requirement. Moreover, such a requirement ignores the simple realities of today\u2019s custodial environment. The lack of a visible state agent does not preclude a finding of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">A recent federal case illustrates this point. In <em>Franklin v </em>Duncan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the accused was charged with murder. The charge was based primarily on his daughter\u2019s alleged repressed memory of the killing. At trial, the prosecution presented testimony from the daughter that she had visited her father in jail after his arrest and had attempted to convince him to confess. She testified that he had not responded to her accusations, but instead pointed to a sign in the jail visiting room that indicated all conversations might be monitored. The trial court denied a defense objection to the testimony, and the prosecutor argued that this silence amounted to a tacit confession of guilt \u201cworth its weight in gold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1445.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On habeas corpus review, the district court found the admission of the accused\u2019s silence to have violated the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights, citing <em>Doyle, supra, </em>and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Petitioner chose to remain silent, knowing that he was in custody and that the government was listening to his calls. In declining to answer his daughter\u2019s question, Franklin explicitly pointed to the sign saying that the government monitored conversations. His pointing to the sign indicates that the desire not to talk to the government was his motivating factor in remaining silent. If this is not an invocation of the right to remain silent, it is difficult for the Court to imagine what would be. Surely petitioner need not state, \u201cI am not answering your question, Eileen, because I am invoking my fifth amendment right against self-incrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ination\u201d in order not to have his silence used against him. <em>[Id. </em>at 1447.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">This result was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>Franklin v Duncan, </em>70 F3d 75, 78 (CA 9, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Similarly, in the instant case, it is quite logical to assume that defendant\u2019s postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was due to a desire not to talk to the government.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not unknown for police agencies to place informants in jail cells in the hope that an accused may make incriminating statements. Moreover, it is not unheard of for police agencies to place secret electronic listening devices or other monitoring equipment in cells, in part to detect violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In today\u2019s custodial environment, it is logical that a defendant, advised of his right to remain silent and the consequences of speaking, will remain silent, even when no officers are visible. Using this silence against a defendant is just as \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d as it was in <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Wainwright, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Thus, I would hold that the prosecution\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s silence during lock up were in violation of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to silence under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The majority also analyzes this case under the rule of <em>People v Bigge, </em>and holds that <em>Bigge </em>is not implicated in the instant case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I disagree. In <em>Bigge, </em>we held that a defendant\u2019s silence in the face of an accusation cannot be used against him as evidence of guilt. \u201cThere can be no such thing as confession of guilt by silence in or out of court. . . . Defendant, if he heard the statement, was not morally or legally called upon to make denial or suffer his failure to do so to stand as evidence of his guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420. The Court in <em>Bigge </em>found that this was a due process violation. The majority rejects the application of this case, stating that, since there was no face-to-face accusation at the time of the silence, there is no reason to rely on <em>Bigge. </em>I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">According to the opinion, defendant did not know Logue would be his accuser during their 1991 incarceration. This is arguably correct. However, the pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ecutor improperly told the jury twice that defendant was silent in the face of an accusation <em>(ante, </em>pp 210-211). I would hold this to be error requiring reversal under <em>Bigge, supra. </em>As the majority has indicated, not even the parties can agree which \u201csilence\u201d was referenced by the prosecution. It is certain that the jury was not aware of the two separate interests of Mr. Logue, nor was it aware of the complicated procedural history of this case. It had to rely on the prosecution for much of the factual development.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Whether Logue was actually an accuser in this case should not be determinative. The prosecutor told the jury that Logue was an accuser and argued that defendant would have confronted him had defendant been an innocent man. It was error requiring reversal under these facts to argue, on cross-examination and in closing, that defendant\u2019s failure to confront his accuser during a postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>situation evidences his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Even were I to find that defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the prosecution\u2019s questioning, I would still affirm the Court of Appeals ruling. Under MRE 403, evidence is properly excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. It is also excluded if it would result in confusion of the issues or a misleading of the jury. The evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d was highly prejudicial and not probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Referring to the notion in <em>Doyle, supra </em>at 617, that \u201cevery post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous,\u201d I would hold that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks should have been stricken as too ambiguous to be useful. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>unclear from the statements themselves which \u201csilence\u201d was actually being referenced \u2022 by the prosecutor. That fact became apparent during oral argument and is further shown by the space devoted to the issue in the majority opinion. Moreover, there are reasons having nothing to do with guilt that would explain why a defendant might not confront his accuser directly outside a courtroom. A defendant might be afraid of the accuser. A defendant might be prevented by the court from contacting the accuser, or think that he would get into more trouble by confronting him. A defendant might not trust his control over his own emotions should he confront his accuser. Lastly, and most probably, a defendant might correctly reason that a confrontation would be of no benefit to him. It seems highly unlikely that Logue would have recanted his story had defendant confronted him and accused him of lying. Nothing in defendant\u2019s silence would tend to prove defendant\u2019s guilt or credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">On the other hand, given the nature of the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments, this evidence was highly prejudicial to defendant. The prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s failure to confront Logue was substantive evidence of his guilt because an innocent person would have let nothing stand in his way. There would have been \u201cno bars strong enough\u201d to have stopped him from rushing out to demand that Logue recant. The argument could well have tipped the scale in the prosecution\u2019s favor, given that this was a close case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Public policy also supports a finding that the prosecutor acted improperly here. A finding in the prosecutor\u2019s favor signals other defendants that they must confront their accusers or risk having the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tactic used against them. This Court should not condone such a confrontational necessity. The risk of spontaneous violence is too great to justify so small a return.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">I would not find the error harmless. Because I conclude that the reference to defendant\u2019s silence during his post-arraignment lock up in 1999 violates the federal constitution, the proper standard of review is governed by federal law. <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967); <em>People v Anderson (After Remand), </em>446 Mich 392, 404; 521 NW2d 538 (1994). The standard to be applied for unpreserved and preserved nonstructural<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> constitutional error is the same: A reviewing court should affirm a defendant\u2019s conviction if it is satisfied that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>People v Graves, </em>458 Mich 476, 482; 581 NW2d 229 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Application of this standard to \u201ctrial type\u201d constitutional errors was recently reaffirmed in <em>Brecht v Abrahamson, </em>507 US 619, 630; 113 S Ct 1710; 123 L Ed 2d 353 (1993). <em>Brecht </em>contrasted the standard of harmless error review to be applied between requests for habeas corpus relief and direct appeals. It noted that there are \u201c \u2018some constitutional errors which in the setting of a particular case are so unimportant and insignificant that they may, consistent with the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>630, citing <em>Chapman, supra </em>at 22. The state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Brecht, supra </em>at 630. In the particular setting of this case, the prosecution has failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s holding, the evidence against defendant was anything but overwhelming. The case against him depended to a great degree on the credibility of both defendant and Logue, as evidenced by the earlier dismissal of charges against defendant. Logue had every reason to falsely accuse defendant, given the benefits he hoped to obtain concerning his own criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Moreover, the other evidence was circumstantial to a great degree. Defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found not on the cocaine baggie itself, but on a foil box that defendant claimed Logue stole while a guest in defendant\u2019s home. The police testimony concerning defendant\u2019s activities on the night in question was consistent with defendant\u2019s testimony. He maintained that Logue had invited defendant and Mr. Boyle to a party, but had told them he must first conduct unrelated business at a motel. Defendant\u2019s behavior, as observed by the police officer, was not inconsistent with innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In short, nothing presented by the prosecution indicates that this constitutional error was \u201charmless\u201d or \u201cinsignificant\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-7\">Brickley and Cavanagh, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"> 884 F Supp 1435 (ND Cal, 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\"> At arraignment, the trial court is required, under the Michigan Rules of Criminal Procedure, MCR 6.104(E)(2), to inform a defendant, not represented by counsel, of his right to remain silent.

Moreover, I would also find that <em>Cetlinski </em>and its predecessor, <em>People v Collier, </em>426 Mich 23; 393 NW2d 346 (1986), upon which <em>Cetlinski </em>relies, are distinguishable from this case. <em>Cetlinski </em>involved a defendant who had made statements to the police and left out certain details. For example, the defendant omitted the fact that he had previously had a conversation with a waitress discussing burning down a building. Also, the prosecutor in <em>Cetlinski </em>did not ask the jury to infer guilt from the defendant\u2019s silence. 435 Mich 763. <em>Collier </em>also involves a defendant who \u201cleft out\u201d certain pertinent facts when giving his statement to police. <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Collier </em>and <em>Cetlinski. </em>In those cases, the defendants made statements to the police about certain events, but omitted facts that would naturally have been included by a person with nothing to hide.
