We hold that the policy language at issue here is unambiguous and enforceable. In doing so, we repudiate the two-justice plurality opinion in <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602; 398 NW2d 411 (1986), upon which the Court of Appeals relied. Under the clear language of the no-fault policy involved in this case, the policy does not cover vehicles furnished for regular use of either the named insured or any relative, unless the vehicle qualifies as a \u201ctemporary substitute vehicle.\u201d We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court to consider whether the nonowned automobile clause applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">This case arises from an automobile accident resulting in two fatalities. A pickup truck driven by defendant Steven Jacob Nikkei and owned by defendant Blue Water Contracting, Inc., rear-ended a car occupied by Frances Cagle and Sherry Fitzgerald. The impact of the collision forced the Cagle car into oncoming traffic, resulting in a head-on collision. Cagle and Fitzgerald died from their injuries. The personal representatives of their estates later brought wrongful death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>At the time of the accident, sixteen-year-old Steven Jacob Nikkei, a newly licensed driver, resided with his parents. His father, defendant Steven John Nikkei, the president and sole shareholder of Blue Water Contracting, allowed Steven Jacob to use the Blue Water pickup truck. Plaintiff insured the pickup truck under a commercial no-fault policy issued to Blue Water, and tendered the full $500,000 limit on that policy in covering the accident. Plaintiff, however, also insured two automobiles owned by Steven Jacob\u2019s parents under a family automobile insurance policy. That policy is the subject of this declaratory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The family automobile insurance policy covers losses sustained by \u201cthe insured\u201d arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the \u201cowned automobile\u201d or any \u201cnon-owned automobile.\u201d The policy defines the phrase \u201cowned automobile\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">(a) a private passenger, farm or utility automobile described in this policy for which a specific premium charge indicates that coverage is afforded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">(b) a trailer owned by the named insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">(c) a private passenger, farm or utility automobile ownership of which is acquired by the named insured during the policy period, provided</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">(1) it replaces an owned automobile as defined in (a) above, or the company insures all private passenger, farm and utility automobiles owned by the named insured on the date of such acquisition and (2) the named insured notifies the company within 30 days after the date of such acquisition of his election to make this and no other policy issued by the company applicable to such automobile, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">(d) a temporary substitute automobile. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The policy further defines \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d as \u201can automobile or trailer not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Plaintiff sought a declaratory ruling that it was not obligated to provide coverage in the wrongful death action because the truck was neither \u201cowned\u201d nor \u201cnon-owned\u201d under the terms of the policy since it was \u201cfurnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative.\u201d The trial court granted summary disposition for defendants under MCR 2.116(C)(10). The trial court reasoned that the policy language is ambiguous and, thus, affords coverage whether the track was furnished for the regular use of Steven John or Steven Jacob Nikkei. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although recognizing that it was not bound by <em>Powers, supra, </em>because only two justices had signed the plurality opinion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals reviewed the plurality opinion for guidance and held that the policy affords coverage in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>We granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">H. AMBIGUITY OF NO-FAULT POLICY LANGUAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The question presented is whether plaintiff\u2019s no-fault policy is ambiguous regarding coverage of losses incurred by an insured arising out of the use of a \u201cnon-owned automobile.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the limitation of residual liability coverage pursuant to a nonowned automobile clause is valid under the no-fault act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the question is one of contract interpretation. See <em>Bianchi v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>437 Mich 65, 68; 467 NW2d 17 (1991). Whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo. <em>Port Huron Ed Ass\u2019n v Port Huron Area School Dist, </em>452 Mich 309, 323; 550 NW2d 228 (1996); <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v Michigan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In <em>Powers, supra, </em>this Court considered whether substantially identical policy provisions defining the phrase \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d were valid. The plurality opinion would have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">the insurers\u2019 method of exclusion \u2014 by the definition of terms at variance with their common meaning, which most policyholders would consider clear without definition \u2014 renders it invalid as (a) ambiguous, (b) not made clear, (c) a technical construction, and (d) contrary to the reasonable expectations of the insured reading the insurance contract. <em>[Id. </em>at 611.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The plurality relied on six rules of contract interpretation to conclude that the clauses were invalid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">1) \u201c[Exceptions in an insurance policy to the general liability provided for are to be strictly construed against the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">2) An insurer may not \u201cescape liability by taking advantage of an ambiguity ....\u201d\u201c \u2018[WJherever there are two constructions that can be placed upon the policy, the construction most favorable to the policyholder will be adopted.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">3) An insurer must \u201cso . . . draft the policy as to make clear the extent of nonliability under the exclusion clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-13\">4) An insurer may not \u201cescape liability by taking advantage of ... a forced construction of the language in a policy . . . .\u201d \u201c[Technical constructions of policies of insurance are not favored . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-14\">5) \u201cThe courts have no patience with attempts by a paid insurer to escape liability by taking advantage of an ambiguity, a hidden meaning, or a forced construction of the language in a policy, when all question might have been avoided by a more generous or plainer use of words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>6) \u201c[N]ot only ambiguous but deceptive.\u201d \u201c[T]he policyholder must be protected against confusing statements in policies . . . .\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 623-624 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The plurality emphasized the second, third, fourth and fifth rule in concluding that the clauses were invalid. The plurality reasoned that ambiguity existed because \u201cowned automobile\u201d and \u201cnonowned automobile\u201d were terms in common use that had unambiguous meanings that differed from the definitions provided in the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 624-627. It determined that the insurers\u2019 construction was a technical one, \u201crequiring the application of an obscurely drafted definition to an apparently unambiguous meaning of a commonly used English word.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628. Further, the plurality explained, clarity required that the policy either specifically reference the definitions to alert the insured that they may differ from common meaning or include the \u201cexclusions\u201d in the exclusion section of the policy to provide notice to the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 627-630.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The plurality additionally relied on the related rule of reasonable expectations to conclude that the exception for nonowned automobiles was invalid. The plurality determined that a person reading the liability provisions of the policy would reasonably expect coverage when driving both the automobile insured under the policy and the cars of others. It reasoned that the policy did not identify the exception as an exclusion, but rather, exempted a group of automobiles by defining the terms in a manner contrary to their common usage. <em>Id. </em>at 631-633. The plurality would have held that \u201can insurer may not, by artful definition of terms at variance with their commonly understood meanings, and by failure to speak plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>and clearly, effect an exclusion of coverage in an automobile liability policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We repudiate the plurality opinion in <em>Powers, supra</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and hold that the nonowned automobile clause of the policy involved in this case is unambiguous. The principles of construction governing other contracts apply to insurance policies. <em>Arco Industries Corp v American Motorists Ins Co, </em>448 Mich 395, 402; 531 NW2d 168 (1995). Where no ambiguity exists, this Court enforces the contract as written. <em>Morley v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>458 Mich 459, 465; 581 NW2d 237 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">An insurance contract is ambiguous when its provisions are capable of conflicting interpretations. <em>Bianchi, supra </em>at 70. In <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Michigan, </em>412 Mich 355, 362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">A contract is said to be ambiguous when its words may reasonably be understood in different ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">If a fair reading of the entire contract of insurance leads one to understand that there is coverage under particular circumstances and another fair reading of it leads one to understand there is no coverage under the same circumstances the contract is ambiguous and should be construed against its drafter and in favor of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">Yet if a contract, however inartfully worded or clumsily arranged, fairly admits of but one interpretation it may not be said to be ambiguous or, indeed, fatally unclear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>In this case, the policy defines the term \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d as \u201can automobile or trailer not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile.\u201d \u201cThe overwhelming weight of authority supports the view that \u2018regular use\u2019 and other similar language limiting the extent of coverage provided through non-owned vehicle clauses is not ambiguous.\u201d <em>Foster v Johnstone, </em>107 Idaho 61, 64; 685 P2d 802 (1984) (cases collected). See also <em>Nationwide Mut Ins Co v Shoemaker, </em>965 F Supp 700, 703 (ED Pa, 1997), aff\u2019d 149 F3d 1165 (CA 3, 1998); <em>Highlands Ins Co v Universal Underwriters Ins Co, </em>92 Cal App 3d 171, 174-175; 154 Cal Rptr 683 (1979); <em>Allstate Ins Co v Humphrey, </em>246 Md 492, 496; 229 A2d 70 (1967); <em>DiOrio v New Jersey Mfrs Ins Co, </em>79 NJ 257, 267; 398 A2d 1274 (1979). We join the majority of courts that have considered this question in concluding that the nonowned automobile clause is clear and unambiguous. Accordingly, we accord this clearly defined term its stated meaning. <em>Group Ins Co of Michigan v Czopek, </em>440 Mich 590, 596; 489 NW2d 444 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In so concluding, we decline defendants\u2019 invitation to discern ambiguity solely because an insured might interpret a term differently than the express definition provided in a contract. \u201cThis court has many times held that one who signs a contract will not be heard to say, when enforcement is sought, that he did not read it, or that he supposed it was different in its terms.\u201d <em>Komraus Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc v Cadillac Sands Motel, Inc, </em>387 Mich 285, 290; 195 NW2d 865 (1972). To the extent that the plurality in <em>Powers </em>gleaned ambiguity by relying on an understanding of a term that differed from the clear definition provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>in the policy, <em>Powers </em>is contrary to the most fundamental principle of contract interpretation \u2014 the court may not read ambiguity into a policy where none exists. <em>Michigan Millers Mut Ins Co v Bronson Plating Co, </em>445 Mich 558, 567; 519 NW2d 864 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Nor does the location of the clause in the definition section of the policy render it ambiguous. \u201cAn insurer is free to define or limit the scope of coverage as long as the policy language fairly leads to only one reasonable interpretation and is not in contravention of public policy.\u201d <em>Heniser v Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co, </em>449 Mich 155, 161; 534 NW2d 502 (1995). \u201cAny clause in an insurance policy is valid as long as it is clear, unambiguous and not in contravention of public policy.\u201d <em>Raska, supra </em>at 361-362. To determine otherwise would hold an insurer liable for a risk it did not assume. <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 567; 489 NW2d 431 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We reject the <em>Powers </em>plurality\u2019s conclusion that placing the clause in the definition section of the policy is deceptive and confusing. In part I of the policy involved in this case, under the heading \u201cCoverage,\u201d the policy clearly states that it covers losses sustained by the insured arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the \u201cowned automobile\u201d or any \u201cnon-owned automobile.\u201d The definitions of those terms are provided in the same part of the policy under the heading \u201cDefinitions: Under Part I.\u201d Although plaintiff could have arranged the policy differently, we conclude that it fairly admits of but one interpretation. Accordingly, it is neither ambiguous nor fatally unclear. <em>Raska, supra </em>at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Finally, we conclude that the <em>Powers </em>plurality improperly relied on the rule of reasonable expectations to defeat the unambiguous policy language. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>Vanguard Ins Co v Clarke, </em>438 Mich 463, 472; 475 NW2d 48 (1991), this Court explained that, under the rule, it \u201cwill examine whether \u2018the policyholder, upon reading the contract language is led to a reasonable expectation of coverage.\u2019 \u201d This Court also expounded on the factors involved in the determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">Factors courts consider in determining the legitimate existence of reasonable consumer expectation include \u201cwhether an insurance policy includes a provision that unambiguously limits or excludes coverage and . . . whether a policyholder could have sufficiently examined an insurance policy so as to discover a relevant clause which limits the coverage . . . .\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 472, n 7, quoting Keeton &amp; Widiss, Insurance Law, p 636.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Under <em>Vanguard, </em>the rule of reasonable expectations has no applicability here because no ambiguity exists in the nonowned automobile clause and the insured could have discovered the clause on examination of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In <em>Raska, supra, </em>this Court rejected an insured\u2019s attempt to rely on the rule of reasonable expectations and held that a nonowned automobile clause in a preno-fault insurance policy was valid and enforceable. This Court\u2019s remarks apply equally to the clause when included in a no-fault policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">[T]he expectation that a contract will be enforceable other than according to its terms surely may not be said to be reasonable. If a person signs a contract without reading all of it or without understanding it, under some circumstances that person can avoid its obligations on the theory that there was no contract at all for there was no meeting of the minds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">But to allow such a person to bind another to an obligation not covered by the contract as written because the first person thought the other was bound to such an obligation is neither reasonable nor just. <em>[Id. </em>at 362-363.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>As we observed in <em>Raska, </em>application of the reasonable expectations rule under these circumstances is contrary to the fundamental principle that the insurer and insured may generally contract regarding the scope of coverage. See <em>Heniser, supra </em>at 161. Accordingly, we decline to utilize the rule of reasonable expectations to circumvent the clear policy language at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Here, the \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d clause unambiguously provides that an automobile furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative is not a nonowned automobile for purposes of the policy. That a question of fact may exist regarding the applicability of the policy language to specific circumstances does not render the policy language ambiguous. See <em>Foster, supra </em>at 65; <em>Highlands, supra </em>at 175-176. Because no ambiguity exists in the policy language, we enforce the contract as written. <em>Morley, supra </em>at 465. Accordingly, the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in declining to enforce the clause in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">in. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We conclude that the nonowned automobile clause is unambiguous, and, thus, the policy does not cover vehicles furnished for regular use of either the named insured or any relative, unless the vehicle qualifies as a \u201ctemporary substitute vehicle.\u201d Because neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals addressed whether the clause applies under the circumstances of this case, we do not reach that issue. Instead, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court to consider whether the exclusion applies in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Taylor, and Young, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> Although commonly referred to as an \u201cowned automobile\u201d or \u201cowned vehicle\u201d \u201cexclusion,\" the clause is not an exclusion at all, but rather is a limitation on coverage by definition of a term used to specify the scope of coverage.

Accordingly, the <em>Powers </em>plurality opinion is not binding precedent. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Masters, </em>460 Mich 105, 115, n 7; 595 NW2d 832 (1999); <em>Dean v Chrysler Corp, </em>434 Mich 655, 661, n 7; 455 NW2d 699 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> The Court of Appeals likewise relied on the <em>Powers </em>plurality opinion in <em>DeMaria v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n (On Remand), </em>165 Mich App 251; 418 NW2d 398 (1987). It has, however, declined to follow the plurality opinion on other occasions.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained the purpose of nonowned automobile clauses in <em>Benjamin v Plains Ins Co, </em>650 F2d 98, 100 (CA 5, 1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">It is well established that the purpose of this provision creating an exception to coverage of non-owned vehicles in automobile insurance policies is to make certain that the insured properly pays premiums on all of the vehicles which are regularly used and therefore are covered by the policy. The non-owned exception, as well as other exceptions involving replacement cars, rental cars, etc., are designed as a convenience to the insured to enable coverage in the case of occasional and sporadic use of such vehicles. To cover a non-owned vehicle regularly used by an insured would cause the insurance company to have to insure vehicles for which the insured did not pay insured [sic] premiums.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\"> Unlike the dissent, we do not view the passage of time since <em>Powers </em>as a significant factor that would weigh in favor of giving binding force to the <em>Powers </em>plurality opinion. Not surprisingly, the dissent identifies no authority for the proposition that insurers are obligated to modify policy language in response to an opinion that is not binding precedent and that the Court of Appeals has declined to follow. See <em>ante </em>at 562, ns 3, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b657-4\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">(dissenting). I would hold that the</p>\n<p id=\"Aai\">insurer\u2019s method of exclusion by definition is invalid. Most policyholders would consider the term \u201cnonowned\u201d clear without definition. Plaintiff\u2019s practice, of defining this unambiguous term in an obscure manner, renders the clause unclear and ambiguous. This case presents the very same definitional exclusions that five members of this Court found unenforceable in <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602; 398 NW2d 411 (1986). The lead opinion, signed by two justices, addressed six rules of contract interpretation in concluding that this form of exclusion is an ambiguous, unclear, technical construction that is contrary to the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 611. Two of us concurred in that result. <em>Id. </em>at 643. Justice Levin wrote separately, but in agreement that the exclusion is unenforceable, because it is unconscionable and contrary to the reasonable expectations of an insured. <em>Id. </em>at 645-646. Because the identical unfair practice is at issue, I see no reason to overturn our previous refusal to enforce these clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">I agree that an insurer may exclude coverage for residual liability when an insured is driving a vehicle owned by a resident family member <em>as long as the exclusion is clearly and unambiguously stated. Id. </em>at 642. The lead opinion in <em>Powers </em>provided that these exclusions could be made clear to the insured by simply referencing the exclusionary definitions section. <em>Id. </em>at 629. Alternatively, the insurer could have listed the exclusions in the exclusions section of the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 628. In the thirteen years since <em>Powers, </em>the insurer has failed to incorporate any clarification into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>its policies. While the insurer has refused to place its insureds on notice regarding its coverage exclusions, this Court placed insurers on notice that this form of exclusion would not be enforced. Today, the majority validates the insurer\u2019s defiance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The majority asserts that the nonowned automobile definition is not an exclusion, but rather a \u201climitation on coverage by definition of a term used to specify the scope of coverage.\u201d Ante, p 560, n 1. However, the exclusions section of the policy serves the same purpose of limiting coverage. The majority\u2019s statement that the definition does not provide an exclusion here is questionable. It should be of no concern to the majority under its analysis that this definition operates to exclude coverage based on a definition contrary to the common meaning of \u201cnonowned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">I disagree that these definitional exclusions fairly place an insured on notice of coverage limits. The insured should not be forced to piece together portions of the contract to determine whether coverage exists.</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-8\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
