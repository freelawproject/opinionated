Smith\u2019s complaint alleging: (1) breach of contract involving the credit life and disability insurance policy, and (2) violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act (mcpa), MCL 445.901 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 19.418(1) <em>et seq., </em>concerning the manner in which defendant represented the benefits and conditions of the policy in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Reversing the Court of Appeals in part, we conclude that defendant is entitled to summary disposition regarding plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claim. Defendant\u2019s evidence established that plaintiff\u2019s deceased father, Robert Smith, made material misrepresentations in his insurance application. Contrary to the Court of Appeals conclusion, there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the application\u2019s authenticity. In addition, defendant was not required to establish that it issued the insurance policy in reliance on Smith\u2019s misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">However, we agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant is not entitled to summary disposition regarding its alleged violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act. Although \u00a7 4(l)(a) of the act generally exempts from the MCPA transactions that are \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by law, \u00a7 4(2) provides an exception to that exemption by permitting certain private actions to be brought pursuant to \u00a7 11. That exception is applicable to plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">On December 4, 1992, plaintiffs deceased father, Robert Smith, bought a new truck financed through Ford Motor Credit Company (fmcc). At the time, Smith was forty-seven years old and employed full-time. As part of his financing package, he purchased a combined credit life and disability policy issued by defendant. Only the credit life insurance policy is at issue here. The certificate of insurance provided the following eligibility requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Who is eligible for life insurance: On the Date of Debt you and any Co-Debtor must each: (i) owe the Debt; (ii) be fully capable of being actively at work for wages or profit at least 30 hours per week; and (iii) be less than 71 years old. At the end of the Term of Insurance, you and any Co-Debtor must each be less than 71 years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On Smith\u2019s application for insurance, slash marks had been made in boxes labeled \u201cno\u201d as responses to the following inquiries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">1. Have you been medically diagnosed as having and are you receiving treatment for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">a. Any condition of the heart, brain, liver, kidney, lungs, cancer or any malignant growth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">b. Diabetes, high blood pressure, circulatory disorders, neurological disorders, mental disorders or disorders of the back or neck?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Above Smith\u2019s signature, the application also warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">Answer all questions honestly and truthfully, misrepresentation is a basis for denial of benefits. Any underwriting decision based on this evidence of insurability shall be made within 60 days from the date of this application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The credit life insurance policy provided in relevant part that defendant would be responsible for the balance due on the fmcc loan if Smith died while the policy was in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Smith had made two payments on the fmcc loan when he suffered a fatal heart attack on January 27, 1993. As personal representative of her father\u2019s estate, plaintiff notified defendant of Smith\u2019s death and made a claim for benefits pursuant to the certificate of insurance. Defendant denied coverage, asserting that the policy was void because Smith had misrepresented his state of health on the application. Defendant rescinded the policy, returning premiums paid for the policy to the car dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">After defendant denied the claim, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on conditions of coverage provided in the certificate of insurance quoted above, count I alleged that defendant was aware that decedent met the conditions and denied his claim in bad faith. Count n alleged that defendant misrepresented the advantages, benefits, terms, and conditions of the insurance policy in violation of the mcpa.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In its motion for summary disposition, defendant claimed it would not have insured Smith had it been aware of his true medical background. In support of its motion, defendant submitted: (1) a copy of Smith\u2019s application revealing negative responses to the aforementioned health inquiries, (2) medical records establishing Smith had been diagnosed with coronary heart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>disease in 1986 and was being treated for this condition at the time of his death, (3) interrogatory responses establishing Smith was an insulin-dependent diabetic, and (4) an affidavit by a former underwriter who claimed defendant would have denied the certificate of insurance had it been aware of Smith\u2019s condition at the time he applied for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Opposing the motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit and claimed: (1) the slash marks through the \u201cNO\u201d responses were not in Smith\u2019s handwriting, and (2) defendant failed to proffer evidence establishing that it had received the insurance application when the insurance policy was issued. Plaintiff also claimed that she was not bound by any statements made in the application and that defendant was precluded from admitting the application into evidence because the application was not attached to plaintiff\u2019s certificate of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The trial court granted the motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). It concluded: (1) an insurer is not obligated to attach the application to the certificate of insurance, (2) Smith had not truthfully answered the application inquiries, and (3) the signature appeared authentic. The trial court noted that there was a question whether Smith authored the slash marks through the \u201cno\u201d boxes on the application. However, the court concluded that the issue was \u201clargely beside the point\u201d because the answers appeared to be \u201cadoptively [Smith\u2019s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Addressing the MCPA claims, the trial court concluded that the mcpa does not apply to activity regulated by the State Commissioner of Insurance, citing <em>Kekel v Allstate Ins Co, </em>144 Mich App 379; 375 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>455 (1985). Accordingly, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed. 223 Mich App 264, 266; 565 NW2d 877 (1997). It concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the authenticity of Smith\u2019s signature. However, the Court held that a factual question existed regarding whether Smith had authored the slash marks through the \u201cNO\u201d boxes and whether defendant had received and relied on the application when issuing the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Addressing whether defendant was exempt from the alleged violations of the MCPA, the Court of Appeals considered \u00a7 4(l)(a) of the act which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">This act does not apply to . . . the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">(a) A transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or file United States. [MCL 445.904(1); MSA 19.418(4)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">It concluded that a \u201ccommon-sense reading\u201d of the language reveals that the Legislature did not intend to exempt illegal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 281, citing <em>Attorney General v Diamond Mortgage Co, </em>414 Mich 603; 327 NW2d 805 (1982). Concluding that <em>Kekel </em>erroneously interpreted \u00a7 4(l)(a), the Court of Appeals held, as a matter of law, that defendant was not entitled to summary disposition. <em>Id. </em>at 282-283.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The Court also concluded that <em>Kekel </em>erroneously interpreted \u00a7 4(2) of the MCPA, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">Except for the purposes of an action filed by a person under [MCL 445.911; MSA 19.418(11)], this act does not apply to an unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive method, act, or practice that is made unlawful by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>(a) Chapter 20 of the insurance code of 1956, Act No. 218 of the Public Acts of 1956, as amended, being sections 500.2001 to 500.2093 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. [MCL 445.904(2); MSA 19.418(4)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Court reasoned that, while \u00a7 4(2) (a) generally exempts from the mcpa deceptive acts made unlawful by chapter 20 of the Insurance Code, the first phrase of \u00a7 4(2) expressly permits private actions to be brought pursuant to \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">n. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">A motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), which tests the factual support of a claim, is subject to de novo review. <em>Spiek v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>456 Mich 331, 337; 572 NW2d 201 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">This Court in <em>Quinto v Cross &amp; Peters Co, </em>451 Mich 358, 362-363; 547 NW2d 314 (1996), set forth the following standards for reviewing motions for summary disposition brought under MCR 2.116(C)(10):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">In reviewing a motion for summary disposition brought under MCR 2.116(C)(10), a trial court considers affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence filed in the action or submitted by the parties, MCR 2.116(G)(5), in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. A trial court may grant a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) if the affidavits or other documentary evidence show that there is no genuine issue in respect to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. MCR 2.116(C)(10), (G)(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In presenting a motion for summary disposition, the moving party has the initial burden of supporting its position by affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence. <em>Neubacher v Globe Furniture Rentals, </em>205 Mich App 418, 420; 522 NW2d 335 (1994). The burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish that a genuine issue of disputed fact exists. <em>Id. </em>Where the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue rests on a nonmoving party, the non-moving party may not rely on mere allegations or denials in pleadings, but must go beyond the pleadings to set forth specific facts showing that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>McCart v J Walter Thompson, </em>437 Mich 109, 115; 469 NW2d 284 (1991). If the opposing party fails to present documentary evidence establishing the existence of a material factual dispute, the motion is properly granted. <em>McCormic v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>202 Mich App 233, 237; 507 NW2d 741 (1993).[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>A. BREACH OF CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">As stated, the Court of Appeals held that two factual issues precluded the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition to defendant: (1) whether Smith had authored the slash marks through the \u201cno\u201d boxes on the application, and (2) whether defendant had relied on the application when issuing the policy. We disagree on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">First, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that there was a question of material fact regarding whether Smith \u201cmade or caused to be made the marks in the box describing the state of his health . . . .\u201d 223 Mich App 275. Defendant submitted a copy of the completed application bearing Smith\u2019s signature immediately below the provision warning that all questions must be answered \u201chonestly and truthfully.\u201d Plaintiff does not dispute that the signature on the insurance application is Smith\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In an attempt to rebut defendant\u2019s prima facie showing, plaintiff stated in her affidavit that the slash marks placed through the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d boxes on the application \u201care not in my father\u2019s handwriting.\u201d Plaintiff essentially suggests that Smith may have signed the application in blank and that someone at the dealership filled in the boxes as shown in the application. This Court in <em>General American Life Ins </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Co v Wojciechowski, </em>314 Mich 275, 283; 22 NW2d 371 (1946), rejected a similar attempt to avoid an insurer\u2019s claim of misrepresentation voiding an insurance contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Appellant claims that there was no showing that [the insured] made the statements found in the application over his signature, that the application might have been signed in blank, and that it might be inferred that the answers had been written in after the application was signed. Defendant offered no proof bearing on this issue and conceded that the signature to the application was that of [the insured]. A copy of the application was attached to the bill of complaint and its authenticity was not denied by the defendant. A prima facie showing was thus made by the [insurer], and the circuit judge correctly concluded that in the absence of any proof to that effect the court would not be justified in finding that a fraud had been perpetrated on either the insurer or the insured, by someone who might have filled in the answers unknown to [the insured].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">As in <em>Wojciechowski, </em>plaintiff\u2019s argument here constitutes mere speculation, not a reasonable inference from the evidence, and thus does not rise to the level of creating a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Because plaintiff has offered no proof that someone else answered the health inquiries contained in the application without Smith\u2019s knowledge or direction, plaintiff has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the application\u2019s authenticity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Second, we agree with defendant that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, under MCL 500.2218; MSA 24.12218, defendant was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>prove that it relied on the misrepresentations contained in Smith\u2019s application for insurance. We review de novo questions involving statutory interpretation. <em>Putkamer v Transamerica Ins Corp of America, </em>454 Mich 626, 631; 563 NW2d 683 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">MCL 500.2218; MSA 24.12218 limits the right of an insurer to rescind an insurance policy on the basis of false statements made in the insurance application. The statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">The falsity of any statement in the application for any disability insurance policy covered by chapter 34 of this code may not bar the right to recovery thereunder unless such false statement <em>materially affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer. </em>[MCL 500.2218; MSA 24.12218 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">This Court has not had occasion to address directly whether \u00a7 2218 requires an insurer to show that it actually relied upon a false statement made in an insurance application before the insurer may avoid payment under the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals imposed such a requirement in <em>Howard v Golden State Mut Life Ins Co, </em>60 Mich App 469, 477; 231 NW2d 655 (1975). See also <em>United of Omaha Life Ins Co v Rex Roto Corp, </em>126 F3d 785, 787 (CA 6, 1997); <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Comm\u2019r of Ins, </em>141 Mich App 776, 781, n 3; 369 NW2d 896 (1985). However, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>clear that the <em>Howard </em>Court never considered the precise language used in the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">As an initial matter, we find it significant that \u00a7 2218 does not expressly mention reliance. Moreover, while the insurer, under \u00a7 2218, necessarily must have relied on a false statement in an insurance application in order for such a statement to have materially affected the insurer\u2019s \u201cacceptance of the risk,\u201d the statute also permits the insurer to rescind the policy if the false statement materially affected the \u201chazard assumed\u201d by the insurer. In <em>In re Certified Question, Wickersham v John Hancock Mut Life Ins Co, </em>413 Mich 57, 63; 318 NW2d 456 (1982), we recognized that the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201ceither\u201d and \u201cor\u201d indicates that the terms \u201cacceptance of the risk\u201d and \u201chazard assumed\u201d have different meanings. We must give effect to both terms in order to avoid rendering either term mere surplusage. <em>Smith v Employment Security Comm, </em>410 Mich 231, 250; 301 NW2d 285 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">As we explained in <em>Wickersham, supra </em>at 63:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">Acceptance of the risk refers to the time of making of the contract of insurance and to the insurance concept of risk. Whether an insurer determines to enter into a contract is affected by its assessment of the likelihood of a fact increasing the chances of the loss insured against.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>On the other hand, the term \u201chazard assumed\u201d refers to the circumstances of the loss. <em>Id. </em>at 62. In order for a misstatement to be material to the hazard assumed, the misstatement \u201c \u2018must be shown in some way to have affected [the hazard] or contributed to the loss ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, quoting <em>Prudential Ins Co of America v Saxe, </em>77 US App DC 144, 156; 134 F2d 16 (1943). Thus, in <em>Wickersham, supra </em>at 63, we observed that the insured\u2019s undisclosed heart problems did not affect or contribute to the hazard assumed because the insured died in a swimming accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Accordingly, while a misrepresentation in an insurance application clearly cannot affect an insurer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201cacceptance of the risk\u201d unless the insurer relied on the misrepresentation in issuing the policy, we conclude that such a misrepresentation materially affects the \u201chazard assumed\u201d by an insurer whenever the facts misrepresented are causally connected to the loss. When such a causal relationship exists, an insurer is entitled to rescind the policy under \u00a7 2218 even without a showing of reliance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In this case, Smith misrepresented his health, stating that he did not have a heart condition. In fact, Smith died of a heart attack. Under these circumstances, it is beyond question that Smith\u2019s misrepresentation is causally connected to the loss. The misrepresentation materially affected the hazard assumed, Smith\u2019s death, regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>defendant actually relied on that misrepresentation. Therefore, under \u00a7 2218, defendant was not required to establish reliance in order to avoid payment under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision on the breach of contract claim and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">B. MICHIGAN CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Turning to the issue whether defendant is exempted from plaintiff\u2019s claim of MCPA violations, we first examine whether defendant is exempted by \u00a7 4(l)(a). The language of \u00a7 4(l)(a) provides that the MCPA is inapplicable to a \u201ctransaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state . . . .\u201d MCL 445.904(1); MSA 19.418(4)(1). Defendant asserts that its application and certificate of insurance forms were submitted to<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and implicitly approved by<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the State Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of Insurance. Hence, it contends, the immediate transaction, the sale of credit life insurance, was \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d and, therefore, was exempted under \u00a7 4(a)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff, however, essentially responds that the statute does not specifically authorize the <em>fraudulent </em>insurance practices that she claims were committed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">As the Court of Appeals recognized, our decision in <em>Diamond </em>Mortgage<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> controls the resolution of this issue. In <em>Diamond Mortgage, </em>the defendant, a real estate broker, also advertised and offered loans to homeowners at an eleven percent interest rate. The financing arrangement resulted in the defendant receiving a \u201cbrokerage or prepaid finance fee\u201d that the Attorney General alleged was actually an interest charge and, moreover, usurious. <em>Id. </em>at 607. The Attorney General also claimed that the defendant used confusing and inconsistent forms and that its method of doing business violated the mcpa. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The defendant in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>argued that it was exempt from the mcpa under \u00a7 4(l)(a) because it had a real estate broker\u2019s license and that one of the activities contemplated was that a licensee would negotiate the mortgage of real estate. <em>Id. </em>at 616. Like plaintiff here, the defendants in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>responded that \u201cno statute [or regulatory agency] specifically authorize[d] misrepresentations or false promises\u201d made in conducting that activity. <em>Id. </em>at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>In concluding that the defendants were not exempt from the MCPA, this Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">While the license generally authorizes Diamond to engage in the activities of a real estate broker, it does not specifically authorize the conduct that plaintiff alleges is violative of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, nor transactions that result from that conduct. In so concluding, we disagree that the exemption of \u00a7 4(1) becomes meaningless. While defendants are correct in stating that no statute or regulatory agency specifically authorizes misrepresentations or false promises, the exemption will nevertheless apply where a party seeks to attach such labels to \u201c[a] transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u201d For this case, we need only decide that a real estate broker\u2019s license is not specific authority for all the conduct and transactions of the licensee\u2019s business. <em>[Id. </em>at 617.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In short, <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>instructs that the focus is on whether the transaction at issue, not the alleged misconduct, is \u201cspecifically authorized.\u201d Thus, the defendant in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>was not exempt from the MCPA because the transaction at issue, mortgage writing, was not \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d under the defendant\u2019s real estate broker\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Applying this analysis in <em>Kekel, </em>the Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant insurer in that case was exempted from the plaintiff\u2019s alleged violations of the MCPA pursuant to MCL 445.903; MSA 19.418(3). It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\"><em>Diamond </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. The activities of the defendant in <em>Diamond </em>which the plaintiffs there were complaining of were not subject to any regulation under the real estate broker\u2019s license of the defendant and thus such conduct was not reviewable by the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ble licensing or regulatory authority. . . . The insurance industry is under the authority of the State Commissioner of Insurance and subject to the extensive statutory and regulatory scheme, all administered \u201cby a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 384, citing MCL 445.904(l)(a); MSA 19.418(4)(l)(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Consistent with these rulings, we conclude here that, when the Legislature said that transactions or conduct \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by law are exempt from the MCPA, it intended to include conduct the legality of which is in dispute. Contrary to the \u201ccommon-sense reading\u201d of this provision by the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the relevant inquiry is not whether the specific misconduct alleged by the plaintiffs is \u201cspecifically authorized.\u201d Rather, it is whether the general transaction is specifically authorized by law, regardless of whether the specific misconduct alleged is prohibited. Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 4(l)(a) generally exempts the sale of credit life insurance from the provisions of the mcpa, because such \u201ctransaction or conduct\u201d is \u201cspecifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As a consequence, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, in part, on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">However, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the <em>Kekel </em>Court misconstrued \u00a7 4(2) of the MCPA. In addition to the broad exemption provided in \u00a7 4(l)(a), \u00a7 4(2) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">Except for the purposes of an action filed by a person under [MCL 445.911; MSA 19.418(11)], this act does not apply to an unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive method, act, or practice that is made unlawful by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">(a) Chapter 20 of the insurance code of 1956, Act No. 218 of the Public Acts of 1956, as amended, being sections 500.2001 to 500.2093 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. [MCL 445.904(2); MSA 19.418(4)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Thus, \u00a7 4(2) (a) specifically exempts from the mcpa unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive methods, acts, or practices made unlawful by chapter 20 of the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Yet, the first phrase of \u00a7 4(2) explicitly provides that the exemption is inapplicable to actions filed under \u00a7 11 of the mcpa, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">(1) Whether or not he seeks damages or has an adequate remedy at law, a person may bring an action to do either or both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">(a) Obtain a declaratory judgment that a method, act, or practice is unlawful under section 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>(b) Enjoin in accordance with the principles of equity a person who is engaging or is about to engage in a method, act, or practice which is unlawful under section 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">(2) Except in a class action, a person who suffers loss as a result of a violation of this act may bring an action to recover actual damages or $250.00, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. [MCL 445.911; MSA 19.418(11).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Giving effect to both \u00a7 4(1) and \u00a7 4(2), we conclude that private actions are permitted against an insurer pursuant to \u00a7 11 of the mcpa regardless of whether the insurer\u2019s activities are \u201cspecifically authorized.\u201d Although \u00a7 4(l)(a) generally provides that transactions or conduct \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d are exempt from the provisions of the MCPA, \u00a7 4(2) provides an exception to that exemption by permitting private actions pursuant to \u00a7 11 arising out of misconduct made unlawful by chapter 20 of the Insurance Code. Therefore, the exemptions provided by \u00a7\u00a7 4(l)(a) and 4(2)(a) are inapplicable to plaintiff\u2019s mcpa claims to the extent that they involve allegations of misconduct made unlawful under chapter 20 of the Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that defendant is not entitled to summary disposition with regard to plaintiff\u2019s mcpa claims. To the extent that <em>Kekel </em>and its progeny<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> are inconsistent with this holding, they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">m. conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">We reverse the Court of Appeals decision on the breach of contract claim. There is no genuine issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>material fact regarding the authenticity of the insurance application. Moreover, under the circumstances of this case, defendant was not required to establish that it relied on Smith\u2019s misrepresentation when issuing the policy. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition for defendant on the breach of contract claim is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We affirm the Court of Appeals in part and reverse in part with regard to the alleged violations of the MCPA. Contrary to the Court of Appeals conclusion, \u00a7 4(l)(a) exempts the sale of insurance from the provisions of the mcpa. However, we agree with the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 4(2) provides an exception to that exemption by permitting private actions pursuant to \u00a7 11. Therefore, defendant is not entitled to summary disposition of plaintiff\u2019s mcpa claims.

See MCL 500.2218(1); MSA 24.12218(1) (\u201cNo misrepresentation shall be deemed material unless knowledge by the insurer of the facts misrepresented would have led to a refusal by the insurer to make the contract\u201d). That argument highlights the dissent\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding of \u00a7 2218. On its face, the statute\u2019s materiality provision plainly requires that the insurer demonstrate, in hindsight, that it \u201cwould have\u201d refused to issue the policy if it had known the facts misrepresented. Such a post hoc determination simply has nothing to do with whether the insurer <em>in fact </em>relied on the misrepresentation when issuing the policy. Thus, the <em>Wickersham </em>Court\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d to which the dissent refers is wholly inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The dissent, <em>post </em>at 471, further argues that \u00a7 2218(2) \u201cexpressly requires an insurer to establish that the prospective insured misrepresented a fact that <em>induced </em>the insurer to contract <em>....'' </em>Thus, claims the dissent, \u201can express reference to reliance would be surplusage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute clearly does <em>not </em>state that the misrepresentation must have induced the insurer to contract.

Clearly, an applicant may make a misrepresentation \u201cas an inducement to the making\" of a contract without the inducement actually causing the insurer to contract. Our construction, contrary to the dissent\u2019s, gives meaning to the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201ceither\u201d and \u201cor,\u201d which use, as stated, indicates that the terms \u201cacceptance of the risk\u201d and \u201chazard assumed\u201d have different meanings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> Justice Kelly\u2019s dissent, <em>post </em>at 472, claims that we have cited <em>Wicker-sham </em>\u201cfor the proposition that a misrepresentation affecting the hazard assumed by the insurer, as distinguished from the risk accepted, does not require reliance.\u201d The dissent further accuses us of \u201comitting portions of <em>Wickersham, </em>and misconstruing the remainder . . . .\u201d <em>Post </em>at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">We do not suggest that <em>Wickersham </em>in any way addressed the reliance issue presented here.

We similarly reject the dissent\u2019s determined effort, <em>post </em>at 474, to make dicta in <em>Wickersham </em>a holding by observing that the <em>Wickersham </em>Court\u2019s passing mention of reliance was a \u201cpointed reference.\u201d Whether the <em>Wickersham </em>Court\u2019s reference to reliance was \u201cpointed\u201d or otherwise, it is clear that the reference is dicta.

Defendant moved for summary disposition. Therefore, it had the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the three elements required to void the insurance policy for misrepresentation.

Therefore, it was not entitled to summary disposition on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">I believe that the majority erred in concluding that the defendant insurer was entitled to summary disposition with regard to plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claim. By awarding defendant insurer summary disposition absent any allegation of reliance, the majority encourages insurers to search their records in an effort to find any inconsequential mistake to deny coverage. I would affirm the Court of Appeals judgment on this issue and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> I also dissent from the majority\u2019s attempt to create a new standard for reviewing motions for summary disposition under the guise of <em>McCart v J Walter Thompson USA, Inc, </em>437 Mich 109, 115, n 4; 469 NW2d 284 (1991). In <em>McCart, </em>this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">[A] mere promise to offer factual support at trial was categorized as a \u201cpleading\u201d under the pre-1985 court rules, see e.g., <em>Rizzo v Kretschmer, </em>389 Mich 363, 377; 207 NW2d 316 (1973), and, as such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>is precisely what is now insufficient under the new requirements of MCR 2.116(G)(4), enacted in 1985.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The observation addressed nothing more than the production of documentary evidence sufficient to survive a motion for summary disposition. But the majority here, without providing supporting authority, intimates that the observation rejected the longstanding rule regarding the standard for reviewing motions for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10). Michigan appellate courts have interpreted the rule in a consistent fashion for the past thirteen years. The interpretation is that an award of summary disposition is inappropriate unless it is impossible for the nonmoving party to support its claim at trial because of a deficiency that cannot be overcome. <em>Lytle v Malady (On Rehearing), </em>458 Mich 153, 176; 579 NW2d 906 (1998) (Weaver, J.); <em>Paul v Lee, </em>455 Mich 204, 210; 568 NW2d 510 (1997); <em>Horton v Verhelle, </em>231 Mich App 667, 672; 588 NW2d 144 (1998); <em>Berry v J &amp; D Auto Dismantlers, Inc, </em>195 Mich App 476, 479; 491 NW2d 585 (1992); <em>Dzierwa v Michigan Oil Co, </em>152 Mich App 281, 284; 393 NW2d 610 (1986). In fact, in <em>McCart </em>itself, we reiterated the continuing vitality of the previous standard of review by citing with approval the decision in <em>Ewers v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>178 Mich App 371; 443 NW2d 504 (1989). In that case, the Court of Appeals provided, \u201c[bjefore judgment may be granted, the court must be satisfied that it is impossible for the claim asserted to be supported by evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. Therefore, although courts are now required to review documentary evidence as provided in <em>McCart, </em>MCR 2.116(C)(10), when adopted, did not alter the way this evidence is to be examined. The majority provides no rationale for rejecting our consistent interpretation of a longstanding court rule. Therefore, I dissent from what, regrettably, amounts to an attempt to lower the bar for granting summary disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\"> 413 Mich 57; 318 NW2d 456 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\"> In <em>Wickersham, </em>this Court expressly noted that \u201cthe Legislature has limited in other ways an insurer\u2019s power to avoid an insurance policy on grounds of material misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>66.

Rather, it simply defines a representation as one that is made \u201cas an inducement to the making\u201d of a contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">While that distinction obviously eludes the dissent, we believe it to be an important one. Clearly, an applicant may make a misrepresentation \u201cas an inducement to the making\u201d of a contract without the inducement actually causing the insurer to contract. Our construction, contrary to the dissent\u2019s, gives meaning to the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201ceither\u201d and \u201cor,\u201d which use, as stated, indicates that the terms \u201cacceptance of the risk\u201d and \u201chazard assumed\u201d have different meanings. <em>[Ante </em>at 460, n 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, inducement is \u201c[t]o <em>cause </em>[a] party to choose one course of conduct rather than another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 775 (emphasis added). To circumvent the meaning of \u00a7 2218(2), the majority creates its own distinction by eliminating the causation element of inducement. No authority exists to support this surprising distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> The majority concedes that an insurer \u201cnecessarily must have relied on a false statement in an insurance application in order for such a statement to have materially affected the insurer\u2019s \u2018acceptance of the risk <em>Ante </em>at 459.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\"> Unlike the defendant in <em>Wickersham, </em>the insurer here failed even to allege that it was deceived by Smith\u2019s misrepresentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\"> Section 2218 requires an insurer to establish that knowledge of the misrepresented facts would have led it to refuse to contract.

Confusion in analyzing MCPA claims has resulted from: construing the exemptions too broadly, rendering the vast majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>of private suits exempt under subsection 4(l)(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> construing the exemptions too narrowly so as to remove all exemptions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or construing the transaction or conduct at issue overly broad<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or narrow,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rendering the MCPA or its exemptions meaningless. It is my opinion that a proper inquiry should be first to determine whether the specific transaction or conduct at issue, as opposed to the general transaction, is \u201cspecifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state . . . .\u201d MCL 445.904(l)(a); MSA 19.418(4)(l)(a). The next inquiry should characterize the party filing suit and the act or practice at issue to determine whether the act should apply to the method, act, or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">MCPA SUBSECTION 4(l)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Subsection 4(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>This act does not apply to either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">(a) A transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">(b) An act done by a publisher, owner, agent ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">It appears that the Legislature intended to provide defendants with a very narrow exemption for transactions or conduct <em>specifically authorized, </em>and for specific acts done by the media. Under this statute, we must examine the specific transaction or conduct at issue to determine whether the narrow exemption provided in subsection 4(l)(a) is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The majority correctly notes that <em>Attorney General v Diamond Mortgage Co, </em>414 Mich 603; 327 NW2d 805 (1982), controls the resolution of this case, and that this Court cautioned that the exemption provided in subsection 4(l)(a) will continue to apply where a party seeks to attach labels to a transaction or conduct that is specifically authorized. 414 Mich 617. The majority then characterizes the transaction or conduct at issue as \u201cthe sale of credit life insurance,\u201d which it asserts is exempt from subsection 4(l)(a) because it is specifically authorized. <em>Ante </em>at 465. The majority then revokes this exemption by reading an exception in subsection 4(2) to the exemption in subsection 4(l)(a). In effect, this allows the court to ignore the exemption provided in subsection 4(l)(a) every time a private action is filed against an insurer under \u00a7 ll.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 11 is the only section in which a private party may file suit, under the majority view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>we should never examine the exemptions section when a private action has been filed against an entity encompassed by subsections 4(2)(a)-(e). As stated in <em>Diamond, </em>I disagree that subsection 4(l)(a) is meaningless. <em>Id. </em>The Legislature provided an exception to the exemption within subsection 4(2) for private actions by placing qualifying language in front of the exemption for acts already made unlawful by specified public acts. If it had intended such a result, it seems that the Legislature would have placed a similar limiting clause in subsection 4(l)(a) providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\"><em>Except for the purposes of an action filed by a person under section 11, </em>this act shall not apply to a transaction or conduct specifically authorized ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">It did not. Alternatively, the Legislature could have placed such language preceding both exemptions 1 and 2, thus mandating that the exception for private suits applies to all subsections of \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Without analysis, the majority reads subsection 2 as an exception to subsection 1. I cannot agree. Thus, I would not remove the exemption for conduct \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In this case, plaintiff complains that defendant utilized both a certificate of insurance and an application for insurance, and that these documents provided inconsistent eligibility requirements. Thus, plaintiff does not complain that defendant \u201csold insurance,\u201d as characterized by defendant and the majority. Alternatively, as noted in <em>Diamond, </em>this conduct should not be characterized as \u201cmisrepresentations or false promises,\u201d as this would never be \u201cspecifically authorized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617. Instead, we must ask whether defendant was specifically authorized to use separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>insurance eligibility forms, for a single transaction, that contain inconsistent or differing conditions for coverage eligibility. Defendant argued that an insurer is not required to attach an insurance application to the certificate of insurance. However, it has not asserted that it is specifically authorized to utilize separate forms with inconsistent eligibility requirements. Defendant does not provide an explanation regarding the inconsistent requirements. Defendant informs us that credit insurers are required to submit all policies, certificates, applications, notices, etc., under MCL 550.612; MSA 24.568(12), and that the insurance commissioner implicitly approves them by. failing to object within thirty days under MCL 550.613; MSA 24.568(13). However, defendant has not argued that it has submitted the forms at issue. Even assuming that these forms were submitted and implicitly approved, there is no indication that the commissioner was aware that the forms were being used together for a single insurance sale transaction. Furthermore, I question whether the insurance commissioner\u2019s silence may be construed as a \u201cspecific authorization\u201d under subsection 4(l)(a). Defendant would have us hold that conduct generally or implicitly allowed is exempt. Such a broad interpretation of such narrow language would result in all mcpa claims being barred. Businesses are generally allowed to transact business. The mcpa protects consumers from the unfair transaction of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">To illustrate, in <em>Temborius v Slatkin, </em>157 Mich App 587; 403 NW2d 821 (1986), the plaintiff filed suit against a car dealership and salesman under the mcpa. She alleged that the dealer represented that an automobile would be delivered to her upon payment to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>third party, when the dealer knew that the third party would be unable to complete the transaction because of the third party\u2019s financial difficulties. <em>Id. </em>at 593. The Court held that if plaintiff\u2019s evidence was believed, the jury could find violations of the mcpa. <em>Id. </em>at 598. This is a good example of the unfair trade practice that is barred by the mcpa. However, under the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201ctransaction or conduct,\u201d the defendant\u2019s conduct would be exempt under subsection 4(l)(a) because the sale of automobiles is specifically authorized by the Secretary of State, MCL 257.248; MSA 9.1948. <em>Ante </em>at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Under the majority view, any activity that is <em>regulated </em>by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States, is specifically authorized. The majority effectively adopts the <em>Kekel </em>interpretation of the statute. The<em>Kekel </em>Court provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">We first look to the exemption language of \u00a7 4(1) (a) to determine if plaintiffs\u2019 complaint speaks to a transaction or conduct which would be the subject of regulatory control \u201cunder laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u201d <em>[Kekel v Allstate Ins Co, </em>144 Mich App 379, 383; 375 NW2d 455 (1985) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The majority does not direct us to a law administered by the insurance commissioner that provides that \u201csale of insurance is authorized.\u201d Like most businesses, it is merely regulated. Under this broad labeling, all mcpa claims will be blocked by subsection 4(1) (a) unless they fall within the exceptions listed in subsections 4(2)(a)-(e). I suggest the majority cannot provide meaningful examples where a consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>would not be blocked by subsection 4(l)(a) under its reading of the terms \u201cspecifically authorized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Under MCL 445.903; MSA 19.418(3), the MCPA protects consumers from unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive methods, acts, or practices in the conduct of \u201ctrade or commerce.\u201d Trade or commerce is defined, in part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">[T]he conduct of a business providing goods, property, or service primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and includes the advertising, solicitation, offering for sale or rent, sale, lease, or distribution of a service or property, tangible or intangible, real, personal, or mixed, or any other article, or a business opportunity. [MCL 445.902(d); MSA 19.418(2)(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In simple terms, the mcpa protects consumers from unfair business practices regarding the sale of personal, family, or household goods or services. Because such businesses are regulated, the consumer has little or no redress under the provisions of the mcpa according to the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Instead, I read the statute consistent with our determination in <em>Diamond, </em>that general transactions or conduct subject to licensing are not necessarily exempt from the MCPA. Plaintiff correctly notes that \u201csubject to regulation\u201d is not the same as \u201cspecifically authorized.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the instant case the transaction or conduct at issue is defendant\u2019s use of inconsistent insurance eligibility forms. Defendant has failed to show that this conduct is specifically authorized. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>most, defendant has shown that when used separately, the forms are implicitly allowed. This is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">MCPA SUBSECTION 4(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">Except for the purposes of an action filed by a person under section 11, this act shall not apply to an unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive method, act, or practice that is made unlawful by [various specified public acts.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In this case, plaintiff, daughter of the deceased insured, is \u201ca person\u201d as defined by MCL 445.902(c); MSA 19.418(2)(c), which includes a natural person.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Furthermore, plaintiff filed under subsection 11(2) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">Except in a class action, a person who suffers loss as a result of a violation of this act may bring an action to recover actual damages or $250.00, whichever is greater, together with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">The court in <em>Robertson v State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co, </em>890 F Supp 671, 674-675 (ED Mich, 1995), correctly explained the organization of the different sections of the MCPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">Thus, section 11 is the section regarding private causes of action brought by consumers. The only other sections addressing who may bring actions under the act (and under what circumstances) are sections 10 and 15. Section 10 applies to class actions brought by the attorney general on behalf of citizens of the state, and \u00a7 15 extends to county prosecutors the power of the attorney general to bring suit. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Section 11 allows private actions to be brought and \u00a7 4(2) excepts actions brought under \u00a7 11 from exemption from the Michigan Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 action is not exempted from the act\u2019s purview. The act allows private party suits where state-initiated prosecution would be precluded under [MCL 445.904(2)(a)-(g); MSA 19.418(4)(2)(a)-(g)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged violations of the mcpa. Specifically, she alleged violations of MCL 445.903(l)(a)-(e); MSA 19.418(3)(l)(a)-(e), and requested actual damages and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 11. Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s suit is not barred by the exemption provided in subsection 4(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I disagree with the conclusion that we should ignore subsection 4(l)(a) when a private suit is filed against an insurer, yet utilize it to bar most consumer claims that do not fall under the exception listed in subsections 4(2)(a)-(e). However, I agree that defendant was not entitled to summary disposition on its mcpa claim. I would hold that because defendant has failed to provide evidence that its conduct, using inconsistent insurance eligibility forms in a single transaction, is specifically authorized, it is not exempt from suit under subsection 4(l)(a) of the MCPA. I would also hold that because plaintiff is a person filing under \u00a7 11, defendant is not exempt under subsection 4(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\"> However, I do not join in footnote 1 of her opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> See <em>Kekel v Allstate Ins Co, </em>144 Mich App 379, 383; 375 NW2d 455 (1985), determining whether the transaction or conduct is the subject of regulatory control.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> The plaintiff in <em>Attorney General v Diamond Mortgage Co, </em>414 Mich 603, 616; 327 NW2d 805 (1982), argued that deceptive practices are not specifically authorized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> The defendant in <em>Diamond </em>asserted that because he was a licensed real estate broker, he was specifically authorized to negotiate the mortgage of real estate and perform all the acts of a broker. 414 Mich 616.
