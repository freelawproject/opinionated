We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission (WCAC), which affirmed the magistrate\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Oxley\u2019s full-time job during the period at issue was as a National Guard technician. Since 1969, such technicians have been classified as federal employees under 32 USC 709(d). This position required that he be a member of the Michigan Air National Guard. See 32 USC 709(b)(1). As a member of the Michigan Air National Guard, Oxley served one weekend a month plus fifteen days of summer camp each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Oxley\u2019s technician position involved computer operations. He had received four weeks of training, but felt that he was insufficiently trained and supported in his job. He alleged that the resulting stress caused him to suffer a myocardial infarction on November 13, 1985. While he returned to work after the heart attack, Oxley contended that his return to the same job subjected him to the same stress and resulted in further disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was terminated from military service because of medical disqualification on October 17, 1986, and terminated from his federal civil service status on February 27, 1987. He receives federal pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">On September 27, 1990, Oxley sought Michigan worker\u2019s compensation benefits, alleging continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>disability due to work-related injuries. However, Oxley did not seek federal worker\u2019s compensation benefits for the injuries at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The magistrate denied Oxley\u2019s claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits, ruling that he was not an employee covered under Michigan\u2019s wdca. She concluded that Oxley was a federal employee for purposes of the WDCA. In reaching this conclusion, she relied on 32 USC 709, which states that a technician is a federal employee. She noted that Oxley received his pay and annual W-2s from the federal government and that his sick and vacation time and other benefits were provided through the federal civil service system. She also found, significantly, that the state adjutant general, Oxley\u2019s supervisor, is a federal employee for purposes of administering technicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The wcac affirmed the magistrate\u2019s analysis and conclusion. 1996 Mich ACO 675. Additionally, it acknowledged <em>Tulppo v Ontonagon Co, </em>207 Mich App 277; 523 NW2d 883 (1994), which indicated that wages earned for service in the National Guard should be included in the computation of weekly wage-loss benefits under the wdca when a claimant is injured in the course of concurrent employment that is covered under the WDCA. However, on the basis of limiting language in <em>Tulppo, </em>the wcac concluded that Oxley was limited to the worker\u2019s compensation benefits available under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The Court of Appeals granted leave and reversed. 227 Mich App 528; 575 NW2d 820 (1998). It con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>eluded that Oxley was both a federal and a state employee and was therefore eligible for worker\u2019s compensation benefits under Michigan\u2019s WDCA. It relied on federal authority indicating that 32 USC 709 made technicians \u201cnominal\u201d federal employees for the limited purpose of making them eligible for federal fringe and retirement benefits and for coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act. It rejected defendant\u2019s contention that technicians like Oxley wear two hats \u2014 they are civilian federal employees while acting as technicians, but members of the military, arguably employed by the state, while engaging in National Guard duties, i.e., when in military training or actual military service. Rather, the Court of Appeals held that Oxley\u2019s work as a technician was military in character and required that he be a member of the National Guard. Applying the economic reality test, it concluded that Oxley was employed by the state because he was voluntarily in the service of the state and subject to its control and direction in his work. It stated that the limiting language in <em>Tulppo, </em>relied upon by the WCAC, was dicta. Finally, it noted that Oxley was not receiving federal worker\u2019s compensation benefits and that there was accordingly no danger of double recovery, which was the basis of Tulppo\u2019s limiting language.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">This Court granted leave to appeal. 459 Mich 927 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Whether Oxley was an employee of the state for purposes of Michigan\u2019s WDCA is a question of law. This Court has the authority to review questions of law involved in any final order of the WCAC. MCL 418.861; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>MSA 17.237(861). This Court reviews questions of law de novo. <em>Hagerman v Gencorp Automotive, </em>457 Mich 720, 727; 579 NW2d 347 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In order to be eligible for Michigan WDCA benefits, a claimant must be a \u201ccovered\u201d employee. Oxley contends that he was a covered employee because he was in the service of the state pursuant to MCL 418.161(l)(a); MSA 17.237(161)(l)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Before beginning to analyze whether Oxley was a covered employee under \u00a7 161(l)(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is helpful to frame the issue by reiterating some facts that are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Oxley\u2019s allegations in his petition for worker\u2019s compensation benefits acknowledge that the injuries at issue arose in the course of his civilian technician work, i.e., his forty hour a week job; not in the course of his military National Guard service, i.e., his service one weekend a month and fifteen days of summer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>camp each year. Further, both parties agree that, pursuant to 32 USC 709, technicians are federal employees and are under the authority of the state adjutant general.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Oxley\u2019s wages were paid by federal funds on a federal paycheck and that his sick and vacation time and other benefits were provided through the federal civil service system. Further, defendant concedes that Oxley was a state employee with respect to his military National Guard duties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>As used in this act, \u201cemployee\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">(a) A person in the service of the state . . . under any appointment, or contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Given these facts, the issue is whether Oxley was exclusively a federal employee or simultaneously a federal employee and a state employee when the injuries at issue arose. It is agreed that if these injuries arose in the course of work as to which he was exclusively a federal employee, Oxley would not be a covered employee under \u00a7 161(l)(a) and thus would be ineligible for Michigan wdca benefits. However, if they arose in the course of work as to which he was both a federal and a state employee, he would be eligible to pursue Michigan wdca benefits under \u00a7 161(l)(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">As to whether Oxley\u2019s civilian technician work can be differentiated from his military National Guard service, Oxley argues that the civilian and military aspects of his work cannot be separated and that he was simultaneously a federal employee and a state employee. Defendant, of course, contends that Oxley\u2019s work can be bifurcated into its civilian and military elements. It claims that Oxley was a federal employee in his capacity as a technician and a state employee with respect to his military National Guard service.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The only Michigan case cited by the parties as bearing on this issue is <em>Tulppo, </em>207 Mich App 277. In <em>Tulppo, </em>a sheriff, who was also a member of the National Guard, sought Michigan worker\u2019s compensation benefits for an injury suffered in the course of his sheriff\u2019s duties. There was no dispute that his sheriff position was clearly covered employment under \u00a7 161(l)(a). The only question was if, in setting his worker\u2019s compensation benefits, the plaintiff\u2019s pay for National Guard service should be considered. The <em>Tulppo </em>Court answered in the affirmative, holding that \u201cfor the limited purpose of determining average weekly wage loss under \u00a7 371 of the wdca, Michigan National Guard members are state employees and . . . fall within the express language of \u00a7 . . . 161.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282. Thus, the <em>Tulppo </em>Court dispositively concluded that where a claimant is injured in the course of covered employment, the claimant\u2019s pay for National Guard service may be considered in calculating worker\u2019s compensation benefits. While it discussed the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide worker\u2019s compensation benefits to National Guard members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201cinjured or killed in the course of <em>other concurrent employment covered by the </em>act,\u201d the question whether such other concurrent employment is covered by the act, as is at issue here, simply was not before the <em>Tulppo </em>Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 207 Mich App 285. Thus, <em>Tulppo </em>provides no guidance regarding whether a technician position constitutes other concurrent employment that is covered by Michigan\u2019s wdca. Nor does <em>Tulppo </em>shed any light on the specific question whether Oxley\u2019s civilian technician work can be separated from his military National Guard service.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Given the paucity of Michigan authorities addressing the issues we confront, we turn to cases from other jurisdictions for guidance. Some federal cases have indicated a categorical conclusion that the civil and military aspects of a technician position are inseparable. However, even cases taking this approach focus on the fundamentally military elements of the challenges at issue in concluding that technicians\u2019 civilian status could not be unraveled from their military service. For example, in <em>Wright v Park, </em>5 F3d 586 (CA 1, 1993), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed a summary judgment dismissing a technician\u2019s claim that his job transfer was retaliation for whistle-blowing. Because a member of the military cannot pursue such a claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the plaintiffs ability to proceed turned on whether his civilian work could be separated from his military service. The <em>Wright </em>court rejected the plaintiffs proposed \u201cBalkanization of technicians\u2019 work\u201d into separate military and civilian elements because it concluded that \u201cthe adverse employment action against which appellant inveighs necessarily implicates his military as well as his civilian status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588-589. <em>American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2953 v Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>235 US App DC 104; 730 F2d 1534 (1984), held that the National Guard was not required to bargain over a union proposal to eliminate consideration of military performance from reduction-in-force actions regarding technicians. In so holding, the court noted that the National Guard Bureau regulation requiring consideration of both civilian and military performance has repercussions on military preparedness. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 116. See also <em>New Jersey Air Nat\u2019l Guard v Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>677 F2d 276 (CA 3, 1982) (holding that the National Guard was not required to bargain over certain conditions of employment with a union representing civilian technicians).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">More recent federal cases explicitly hold that the military and civilian aspects of a technician\u2019s position can be separated with respect to claims that do not implicate integrally military elements of such positions. In two recent decisions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that title vn of the federal civil rights act applied to National Guard technicians except with respect to personnel decisions \u201cintegrally related to the military\u2019s unique structure.\u201d <em>Mier v Owens, </em>57 F3d 747, 748 (CA 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>1995); <em>Gregory v Widnall, </em>153 F3d 1071, 1074 (CA 9, 1998). The <em>Mier </em>court noted that title vn\u2019s protection against employment discrimination applies to civilian employees of the military, but not to military personnel. <em>Mier </em>at 749. In order for a technician to be eligible to pursue claims available to civilian employees but not military personnel, it is necessary to bifurcate the technician\u2019s civilian work from his military service. Accordingly, <em>Gregory </em>and <em>Mier </em>indicate that, unless the situation under scrutiny is fundamentally military, the civilian aspect of National Guard technician positions may be differentiated from the military aspect and considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Careful examination of the facts in these cases provides guidance in identifying when the military and civilian aspects of a technician position cannot be separated. In <em>Mier, </em>a technician alleged discrimination and retaliation in 1) the denial of military promotions, 2) suspension from civilian employment resulting from the military promotion denials, and 3) subjection to an investigation. At issue was whether the plaintiff could utilize uniquely civilian remedies, unavailable to military personnel, such as a suit under title vn of the federal civil rights act. The <em>Mier </em>court concluded that he could not. It stated that \u201c[military promotion is one of the most obvious examples of a personnel action that is integrally related to the military\u2019s structure\u201d and accordingly held that the denial of a military promotion and a resulting suspension from civilian employment were integrally military issues that are not reviewable under title vn. <em>Id. </em>at 751. It also concluded that investigations are \u201ccentral to the military\u2019s unique concerns regarding discipline and control\u201d and accordingly are not reviewable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>under title vn. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the <em>Gregory </em>court rejected a technician\u2019s attempt to pursue a title vn action because it found that his allegations relating to a military promotion were \u201cintegrally related to the military\u2019s unique structure.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 153 F3d 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">These cases all indicate that the judicial inquiry is to determine if bifurcation is possible or if the civilian and military aspects of the employment are so commingled that an unraveling is impossible. The bottom line is that, except with respect to claims implicating integrally military issues, technician work can be separated into its civilian and military elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The issue here is Oxley\u2019s eligibility for state worker\u2019s compensation benefits regarding injuries allegedly incurred in the course of civilian work as a technician. This issue does not affect any issue integrally related to the military\u2019s unique structure, nor does plaintiff claim that it does. This is reasonable because the availability of state worker\u2019s compensation benefits does not implicate fundamentally military issues such as military discipline, military promotions or the nation\u2019s military preparedness. Therefore, the present case is distinct from the cases discussed above in which the claim affected on such fundamentally military issues, making it impossible to separate the technicians\u2019 civilian work from their military service. Accordingly, the civilian and military aspects of Oxley\u2019s position may be treated separately here for purposes of determining his eligibility for Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>worker\u2019s compensation benefits for injuries arising in the course of civilian technician work.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In the context of a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits, the next issue is whose service the claimant was in when the alleged injuries arose. Here, this issue is simple because Oxley himself acknowledges that the injuries at issue arose in the course of his civilian technician work.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 32 USC 709(d) explicitly states that Oxley is a federal employee in his capacity as a technician.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The arguable basis for considering him simultaneously in the service of the state was his military service with the National Guard. However, because his civilian technician status can be separated from his military service with respect to eligibility for state worker\u2019s compensation benefits, Oxley\u2019s injuries did not arise in the course of employment in the service of the state. Accordingly, he is not a covered employee under \u00a7 161(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">However, before closing the door on Oxley\u2019s claim, we must address a final issue raised by the Court of Appeals conclusion that, even in his capacity as a technician, Oxley was employed by the state under the economic reality test. 227 Mich App 534. This test is well set out in the recent case of <em>Kidder v Miller-Davis Co, </em>455 Mich 25, 34; 564 NW2d 872 (1997), where this Court reiterated that it had rejected the control test in favor of the economic reality test to determine who is an employer for purposes of the WDCA. Specifically, the <em>Kidder </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">[T]his standard examines a number of criteria including [1] control, [2] payment of wages, [3] hiring, firing, [and] the maintenance of discipline, and [4] common objective. These factors are viewed together in their entirety under a totality of the circumstances test. <em>[Id. </em>at 42.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">On the basis of this test, Oxley claims state employee status. He contends that because the adjutant general, an agent of the state, controlled him and had authority to hire, fire, and discipline him, he was an employee of the state. In making this argument, Oxley relies on 32 USC 709(c), which authorizes the state adjutant general to supervise technicians. Overlooked in his analysis, however, is the fact that federal cases establish that in the capacity where they administer technicians, state adjutants general act as federal agents, not state agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In <em>Gilliam v Miller, </em>973 F2d 760, 762 (CA 9, 1992), the Ninth Circuit held that an adjutant general\u2019s \u201cpersonnel actions as supervisor over the federal civilian technicians are taken in the capacity of a federal agency,\u201d but his actions in supervising the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>National Guard are in the capacity of a state agency. Similarly, in <em>Leistiko v </em>Stone, 134 F3d 817, 818 (CA 6, 1998), a wrongful discharge case, the Sixth Circuit stated that the adjutant general acted as \u201cthe designee of the Secretary of the Army\u201d in terminating a technician\u2019s employment after he was removed from flying status for medical reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Thus, as these authorities persuasively advance, Oxley cannot utilize the status of his supervisor to advance his claim that the economic realities indicate that he was a state employee because his contention that the adjutant general was acting as a state agent in supervising his civilian technician work is untenable. This disposes of factors 1 (control) and 3 (hiring, firing, and discipline authority) of the economic reality test.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The other two factors also militate toward a conclusion that Oxley was a federal employee, not a state employee, in his civilian technician work. Regarding factor 2 (wages), it is undisputed that Oxley received his wages by a federal paycheck and from federal funds. Further, his sick and vacation time and other benefits were provided under the federal civil service system. Finally, with respect to factor 4 (common objective), Oxley\u2019s work as a technician was part of the common objective of the federal government to provide for the common defense. See US Const, preamble, art I, \u00a7 8. Therefore, these remaining factors of the economic reality test also demonstrate that Oxley was not a state employee in his capacity as a technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Accordingly, under both the statutory language and the economic reality test, Oxley, in his capacity as a technician, was not in the service of the state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Michigan. Therefore, this employment was not covered under \u00a7 161(l)(a) and he is not eligible to pursue benefits under Michigan\u2019s wdca for an injury allegedly suffered in the course of his civilian technician work.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that, in his capacity as a civilian technician, Oxley was not a covered employee under \u00a7 161(l)(a) of the wdca. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission, which affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-6\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\"> He alleges subsequent injury dates in 1986 and 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\"> At oral argument before the Court of Appeals, Oxley\u2019s counsel acknowledged that while Oxley was entitled to federal worker\u2019s compensation benefits, he had not pursued them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> Section 161(l)(a) states in pertinent part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\"> In the proceedings below and in the parties\u2019 arguments here, the issue has been articulated as Oxley\u2019s eligibility to pursue Michigan wdca benefits under \u00a7 161(l)(a). However, the analysis involves consideration of what work Oxley was engaged in when he sustained his injuries. Accordingly, MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1), which states in pertinent part, \u201c[a]n employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act,\u201d is also implicated. We recognize that \u00a7 301 thus bears on the issue whether Oxley is eligible to pursue wdca benefits; however, for ease of reference, we will frame the issue as whether he is a covered employee \u201cunder \u00a7 161(l)(a)\u201d throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b628-5\"> 32 USC 709(c) and (d) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">(c) The Secretary concerned shall designate the adjutants general referred to in section 314 of this title, to employ and administer the technicians authorized by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">(d) A technician employed under subsection (a) is an employee of the Department of Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\"> We note that the only issue presently before the Court is Oxley\u2019s eligibility to pursue such benefits; whether he can demonstrate the requisite causation, i.e., that his injuries arose \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d his employment, to entitle him to benefits under the wdca is a separate issue, not yet addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\"> As a point of clarification, we reiterate that <em>Tulppo </em>did not involve a claimant injured in the course of any National Guard duties. The <em>Tulppo </em>Court nonetheless stated that a National Guard member injured in the course of federal or state service was limited to compensation benefits available under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act or the Michigan Military Act, respectively. 207 Mich App 285. Here, the wcac relied on this statement as an additional indication that Oxley was not entitled to pursue Michigan worker\u2019s compensation benefits. The Court of Appeals correctly observed that this statement of the <em>Tulppo </em>Court was dictum. 227 Mich App 534-535.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\"> We note that the <em>Gregory </em>court assumed, without deciding, that a technician\u2019s retaliation-based hostile work environment claim was justiciable under title vn, which suggests that technicians\u2019 civilian status can be separated from their military status with respect to such a claim. However, it concluded that the plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding retaliation. 153 F2d 1075.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\"> We note that in other cases, where it is unclear whose service an employee was in at the time an injury was incurred, Michigan\u2019s rule disfavoring double recovery may come into play.

However, the case at bar does not present this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> We are aware that <em>American Federation of Government Employees, supra, </em>concluded that 32 USC 709 made technicians \u201cnominal\u201d federal employees for the limited purpose of fringe and retirement benefits and coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act. 235 US App DC 105-106. However, the language of 32 USC 709(d) does not so limit a technician\u2019s federal employee status. Moreover, worker\u2019s compensation benefits may be reasonably categorized as \u201cfringe benefits\u201d because they are \u201c[s]ide, non-wage benefits which accompany or are in addition to a person\u2019s employment ....\u2019\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 667. Therefore, even under <em>American Federation of Government Employees </em>gloss on 32 USC 709(d), technicians are federal employees for purposes of fringe benefits, including worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b637-7\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s analysis of the issues presented in this case. In order to conclude that plaintiff was not a state employee, the majority artificially divides plaintiff\u2019s employment into two not necessarily distinct parts: civilian and military. It then concludes that the plaintiff is exclusively a federal employee when working as a civilian and that his injuries arose out of his civilian employment. Consequently, he is not entitled to state worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">I do not subscribe to the civilian-military dichotomy. I would hold that, although the National Guard Technician Act of 1968 (the Technician Act) conferred nominal federal employment status upon National Guard technicians, such technicians are also state employees for purposes of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. Additionally, I would hold that, applying the economic reality test, an employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>relationship existed between the state of Michigan and plaintiff for purposes of the worker\u2019s compensation statute. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The National Guard \u201coccupies a distinct role in the federal structure that does not fit neatly within the scope of either state or national concerns.\u201d <em>Knutson v Wisconsin Air Nat\u2019l Guard, </em>995 F2d 765, 767 (CA 7, 1993). It is a hybrid organization that serves, in times of need, both the federal government and the state within which it is located. \u201c[T]he Guard may serve the state in times of civil strife within its borders while also being available for federal service during national emergencies.\u201d <em>Id.-, </em>see also <em>New Jersey Air Nat\u2019l Guard v Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>677 F2d 276, 279 (CA 3, 1982). \u201cWithin each state the National Guard is a state agency, under state authority and control. At the same time, the activity, makeup, and function of the Guard is provided for, to a large extent, by federal law.\u201d <em>Bowen v Oistead, </em>125 F3d 800, 802, n 1 (CA 9, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The Governor and the Governor\u2019s appointed adjutant general command the guard in each state. 32 USC 314. The federal Defense Department, the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force, and the National Guard Bureau prescribe regulations and issue orders to organize, discipline, and govern the guard. 32 USC 310. States that fail to comply with federal regulations risk forfeiture of federal funds allocated to organize, equip, and arm state guards. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 101, 107, 108, 501; <em>Knutson, </em>995 F2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Every member of the state Air National Guard is also enlisted in a federal organization known as the Air National Guard of the United States (ANGUS), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>component of the Ready Reserves of the Armed Forces. The latter is activated when the guard is called into federal service. 10 USC 261, 269, 8079, 8261; 32 USC 101, 301; <em>Perpich v Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>496 US 334, 345-346; 110 S Ct 2418; 110 L Ed 2d 312 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The majority does not explain how or why plaintiffs position as a computer operator was not military-related. It simply assumes that the plaintiffs Michigan National Guard duties on the weekends were military in nature. Whereas, his technician job during the week, when he worked under the control of the state adjutant general, was exclusively civilian, lacking any military qualities or elements. However, in <em>Leistiko v Stone,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the capacity of National Guard technicians is \u201cirreducibly military in nature.\u201d On the basis of the record before us, it is reasonable to conclude that plaintiffs job, as a computer operator in the Air National Guard, primarily served the state of Michigan. See <em>Knutson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Unlike the majority, I find highly persuasive the interpretation of the Technician Act in <em>American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2953 v Federal Labor Relations Authority (AFGE), </em>235 US App DC 104, 113; 730 F2d 1534 (1984). The federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia explained the purpose of the Technician Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">The principal purpose of enacting the Technician Act was undoubtedly to provide a <em>retirement and fringe benefit plan for National Guard technicians. </em>Critics of the old sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tem complained that the failure of the prior law to provide a comprehensive retirement package acted as a drag on the Guard\u2019s efforts to recruit and retain a first-rate cadre of technicians. By providing nominal federal employment status to the technicians, the Act sought to cement their allegiance to their Guard careers. <em>[Id. </em>at 113.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The court held that the Technician Act made technicians \u201cnominal federal employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109. Congress added the federal employment status for the limited purpose of allowing such members to pursue retirement benefits and coverage under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 USC 1346, 2671-2680. The implication, of course, is that such employees were, and still are, primarily employees of their respective states.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\u201cThe employment, discipline and discharge of technicians remains completely with the state officials, and their day to day activities on the job are controlled at the state level.\u201d <em>AFGE, supra </em>at 108. Accordingly, I would hold that plaintiff always held the position as a state employee, as well as a nominal federal employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Likewise, applying the economic reality test, I conclude that plaintiff was primarily employed by the state. The majority correctly recites the appropriate test from <em>Kidder v Miller-Davis Co,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but erroneously concludes that plaintiff was exclusively a federal employee during the weekdays as a technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The <em>Kidder </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">[The economic reality test] examines a number of criteria including [1] control, [2] payment of wages, [3] hiring, firing, [and] the maintenance of discipline, and [4] common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>objective. These factors are viewed together in their entirety under a totality of the circumstances test. <em>[Id. </em>at 42.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The majority states that, because the state adjutant general acted as an agent of the federal government, the first factor compels a finding that plaintiff was a federal employee. In other words, the plaintiff was under the control of a federal agent. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the state adjutant general acted as a federal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The majority cites <em>Gilliam v Miller</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Leistiko v Stone</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to support its assertion that the state adjutant general is an agent of the federal government. I find the majority\u2019s reliance on both cases misplaced, because both are distinguishable from the case at issue. In Gilliam, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals simply stated that the Oregon Adjutant General acts as a federal agency for the limited purpose of determining whether the federal Administrative Procedures Act applies. The Ninth Circuit Court was not presented with the question before us, whether a National Guard technician is a federal or a state employee. Moreover, in <em>Leistiko, </em>there was no discussion about whether a state official acts as a federal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">I find compelling the fact that the Michigan Legislature created the office of the adjutant general. MCL 32.700; MSA 4.678(300). In fact, it vested our Governor with the authority to appoint the adjutant general. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of the adjutant general\u2019s duties is to act as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u201cliaison in the transaction of official business for the state . . . .\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Therefore, the Legislature intended the state adjutant general to be a state agent, not a federal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The state adjutant general has the authority to employ, command, and control the day-to-day activities of the technicians. Accordingly, plaintiff was in the control of the state. Likewise, the same analysis would apply to factor three of the test, because the state adjutant general is vested with the authority to hire, fire, and maintain discipline over plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">As to factor two, wages, it is undisputed that plaintiff received his wages from federal funds. However, in <em>Tulppo v Ontonagon Co,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals stated that federal funding is not dispositive as a factor to determine whether an employee is a state or federal employee. Thus, the fact that plaintiff was paid from federal funds does not carry great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Finally, as to factor four, common objective, the majority holds that plaintiffs work as a technician was part of the common objective of the federal government. However, the majority conveniently ignores the fact that a person enlisting in the National Guard takes an oath to defend not only the United States, but also the Constitution of the state of Michigan. MCL 32.625; MSA 4.678(225). This provides further support that plaintiff was both a state and a federal employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Factors one, three, and four favor a finding that plaintiff was employed by the state of Michigan. Therefore, I would conclude that plaintiffs employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ment was covered under \u00a7 161(l)(a). Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b643-4\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> 134 F3d 817, 820-821 (CA 6, 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\"> 455 Mich 25, 34; 564 NW2d 872 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b641-9\"> 973 F2d 760, 762 (CA 9, 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-10\"> <em>Supra </em>at 818.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\"> MCL 32.702; MSA 4.678(302).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"> MCL 32.710; MSA 4.678(310).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> 207 Mich App 277, 284; 523 NW2d 883 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
