We conclude that Act 374 neither imposes new activities nor increases the level of activities on local units. Further, because in 1978 and under Act 374, the state\u2019s only contribution to the activity at issue relates to the payment of judicial salaries, these matters are not subject to an analysis to determine whether Act 374 decreases the state\u2019s proportionate share of the necessary costs of the activities it requires of these two local units. We accordingly affirm in part and vacate in part the Court of Appeals opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">According to its title, Act 374 is designed to revise the organization and jurisdiction of the courts. It is an effort to reorganize the state trial courts and to provide a uniform funding mechanism. For purposes of these appeals, relevant features of Act 374 are that it abolishes Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court and merges it with the Third Circuit Court and that it makes the funding units\u2019 responsibilities for the funding of the Third Circuit and the 36th District Court consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>responsibilities of funding units of all other circuits and districts. Sections 9931, 8271, and 591. Specifically, Act 374 requires Detroit to fund 36th District Court and Wayne County to fund the newly reconstituted Third Circuit Court. Detroit and Wayne County contend that Act 374\u2019s imposition of these responsibilities violates the Headlee Amendment because it places funding obligations on them that they were not previously required to shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In both cases, the trial court held that Act 374 violated the Headlee Amendment. The cases were consolidated on appeal and the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Act 374 did not violate the Headlee Amendment. 228 Mich App 386; 579 NW2d 378 (1998). We granted leave to consider whether Act 374 violates the Headlee Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 457 Mich 884 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The relevant Headlee provision, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law: A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. The provision of this section shall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Drawing from this Court\u2019s previous decisions, the Court of Appeals aptly articulated the parameters of \u00a7 29 at 396-398:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-3\">The first sentence of this provision prohibits reduction of the state proportion of necessary costs with respect to the continuation of state-mandated activities or services. The second sentence requires the state to fund any additional necessary costs of newly mandated activities or services and increases in the level of such activities or services from the 1978 base year. This language does not guarantee that local units\u2019 spending levels will not increase from the 1978 level. Rather, the Headlee Amendment only guarantees that the state will not reduce its proportion of the necessary costs of existing activities or services, and that the state will pay entirely for necessary costs when it mandates new activities or services or to the extent the state increases the level of an existing activity or service. Increased levels of local spending attributable to other causes, e.g., inflation or the greater utilization of a program by the public, are not addressed by this provision of the Headlee Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArF\">The Michigan Supreme Court has interpreted \u00a7 29 to \u201c \u2018reflect an effort on the part of the voters to forestall any attempt by the Legislature to shift [fiscal] responsibilities to the local government ....\u2019\u201d <em>Schmidt v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>441 Mich 236, 250; 490 NW2d 584 (1992), quoting <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 379; 381 NW2d 662 (1985). The two sentences of \u00a7 29 \u201cmust be read together \u2018[b]ecause they were aimed at alleviation of two possible manifestations of the same voter concern ....\u2019\u201d <em>Schmidt, supra </em>at 251, quoting <em>Durant, supra </em>at 379. To make the necessary comparison between state aid provided during the Headlee Amendment base year (1978) and a later year at issue, the <em>Schmidt </em>Court considered, at length, three possible formulations: the \u201cstate-to-state\u201d formulation, the \u201clocal-to-local\u201d formulation, and the \u201cstate-to-local\u201d formulation. It ultimately adopted the \u201cstate-to-local\u201d formulation. This method involves comparing \u201cthe ratio of total state aid for a required activity to total necessary costs for the required activity in the base year . . . with the ratio of state aid to an individual local unit of government for the activity to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>necessary costs of that unit for the activity in the year of challenged funding.\u201d <em>Schmidt, supra </em>at 249. Under this formulation, \u201c[t]he state is obligated to afford each unit providing the activity or service the same proportion of funding that the state provided on a statewide basis in the year that the Headlee Amendment was ratified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250; see also <em>Durant v Michigan, </em>456 Mich 175, 187; 566 NW2d 272 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In <em>Schmidt, supra </em>at 252, this Court discussed the voters\u2019 intent in ratifying the Headlee Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">The state-to-local formulation satisfies the voters\u2019 intent in enacting the Headlee Amendment. When the voters ratified the Headlee Amendment, they sought to ensure that when the state mandates a program, funds are provided to the local government to pay for that program. The state-to-local method of calculating the state\u2019s obligation achieves the voters\u2019 desire to secure a minimum level of funding for the local government unit for mandatory programs and to link the mandating of programs with the necessity for taxing to pay for those programs. This approach also creates the appropriate balance between the state\u2019s desire for discretion in allocating funds and the desire of the local units of government for minimum funding. The state-to-local ratio provides a uniform allocation of resources for mandatory programs. The state is free to supplement that minimum funding on the basis of its perception of need, but the local government is guaranteed its proportionate share.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">After reiterating these principles, the Court of Appeals proceeded to make a Headlee Amendment analysis of Act 374. The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201ctrial court operations\u201d was the relevant activity or service under \u00a7 29. 228 Mich App 401-402. It found that Act 374 requires counties to fund the operation of the circuit courts, district units to fund the operation of district courts, and the state to fully fund circuit and district court judicial salaries. <em>Id. </em>at 402-403. It found that in 1978, state law mandated that local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>units fund and operate circuit and district courts and that the state subsidized a portion of judicial salaries. <em>Id. </em>at 405. It then concluded that Act 374 neither mandated new activities for local units nor increased the level of any activity required of local units. <em>Id. </em>Finally, it concluded that, despite incomplete information to perform the relevant equations, it was able to determine that Act 374 did not decrease the state-financed proportion of necessary costs of trial court operations to either Detroit or Wayne County from that provided on a statewide basis in 1978. <em>Id. </em>at 407-408.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On appeal here, the parties do not dispute the Court of Appeals findings regarding what Act 374 requires of local units and what state law required of local units in 1978 in terms of trial court operations. Rather, they dispute whether the Court of Appeals correctly identified the relevant activity under \u00a7 29 as \u201ctrial court operations.\u201d The parties\u2019 briefs and arguments before this Court suggest that these appeals turn on how the relevant activity is defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">However, there is an underlying issue that neither the parties nor the Court of Appeals explicitly addressed: what the proper frame of reference is for deciding whether a mandated activity constitutes a \u201cnew activity\u201d or \u201cincrease in the level of any activity.\u201d Resolution of this issue is important because \u00a7 29 distinguishes between the continuation of an activity mandated in 1978 and the imposition of a new activity or increase in the level of an activity. Section 29 prohibits the state from reducing its proportion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>necessary costs of <em>existing activities </em>while it requires the state to pay the increased necessary costs in full when it mandates <em>new activities </em>or mandates activities at an <em>increased level. </em>Specifically, the underlying question is: does \u00a7 29 address mandated activities that are new or required at an increased level from the perspective of a particular local unit or from the perspective of local units collectively? That is, is the second sentence of \u00a7 29 triggered by any mandate that requires a particular local unit to perform an activity that is new to it (or at an increased level) or only by a mandate that requires local units to perform an activity that the state did not previously require local units to perform (or at an increased level from that previously required of local units)? For ease of reference we will refer to the first option as \u201cthe broad interpretation\u201d (an activity is \u201cnew\u201d under \u00a7 29 merely if it is new to a particular unit) and the second option as \u201cthe narrow interpretation\u201d (an activity is \u201cnew\u201d under \u00a7 29 only if it is new to local units collectively, i.e., an activity the state did not previously require local units to perform).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In <em>Schmidt, </em>441 Mich 253, in the context of discussing the strengths of the state-to-local formulation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we offered two examples that shed light on this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">For example, if a district in existence in the base year was not providing a mandatory program when the Headlee Amendment took effect, this method would entitle the district to the same proportionate share as every other local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>unit that previously provided the programs. This formulation also simplifies funding where new districts are created by consolidation, or reorganization, or otherwise. If the newly organized district adds a program that was \u201cmandated\u201d when the Headlee Amendment took effect, any district providing the program is then entitled to the same proportionate share as every other unit providing the activity or service. Thus, the anomaly of funding at either zero or one hundred percent (pursuant to the second sentence of \u00a7 29) is avoided. New districts, like previously existing districts, would be entitled to the same proportionate share of state funding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">In both these examples, from the perspective of the particular unit, it might be argued that the state mandated a \u201cnew activity.\u201d But in both examples, this Court concluded that the particular local unit would not be entitled to one hundred percent funding as required under the second sentence of \u00a7 29 when the state imposes a \u201cnew activity.\u201d Rather, we concluded that these local units would only be entitled to the same proportionate share of state funding that other local units received for that activity. We concluded that these examples involved the simple continuation of an activity that the state required of local units in 1978, and did not impose on local units a new activity (or an increased level of activity), even though these particular local units had not previously performed these activities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In short, we adopted the narrow interpretation. Under the narrow interpretation of \u00a7 29, the relevant frame of reference is whether a mandated activity is new (or at an increased level) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>local units collectively. We thus concluded that the second sentence of \u00a7 29 is only triggered when the state mandates a new activity by requiring local units to perform an activity that the state did not require local units to perform in 1978 or when it increases the level of an activity from the level that it required local units to perform in 1978.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two corollaries flow from this conclusion: 1) a requirement that a particular local unit fund an activity that was locally funded in 1978 would not constitute a \u201cnew activity\u201d under \u00a7 29, regardless of whether the particular local unit previously funded this activity; and 2) a requirement that a particular local unit fund an activity at a level that was locally funded in 1978 would not constitute an \u201cincrease\u201d in the level of activity, regardless of whether the particular unit previously funded the activity at this level.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We acknowledge that these conclusions are drawn from examples in <em>Schmidt. </em>Examples in an opinion are, by definition, dicta. However, these examples are consistent with both the language of \u00a7 29 and this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Schmidt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The second sentence of \u00a7 29 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of <em>units </em>of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay <em>the unit </em>of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The use of the plural \u201cunits\u201d in the first phrase of this sentence indicates that the state is not to require activities that are new or at an increased level from the perspective of local units collectively. Of course, the use of the singular \u201cthe unit\u201d in the second phrase of this sentence indicates that the proper remedy for the imposition of such a new or increased activity is to pay the increased necessary costs to each particular unit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the initial question whether a statute mandates a new activity or an increased level of activity is to be answered by considering local units collectively, rather than a particular local unit, according to the plain meaning of the word \u201cunits\u201d in the first phrase of the second sentence of \u00a7 29. Thus, this Court\u2019s analysis of the two examples in <em>Schmidt </em>is consistent with the language of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Moreover, the principles underlying these examples clearly follow from our holding in <em>Schmidt </em>that \u201cthe voters intended neither to freeze legislative discretion nor to permit state government full discretion in its allocation of support for mandated activities or services\u201d and that only the state-to-local formulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u201cgives full effect to the language and advances the purposes that voters sought to achieve in ratifying the Headlee Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 249-250. Specifically, as noted above, we held that the state-to-local formulation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">creates the appropriate balance between the state\u2019s desire for discretion in allocating funds and the desire of the local units of government for minimum funding. The state-to-local ratio provides a uniform allocation of resources for mandatory programs. <em>[Id. </em>at 252.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Assessment of the broad and narrow interpretations of \u201cnew activity\u201d on the basis of these criteria\u2014 1) balancing state discretion in allocating funds and minimum funding guarantees for local units, and 2) uniform allocation of resources \u2014 demonstrates that only the narrow interpretation meets these dual purposes of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">First, we consider the effect of these competing inteipretations on the goal of not freezing legislative discretion. In <em>Schmidt, </em>we discussed several ways that the Headlee Amendment limits the state\u2019s discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">First, it expresses the desire to prohibit the state from requiring new or expanded activities without fully funding them. . . . Second, the language evidences a purpose of preventing the state from reducing \u201cthe proportion of state spending in the form of aid to local governments.\u201d . . . Finally, the language embodies an antishifting purpose that prevents the state from shifting \u201cthe tax burden to local government.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 254, quoting Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">We reiterated that the two sentences of \u00a7 29 must be read together and that they \u201c \u2018clearly reflect an effort on the part of the voters to forestall any attempt by the Legislature to shift responsibility for services to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the local government, once its revenues were limited by the Headlee Amendment, in order to save the money it would have had to use to provide the services itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, quoting <em>Durant, supra, </em>424 Mich 379. Similarly, in <em>Livingston Co v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; Budget, </em>430 Mich 635, 644; 425 NW2d 65 (1988), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">[The Headlee Amendment\u2019s overall] plan is quite obvious. Having placed a limit on state spending, it was necessary to keep the state from creating loopholes either by shifting more programs to units of local government without the funds to carry them out, or by reducing the state\u2019s proportion of spending for \u201crequired\u201d programs in effect at the time the Headlee Amendment was ratified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We further suggested that legislative changes that do not create such loopholes do not implicate the Headlee Amendment. For example, we held, at 645:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">While the state can, and sometimes does, mandate higher standards, benefits, and so forth, it does not necessarily profit from increasing these standards, and, therefore, the kind of escape hatch for the state that the Headlee Amendment was intended to head off is not created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">These holdings indicate that \u00a7 29 primarily addresses shifts from the state to local units. With respect to shifts of responsibility among local units, \u00a7 29 only guarantees that each local unit will receive the state-financed proportion of funding provided on a statewide basis in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The Headlee Amendment simply does not speak to all potential shortcomings of funding statutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>extent that the Headlee Amendment does not address perceived inequities of statutes, parties may seek relief through the political process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">These authorities indicate that the intended limitations of \u00a7 29 on the state\u2019s discretion do not include requiring the state to fully fund an activity that was locally funded in 1978, but is later imposed on a different local unit. The broad interpretation would result in the imposition of such a requirement and would therefore limit the Legislature\u2019s discretion beyond that intended by the Headlee Amendment. The narrow interpretation is consistent with \u00a7 29\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>focus on shifts from the state to local units and does not similarly hamper the Legislature\u2019s discretion in ways not envisioned by the Headlee Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The intent to assure minimum funding at 1978 levels would be met by either interpretation. Under the narrow interpretation, a local unit required to assume funding for an activity it previously did not fund, but which local units were required to fund in 1978, would receive the state-financed proportion provided in 1978. Under the broad interpretation, a local unit required to assume funding for an activity that it previously did not fund would receive one hundred percent state funding, even though the activity was locally funded in 1978 and other local units funding the same activity are guaranteed only the state-financed proportion provided in 1978. <em>Minimum </em>funding is guaranteed under both these readings of \u00a7 29; however, the broad interpretation is obviously more advantageous to the particular local unit because it would go beyond providing minimum funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In light of these observations, we next consider the intended <em>balance </em>between the dual goals of a) preserving the Legislature\u2019s ability to enact necessary and desirable legislation in response to changing times and conditions and b) guaranteeing a predictable level of minimum funding. The broad interpretation defeats the first goal by placing limitations on legislative discretion beyond those imposed by \u00a7 29, and distorts the second goal by providing in some cases full state funding where \u00a7 29 guarantees only the state-financed proportion provided in 1978. The broad interpretation would therefore undermine the intended balance of these dual goals. The narrow interpretation, in contrast, is consistent with both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>\u00a7 29\u2019s focus on shifts from the state to local units and \u00a7 29\u2019s guarantee of minimum funding. Therefore, only the narrow interpretation of \u00a7 29 honors the intended balance between legislative discretion and guaranteed minimum funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Further, the broad interpretation clearly undermines the intent to provide a uniform allocation of resources. Under the broad interpretation, two local units providing the same activity could receive widely different amounts of state funding depending on whether the unit performed the activity in 1978 (in which case it would receive the state-financed proportion provided in 1978) or was only later assigned the activity (in which case it would receive one hundred percent state funding). The narrow interpretation of \u00a7 29 would not create such friction-producing funding anomalies. Under the narrow interpretation, with respect to activities that the state required local units to perform in 1978,' any local unit required to perform that activity is entitled to the same state proportion of funding that was provided in 1978. Thus, only the narrow interpretation would further the goal of uniform allocation of state resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">For these reasons, we hereby adopt the narrow interpretation. We hold that the second sentence of \u00a7 29 is only triggered by a mandate that requires local units to perform an activity that the state previously did not require local units to perform or at an increased level from that previously required of local units.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In applying this holding, we again note that the parties do not dispute the Court of Appeals findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>regarding what Act 374 requires of local units and what state law required of local units in 1978 in terms of trial court operations. We agree with the Court of Appeals analysis of these issues and hereby adopt the following portion of its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">Act 374, \u00a7 9931 abolishes the Recorder\u2019s Court<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and merges it with the Third Circuit Court effective October 1, 1997. Act 374, \u00a7 591 requires the county board of commissioners in each county to annually appropriate funds for the operation of the circuit court in that county. Act 374, \u00a7 555 requires the state to pay the salary of circuit judges and to reimburse the county if it pays an additional salary within prescribed limitations. Act 374, \u00a7 8271 requires the governing body of each district funding unit to annually appropriate funds for the operation of the district court in that district. Act 374, \u00a7 8104 also requires district funding units to finance and operate the district courts. Act 374, \u00a7 8202 requires the state to pay the salary of district judges and to reimburse the local unit if it pays an additional salary within prescribed limitations. Accordingly, under Act 374, the state mandates that counties pay for the operation of the circuit courts, that district units pay for the operation of the district courts, and that the state pay circuit court and district court judicial salaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">A Headlee Amendment analysis next requires that we compare this with the operation of trial courts in 1978 \u2014 the Headlee Amendment base year. In <em>Grand Traverse Co v Michigan, </em>450 Mich 457, 473-474; 538 NW2d 1 (1995), the Michigan Supreme Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">\u201cDespite the fact that the courts have always been regarded as part of state government, they have operated historically on local funds and resources.

Rather, as set forth above, a number of statutes addressing particular aspects of trial court operations clearly implied that local units were to fund trial courts. The mosaic of these various statutes, and the strong tradition of local funding of trial courts recognized in case law, demonstrates that state law effectively mandated that local units fund trial courts in 1978.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that in 1978 state law mandated that local units fund trial courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The state contends that complete financial records from the pre-Headlee Amendment period are not available; however, it is apparently undisputed that the state\u2019s only contribution to trial court operations in 1978 was with respect to a portion of judicial salaries.

[228 Mich App 402-405.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">These findings \u2014 that, both in 1978 and under Act 374, local units were required to fund trial court operations as a whole with the exception of judicial salaries<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 compel the conclusion that Act 374 neither mandates new activities nor increases the level of activities relating to trial court operations. Act 374 does not require any new or increased activities of local units. Rather, it simply requires the two units at issue to do what the state required every local unit to do in 1978: fund the local district or circuit court, except for the portion of judicial salaries paid by the state. The conclusion that Act 374 does not mandate any new or increased activities holds regardless of whether we define the relevant activity as \u201ctrial court operations\u201d or by more specific categories because local units funded trial court operations as a whole (with the exception of judicial salaries) in 1978. That is, even if we were to separately consider the more specific activities included in \u201ctrial court operations,\u201d each activity required under Act 374 was required of local units in 1978. Therefore, Act 374\u2019s imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>such activities on local units would not constitute a new activity or increase in activity required of local units, even if a particular local unit had not previously performed it. Accordingly, for purposes of applying the second sentence of \u00a7 29 we need not decide whether the Court of Appeals properly identified the relevant activity as \u201ctrial court operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Ordinarily, for purposes of the first sentence of \u00a7 29 \u2014 determining whether the state has reduced the state-financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing state-mandated activity \u2014 it would be necessary to identify the relevant activity. Here, however, it is undisputed that, in 1978 and under Act 374, the state\u2019s only contribution to the activity at issue relates to payment of judicial salaries. The final sentence of \u00a7 29 states that it \u201cshall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 18 governs judicial salaries. Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 29\u2019s final sentence, the state\u2019s only contribution to the activity at issue, however defined, is not subject to an analysis under the first sentence of \u00a7 29 to determine if Act 374 decreases the state\u2019s proportionate share of the necessary costs of the activities that it mandates.

Were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>these scenarios to occur, under our approach, the state would have to provide its proportion of the necessary costs to the local unit for these continuing activities (under the state-to-local formulation), but it would not have to fully fund them as \u201cnew\u201d activities. If such legislation were to pass, and were perceived to be unfair, there would surely be, as Chief Justice Cavanagh suggested in his dissent in <em>Schmidt, </em>a political price to pay. 441 Mich 280.

Because the language of \u00a7 29, its underlying purpose, and our opinion in <em>Schmidt </em>all belie the majority\u2019s contentions, I respectfully dissent. I would hold that the Headlee Amendment obligations contained in the second sentence of \u00a7 29 run from the state to each unit of local government individually. I would also hold that the Court of Appeals erred in defining the relevant activity or service at issue in this case as \u201ctrial court operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">I. THE LANGUAGE OF CONST 1963, ART 9, \u00a7 29</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The starting point for any constitutional analysis is the language of the constitution itself. The primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>rule of constitutional construction is that of the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of the voters approving the constitution. The rule has been described by Justice Cooley as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">A constitution is made for the people and by the people. The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. \u201cFor as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, <em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u201d <em>[Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), quoting Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, p 81 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Moreover, the Court must give force to all the words used in a constitutional provision. \u201cNeither the legislature, nor this Court, has any right to amend or change a provision. in the Constitution.\u201d <em>Pillon v Attorney General, </em>345 Mich 536, 547; 77 NW2d 257 (1956). Thus, the Court must avoid any construction that would invalidate portions of the language used in the provision under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Unfortunately, the majority has strayed from these time honored rules of construction. The majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe relevant frame of reference [under the second sentence of \u00a7 29] is whether a mandated activity is new (or at an increased level) to local units collectively,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 599-600, is contradicted by the specific language of the second sentence:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay <em>the unit of Local Government </em>for any necessary increased costs. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The italicized portion of this sentence explicitly refers to local unit in the singular. This use of the singular \u201csuggests that the section was intended to impose an obligation on the state vis-a-vis <em>each unit of local government </em>with respect to mandated activities or services as well as new requirements.\u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>441 Mich 251 (emphasis added). The Court addressed this very issue in <em>Schmidt:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">The first sentence [of art 9, \u00a7 29] focuses on a single proportionate obligation by the state measured during the base year, i.e., the year that the Headlee Amendment became effective. The only language in \u00a7 29 that speaks directly to payment occurs in the second sentence, which requires a \u201cstate appropriation ... to pay <em>the </em>unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language references a singular unit and a singular governmental body. It suggests that the framers intended, and the voters understood, that the state\u2019s obligation ran to each unit of local government. <em>[Id.][</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The majority believes that \u201c[t]he use of the plural \u2018units\u2019 in the first phrase of this sentence indicates that the state is not to require activities that are new or at an increased level from the perspective of local units collectively.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 601. However, such a reading of \u00a7 29 does not comport with the common understanding of the terms selected by the drafters and ratified by the public. To reiterate, the second sentence of \u00a7 29 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>A new activity or service of an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Read in the context of the entire sentence, the use of the plural \u201cunits\u201d in the first part of the sentence is merely a recognition that there are a variety of different units of local government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unlike the singular state government, there are different units of local government, including those governing cities, counties, townships, school districts, and the like. Indeed, to read the reference to \u201cunits\u201d any other way would require one to effectively ignore other language appearing in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Section 29 requires in part that the state pay for \u201can increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law . . . .\u201d However, the majority\u2019s interpretation effectively eliminates the verbiage. Under its analysis, it does not seem possible for a locality to recover for an \u201cincreased\u201d obligation foisted on it by the state. If the required activity has already been undertaken by the collective local gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>emments in the past, \u201c\u00a7 29 only guarantees that each local unit will receive the state-financed proportion of funding provided on a statewide basis in 1978.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 603. Therefore, even if the city of Detroit\u2019s expenses increased tenfold because of the court reorganization plan, the city would not be able to recover \u201cfor any necessary increased costs\u201d apart from the percentage the state was already paying before 1978. In other words, there is never an \u201cincrease\u201d in an activity; rather, there is only a change in the proportionate share required by the state. This approach is simply incompatible with the specific language of \u00a7 29, and it violates the rule of constitutional construction that we must give force to the actual language of the constitutional provision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In sum, I believe the majority\u2019s interpretation of the second sentence of \u00a7 29 strays from the actual text of the sentence. Its interpretation gives the word \u201cunits\u201d exactly the \u201cdark or abstruse meaning\u201d that Justice Cooley warned against. Moreover, it seems to ignore the language pertaining to an \u201cincrease\u201d in a required activity or service.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>n. THE PURPOSE OF CONST 1963, ART 9, \u00a7 29</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Not only do I find the majority\u2019s interpretation contrary to the language of \u00a7 29,1 also find it contrary to the purposes underlying the Headlee Amendment. The Court has previously recognized that the Headlee Amendment was proposed as part of a nationwide \u201ctaxpayer revolt.\u201d <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 378; 381 NW2d 662 (1985). The amendment was intended to prohibit unfunded mandates so that the state could not require new or expanded activities of local units without fully funding them. <em>Id. </em>at 391. In order to effectuate this intent, \u00a7 29 was designed to prohibit the state from shifting the costs of activities or services required by state law to various units of local government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">Having placed a limit on state spending, it was necessary to keep the state from creating loopholes either by shifting more programs to units of local government without the funds to carry them out, or by reducing the state\u2019s proportion of spending for \u201crequired\u201d programs in effect at the time the Headlee Amendment was ratified. <em>[Livingston Co v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; Budget, </em>430 Mich 635, 644; 425 NW2d 65 (1988).][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Unfortunately, however, the majority\u2019s analysis would allow the state to shift certain activities or services to local governments with no financial consequences. As long as some unit of local government undertook a particular activity or service in 1978, then the state would be able to require any or all other units of local government to undertake the task without providing any additional funding for this new mandate. For example, the state could require that every locality establish a separate \u201cRecorder\u2019s Court\u201d for criminal prosecutions. Although this separate recorder\u2019s court would be new to every locality except the city of Detroit, the majority\u2019s analysis would not require the state to fund any of these new courts, since a single recorder\u2019s court existed in the city of Detroit in 1978. Allowing the state to foist such an unfunded mandate on localities is, without question, diametrically opposed to the purpose behind Headlee.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Even so, the majority argues that it is reading \u00a7 29 in a way that is consistent with the purposes of Headlee. In particular, it argues that its interpretation meets the underlying purposes of \u201c1) balancing state discretion in allocating funds and minimum funding guarantees for local units, and 2) uniform allocation of resources . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 602. Assuming for sake of argument that these are the most significant purposes underlying \u00a7 29, I believe that the majority\u2019s approach gives wide latitude to the state to require localities to undertake services that they have never undertaken before.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As mentioned above, as long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>some localities were undertaking the service in 1978, the state can require other localities to undertake the same function without providing funding for the new activity. More importantly, it allows the state to shift responsibilities between different units of local government so that resources axe not distributed uniformly. For example, the state could shift a variety of activities formerly performed by several different units of local government to a single unit of local government, while only paying for a portion of the new cost to the locality. The single unit of government would have to shoulder the financial burden of all these new activities while the other units of local government would be alleviated of the financial burden accompanying the activity. In other words, some units of local government would receive a windfall at the expense of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">For these reasons, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s reasoning. I believe that the state\u2019s obligations under the second sentence of \u00a7 29 flow to each individual unit of local government and not local governments in the collective. Therefore, I would hold that, if the state should mandate a program shift from one local unit to another, that program is \u201cnew\u201d to the unit that must now provide the activity. The local unit is entitled to an appropriation for any necessary increased costs as a result of the switch. Similarly, if the state should mandate a program shift from one local unit to another that requires the unit to provide a greater level of an activity than the unit already provides, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>unit is likewise entitled to a state appropriation for any necessary increased costs resulting from the program shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Does this impose significant restrictions on state government? Does this, time and again, thwart the state\u2019s ability to enact good public policy? The obvious answer to each question is \u201cyes.\u201d That, however, is the result, intended or unintended, of the Headlee Amendment that Michigan voters adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">in. THE RELEVANT ACTIVITY OR SERVICE</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Examining Act 374 from the standpoint of the individual units of local government involved in this case, I believe that the court reorganization mandated by the act does violate the Headlee Amendment. While I believe that the Court of Appeals properly viewed this case from the perspective of the individual units of local government rather than local governments in the collective, I believe it erred in defining the relevant activity or service in this case as \u201ctrial court operations.\u201d Rather, I believe the relevant activities or services in this case are \u201cformer Common Pleas Court functions\u201d and \u201cformer Recorder\u2019s Court functions.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The Court of Appeals holding is aptly summarized by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201ctrial court operations\u201d was the relevant activity or service under \u00a7 29. 228 Mich App [386] 401-402 [579 NW2d 378 (1998)]. It found that Act 374 requires counties to fund the operation of the circuit courts, district units to fund the operation of district courts, and the state to fully fund circuit and district court judicial salaries. <em>Id. </em>at 402-403. It found that in 1978, state law mandated that local units fund and operate circuit and district courts and that the state subsidized a portion of judicial salaries. <em>Id. </em>at 405. It then concluded that Act 374 neither mandated new activities for local units nor increased the level of any activity required of local units. <em>Id. </em>Finally, it concluded that, despite incomplete information to perform the relevant equations, it was able to determine that Act 374 did not decrease the state-financed proportion of necessary costs of trial court operations to either Detroit or Wayne County from that provided on a statewide basis in 1978. <em>Id. </em>at 407-408. <em>[Ante </em>at 596-597.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">However, defining the relevant activity or service in question as \u201ctrial court operations\u201d is simply too broad a category. First, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Headlee Amendment clearly indicate that the people of Michigan intended the word \u201cactivity\u201d to apply to more specific functions than the umbrella term \u201ctrial court operations.\u201d A primary aim of those who ratified the Headlee Amendment was to prevent the state from enacting laws and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>regulations that create financial burdens on local units, unaccompanied by financial support to alleviate those burdens. <em>Schmidt, </em>441 Mich 251. If all trial court functions fall under the broad category of \u201ctrial court operations,\u201d the state is free to impose a multitude of laws and regulations on a local unit without an appropriation for the resulting increased costs. To accept the Court of Appeals definition would create a situation in which a local unit can be depicted as having provided practically any activity in 1978, thereby precluding a finding that a \u201cnew\u201d activity had been imposed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This construction effectively nullifies the second sentence of the amendment. The people, in adopting the Headlee Amendment, did not intend to offer so little protection against the very problem that they aimed to prevent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Moreover, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Durant </em>reflects that the proffered definition is too broad. In <em>Durant, </em>one issue presented to the Court was whether education, as a whole, is a state-mandated \u201cactivity\u201d within the meaning of the Headlee Amendment. Plaintiffs attempted to characterize the relevant activity as \u201ceducation.\u201d They argued that because the state has delegated to local school districts the duty to provide education, all the functions performed by a school district are required by state law within the meaning of the Headlee Amendment. The Court rejected this reasoning and held that \u00a7 29 applies only to <em>specific </em>requirements imposed on the school districts by state statutes and state agencies. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">By analogy, just as \u201ceducation\u201d is too broad a concept for a Headlee examination, so too is the broad concept of \u201ctrial court operations.\u201d The Court of Appeals reviewed the statutory delineations of various educational functions in order to determine if the activities were specific and identifiable. We should similarly examine the statutory delineations of trial court functions. For example, the Common Pleas Court (the predecessor of the 36th District Court) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>was a distinct judicial entity, established and operated pursuant to 1929 PA 260 and vested with specific judicial authority different from any other court in Wayne County. The same can be said of Recorder\u2019s Court. Thus, it is logical to define the relevant activity by the statutory parameters set for its delivery. To define the activities as \u201cformer Common Pleas Court functions\u201d and \u201cformer Recorder\u2019s Court functions\u201d comports with the purpose and intent of the Headlee Amendment as well as the applicable case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Thus, I would hold that the relevant activities or services in this case are \u201cformer Common Pleas Court functions\u201d and \u201cformer Recorder\u2019s Court functions.\u201d Such a holding would provide the level of specificity required by the Headlee Amendment. Viewing the relevant activities or services as such, I would find that Act 374 violates \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment by requiring the city of Detroit to undertake the new or increased responsibility for \u201cformer Common Pleas Court functions,\u201d and Wayne County for undertaking the new or increased responsibility for \u201cformer Recorder\u2019s Court functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The majority finds no Headlee violation in this case by examining units of local government in the collective for purposes of determining whether the state has required them to undertake \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cincreased\u201d activities. However, I believe such an approach is simply inconsistent with the language and purpose of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29. Act 374 requires that the city of Detroit provide \u201cformer Common Pleas functions\u201d and that Wayne County provide \u201cformer Recorder\u2019s Court functions.\u201d These activities were previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>performed by other units of local government. Nevertheless, I believe that the state\u2019s funding obligation under the Headlee Amendment is implicated because the activities are \u201cnew\u201d to these particular units of local government. Consequently, the state should be required to make appropriations for any necessary increased costs resulting from the requirements of Act 374.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-4\">Brickley and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\"> The first sentence of the majority opinion in <em>Schmidt </em>explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he question presented is the proper interpretation of the <em>first </em>sentence of \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment . . . .\u201d 441 Mich 241 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> The complete language of \u00a7 29 is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A14F\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.

The provision of this section shall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\"> Ironically, the majority examines certain examples from the <em>Schmidt </em>opinion, but it ignores the remainder of the opinion\u2019s logic, which, in discussing the first sentence of \u00a7 29, repudiates the exact view that is adopted by the majority. See <em>id. </em>at 259-260 (\u201c[T]he statewide approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>permits the state to shift funding from some districts to others while still requiring those districts to carry out mandated programs. This separation of the taxing question from the programing question is contrary to one of the primary purposes of the Headlee Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The idea that the second sentence should be approached from the perspective of an individual unit of local government was also clearly expressed in both of the <em>Schmidt </em>dissents. In my own dissent, I explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">In a noteworthy contrast, the second sentence of \u00a7 29, dealing with state financing of new or increased state-required activities or services, refers to \u201cunit of Local Government\u201d in the singular, by way of prohibiting the state from adding new program obligations or increasing the level of existing program obligations on local governments, \u201cunless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs.\u201d . . . [I]t is entirely logical for the requirements of the second sentence of \u00a7 29 to apply on a local unit basis. The essence of the second sentence is to require that <em>all </em>new, increased costs resulting from new or increased state program requirements be one hundred percent funded by the state. This could not occur unless every unit\u2019s increased costs in that regard were funded one hundred percent. <em>[Id. </em>at 266, n 2, (opinion of Cavanagh, C.J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Justice Levin\u2019s dissent also came to a similar conclusion, albeit for a different reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">The phrase \u201ctaken as a group\u201d set forth in \u00a7 30 does not appear in \u00a7 29; for purposes of \u00a7 29, units of local government are not to be taken as a group. <em>[Id. </em>at 291, n 21.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Thus, it seems the only thing that seven justices could agree on in <em>Schmidt </em>was that the second sentence required consideration from the perspective of <em>each individual unit </em>of local government. I believe this clear consensus undermines any reliance on <em>Schmidt </em>by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\"> The language of the second sentence of \u00a7 29 is in notable contrast with that of \u00a7 30 of the Headlee Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">The proportion of total state spending paid to all units of Local Government, <em>taken as a group, </em>shall not be reduced below that proportion in effect in fiscal year 1978-79. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">If the drafters had meant for the second sentence to apply to units of local governments collectively, they could have made \u00a7 29 abundantly clear by adding the modifying phrase \u201ctaken as a group\u201d after units of local government, just as they did in \u00a7 30. See <em>Schmidt, </em>441 Mich 272-273 (Cavanagh, C.J., dissenting) (adding the words \u201ctaken as a group\u201d after \u201cunits of local government\u201d would have suggested \u201cthat only activities or services required of <em>all </em>units of local government were implicated\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> Moreover, the second sentence of \u00a7 29 specifically requires the state to pay an individual unit of local government \u201cfor <em>any </em>necessary increased costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This is in direct contrast with the first sentence, which prohibits the state from reducing its <em>\u201cproportion </em>of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.\u201d However, the majority requires that the state only pay for a proportion of the necessary cost of any increase in an expense resulting from a shift in responsibilities among different units of local government. While I agree with the majority\u2019s quotation of <em>Schmidt </em>explaining that the two sentences of \u00a7 29 \u201c \u2018must be read together\u2019 \u201d when interpreting the meaning of those two sentences, <em>ante </em>at 598, n 2, that does not mean that the two sentences should be read as requiring the same thing. The two sentences should be consistent with one another, but they still provide distinct requirements on the state and cover different situations. Any other interpretation would render the second sentence merely surplusage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> The need for \u00a7 29\u2019s antishifting protections is underscored by \u00a7 31 of the Headlee Amendment, which specifically limits a local unit of government\u2019s ability to raise revenue for any new or expanded activities. In particular, \u00a7 31 does not allow a locality to raise property or other local taxes \u201cwithout the approval of a majority of the qualified electors.\u201d See <em>Bolt v City of Lansing, </em>459 Mich 152; 587 NW2d 264 (1998). Thus, Headlee\u2019s antishifting purpose, embodied in \u00a7 29, is critical to prevent the state government from requiring new or increased activities of a locality without giving the locality the means to pay for that new mandate. Otherwise, the local government would be forced into the Hobson\u2019s choice of trying to convince its constituency to approve by referendum a tax increase to pay for the unfunded state mandate, or to cut other areas of the locality\u2019s budget to pay for the mandate. Either choice is not likely to be popular with the voting public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> It is worth noting that both these underlying principles come from <em>Schmidt, </em>which dealt with the first sentence of \u00a7 29. Since the first sentence requires that the state continue to fund its <em>proportionate </em>share of preexisting state mandates, it certainly makes sense that the Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>concerned about \u201cminimum funding guarantees for local units\u201d and \u201cuniform allocation of resources.\" However, the second sentence requires funding for <em>all </em>new or increased activities. Thus, it is questionable whether these underlying purposes identified in <em>Schmidt </em>should apply to the second sentence of \u00a7 29 at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\"> In 1978, the three trial courts located within Wayne County were organized differently than trial courts in other counties in the state of Michigan. In most Michigan counties there existed a district court and a circuit court. In Wayne County, there existed Recorder\u2019s Court, the Common Pleas Court, and the Third Circuit Court. Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court jurisdiction included felony, misdemeanor, and traffic and ordinance violations arising within the city of Detroit. Additionally, the civil functions normally performed by a district court were performed by the Common Pleas Court. Its jurisdiction included civil disputes less than $10,000 and landlord-tenant disputes. The Third Circuit Court\u2019s organization and jurisdiction was the same as other circuit courts statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">In 1980, the Legislature enacted 1980 PA 438 and 440, reorganizing the three DetroitAVayne County trial courts. The acts created the 36th District Court and transferred to it the functions performed by the Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Court along with the criminal misdemeanor and traffic and ordinance divisions of Recorder\u2019s Court. The Common Pleas Court was abolished. However, Recorder\u2019s Court continued to have felony criminal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">It is worth noting that the Legislature conditioned the 1980 court reform legislation on the city of Detroit and Wayne County agreeing to assume responsibility for the expenses required of them by the court reform legislation. As a result of negotiations between the local units and the state, both the city and the county expressly waived any potential claims under the Headlee Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\"> For example, as plaintiffs argue, local units also have the obligation to provide education, prosecuting attorneys, police officers, fire protection, etc. Every new local mandate will, by definition, fall under one of these categories since these are only the broadly defined categories under which local units of government are vested with the power to act. To define the relevant activity in such a broad manner means that every new mandate would be determined for Headlee purposes to be merely a continuation of broader, preexisting activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> Further support is found in the definitions contained in the Headlee implementation statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201cActivity\u201d means a specific and identifiable administrative action of a local unit of government. The provision of a benefit for, or the protection of, public employees of a local unit of government is not an administrative action. [MCL 21.232(1); MSA 5.3194(602)(1).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">\u201cService\u201d means a specific and identifiable program of a local unit of government which is available to the general public or is provided for the citizens of the local unit of government. The provision of a benefit for, or the protection of, public employees of a local unit of government is not a program. [MCL 21.234(1); MSA 5.3194(604)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">These definitions reinforce the idea that the Court of Appeals characterization of the relevant activity as \u201ctrial court operations\u201d is too broad. Trial court functions as a whole have historically been broken down to specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>areas of jurisdictional authority. Thus, to characterize the activity or service that a local unit provides as \u201ctrial court services\u201d would do little to shed light on what the unit \u201cspecific[ally] and identifiabl[y]\u201d provides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 375. This portion of the decision affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals on remand, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">Only those specific and identifiable programs which the state requires the school districts to provide by state statute or state agency regulation fall within the state financing requirements of \u00a7 29. [129 Mich App 517, 528; 342 NW2d 591 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Examples of such state-mandated programs as stated in <em>Durant </em>are: courses in the constitution, history, government, and civics, courses in health and physical education, bilingual instruction in school districts with an enrollment of twenty or more children of limited English speaking ability, special education, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
