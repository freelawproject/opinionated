The trial court granted defendant Cone-Blanchard Machine Company\u2019s motion for summary disposition. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that summary disposition was improper. It concluded that the plaintiff established a prima facie case of continuity of enterprise sufficient to allow a products liability claim against Cone-Blanchard. It also concluded that the plaintiff had established facts sufficient to allow the claim of breach of duty to warn to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\">We reverse and hold that, because Cone-Blanchard\u2019s predecessor was available for recourse as witnessed by plaintiff\u2019s negotiated settlement with the predecessor for $500,000, the continuity of enterprise theory of successor liability is inapplicable. Further, plaintiff did not produce evidence sufficient to show a relationship between Cone-Blanchard and plaintiffs employer or that Cone-Blanchard was actually aware of the alleged design defect in the type of machine owned by plaintiff\u2019s employer. Thus, summary disposition was appropriate with regard to the claim of breach of duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">While operating a Conomatic feed screw machine on her job at defendant Seven Ranges, Inc., plaintiff\u2019s hair became ensnarled in the rapidly spinning and unguarded rod being processed by the machine. Her hair and scalp were tom from her head. Plaintiff sued Cone-Blanchard and Seven Ranges. She alleged that Cone-Blanchard was liable as the legal successor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Cone Automatic Machine Company (Cone I), the company that designed and manufactured the machine in 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Plaintiff specifically alleged a design or manufacturing defect on the ground that the machine contained no emergency shutoff button or other safety devices. She also alleged breach of warranty of fitness for intended purposes and breach of implied warranty of merchantability. Finally, she alleged that Cone-Blanchard breached its duty to warn of the known or reasonably suspected danger posed by operation of the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Defendant Cone-Blanchard filed a motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). Defendant argued that it could not be liable because it was not the manufacturer of the machine. Further, Cone-Blanchard argued that there was no continuity of enterprise between Cone I, the manufacturer, and itself that would support imposition of successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">In 1963, Pneumo Dynamics purchased Cone I by acquiring all its stock. Shortly thereafter, Cone I ceased operations and dissolved. Pneumo Dynamics formed Cone Automatic Machine Co, Inc. (Cone II). Cone II had no employees, assets, or place of business and existed solely to hold the Cone name. Pneumo Dynamics continued to manufacture the Conomatic line of machines through a wholly owned subsidiary, Pneumo Dynamics Machine Tool Group (pdmtg). Pdmtg included assets of the dissolved Cone I in addition to assets from two other machine companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">In 1972, Cone-Blanchard purchased the assets of PDMTG and the stock of Cone II from Pneumo Dynam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ics and, thereafter, continued the manufacture and design of the Conomatic line of screw machines. Pneumo Dynamics ceased designing and manufacturing the Conomatic line of screw machines, although it remained an active corporation. Pneumo Dynamics changed its name to Pneumo Abex Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\">The trial court granted defendant Cone-Blanchard\u2019s motion for summary disposition, determining that it was not a successor corporation for purposes of successor liability under <em>Turner v Bituminous Casualty Co, </em>397 Mich 406; 244 NW2d 873 (1976). The trial court also dismissed plaintiffs claim that Cone-Blanchard failed to warn of, alleged defects in the machine. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that plaintiff had established a question of fact concerning whether there was sufficient continuity of enterprise for successor liability and whether Cone-Blanchard had breached a duty to warn of the machine\u2019s alleged defects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a motion for summary disposition de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">CONTINUITY OF ENTERPRISE</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In <em>Turner, supra, </em>this Court held that a corporate successor may be liable for its predecessor\u2019s defective products if the totality of the acquisition demonstrates a basic continuity of the enterprise between the predecessor and successor corporations. Thus, under <em>Turner, </em>successor liability becomes an element of the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case of products liability. <em>Turner </em>was a departure from the traditional rule of nonliability for corporate successors who acquire the predecessor through a purchase of assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The traditional rule of successor liability examines the nature of the transaction between predecessor and successor corporations. If the acquisition is accomplished by merger, with shares of stock serving as consideration, the successor generally assumes all its predecessor\u2019s liabilities. However, where the purchase is accomplished by an exchange of cash for assets, the successor is not liable for its predecessor\u2019s liabilities unless one of five narrow exceptions applies. The five exceptions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">\u201c \u2018(1) where there is an express or implied assumption of liability; (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger; (3) where the transaction was fraudulent; (4) where some of the elements of a purchase in good faith were lacking, or where the transfer was without consideration and the creditors of the transferor were not provided for; or (5) where the transferee corporation was a mere continuation or reincarnation of the old corporation.\u2019 (19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Am Jur 2d, Corporations, \u00a7 1546, pp 922-924; <em>Malone v Red Top Cab Co, </em>16 Cal App 2d 268, 273 [60 P2d 543 (1936)].)\u201d <em>[Turner, supra </em>at 417, n 3, quoting <em>Schwartz v McGraw-Edison Co, </em>14 Cal App 3d 767; 92 Cal Rptr 776 (1971).[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-3\">The traditional rule reflects the general policy of the corporate contractual world that liabilities adhere to and follow the corporate entity. It serves to protect creditors and shareholders, to facilitate determination of tax responsibilities, and to promote free alienability of business assets. In the context of tort law, the traditional rule with its narrow exceptions has been criticized as an elevation of form over substance, that may leave victims of a defective product without recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">These policy concerns shaped this Court\u2019s expansion of the traditional rule in <em>Turner. </em>After examining the relevant policy concerns, this Court in <em>Turner </em>concluded that a continuity of enterprise between a successor and its predecessor may force a successor to \u201caccept the liability with the benefits\u201d of such continuity. <em>Id. </em>at 430. <em>Turner </em>held that a prima facie case of continuity of enterprise exists where the plaintiff establishes the following facts: (1) there is continuation of the seller corporation, so that there is a continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operations of the predecessor corporation; (2) the predecessor corporation ceases its ordinary business operations, liquidates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and dissolves as soon as legally and practically possible; and (3) the purchasing corporation assumes those liabilities and obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the selling corporation. <em>Turner </em>identified as an additional principle relevant to determining successor liability, whether the purchasing corporation holds itself out to the world as the effective continuation of the seller corporation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Application of <em>Turner </em>in this case is complicated by the fact that the manufacturer, Cone I, is twice removed from defendant Cone-Blanchard. In other words, Cone-Blanchard did not directly purchase Cone I. Rather, Cone I was purchased by Pneumo Dynamics. Pneumo Dynamics then continued manufacturing the Conomatic line of machines through its wholly owned subsidiary, pdmtg, and formed a new company, Cone II, for purposes of carrying on the Cone name. Cone-Blanchard purchased the assets of pdmtg and the stock of Cone II. It then took over the manufacture of Conomatic machines. We note at the outset, that the tertiary nature of the relationship between Cone I and Cone-Blanchard generally factors against a finding of continuity, but does not preclude it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Although in the appropriate case a tertiary successor might be liable for a manufacturer\u2019s defective product, we conclude, on the basis of our interpretation of <em>Turner, </em>that this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\">This case illustrates the limits of <em>Turner's </em>applicability. <em>Turner's </em>holding indicates that the \u201ccontinuity of enterprise\u201d doctrine applies only when the transferor is no longer viable and capable of being sued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\">In our analysis of the matter we must conclude at this point that in a products liability case where the corporation fabricating the injury-producing item changes corporate structure before injury and suit, as a matter of policy neither the victim nor the successor corporation has a different interest vis-a-vis the suit whatever the type of corporate metamorphosis \u2014 merger, de facto merger, or sale of assets for <em>cash </em>\u2014 so <em>long as the transferor corporation becomes defunct. [Id. </em>at 429 (emphasis added).][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The thrust of the decision in <em>Turner </em>was to provide a remedy to an injured plaintiff in those cases in which the first corporation \u201clegally and/or practically becomes defunct.\u201d <em>Turner, supra </em>at 419. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>Turner </em>Court reasoned that \u201cdistinctions between types of corporate transfers are wholly unmeaningful\u201d because the injured plaintiff \u201chas no place to turn for relief except to the second corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The underlying rationale for the <em>Turner </em>Court\u2019s decision to disregard traditional coiporate law principles was to provide a source of recovery for injured plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Pneumo Dynamics, now Pneumo Abex, continued on as an active coiporation after the transaction with Cone-Blanchard. While failure of the predecessor to dissolve may not be fatal in every action for successor liability, especially, for example, where the predecessor continues as a shell or is otherwise underfunded, the fact that a predecessor remains a viable source for recourse is. Certainly, where a plaintiff has in fact successfully pursued a remedy against a predecessor, the policy concerns that underscored the adoption of the continuity of enterprise theory in <em>Turner </em>simply are not present. Here, in light of the availability of Pneumo Abex to suit as evidence by plaintiff\u2019s $500,000 settlement with Pneumo Abex, <em>Turner </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">DUTY TO WARN</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">This Court has not previously addressed whether a successor coiporation has an independent duty to warn a third party of a predecessor\u2019s negligently designed and manufactured product.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Generally, \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>individual has no duty to protect another who is endangered by a third person\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Murdock v Higgins, </em>454 Mich 46, 54; 559 NW2d 639 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">Whether a duty exists is a question of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\">In determining whether to impose a duty, this Court evaluates factors such as: the relationship of the parties, the foreseeability of the harm, the burden on the defendant, and the nature of the risk presented. <em>[Id. </em>at 53.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We conclude that in certain circumstances a successor may have an independent duty to warn a predecessor\u2019s customer of defects in a predecessor\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Consistent with general negligence principles, a successor corporation\u2019s duty to warn a predecessor\u2019s customer of the predecessor\u2019s negligence requires a \u201c \u2018special relationship\u2019 either between the defendant and the victim, or the defendant and the third party who caused the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. The mere status of a defendant as a successor corporation is insufficient to create a duty to warn. See <em>Polius v Clark Equipment Co, </em>802 F2d 75, 84 (CA 3, 1986). Relevant indicia of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d include: a successor\u2019s actual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>constructive knowledge of a defect in its predecessor\u2019s product, a continuing relationship with the predecessor\u2019s customer, service agreements between the successor and the predecessor\u2019s customer relating to the machine in question, and evidence that the successor had actually serviced the machine in question. A successor\u2019s awareness of the location or present owner of a defective product is a logical predicate to liability. See <em>Travis v Harris Corp, </em>565 F2d 443, 449 (CA 7, 1977) (without knowledge of the machine\u2019s current location the successor has no one to warn).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Plaintiff contends that existence of <em>Flaugher v Cone Automatic Machine Co, </em>30 Ohio St 3d 60, 67; 507 NE2d 331 (1987), and a 1979 Texas lawsuit cited by the <em>Flaugher </em>case alleging similar injuries caused by Conomatic machines supports a finding that Cone-Blanchard had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged defect in the design of the Conomatic feed screw machine. While earlier lawsuits involving similar products and similar injuries might conceivably be sufficient to inform a successor of a defective product, <em>Flaugher </em>was summarily dismissed, and it was never established that the Conomatic product involved in that case was defective. Similarly, plaintiff presented no evidence that the machine involved in the Texas lawsuit was deemed defective. For these reasons, we conclude plaintiff cannot rely on the <em>Flaugher </em>and Texas cases as evidence of Cone-Blanchard\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of a defect in the particular machine at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">As to a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Cone I\u2019s customers, there is no evidence that Cone-Blanchard actually or by agreement serviced the machine in question. Plaintiff was able to establish that Cone-Blanchard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>had access to Cone I\u2019s customer lists and that her employer possessed a Cone-Blanchard business card on its premises. We conclude that while Cone-Blanchard may have solicited continuing business from Cone I\u2019s customers, such evidence alone is insufficient to support a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\">For these reasons we find that Cone-Blanchard did not have a duty to warn of alleged defects in the machine at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">\n<em>TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We hold that <em>Turner's </em>continuity of enterprise theory is inapplicable to the facts of this case: plaintiff has successfully pursued a remedy against Cone-Blanchard\u2019s predecessor. We further hold that the plaintiff has not established a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether defendant breached a duty to warn of the alleged defect in the Conomatic feed screw machine operated by plaintiff. Consequently, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-7\">Taylor, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Weaver, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-4\"> 221 Mich App 43; 560 NW2d 664 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-5\"> 457 Mich 866 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b787-6\"> In reviewing a motion for summary disposition brought under MCR 2.116(C)(10), a trial court considers affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence filed in the action or submitted by the parties, MCR 2.116(G)(5), in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. A trial court may grant a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) if the affidavits or other documentary evidence show that there is no genuine issue in respect to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Further, the defendant took over what had been the manufacturer\u2019s entire plant facilities, equipment, machinery, inventory and patents.

In <em>Turner, </em>this Court stated that \u201cthere may be a cause of action [for the plaintiff] where the totality of the transaction demonstrates a basic continuity of the enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. This statement demonstrates that <em>Turner's </em>continuity of enterprise doctrine does not simply seek to guarantee that the plaintiff has some source of recovery, nor is it based on principles of strict liability, as the majority apparently believes. Indeed, <em>Turner </em>has nothing to do with determining whether an injury was negligently inflicted. Rather, the test in <em>Turner </em>is designed to determine whether the company (or \u201centeiprise\u201d) involved in the lawsuit is essentially the same company that was allegedly negligent in designing or manufacturing the offending product.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In making this determination, the <em>Turner </em>Court recognized that a corporation is susceptible to changes in ownership and structure that simply cannot occur in the life of a human tortfeasor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 419-420. Thus, the <em>Turner </em>Court eschewed reliance upon the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>formalities of corporation law, and sought to determine, by examining the relevant criteria, whether the corporate defendant was, in essence, a continuation of the corporation that was allegedly negligent in designing or manufacturing the product at issue, or whether it was a stranger to the allegedly negligent corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 423-424, quoting <em>Ray v Alad Corp, </em>55 Cal App 3d 855; 127 Cal Rptr 817, 820 (1976) (\u201cdoes a manufacturer\u2019s responsibility for its defective products survive a change in ownership, where the manufacturing business, as such, maintains its identity and continues to operate as before \u2018at the same old stand\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\">We explained that the policy basis of this \u201ccontinuity of the enterprise\u201d requirement \u201c \u2018is that the enterprise, the going concern, ought to bear the liability for the damages done by its defective products.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner, supra </em>at 414, quoting <em>Shannon v Samuel Langston Co, </em>379 F Supp 797, 802 (WD Mich, 1974). We also reasoned that such an enterprise enjoys certain continuing benefits, such as goodwill and expertise, and therefore must also accept continuing responsibility for the costs that the enterprise has imposed on society through its negligence. <em>Turner </em>at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">This reasoning is not inconsistent with our insistence upon fault-based products liability theory in <em>Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, </em>421 Mich 670, 681; 365 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>176 (1985), where we stated that \u201c[w]hen the societal goal of holding manufacturers accountable for the safety of their products has been threatened by the interposition of technical rules of law, it has been the rules that have gradually given way.\u201d While it would be an aggressive version of strict liability that would hold a corporation hable for injuries caused by the defective product of a different corporation, <em>Turner </em>sought to answer a different question altogether: whether the defendant corporation was the same enterprise as the allegedly offending corporation, or a corporate stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The traditional rule of successor liability arose from technical rules of law \u201cdeveloped not in response to products liability problems, but largely in the areas of creditors\u2019 protection, . . . and of tax assessments, ... or, in the case of the de facto merger, in the context of shareholder rights.\u201d <em>Turner, supra </em>at 418. In <em>Turner, </em>we rejected reliance on these technical rules when deciding whether a defendant enterprise was, as a matter of practical fact, a mere continuation of the allegedly negligent enterprise. <em>Id. </em>at 426 (\u201c[T]o say Old Sheridan is a stranger to New Sheridan, and vice versa, is to honor form over substance. . . . Continuity is the purpose, continuity is the watchword, continuity is the fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">For these reasons, I cannot agree with the majority that <em>Turner's </em>applicability depends on whether there has already been a recovery in the case in question. Nor can I agree that <em>Turner's </em>reasoning was based on notions of strict liability. While many of the cases that <em>Turner </em>cited were strict liability cases, <em>Turner's </em>central rationale is consistent with this Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[w]hen the societal goal of holding manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>facturers accountable for the safety of their products has been threatened by the interposition of technical rules of law, it has been the rules that have gradually given way.\u201d <em>Prentis, supra </em>at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-3\">Because the question presented in this case is <em>who </em>is responsible for the alleged negligence, rather than <em>whether </em>there actually was negligence, I would hold that <em>Turner's </em>continuity of the enterprise test is the controlling test in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The Court in <em>Turner </em>adopted the following guidelines to determine if there was sufficient continuity between a successor corporation and its predecessor to justify imposing liability on the successor. \u201cIf there is such continuity, then the transferee must accept the liability with the benefits.\u201d <em>Turner, supra </em>at 430. These guidelines examine whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\u201c(1) There is a continuation of the enterprise of the seller corporation, so that there is a continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201c[2] The seller corporation ceases its ordinary business operations, liquidates, and dissolves as soon as legally and practically possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201c[3] The purchasing corporation assumes those liabilities and obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the seller corporation.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 420, quoting <em>Shannon, supra </em>at 801, in turn citing <em>McKee v Harris-Seybold Co, Div of Harris-Intertype Corp, </em>109 NJ Super 555, 563-567; 264 A2d 98 (1970), aff\u2019d 118 NJ Super 480; 288 A2d 585 (1972).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The <em>Turner </em>Court included one additional factor: whether \u201c[t]he purchasing corporation held itself out to the world as the effective continuation of the seller corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430. Application of these guidelines to the evidence before the Court demonstrates that numerous questions of material fact remain for decision by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The first factor examines whether Pneumo Dynamics and Cone-Blanchard \u201ccontinued] the enterprise of the seller corporation.\u201d The sales contract shows that when Cone-Blanchard bought Pneumo\u2019s machine tool division in 1972, it took over what had been Cone I\u2019s \u201centire plant facilities, equipment, machinery, inventory and patents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The sales contract lists all Cone I\u2019s assets that Pneumo sold to Cone-Blanchard. These assets include, among other things, accounts receivable, raw materials and other inventory, machinery, equipment, tools, real property, trademarks and patents, leases, customer books, and files and records. Furthermore, Cone-Blanchard assumed all the contracts with unionized employees serving Cone I\u2019s plant. It assumed the obligations of Pneumo\u2019s hourly and salaried employee pension programs, expressly granting employees pension credit for time served under both Pneumo and Cone I. While the contract does not expressly provide for retention of \u201cmanagement\u201d personnel, it is a reasonable inference that the \u201csalaried employees\u201d include management employees. A jury could find on these facts that Cone-Blanchard purchased Cone I from Pneumo as a continuing enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The second criterion examines whether \u201c[t]he seller corporation ceases its ordinary business operations, liquidates, and dissolves as soon as legally and practi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>cally possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420. Pneumo has neither liquidated nor dissolved, but, under the facts of this case, this criterion is irrelevant to determining whether Cone-Blanchard purchased Cone I from Pneumo as a going concern. Pneumo sold its entire machine division to Cone-Blanchard, and executed a covenant not to compete \u201canywhere in the world in the manufacture, sale or service of, machines or parts of a nature similar to those manufactured, serviced or sold by the Machine Tool Group at any time on or before the Closing Date [of the sale to Cone-Blanchard].\u201d For all practical purposes, Pneumo has \u201cliquidated and dissolved\u201d in the relevant industry and sold its Machine Tool Group and Cone I as a folly operational continuing enteiprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\">The third criterion examines whether the \u201cpurchasing coiporation assumes those liabilities and obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the seller corporation.\u201d <em>Turner, supra </em>at 420. In the contract of sale between Cone-Blanchard and Pneumo, Cone-Blanchard expressly assumed \u201cliabilities incurred ... in the ordinary course of business in operating the Business,\u201d \u201cobligations and liabilities . . . under all open sales contracts and purchase contracts,\u201d and \u201cobligations and liabilities . . . under all other contracts, plans, agreements and commitments,\u201d such as labor, pension, and insurance agreements. Unquestionably, these are the types of continuing liabilities and obligations a buyer must assume if the purchased corporation is to be operated as a going concern. Cone-Blanchard\u2019s assumption of the liabilities and obligations of Pneumo\u2019s machine tool group, as well as Pneumo\u2019s complete exit from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>machine tool industry, as evidenced by the covenant not to compete, shows that Cone-Blanchard did buy this division of Pneumo as a continuing business enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The fourth factor, whether the purchasing corporation holds itself out as \u201cthe effective continuation of the seller corporation,\u201d merits little discussion. By its very name and the name of its product, it is clear that Cone-Blanchard capitalizes on the Cone name. The evidence shows that Pneumo did so, as well: not only did it use Cone I\u2019s product trade name (Conomatic), but it also continued to use the original company\u2019s corporate trade name, describing it in a product manual as the Cone Automatic Machine Company: A Division of Pneumo Dynamics Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">There are numerous triable questions of material fact regarding whether Cone-Blanchard is the corporate successor of Cone I. The Court of Appeals should be affirmed with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">The majority holds that a successor corporation may have an independent duty to warn of defects in its predecessor\u2019s products, where there is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the defendant and the victim or the defendant and the third party who caused the injury. <em>Ante, </em>pp 706-707, quoting <em>Murdock v Higgins, </em>454 Mich 46, 54; 559 NW2d 639 (1997). According to the majority, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">[r]elevant indicia of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d include: a successor\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of a defect in its predecessor\u2019s product, a continuing relationship with the predecessor\u2019s customer, service agreements between the successor and the predecessor\u2019s customer relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>machine in question, and evidence that the successor had actually serviced the machine in question. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 707-708.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-3\">Under the majority\u2019s test, drawing all reasonable inferences from the given evidence in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, Cone-Blanchard had an independent duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The majority, however, dismisses the plaintiff\u2019s claims that the defendant had constructive knowledge of the defect in the machine that injured the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that in two previous lawsuits against Cone-Blanchard, one in 1979 and one in 1982, an individual sued after being scalped by a Conomatic Feed Screw Machine. These cases involved the same type of machines and the same type of injury as are involved in the instant case. The majority asserts, however, that in neither case was the machine proved to be defective. Therefore, the defendant had no constructive knowledge of any defect in the machine in question. <em>Id., </em>p 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In so holding, the majority fails to observe the proper standard for judging evidence on a summary judgment motion. From the fact of these two lawsuits, a jury could reasonably find that the defendant had knowledge that these machines might cause this injury. Giving the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences, two lawsuits alleging the same injury from the same machine are sufficient notice to the defendant that there may be a defect in that type of machine, worth investigating further. \u201cIf one by exercise of reasonable care would have known a fact, he is deemed to have had constructive knowledge of such fact . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 314. A jury could reasonably find that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ant, \u201cby exercise of reasonable care,\u201d would have known of the alleged defect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">With respect to Cone-Blanchard\u2019s contact with the owner of the machine that injured the plaintiff, the majority again fails to look at the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, and fails to draw reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. The majority acknowledges that \u201cCone-Blanchard had access to Cone I\u2019s customer lists and that [plaintiff\u2019s] employer possessed a Cone-Blanchard business card on its premises,\u201d but states that \u201cwhile Cone-Blanchard may have solicited continuing business from Cone I\u2019s customers, such evidence alone is insufficient to support a \u2018special relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>pp 708-709.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">To infer from this evidence that Cone-Blanchard was merely \u201csoliciting\u201d business from the plaintiffs employer is an inference from the evidence in favor of the defendant, which is not proper on summary disposition. <em>Chandler v Dowell Schlumberger Inc, </em>456 Mich 395, 397; 572 NW2d 210 (1998). A jury could reasonably find, from the evidence acknowledged by the majority, that an agent of Cone-Blanchard had specifically examined the machine in question and had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the plaintiff\u2019s employer, whether or not the purpose of that relationship was solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">A jury could reasonably find from the evidence before the Court that Cone-Blanchard had constrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>five knowledge of a defect in its predecessor\u2019s machine, and that it had been in contact with the plaintiff\u2019s employer about the machine in question. Whether this contact was for purposes of inspection, repair, or replacement is purely speculative, and this Court may not speculate in favor of the defendant in reviewing this motion for summary disposition. <em>Chandler, supra. </em>This evidence presents material questions of fact regarding whether Cone-Blanchard had a duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The <em>Turner </em>test is applicable to the facts of the instant case, and under that test, the evidence presented by the plaintiff is more than adequate to go to a jury regarding whether Cone-Blanchard is a corporate successor to Cone I. The plaintiff has also submitted evidence sufficient to raise questions of fact regarding whether Cone-Blanchard had a duty to warn the plaintiff of the dangers presented by the machine in question. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent, and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b805-5\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\"> Corporations can be merged, spun-off, and otherwise sold in a variety of ways. <em>If the </em>corporation is sold as a going concern, however, it continues to exist as the same enteiprise in a relevant sense.
