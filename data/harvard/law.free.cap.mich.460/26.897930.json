We hold that the names of unknown patients are protected by the physician-patient privilege, and that defendant hospitals have a duty to refrain from disclosure. We also review the <em>Gregory </em>trial court\u2019s order that the defendant hospital provide Gregory with any investigative reports rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tive to the incident report; any statements made by any person with respect to the incident; and any notes, memoranda, records, and reports related to the incident. Additionally, we review the <em>Gregory </em>trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant hospital\u2019s motions for summary disposition for plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a notice of intent and for plaintiffs failure to, file an affidavit of merit. We decline to review the <em>Gregory </em>trial court\u2019s partial denial of defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary disposition regarding plaintiff\u2019s express contract claim for violation of the statute of frauds and the Michigan Court Rules. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to <em>Dorris v Detroit Osteopathic Hospital. </em>We partially reverse the trial court in <em>Gregory v Heritage Hospital </em>and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">A. <em>DORRIS v DETROIT OSTEOPATHIC HOSPITAL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">This is an interlocutory appeal in a medical malpractice action. Plaintiffs Deborah Dorris and Raymond Dorris<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal the Court of Appeals reversal of the trial court\u2019s order compelling defendant Detroit Osteopathic Hospital Corporation to reveal the name of the patient who shared a hospital room with Dorris.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Plaintiff Dorris visited the Riverside Osteopathic Hospital<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> emergency room on the evening of June 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>1993, complaining of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The emergency room physician, Dr. Lusk, prescribed the drug Compazine, which was administered intravenously. After the Compazine was administered, Dorris had an apparent anaphylactic reaction to the drug. Dorris\u2019 condition later stabilized, and she was discharged within twenty-four hours. Dorris claimed that she had refused the Compazine because she had a history of allergic reactions to medicines. Dorris alleged that she instead requested Lomatil, which she previously had taken without incident, but Dr. Lusk refused her request. Dorris stated that she also told the nurse who put Compazine into the intravenous bag that she did not want the medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Dorris filed suit in March 1994 and alleged that the hospital\u2019s employee negligently administered Compazine in violation of the standard of care for an emergency room physician and against Dorris\u2019 specific instructions. Dorris\u2019 complaint alleges damages for the allergic reaction, as well as pain, suffering, humiliation, and great emotional and mental distress. Dorris\u2019 husband alleges damages as a result of loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Dorris claims that the patient who shared her hospital room witnessed Dorris\u2019 refusals of Compazine. During discovery, plaintiff moved to compel defendant to disclose the name of that patient. The circuit court granted the motion. The Court of Appeals reversed. 220 Mich App 248; 559 NW2d 76 (1996). The Court of Appeals based its holding on <em>Schechet v Kesten, </em>372 Mich 346, 351; 126 NW2d 718 (1964). In <em>Schechet, </em>this Court stated that MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157 \u201cprohibits the physician from disclosing, in the course of any action wherein his patient or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>patients are not involved and do not consent, even the names of such noninvolved patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Plaintiff Dorris appeals the decision of the Court of Appeals. 457 Mich 866 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">B. <em>GREGORY v HERITAGE HOSPITAL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In her complaint, plaintiff Eloise Gregory alleges that she was the victim of an assault and battery occurring while she was a patient at defendant Heritage Hospital on May 13, 1997. She claims that she was awakened because of a physical altercation between her roommate and another patient from across the hall. Gregory alleges that she was grabbed by defendant Jane Doe who pushed her to the ground and beat her, causing her to lose consciousness and sustain serious injuries. Additionally, Gregory alleges breach of contract by Heritage. Gregory argues that this contract gave rise to a duty of Heritage to protect patients while under its care. Gregory also alleges that Heritage had inadequate staffing to supervise and monitor the behavior of the patients under its psychiatric care.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Gregory served Heritage with interrogatories and a request for production of documents that included: any incident/investigative reports relating to the incident; any statements made by any person with respect to the incident; and any notes, memoranda, records, and reports related to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Heritage objected to the discovery requests. In lieu of answering the complaint, Heritage filed three motions for summary disposition. Gregory subsequently filed a motion to compel discovery. Heritage\u2019s motions for summary disposition were in large part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>denied, and Gregory\u2019s motion to compel discovery was granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Heritage was ordered to provide Gregory with answers to her interrogatories; the incident report involving Jane Doe; Jane Doe\u2019s full name, last known address, telephone number, social security number, or date of birth; any investigative reports relative to the incident report; any statements made by any person with respect to the incident; and any notes, memoranda, records, and reports related to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Heritage applied for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, which was denied. This Court granted Heritage\u2019s application for leave to appeal and combined this case with <em>Dorris v Detroit Osteopathic Hosp. </em>458 Mich 876 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We first address whether the defendant hospitals are required to provide identification information about other unknown patients to the plaintiffs. The physician-patient statute in Michigan, found at MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">Except as otherwise provided by law, a person duly authorized to practice medicine or surgery shall not disclose any information that the person has acquired in attending a patient in a professional character, if the information was necessary to enable the person to prescribe for the patient as a physician, or to do any act for the patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>as a surgeon. If the patient brings an action against any defendant to recover for any personal injuries, or for any malpractice, and the patient produces a physician as a witness in the patient\u2019s own behalf who has treated the patient for the injury or for any disease or condition for which malpractice is alleged, the patient shall be considered to have waived the privilege provided in this section as to another physician who has treated the patient for the injuries, disease, or condition. If a patient has died, the heirs at law of the patient, whether proponents or contestants of the patient\u2019s will, shall be considered to be personal representatives of the deceased patient for the purpose of waiving the privilege under this section in a contest upon the question of admitting the patient\u2019s will to probate. If a patient has died, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy insuring the life of the patient, or the patient\u2019s heirs at law, may waive the privilege under this section for the purpose of providing the necessary documentation to a life insurer in examining a claim for benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">The physician-patient privilege was not recognized at common law, and, thus, its scope is controlled by the language of the statute. <em>People v Johnson, </em>111 Mich App 383; 314 NW2d 631 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">It is well established that the purpose of the statute is to protect the confidential nature of the physician-patient relationship and to encourage a patient to make a full disclosure of symptoms and condition. <em>Domako v Rowe, </em>438 Mich 347, 354; 475 NW2d 30 (1991); <em>Gaertner v Michigan, </em>385 Mich 49, 53; 187 NW2d 429 (1971); <em>Schechet, supra </em>at 351; 81 Am Jur 2d, Witnesses, \u00a7 438, p 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">This Court, in <em>Gaertner, supra </em>at 53, summarized the purpose of the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">The purpose of this statute is to protect the confidential nature of the physician-patient relationship. In <em>Schechet v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Kesten, 372 </em>Mich 346, 351 [126 NW2d 718 (1964)], this Court said of the statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cIt prohibits the physician from disclosing, in the course of any action wherein his patient or patients are not involved and do not consent, even the names of such noninvolved patients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">The privilege of confidentiality belongs to the patient; it can be waived only by the patient. <em>Schechet v Kesten, supra. </em>In <em>Storrs v Scougale, </em>48 Mich 387, 395 [12 NW 502 (1882)], this Court by Justice Cooley said of this privilege of confidentiality:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201c[A] privilege is guarded which does not belong to him [the physician] but to his patient, and which continues indefinitely, and can be waived by no one but the patient himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">In <em>Schechet, </em>this Court considered whether the physician-patient privilege prohibited the discovery of the names and treatment histories of patients in a libel and slander claim brought by plaintiff Dr. Schechet against defendant Dr. Kesten on the basis of an allegedly slanderous and libelous report Dr. Kesten made to a credentials committee about Dr. Schechet. Dr. Schechet sought the names and treatment histories regarding those patients whom Dr. Kesten accused Dr. Schechet of failing to appropriately treat in his report to the committee. This Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order of disclosure, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">Such veil of privilege is the patient\u2019s right. It prohibits the physician from disclosing, in the course of any action wherein his patient or patients are not involved and do not consent, even the names of such noninvolved patients. [372 Mich 351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">In its decision in <em>Dorris v Detroit Osteopathic Hosp, </em>the Court of Appeals panel relied upon <em>Schechet </em>in finding that the names of nonparty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>patients were protected by the physician-patient privilege and not subject to disclosure. Plaintiff Dorris argues that the panel committed error requiring reversal by wrongfully relying on this dicta from <em>Schechet. </em>Rather, Dorris argues that this Court should follow <em>Porter v Michigan Osteopathic Hosp Ass\u2019n, Inc, </em>170 Mich App 619; 428 NW2d 719 (1988). In <em>Porter, </em>the plaintiff sought disclosure of the names and information regarding two other patients who allegedly raped her while she was a patient at the Michigan Osteopathic Hospital. In upholding the trial court\u2019s order of disclosure, the Court of Appeals found that disclosure of the names and addresses of unknown patients who were suspected as assailants did not require disclosure of information necessary for treatment or diagnosis pursuant to MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the Court of Appeals found that the names and addresses of the unknown patients were discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The <em>Dorris </em>panel noted the <em>Porter </em>dissent that found that the physician-patient privilege \u201cstatute has not been construed as limited to information solely necessary for treatment.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>170 Mich App 627 (Mackenzie, J., dissenting). However, the <em>Dorris </em>panel noted that in <em>Porter </em>there were stronger policy reasons for disclosure, because the plaintiff was seeking the name of the patients who allegedly attacked her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>whereas, in <em>Dorris, </em>the plaintiff was only seeking the name of the patient who may have overheard a conversation between the plaintiff and medical personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Gregory argues that her case presents stronger reasons for disclosure than those argued in <em>Dorris </em>and <em>Porter. </em>She argues that in the present case, the information requested is required to identify a party to the litigation. She would have this Court hold that, unless the information is necessary for the purpose of examination, diagnosis, or treatment, it is discoverable. She further argues that the identity of the unknown patient is not protected by the physician-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">This state has a strong historical commitment to a far-reaching, open, and effective discovery practice. <em>Daniels v Allen Industries, Inc, </em>391 Mich 398, 403; 216 NW2d 762 (1974). \u201c[T]he Michigan Court Rules of 1985 in no way acted to restrict discovery or to modify this commitment to open discovery.\u201d <em>Domako, </em>438 Mich 359. MCR 2.302(B)(1), which governs the scope of permissible discovery, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">In General. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of another party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of a discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissable at trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>MCR 2.302(B)(1) clearly prohibits discovery of privileged information. We agree with Judge Mackenzie\u2019s dissent in <em>Porter, supra </em>at 627, that \u201c[t]he concept of privilege thus supersedes even the liberal discovery principles of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The language of \u00a7 2157 is clear in its prohibition of disclosure of privileged information. In accordance with prior rulings of this Court, particularly <em>Schechet, </em>that the purpose of the privilege is to encourage patients\u2019 complete disclosure of all symptoms and conditions by protecting the confidential relationship between physician and patient, we find requiring the defendant hospitals to disclose the identity of unknown patients would be in direct contradiction of the language<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and established purpose of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ute. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Historically, confidentiality has been understood to be necessary to promote full disclosure of a patient\u2019s medical history and present medical concerns. See <em>Briesenmeister v Knights of Pythias, </em>81 Mich 525, 531; 45 NW 977 (1890). As the dissent notes, \u201cinformation falls within the purview of the physician-patient privilege only if it was \u2018necessary\u2019 to enable a physician \u2018to prescribe\u2019 for a patient.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 50-51. The dissent goes on to argue that we have disregarded this language and render the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>statute surplusage. However, patients armed with the knowledge that their name may not be kept confidential may not be as willing to reveal their full medical history for fear that, ultimately, that information, too, may lose its confidential status. This chilling of the patient\u2019s desire to disclose would have a detrimental effect on the physician\u2019s ability to provide effective and complete medical treatment and is therefore \u201cnecessary\u201d to enable a physician \u201cto prescribe\u201d for a patient.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">A patient may intentionally and voluntarily waive the privilege. See <em>Kelly v Allegan Circuit Judge, 382 </em>Mich 425; 169 NW2d 916 (1969). A patient may also impliedly waive the privilege as specifically provided for with \u00a7 2157. However, the patients in the present cases have neither voluntarily nor impliedly waived their right to the privilege. Therefore, this Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Schechet </em>is equally applicable to the present cases. That Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">It need only be said that no question of waiver of privilege is before us; . . . that the third party information plaintiff would have disclosed could in no view of the cited rules of court be regarded as \u201cmatter not privileged which is admissible under the rules of evidence governing trials,\u201d and that the circuit court erred reversibly in failing to uphold the defendant physician\u2019s right \u2014 no duty \u2014 to refrain from disclosure .... [372 Mich 350-351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In <em>Gregory, </em>the trial court ordered the defendant hospital to provide Gregory with any investigative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>reports relative to the incident report; any statements made by any person with respect to the incident; and any notes, memoranda, records, and reports related to the incident. Heritage argues that the incident report, as well as any other information maintained in furtherance of the hospital\u2019s quality assurance and peer review function is protected from discovery by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Two Michigan statutes govern the confidentiality of records, reports, and other information collected or used by peer review committees in the furtherance of their duties. MCL 333.20175; MSA 14.15(20175) addresses a hospital\u2019s duty to keep and maintain records regarding all treatment given to patients at that facility. It also addresses the confidentiality of peer review records. Section 20175(8) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">The records, data, and knowledge collected for or by individuals or committees assigned a professional review function in a health facility or agency are confidential, shall be used only for the purposes provided in this article, are not public records, and are not subject to court subpoena.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Further evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent to fully protect quality assurance/peer review records from discovery is found at MCL 333.21515; MSA 14.15(21515), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">The records, data, and knowledge collected for or by individuals or committees assigned a review function described in this article are confidential and shall be used only for the purposes provided in this article, shall not be public records, and shall not be available for court subpoena.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In <em>Gallagher v Detroit-Macomb Hosp Ass\u2019n, </em>171 Mich App 761; 431 NW2d 90 (1988), the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Appeals considered whether an incident report prepared regarding Gallagher\u2019s slip and fall while a patient at South Macomb Hospital could be introduced at trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling refusing to permit Gallagher to introduce the incident report. The <em>Gallagher </em>Court noted that the Public Health Code requires hospitals to engage in reviews of their practices and procedures in an effort to improve the quality of patient care. \u201cTo achieve this end, the Legislature has exempted from court subpoena information and records compiled in furtherance of improving health care and reducing morbidity and mortality.\u201d 171 Mich App 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">Hospitals are required to establish peer review committees whose purposes are to reduce morbidity and mortality and to ensure quality care. MCL 333.21513; MSA 14.15(21513).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Attorney General v Bruce, </em>422 Mich 157, 169; 369 NW2d 826 (1985), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">The rationale for protecting the confidentiality of the records, data, and knowledge of such [peer review] committees was set forth in an oft-quoted opinion of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cConfidentiality is essential to effective functioning of these staff meetings; and these meetings are essential to the continued improvement in the care and treatment of patients. Candid and conscientious evaluation of clinical practices is a <em>sine qua non </em>of adequate hospital care. To subject the discussions and deliberations to the discovery process, without a showing of exceptional necessity, would result in terminating such deliberations. [Emphasis in original. <em>Bredice v Doctors Hosp, Inc, </em>50 FRD 249, 250 (D DC, 1970), <em>aff'd without opinion </em>156 US App DC 199; 479 F2d 920 (1973).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Additionally, in <em>Monty v Warren Hosp Corp, </em>422 Mich 138, 147; 366 NW2d 198 (1985), this Court found that in determining whether the information is privileged, \u201cthe court may wish to consider the hospital\u2019s bylaws and internal regulations, and whether the committee\u2019s function is one of current patient care or retrospective review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In the present case, defendant Heritage provided the affidavit of Therese Oziemski, Manager of Quality and Utilization Management at Heritage Hospital. According to Ms. Oziemski\u2019s affidavit, the incident report and other investigative documents sought by plaintiff Gregory are used for the purpose of maintaining health care standards at the hospital, improving the quality of care provided to patients, and reducing morbidity and mortality within the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Hospital personnel are expected to give their honest assessment and reviews of the performance of other hospital staff in incidents such as the one in the present case. Absent the assurance of confidentiality as provided by \u00a7\u00a7 21515 and 20175(8), the willingness of hospital staff to provide their candid assessment will be greatly diminished. This will have a direct effect on the hospital\u2019s ability to monitor, investigate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and respond to trends and incidents that affect patient care, morbidity, and mortality.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Given that Heritage offered evidence in the form of Ms. Oziemski\u2019s affidavit that the information sought by Gregory was collected for the purpose of retrospective review by the peer committee, the trial court erred in ordering Heritage to produce the incident reports and other related investigatory documents. Gregory was not afforded the opportunity to challenge this evidence regarding whether it was actually collected for the purpose of retrospective review by the peer committee.

The plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in granting summary disposition for failure to file the claim within the two-year period of limitation applicable to medical malpractice claims, because the complaint stated a claim for ordinary negligence only, which is governed by a three-year period of limitation. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s order of summary disposition, agreeing with the trial court that the allegations within the plaintiff\u2019s complaint involve issues of medical judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">The key to a medical malpractice claim is whether it is alleged that the negligence occurred within the course of a professional relationship.

In <em>Starr v Providence Hosp, </em>109 Mich App 762, 766; 312 NW2d 152 (1981), the Court of Appeals found that issues involving whether the defendant hospital exercised appropriate supervision in a \u201cspecial care unit\u201d were \u201cissues involving professional judgments which are beyond the common knowledge and experience of laymen to judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In <em>Waatti v Marquette General Hosp, Inc, </em>122 Mich App 44, 49; 329 NW2d 526 (1982), the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[w]hether a seizure patient requires constant medical attendance or restraints is an issue of medical management to be established by expert testimony,\u201d citing <em>Wilson v Stilwill </em>and <em>Starr v Providence Hosp, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Count hi of Gregory\u2019s complaint makes the three following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">17.

The ordinary layman does not know the type of supervision or monitoring that is required for psychiatric patients in a psychiatric ward. Thus, the trial court erred in not requiring that plaintiff provide a notice of intent to sue and an affidavit of merit as required by \u00a7\u00a7 2912b and 2912d.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We note that the appropriate sanction for the failure to provide a notice of intent to sue is dismissal without prejudice. See <em>Neal v Oakwood Hosp, </em>226 Mich App 701, 715; 575 NW2d 68 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">As to the appropriate sanction for failure to file an affidavit of merit, we find in the present case that dismissal without prejudice is also appropriate. In <em>VandenBerg v VandenBerg, </em>231 Mich App 497, 502; 586 NW2d 570 (1998), the Court of Appeals found that the purpose of the statute was to prevent frivolous medical malpractice claims. In that case, plaintiff did not file an affidavit of merit at the time of filing the complaint; however, the defendants did receive an affidavit of merit at the same time they were served with the summons and the complaint. The Court of Appeals found that defendants did not suffer any prejudice because \u201cthey had access to the affidavit of merit from the moment they received the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503. In the present case, plaintiff\u2019s complaint was unaccompanied by an affidavit of merit at the time of filing and service upon the defendant, and at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>no time has plaintiff ever supplemented her complaint with an affidavit of merit. Under these circumstances, we hold that dismissal without prejudice would be the appropriate sanction for plaintiffs failure to comply with \u00a7 2912d.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We hold that the names of unknown patients are protected by the physician-patient privilege, MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157, and that the defendant hospitals have a duty to refrain from disclosure. The language of MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157 is clear in its prohibition of disclosure of privileged information. Where a patient has neither voluntarily waived the privilege nor impliedly done so as specifically provided within \u00a7 2157, there are strong public policy reasons for applying the physician-patient privilege to disclosure of an unknown patient\u2019s name. A patient who fears disclosure may be chilled from seeking medical assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We also hold that the <em>Gregory </em>trial court erred in ordering the defendant hospital to provide plaintiff with any investigative reports relative to the incident report; any statements made by any person with respect to the incident; and any notes, memoranda, records, and reports related to the incident. Defendant argues that this information was collected by the defendant hospital for the purpose of retrospective review by a peer committee and should be protected from discovery pursuant to MCL 333.20175; MSA 14.15(20175) and MCL 333.21515; MSA 14.15(21515). However, because plaintiff was not afforded the opportunity to challenge whether information sought was actually collected for the purpose of retrospec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tive review by a peer committee, we remand to the trial court to allow plaintiff to test the veracity of defendant hospital\u2019s procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">We also hold that the <em>Gregory </em>trial court erred in denying defendant hospital\u2019s motions for summary disposition for plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a notice of intent and for plaintiff\u2019s failure to file an affidavit of merit. The supervision and monitoring of psychiatric patients in a psychiatric ward involves questions of professional medical management and, therefore, cannot be judged by the common knowledge and experience of a jury. Thus, plaintiff Gregory\u2019s claim was one of medical malpractice and subject to MCL 600.2912b; MSA 27A.2912(2) and MCL 600.2912d; MSA 27A.2912(4). Given that plaintiff Gregory failed to comply with these provisions, the trial court erred in not granting the defendant hospital\u2019s motions for summary disposition on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to <em>Dorris v Detroit Osteopathic Hosp. </em>We partially reverse the judgment of the trial court in <em>Gregory v Heritage Hosp </em>and remand the case to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-6\">Weaver, C.J., and Taylor, and Young, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b135-7\">Corrigan, J., concurred with Brickley, J., in <em>Gregory, </em>but took no part in the decision of <em>Dorris.</em></judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\"> Because the claims of plaintiff Raymond Dorris are derivative, for the purposes of this opinion, \u201cDorris\u201d will refer to Deborah Dorris only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"> Defendant oversees Riverside Osteopathic Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions regarding plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a notice of intent, failure to file an affidavit of merit, and express contract claim, but granted defendant\u2019s motion regarding plaintiff\u2019s implied contract claim. This opinion does not address defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition regarding the express contract claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-5\"> Given that <em>Porter </em>also involved the psychiatrist-patient privilege, the Court of Appeals found that that privilege only extended to information necessary for treatment or diagnosis as well. MCL 330.1750(l)(c); MSA 14.800(750)(l)(c) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cPrivileged communication\u201d means a communication made to a psychiatrist or psychologist in connection with the examination, diagnosis, or treatment of a patient, or to another person while the other person is participating in the examination, diagnosis, or treatment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed) defines \u201cprescribe,\u201d in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">In a medical sense \u201cprescribe\u201d means to direct, designate, or order the use of a particular remedy, therapy, medicine, or drug. <em>[Id. </em>at 1183.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\"><em>Random, House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>defines \u201cprescribe,\u201d in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">to designate or order the use of (a medicine, treatment, etc.) ... to order a treatment or medicine. <em>[Id. </em>at 1067.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Given these definitions, \u201cprescribe\u201d should be interpreted broadly enough to encompass any information acquired to allow the physician to order or recommend any treatment for a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">Additionally, we note that, pursuant to Michigan Administrative Code, it is necessary for a physician to obtain a patient\u2019s name before a prescription can be written for the patient. Michigan Administrative Code, R 338.479b provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">Rule 9b.

Therefore, the patient\u2019s name is information acquired to allow the physician to order or recommend treatment for a patient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b124-14\"> The dissent argues that by not addressing the distinction that plaintiffs are requesting patient names from a hospital, as opposed to a physician, we are imputing the physician-patient privilege to the hospital. However, in <em>Massachusetts Mut Life Ins Co v Michigan Asylum for the Insane Bd of Trustees, </em>178 Mich 193, 204; 144 NW 538 (1913), quoting <em>Smart v Kansas City, </em>208 Mo 162, 198; 105 SW 709; 14 LRA Ann Cas 565 (1907), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-15\">\u201c[I]t seems that it must follow as a natural sequence that when the physician subsequently copies that privileged communication upon the record of the hospital, it still remains privileged.

[MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The primary goal of interpreting a statutory provision, like the physician-patient privilege, is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998). To accomplish this goal, we presume that every word in the statute has meaning and avoid any construction that renders any part surplusage. <em>Altman v Meridian Twp, </em>439 Mich 623, 635; 487 NW2d 155 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The statutory section cited here provides that information falls within the purview of the physician-patient privilege only if it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to enable a physician<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cto prescribe\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a patient. MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157.

[Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The majority here concludes that the name of a \u201cnon-involved patient\u201d is protected by the privilege.

By concluding that patient names are within the purview of the privilege, this Court has ignored several fundamental principles of statutory construction: that every word should be given meaning, if possible, and that any construction that renders part of a statute surplusage should be avoided. <em>Altman, supra </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Consistent with <em>Porter v Michigan Osteopathic Hosp Ass\u2019n, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>information falls within the scope of the physician-patient privilege only if it is acquired by a physician in his professional character, and is \u201c \u2018necessary to enable him to prescribe ... as a physician.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Porter, </em>the Court of Appeals properly held that disclosure of names of unknown patients suspected of assaulting the plaintiff did not require disclosure of information \u201c \u2018necessary to enable [a physician] to prescribe ... as a physician.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The majority astutely notes that <em>Porter </em>also involved the psychiatrist-patient privilege, which \u201cprevents the discovery of \u2018a communication made to a psychiatrist or psychologist in connection with the examination, diagnosis, or treatment of a patient . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in <em>Porter, </em>the Court of Appeals properly held that disclosure of names of unknown patients suspected of assaulting the plaintiff did not require disclosure of information \u201cnecessary for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>poses of examination, diagnosis and treatment.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a result, the Court of Appeals concluded that the patient names were not protected by either privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In this case, the majority disregards the plain language of the statute.
