In doing so, we adopt as our own the following dissenting opinion written by Judge Bandstra in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">Plaintiff appeals by leave granted from an order denying reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s previous order that excluded the introduction of an appraisal of property owned by defendants Archie and Mary Ann VanElslander. Because [we] find that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding this evidence, [we] reverse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">This case arises from a condemnation action. Plaintiff is engaged in a road-widening project in Macomb County, and condemned a portion of defendants\u2019 property under the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act, MCL 213.51 <em>et seq.) </em>MSA 8.265(1) <em>et seq. </em>The condemnation left the remainder of defendants\u2019 property in violation of local zoning laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>with respect to building setback requirements. At trial, plaintiff wishes to introduce an appraisal of defendants\u2019 property that is based on the possibility that a zoning variance could be obtained to cure the violations created by the condemnation. Defendants filed a motion to exclude the evidence, which the trial court granted. Plaintiff moved for reconsideration in the trial court or, alternatively, requested that defendants be ordered to cooperate in a request for a zoning variance. The trial court denied both requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">In this interlocutory appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly excluded evidence of a possible zoning variance. We review the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Phillips v Deihm, </em>213 Mich App 389, 401; 541 NW2d 566 (1995); <em>Detroit v Gorno Steel &amp; Processing Co, </em>157 Mich App 294, 311; 403 NW2d 538 (1987). Relevance is the threshold of admissibility. MRE 402. Evidence is relevant if it \u201chas any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d <em>Yates v Keane, </em>184 Mich App 80, 82; 457 NW2d 693 (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">The meaning of just compensation has been described by [the Court of Appeals]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cBoth the federal and state constitutions provide that private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. Just compensation means the full monetary equivalent of the property taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201cThe purpose of just compensation is to put property owners in as good a position as they would have been had their property not been taken from them. The public must not be enriched at the property owner\u2019s expense, but neither should the property owner be enriched at the public\u2019s expense. There is no formula or artificial measure of damages applicable to all condemnation cases. The amount of damages to be recovered by the property owner is generally left to the discretion of the trier of fact after consideration of the evidence presented. <em>[K &amp; K Construction, Inc v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>217 Mich App 56, 72-73; 551 NW2d 413 (1996)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] (citations omitted).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">[The Court of Appeals] has also articulated a means of calculating just compensation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201c[T]he proper measure of damages in a condemnation case involving a partial taking consists of the fair market value of the property taken plus severance damages to the remaining property if applicable. To calculate the severance damages, the parties may present evidence of the cost to cure. <em>[Dep\u2019t of Transportation v Sherburn, </em>196 Mich App 301, 306; 492 NW2d 517 (1992).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">In <em>Sherbum, </em>[the Court of Appeals] also explained the rationale behind the use of \u2018cost to cure\u2019 evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cWhere severance damages have occurred, it may sometimes prove possible for the property owner to perform certain actions upon the property to rectify the injuries in whole or in part, thus decreasing the amount of severance damages and correspondingly increasing the parcel's market value. These actions constitute a \u2018curing\u2019 of the defects, and the financial expenditures to do so constitute the condemnee\u2019s cost to cure. <em>[Id. </em>at 305.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">Thus, any evidence that would tend to affect the market value of the property as of the date of condemnation is relevant. This includes evidence of the possibility of rezoning to the extent that \u201cthe \u2018possibility\u2019 would have affected the price which a willing buyer would have offered for the property just prior to the taking.\u201d <em>State Hwy Comm\u2019r v Eilender, </em>362 Mich 697, 699; 108 NW2d 755 (1961).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">Defendants point out that <em>Eilender </em>involved rezoning rather than a variance and that evidence regarding the rezoning was offered on behalf of the landowner rather than the state. Neither of these distinctions make <em>Eilender </em>inapposite to this case. Both the possibility of rezoning and the possibility of a variance are subject to vicissitudes. A variance may, as plaintiff argues, be easier to obtain than a rezoning, while a variance granted may be revoked in the future, as pointed out by defendants. These are considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tions to be weighed by the factfinder in determining \u201cthe price which a willing buyer would have offered for the property just prior to the taking\u201d under <em>Eilender </em>regardless of whether the possibility of rezoning or the possibility of a variance is at issue. There is no reason to apply <em>Eilender </em>only to benefit property owners seeking to increase compensation; it is equally available to governmental entities seeking to assure that compensation is just. \u201cJust compensation . . . should neither enrich the individual at the expense of the public nor the public at the expense of the individual.\u201d <em>Id.[</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">The proper threshold for the admission of this type of evidence was articulated in <em>Eilender.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cThe possibility of a change in the zoning seems, therefore, to have been neither frivolous nor purely speculative, and, if such were \u2018a reasonable possibility,\u2019 this possibility should be assigned a monetary value in fixing the value of the property as of the time of the taking. <em>[Id. </em>at 700 (citation omitted).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">The [Court of Appeals] majority concludes that the expert\u2019s opinion that a variance would be granted was based on an \u201cassumption\u201d without \u201cany evidence\u201d in support and concludes that this \u201cunsupported, speculative\u201d opinion was appropriately withheld from the factfinder. [We] disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">In response to defendants\u2019 original motion to exclude the expert testimony, plaintiff referred to the expert\u2019s appraisal, which would have formed the basis of his testimony for the factfinder. That appraisal detailed how the appraiser had conferred with employees of plaintiff\u2019s real estate division who had successfully obtained variances for numerous properties affected by a similar road-widening project also located in Sterling Heights. As a result, the appraiser was able to estimate the likely cost of obtaining a variance in the instant case and, further, to predict that a variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>would be issued. The appraisal also explained the expert\u2019s opinion that a variance was likely because the city of Sterling Heights requires a setback at intersections to establish a clear sight area and that same purpose would be advanced by the proposed taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">This was sufficient to make the expert\u2019s appraisal and accompanying testimony admissible. It was certainly more compelling support for the proposition that there is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that a variance will issue in this case than the evidence available in <em>Eilender. </em>There, apparently the only evidence regarding a tabled rezoning application was that the requested rezoning \u201cwould not be inconsistent with the use of certain of the surrounding areas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, [the] Supreme Court determined that this was sufficient to conclude that the possibility of a zoning change was \u201cneither frivolous nor purely speculative\u201d and that this possibility should be considered by the factfinder in determining the value of the property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">The [Court of Appeals] majority correctly points out that other variances granted on other roadways do not necessarily mean that a variance would also be granted with respect to the parcel at issue here. Defendants would be free to make that argument and present testimony and other supporting evidence to the factfinder. However, to remove this issue completely from the factfinding process is inconsistent with <em>Eilender.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Accordingly, [we] reverse the trial court\u2019s order that excluded the appraisal at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">On the basis of Judge Bandstra\u2019s opinion set forth above, we reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the order of the circuit court, and we remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-5\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Kelly, Taylor, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-11\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued August 8, 1997 (Docket No. 183321).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\"> 459 Mich 902 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\"> Reversed on other grounds 456 Mich 570; 575 NW2d 531 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> Defendants no longer challenge the proposition that the trier of fact may consider the possibility of obtaining a zoning variance when determining the value of the property just prior to taking. Defendants continue to dispute, however, whether plaintiffs proffered sufficient evidence to establish such a possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\"> As mentioned, plaintiff relied on the expert appraisal in opposition to defendant\u2019s original motion to exclude the evidence; the majority\u2019s criticisms of plaintiff for coming forward with additional material in an attempt to have the trial court\u2019s ruling on this matter reconsidered do not apply to that appraisal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> Defendants also argue that this appeal should be dismissed as moot because they have either demolished or altered the building that, following the condemnation, presented the zoning nonconformity. This fact does not render this appeal moot; the factfinder may still consider the possibility of a variance in determining what a willing buyer would have paid for the property, including the building, just prior to the condemnation.
