As an initial matter, while we would customarily begin our analysis with a discussion of whether the OMA was violated by the conduct of the board of trustees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are bypassing that question and moving directly to the constitutional question because the OMA cannot be a restraint upon the actions of defendant in this circumstance. As explained below, we hold that the Legislature does not have power to regulate open meetings for defendant in the context of presidential searches at all, i.e., the Legislature is institutionally unable to craft an open meetings act that would not, in the context of a presidential selection committee, unconstitutionally infringe the governing board\u2019s power to supervise the institution. We therefore reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">John DiBiaggio resigned as president of Michigan State University during the summer of 1992. Defendant appointed Gordon Guyer interim president and thereafter formed a presidential search committee (PSC), consisting of the eight university trustees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>nine additional members, to assist it in selecting a new president. The psc developed a statement of qualifications and proceeded to identify potential candidates to meet its charge of recommending final candidates to defendant by July 1, 1993.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The search process, however, ground to a halt when the msu student <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>newspaper, the State News, published a confidential list of over one hundred nominees under consideration for the presidency. In response, defendant reconstituted the PSC to consist of four trustees and the nine nontrustee members. The PSC then continued its search in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The PSC gathered and reviewed information regarding the candidates, eventually selecting fifteen to interview. After completing the interviews, the PSC recommended four candidates to defendant. Defendant released the names of these candidates to the public. One candidate eventually withdrew, and defendant publicly interviewed the others. Two candidates withdrew after their interviews. Defendant considered the remaining candidate at a July 27, 1993, meeting, but the trustees were evenly divided regarding her candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Unable to reach a decision to elect the sole remaining candidate, defendant requested that the PSC reconvene and recommend additional candidates. The PSC declined to recommend other candidates. Defendant\u2019s chairman then contacted M. Peter McPherson, a candidate who had withdrawn his name from consideration after his interview with the PSC, and urged him to reinstate his candidacy. McPherson agreed. Defendant publicly interviewed him on August 17, 1993, and subsequently elected him president.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Plaintiffs commenced this action shortly after defendant reconstituted the psc, but the trial court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties continued discovery after the conclusion of the search and eventually filed cross-motions for summary disposition. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion, concluding that the psc was not a public body subject to the OMA, that application of the oma to the presidential search is unconstitutional, and that defendant did not unlawfully delegate its constitutional authority. The Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that, although courts have held that Michigan public universities are distinct governmental bodies, coequal with the Legislature, they are not constitutionally immune from all regulation by the Legislature. The Court then concluded that the policy of promoting openness in government that underlies the oma supported application of the act to state universities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">The longstanding public policy of this state to open the acts of governmental officials to public scrutiny supports the conclusion that the oma can be constitutionally applied to universities. The oma is not aimed at any activities peculiar to the university and does not attempt to change or disturb its educational activities. In fact, the effect of the oma with respect to public universities is minimal. Although it requires that much of the process of selecting a university president be done in public, it does not tell the board what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the criteria should be for that selection, how to select a candidate, or whom to select as president. It merely requires that, when interviewing candidates and when making a detailed review of applications of candidates who do not request confidentiality, the university function in public meetings. It does not divest the board of its authority to select a president. [221 Mich App 103, 112; 561 NW2d 433 (1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The Court of Appeals also determined that the psc violated the OMA during its search process. The Court reasoned that the PSC was a \u201cpublic body\u201d for purposes of the OMA because defendant empowered it by resolution to exercise portions of defendant\u2019s governmental authority in selecting a president. The Court determined that the psc violated the oma \u201cwhen it took steps to reduce the number of candidates in private session, when it reviewed applications of persons not requesting confidentiality, and when it interviewed applicants in private.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. Finally, the Court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that defendant unlawfully delegated its constitutional authority to select a president because defendant, while giving the psc more than ministerial duties, retained its ultimate authority. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We address today the constitutional question left open by <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>444 Mich 211, 235-236; 507 NW2d 422 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>(1993),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and conclude that application of the oma to committees formed by governing boards of public universities to assist in the selection of university presidents is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The Michigan Constitution is a limitation on the Legislature\u2019s power, not a grant of power to it. <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1976 PA 240, </em>400 Mich 311, 317-318; 254 NW2d 544 (1977). As this Court explained in <em>In re Brewster Street Housing Site, </em>291 Mich 313, 332-333; 289 NW 493 (1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">By the Declaration of Independence, all political connection between the colonies and the State of Great Britain was declared to be dissolved and the colonies asserted to be free and independent States. The several States, when organized, succeeded to all of the legislative powers within their respective territorial jurisdictions possessed by the Parliament of England, and as such free and independent States they still possess those powers, except insofar as they have been delegated by the States to the Federal government by the Constitution of the United States or voluntarily restrained by the people through the Constitution of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Thus, absent a constitutional limitation, the Legislature has the power to legislate within a particular field. See <em>Advisory Opinion 1976 PA 240, supra </em>at 318; <em>Oakland Co Taxpayers\u2019 League v Oakland Co Supervisors, </em>355 Mich 305, 323; 94 NW2d 875 (1959); <em>Brewster Street, supra </em>at 333. In this case, we revisit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the question of the scope of the Legislature\u2019s power to regulate public universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The Michigan Constitution confers a unique constitutional status on our public universities and their governing boards.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5 grants defendant broad authority over Michigan State University, including the power to elect the president of the university:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">[T]he trustees of Michigan State University and their successors in office shall constitute a body corporate known as the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University .... Each board shall have general supervision of its institution and the control and direction of all expenditures from the institution\u2019s funds. Each board shall, as often as necessary, elect a president of the institution under its supervision. He shall be the principal executive officer of the institution, be ex-officio a member of the board without the right to vote and preside at meetings of the board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4, however, restricts the board\u2019s power to dictate its procedure, directing that \u201c[fjormal sessions of governing boards of such institutions shall be open to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">In construing provisions of our constitution, the primary rule is that of \u201ccommon understanding.\u201d <em>Council of Organizations &amp; Others for Education About Parochiaid, Inc v Governor, </em>455 Mich 557, 569; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>566 NW2d 208 (1997). In <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), this Court embraced Justice Cooley\u2019s explanation of this principle in his treatise, 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (6th ed), p 81:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\">A constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. </em>\u201cFor as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, <em>the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, </em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">To clarify meaning, we often consider the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the provision and the purpose it is designed to accomplish. <em>Bolt v City of Lansing, </em>459 Mich 152, 160; 587 NW2d 264 (1998). Thus, we turn to the historical origins of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5 to discern the limits they place on the Legislature\u2019s power to regulate our public universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Long ago, the Legislature controlled and managed our first public university, the University of Michigan. Const 1835, art 10, \u00a7 5; see <em>Regents of the Univ of Michigan v Michigan, </em>395 Mich 52, 63; 235 NW2d 1 (1975). This experiment failed, prompting extensive debate regarding the future of the university at the Constitutional Convention of 1850. <em>Sterling v Regents of Univ of Michigan, </em>110 Mich 369, 374-378; 68 NW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>253 (1896). Const 1850, art 13, \u00a7 8 emerged from these debates, divesting the Legislature of its power to regulate the university and placing control in an elected board. <em>Id. </em>at 377-380. The provision granted the board \u201cthe general supervision of the university, and the direction and control of all expenditures . . . .\u201d The Constitution of 1850 also granted the board the power to elect a president of the university. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The University of Michigan thrived under the leadership of its board of regents. <em>Sterling, supra </em>at 377. Recognizing the importance of an independent governing board in managing state colleges and universities, Const 1908, art 11, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 vested control of the then-named Michigan Agricultural College in the State Board of Agriculture.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State Bd of Agriculture v Auditor General, </em>226 Mich 417, 424; 197 NW 160 (1924); <em>State Bd of Agriculture v Auditor General, </em>180 Mich 349, 359; 147 NW 529 (1914); <em>Bauer v State Bd of Agriculture, </em>164 Mich 415; 129 NW 713 (1911). Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5 combined the separate provisions of the Constitution of 1908 into one provision, granting the respective governing bodies control over the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The current provision draws its language from Const 1850, art 13, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">This Court has long recognized that Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5 and the analogous provisions of our previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>constitutions limit the Legislature\u2019s power.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he Legislature may not interfere with the management and control of\u201d universities. <em>Regents, supra </em>at 395 Mich 65. The constitution grants the governing boards authority over \u201cthe absolute management of the University, and the exclusive control of all funds received for its use.\u201d <em>Bd of Agriculture, supra </em>at 226 Mich 424. This Court has \u201cjealously guarded\u201d these powers from legislative interference. <em>Bd of Control of Eastern Michigan Univ v Labor Mediation Bd, </em>384 Mich 561, 565; 184 NW2d 921 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">This Court has not, however, held that universities are exempt from all regulation. In <em>Regents of the Univ of Michigan v Employment Relations Comm, </em>389 Mich 96, 108; 204 NW2d 218 (1973), we quoted <em>Branum v Bd of Regents of the Univ of Michigan, </em>5 Mich App 134, 138-139; 145 NW2d 860 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">It is the opinion of this Court that the legislature can validly exercise its police power for the welfare of the people of this State, and a constitutional corporation such as the board of regents of the University of Michigan can lawfully be affected thereby. The University of Michigan is an independent branch of the government of the State of Michigan, but it is not an island. Within the conf\u00ednes of the operation and the allocation of funds of the University, it is supreme. Without those confines, however, there is no reason to allow the regents to use their independence to thwart the clearly established public policy of the people of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Legislative regulation that clearly infringes on the university\u2019s educational or financial autonomy must, therefore, yield to the university\u2019s constitutional power. Thus, although a university is subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>public employees relations act, MCL 423.201 <em>et seq.) </em>MSA 17.455(1) <em>et seq., </em>the regulation cannot extend into the university\u2019s sphere of educational authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">Because of the unique nature of the University of Michigan . . . the scope of bargaining by [an association of interns, residents, and post-doctoral fellows] may be limited if the subject matter falls clearly within the educational sphere. Some conditions of employment may not be subject to collective bargaining because those particular facets of employment would interfere with the autonomy of the Regents. <em>[Regents, supra </em>at 389 Mich 109.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">See also <em>Central Michigan Univ Faculty Ass\u2019n v Central Michigan Univ, </em>404 Mich 268, 281-283; 273 NW2d 21 (1978). Similarly, although the Legislature may attach conditions to an appropriation, the conditions cannot invade university autonomy. <em>Bd of Agriculture, supra </em>at 226 Mich 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In this case, we do not consider a generally applicable law that implicates university financial autonomy. Rather, we consider a law that dictates the manner in which the university operates on a day-to-day basis. The authority of the governing board is derived from Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">Each board shall have general supervision of its institution .... Each board shall, as often as necessary, elect a president of the institution under its supervision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">We hold that the application of the OMA to the internal operations of the university in selecting a president infringes on defendant\u2019s constitutional power to supervise the institution. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Although a university is not a separate branch of government, our decision in <em>In re 1976 PA 267, </em>400 Mich 660; 255 NW2d 635 (1977), is instructive. In that case, this Court held in a rare advisory opinion that the proposed OMA provision applying the act to this Court during its exercise of rulemaking authority and deliberations regarding administrative orders was unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-3\">The judicial powers derived from the Constitution include rulemaking, supervisory and other administrative powers as well as traditional adjudicative ones. They have been exclusively entrusted to the judiciary by the Constitution and may not be diminished, exercised by, nor interfered with by the other branches of government without constitutional authorization. See <em>Attorney General ex rel Cook v O\u2019Neill, </em>280 Mich 649; 247 NW 445 (1937). It is our opinion that 1976 PA 267 is an impermissible intrusion into the most basic day-to-day exercise of the constitutionally derived judicial powers. <em>[Id. </em>at 663.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Given the constitutional authority to supervise the institution generally, application of the oma to the governing boards of our public universities is likewise beyond the realm of legislative authority. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">That the oma cannot constitutionally be applied to the defendant\u2019s presidential search committee is supported by the language of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1961 recognized that the decision whether to open meetings of university governing boards to the public lay within the boards\u2019 sphere of authority. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4 restricted the boards\u2019 authority by requiring that \u201c[formal sessions of governing boards of such universities shall be open to the public.\u201d The author of the provision explained its purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">Meetings of governing boards of the 3 major universities have been open to the public and news media for the past V2 dozen years and that has been accomplished only after a long period of negotiations. As it stands, the public and news media are present only as a matter of sufferance. They are invited guests of the governing board, an invitation which could be, conceivably, withdrawn at any time. . . . [N]ow that we are creating by constitutional enactment 7 more such governing boards, it would be appropriate that their formal meetings should be conducted in public sessions. [1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1187.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">That the provision is limited to \u201cformal sessions,\u201d rather than all sessions, signifies that the governing boards retain their power to decide whether to hold \u201cinformal\u201d sessions in public. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5, prohibits the Legislature from intruding in this basic day-to-day exercise of the boards\u2019 constitutional power. Nor can application of the OMA rest on the absence of a definition of \u201cformal sessions\u201d in the constitution. Unlike other provisions of the constitution, the Legislature is not delegated the task of defining the phrase \u201cformal sessions\u201d for purposes of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The meetings of the PSC clearly were not \u201cformal\u201d sessions of defendant under the common understanding of that term.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Only four trustees were members of the psc and participated in that phase of the presidential search. Under Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5, the governing board of the university, not the Legislature, has the power to open the meetings of a presidential search committee such as the instant one to the public. Application of the OMA to the PSC is simply an impermissible intrusion on defendant\u2019s constitutional authority to supervise the institution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Under Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4, defendant\u2019s presidential selection process need not have been open to the public except when conducted at a formal session of the board, such as the session at which defendant elected President McPherson.

Accordingly, I write separately to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>my views, which are somewhat more constrained than those of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u201c[I]t is well settled in Michigan that, \u2018[constitutional questions will not be passed upon when other decisive questions are raised by the record which dispose of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lisee v Secretary of State, </em>388 Mich 32, 40-41; 199 NW2d 188 (1972), quoting <em>People v Quider, </em>172 Mich 280, 288-289; 137 NW 546 (1912). This longstanding rule requires us to consider constitutional questions only as a last resort, and to avoid such questions where a nonconstitutional basis exists for resolving the matter. The case before us presents the question whether defendant\u2019s presidential search procedure violated the Open Meetings Act (oma). Long before we need consider the constitutionality of the OMA, we must first logically address the question actually before us, i.e., whether the search in fact violated the OMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">I am in agreement with the reasoning and rationale of Justice Kelly\u2019s dissent with respect to this issue, and concur, for the reasons stated in her opinion, with her finding that the OMA was indeed violated by the search proceeding undertaken by defendant. Accordingly, from this point, and not before, I am required to proceed with an analysis of the constitutional question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In regard to the resolution of this constitutional question, I find persuasive the language and history of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As noted by the majority, a review of the official record regarding this provision would tend to indicate that the framers considered that, where they were constitutionally creating a number of additional university governing boards, they should constitutionally include a provision opening the formal meetings to the public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The obvious logic of this is that the framers thought that such an opening would need to be made constitutionally. Were that the case, a provision such as the oma, enacted by the Legislature, would be insufficient to forcibly open a meeting of the board of a constitutional university. Further, where the framers have determined that only formal sessions of the board need be open, it would appear both that the defendant board complied with the constitutional provisions, and that an attempt to apply the OMA to force further openings of sessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that were less than formal sessions of the board would be constitutionally prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">Accordingly, I am able to agree with the majority that, when applied to the facts of this case, the oma unconstitutionally invades the province of the defendant board to hold less than formal meetings in a closed setting. Because I am not persuaded of the need to rule on issues not directly before us, I would proceed no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Thus, I dissent from the majority\u2019s failure to ascertain whether the oma was violated by defendant\u2019s actions, and from the majority\u2019s departure from our longstanding rule of judicial restraint regarding constitutional questions. For the reasons stated in Justice Kelly\u2019s opinion on this issue, however, I find defendant\u2019s actions to have violated the oma, and thus would address the constitutional question. Given the language and history of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4, it appears that the framers constitutionally required formal meetings of university governing boards to be open, and by this action indicated that meetings of a less than formal nature could be held in a closed setting. The existence of these constitutional parameters leads to the conclusion that a less than constitutional attempt to invade the province of these provisions (i.e., a legislative enactment such as the OMA) must fail. Accordingly, I join in the result, but only a portion of the reasoning, of the majority on this issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\"> Traditionally, we have, as noted above, exhibited a- great reluctance to resolve constitutional questions, and done so only when that was clearly required. Respect for both our constitution and the acts of our Legislature, as well as concepts of judicial restraint, demand no less. The majority appears to act under the theory that the constitutionality of the oma is relevant to whether the Legislature has the power to legislate in a particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>lar area. Of course this is true. The majority\u2019s theory strays, however, in implying we should thus inquire about the constitutionality of an act before considering its effects, since, if it is unconstitutional, it must have no effect. This truism hardly justifies the underlying suggestion, which would, effectively, replace our longstanding rules of judicial restraint and constitutional reluctance with a mandate to address constitutional questions as a preliminary matter of statutory construction. I both challenge the need for such an approach and fear the results of such unwarranted zeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\"> I specifically do not rely on <em>In re 1976 PA 267, </em>400 Mich 660; 255 NW2d 635 (1977), because I find the opinion, which dealt with the interrelation of the judicial and legislative branches, to be distinguishable. Given my reliance on the language of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4, I need not reach any question regarding the applicability of our decisions concerning separate branches of government to university boards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> See 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 1187, quoted by the majority <em>ante </em>at 90.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b181-5\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7-\">(dissenting). This Court granted leave to determine whether the presidential selection procedure utilized by defendant violated the Open Meetings Act (oma), MCL 15.261 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 4.1800(11) <em>et seq. </em>Also at issue is whether application of the oma to committees formed by the governing boards of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>public universities to assist in the selection of university presidents is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to bypass the question whether the OMA was violated. That question must necessarily be answered before addressing whether application of the OMA to defendant is constitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on both questions and hold (1) that the OMA applied to activities of the presidential search committee because it was a public body exercising a government function, and (2) the state constitution is not violated by applying the OMA to defendant\u2019s search committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">DEFENDANT\u2019S VIOLATION OF THE OPEN MEETINGS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">The Court of Appeals held that the search committee was a \u201cpublic body\u201d under the OMA and that, therefore, the OMA applied to its activities. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Under the act, all decisions of a public body must be made at a meeting open to the public. MCL 15.263(2); MSA 4.1800(13)(2). The OMA defines a \u201cdecision\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">a detennination, action, vote, or disposition upon a motion, proposal, recommendation, resolution, order, ordinance, bill, or measure on which a vote by members of a public body is required and by which a public body effectuates or formulates public policy. [MCL 15.262(d); MSA 4.1800(12)(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">It defines a public body as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>any state or local legislative or governing body, including a board, commission, committee, subcommittee, authority, or council, which is empowered by state constitution, statute, charter, ordinance, resolution, or rule to exercise governmental or proprietary authority or perform a governmental or proprietary function, or a lessee thereof performing an essential public purpose and function pursuant to the lease agreement. [MCL 15.262(a); MSA 4.1800(12)(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">The defendant Board of Trustees empowered the presidential search committee by resolution to exercise portions of the governmental authority of the board to select the university\u2019s president. The committee reviewed and studied candidates and reduced the number to be considered by the board as a whole. The parties are in agreement that the search committee narrowed the original field of candidates from over 150 to 4. I believe that its activity in this winnowing process was more than ministerial in nature, being that it involved review, discussion, and evaluation of the relative merits of the candidates. It was a form of decision making.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Once a committee is determined to be a public body, a meeting of a quorum of that body is subject to the act. In this case, the search committee was composed of four trustees and nine lay members. Thus, seven members constituted a quorum. Alternatively, if only trustees are considered, a quorum would be three. However, even a subquorum committee has been held to be subject to the oma.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">For example, in <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Univ of Mich Bd of </em>Regents,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this Court specified that the intent of the Legislature in enacting the oma was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>remedy the ineffectiveness of the 1968 open meetings statute and \u201cpromote a new era in governmental accountability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. We explained that \u201c[t]he deliberation of public policy in the public forum is an important check and balance on self-government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. To further this policy, Michigan courts have \u201chistorically interpreted the statute broadly, while strictly construing its exemptions and imposing on public bodies the burden of proving that an exemption exists.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We held that the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan is a public body under the OMA. <em>Id. </em>at 225. We continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">The selection of a university president is one of the board\u2019s most important exercises of governmental authority. If it establishes any form of subcommittee and empowers that subcommittee by \u201cresolution or rule\u201d to exercise this particular governmental authority, then that subcommittee is also a \u201cpublic body\u201d within the meaning of the act. <em>[Id. </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acr\"><em>Booth Newspapers </em>further held that selection of a president, whether by a one-person committee, some other committee, or the whole board, constitutes the exercise of governmental authority. Whatever the composition of the selection body, it is a public body under the OMA. <em>Id. </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The search committee in this case was composed of fully one-half of the members of the Board of Trustees. It was given the same authority as that given the one-person committee in <em>Booth Newspapers. </em>Applying the analysis in <em>Booth Newspapers, </em>I conclude that the search committee in this case was a public body. Moreover, it engaged in decision making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>by determining which candidates would be presented as finalists to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">Therefore, both the reasoning in <em>Booth Newspapers </em>and a straightforward reading of the oma indicate that the presidential search committee was a public body. As such, the committee violated the oma when it reduced the number of candidates in private session, when it reviewed applications, and when it interviewed applicants in private. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">the constitutionality of applying the oma IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The majority holds that application of the oma to the internal operations of the university in selecting a president infringes on the university\u2019s constitutional power to supervise itself. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Michigan Constitution states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">[T]he trustees of Michigan State University and their successors in office shall constitute a body corporate known as the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University. . . . [It] shall have general supervision of its institution . . . [and] shall, as often as necessary, elect a president of the institution under its supervision. [Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">It also requires that formal sessions of governing bodies of institutions, including Michigan State University, be open to the public. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">When reviewing constitutional provisions, our objective is to give effect to the intent of the people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>who adopted the constitution. <em>Livingston Co v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; Bridget, </em>430 Mich 635, 641-642; 425 NW2d 65 (1988); <em>Macomb Co Taxpayers Ass\u2019n v L'Anse Creuse Public Schools, </em>213 Mich App 71, 78; 540 NW2d 684 (1995).

In <em>W T Andrew </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Co v Mid-State Surety </em>Corp,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we held that, although the University of Michigan was a constitutionally created corporation, the public works bond statute could be applied to it through the Legislature\u2019s police power.

We found that the public employees relations act could be applied to state universities without violating their constitutional autonomy. <em>Id. </em>at 108. We referred to <em>Branum v Univ of Mich </em>Regents,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> holding that, whereas universities have independence in educational matters, they are still a part of the state government. Therefore, the Legislature can waive the universities\u2019 rights to governmental immunity, as it did for other bodies in the state government. <em>Id. </em>at 137-138. In particular, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">It is the opinion of this Court that the legislature can validly exercise its police power for the welfare of the people of this State, and a constitutional corporation such as the board of regents of the University of Michigan can lawfully be affected thereby. The University of Michigan is an independent branch of the government of the State of Michigan, but it is not an island. Within the confines of the operation and the allocation of funds of the University, it is supreme. Without these confines, however, there is no reason to allow the regents to use their independence to thwart the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>clearly established public policy of the people of Michigan. <em>[Id. </em>at 138-139.][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">While I agree with the majority that \u201cthe Legislature may not interfere with the management and control of\u201d universities,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> I disagree with its conclusion that the oma infringes defendant\u2019s constitutional power to supervise the institution. The oma is not aimed at any activities peculiar to the university and does not attempt to change or disturb its educational activities. Although it requires that the process of selecting a university president be done in public, it does not tell the board what the criteria should be for selection. It does not dictate the process or the person to be selected. What it does require is, when interviewing candidates and when making a detailed review of applications, that the university function in public meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">I cannot conclude that this requirement divests the board of its authority to select a president. The majority holds that application of the oma to the presidential selection process infringes defendant\u2019s constitutional power to supervise the university. However, it makes no attempt to explain what constitutes the infringement. I submit there is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>In re 1976 PA 267,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is misplaced. In that case, this Court noted that the powers of government were divided among three branches of government pursuant to Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2. It further noted that the separation of powers set forth in the constitution was \u201cdesigned to preserve the independence of the three branches of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. Incontestably, the judiciary is one branch. Although various cases have stated that public universities are government branches coequal with the Legislature, the constitution contains no provision that elevates them to a separate branch, like the judiciary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since autonomous state universities have not achieved that status under the constitution, and <em>In re 1976 PA 267 </em>dealt with a separate branch, it is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">Also, the majority states that \u201capplication of the OMA to the governing boards of our public universities is . . . beyond the realm of legislative authority.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 89. The issue here is whether the OMA applies to only one function of the boards, the selection of the universities\u2019 presidents. The majority provides no basis for concluding that the oma has no application to the remaining functions of the boards. Its statement in this regard could well be misleading to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u201cSunshine laws,\u201d such as the OMA, were adopted in Michigan as early as 1895. <em>Wexford Co Prosecutor v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Pranger, </em>83 Mich App 197, 201, n 5; 268 NW2d 344 (1978).
