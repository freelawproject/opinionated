Specifically, we are presented with the question whether an employer being sued for sex discrimination based upon the terms of a collective bargaining agreement may seek contribution from a union that was a party to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>labor agreement. We hold that Michigan law permits an employer to bring such a contribution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Plaintiff Christina Donajkowski began working for defendant Alpena Power Company in 1985. In 1986, she became a meter reader, and the first female member of Local 286, Utility Workers of America, AFL-CIO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff Beth McDonald joined Donajkowski as a meter reader and member of the union in 1989. Later that year, Alpena Power and the union negotiated a three-year collective bargaining agreement that created a new classification entitled \u201cgeneral labor/meter reader.\u201d Donajkowski and McDonald were placed in this new classification. Pursuant to the agreement, the wage range for the new classification was between $7.50 and $10.50 an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Because the members of the new classification, which included two men, had been making more than $10.50 an hour before the agreement, the agreement froze their wages. The two men in the general labor/meter reader classification moved into other classifications before the agreement took effect, leaving only plaintiffs Donajkowski and McDonald in the general labor/meter reader classification. The agreement provided pay increases for the other union classifications. There were no women in these other classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Alpena Power hired plaintiff Deedra Duranceau into the general labor/meter reader classification in 1990. Duranceau started at $7.50 an hour and received regular increases until she reached the $10.50 maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">When Alpena Power and the union could not agree on a new contract in 1992, Alpena Power instituted the terms of its last best offer and union members worked without a contract. Defendant\u2019s last best offer maintained the basic structure of the 1989 collective bargaining agreement insofar as it maintained the maximum wage for the general labor/meter reader classification while providing increases for the other classifications. The effect of these terms was to freeze the wages of the three female union members \u2014 all of whom were in the general labor/meter reader classification \u2014 while granting increases for the remaining classifications, which were populated by male union members. However, nonunion female employees also received pay increases during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In 1993, plaintiffs and the union filed suit against Alpena Power alleging sex discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.] </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq., </em>and the Equal Pay Act, 29 USC 206(d)(1). After the union was dismissed as a party-plaintiff pursuant to stipulation, defendant filed a third-party complaint seeking contribution from the union in the event defendant was found liable to plaintiffs. Defendant argued that the union should be jointly liable for any discrimination stemming from the collective bargaining agreement because that agreement was the result of negotiation between defendant and the union. The trial court allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>third-party complaint, over the union\u2019s protest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Eventually, the trial court also granted summary disposition for defendant on plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Plaintiffs and the union then appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed the grant of summary disposition, but affirmed the decision allowing the third-party complaint against the union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alpena Power and the union both sought leave to appeal. We denied Alpena Power\u2019s application, but granted leave to the union.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the merits of the underlying claims are not at issue here, and we only concern ourselves with the propriety of defendant\u2019s third-party complaint against the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The parties correctly assert that a claim for sex discrimination sounds in tort. See <em>Stimson v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>77 Mich App 361, 366, n 3; 258 NW2d 227 (1977). Our Legislature has declared that there is a right of contribution among joint tortfeasors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">Except as otherwise provided in this act, when 2 or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to a person or property or for the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them. [MCL 600.2925a(l); MSA 27A.2925(1)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The defendant employer contends that, to the extent it is liable to plaintiffs for sex discrimination, the union is liable as a joint tortfeasor under the statute. For its part, the union contends: (1) an intentional tortfeasor may not seek contribution, and (2) the Civil Rights Act should be construed as prohibiting any attempt by an employer to seek contribution from a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">As explained below, we are not persuaded by the union\u2019s arguments, and we conclude, as did the trial court and the Court of Appeals, that the plain language of the contribution statute permits defendant to pursue a third-party claim against the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">We review questions of statutory construction de novo. <em>McAuley v General Motors Corp, </em>457 Mich 513, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998). In construing a statute, our purpose is to ascertain and to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Reardon v Mental Health Dep\u2019t, </em>430 Mich 398, 407; 424 NW2d 248 (1988). If the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute reflects the legislative intent and judicial construction is not permitted. <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). We must give the words of a statute their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">A. THE CONTRIBUTION STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">At common law, courts have often drawn distinctions between intentional and nonintentionai tortfeasors vis-a-vis their right to seek contribution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, Michigan common law prohibits an intentional tortfeasor from seeking contribution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, our Legislature has not seen fit to maintain that common-law distinction in our statutory scheme. Thus, unlike a number of other states, our contribution statute does not include any limitation or prohibition concerning intentional tortfeasors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whatever the pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>icy arguments for or against such a rule,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we conclude that the Legislature has unambiguously provided that contribution may be had between tortfeasors without regard to the intentional character of their acts, and we are not at liberty to ignore the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The union relies upon a number of cases addressing the distinction between intentional and nonintentional tortfeasors. Most of those cases dealt with the common law. See <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314; 174 NW2d 797 (1970), overruled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>part on other grounds in <em>Hapner v Rolf Brauchli, Inc, </em>404 Mich 160, 182, n 5; 273 NW2d 822 (1978); <em>Caldwell v Fox, </em>394 Mich 401; 231 NW2d 46 (1975); <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co of Maryland v Newman, </em>109 Mich App 620; 311 NW2d 821 (1981); <em>Johnson v Bundy, </em>129 Mich App 393; 342 NW2d 567 (1983). In addition, the facts in <em>Moyses, Caldwell, </em>and <em>Johnson </em>involved negligence, breach of warranty, or products liability, rather than intentional torts. Thus, to the extent that any of these cases suggest that the contribution statute does not apply to intentional tortfeasors, they do so only in dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The only Michigan case that directly addresses the statutory contribution rule is <em>Hunt v Chrysler, </em>68 Mich App 744, 747-750; 244 NW2d 16 (1976), where the Court concluded that an intentional tortfeasor <em>may </em>bring an action for contribution under the statute. The union does cite one federal case, <em>In re Air Crash at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, </em>791 F Supp 1204, 1226 (ED Mich, 1992), wherein the federal district court stated that \u201cMichigan courts have ruled that an intentional tortfeasor may not recover contribution under the [contribution statute].\u201d However the court in <em>In re Air Crash </em>was mistaken; no Michigan court has so held. The court in <em>In re Air Crash </em>confused the Michigan common-law rule with that established in the Michigan contribution statute, and essentially relied on dicta from the cases it cited for this proposition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that, on the basis of its plain and unambiguous terms, the Michigan contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tion statute, with specific exceptions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> authorizes an intentional tortfeasor to seek contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">B. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The union also argues that the Civil Rights Act should be read to preclude an action for contribution brought by an employer against a union. The union does not point to any language in the act requiring or even hinting at such a result. Instead, the union relies on a case involving title vn, the federal counterpart to our Civil Rights Act. In <em>Northwest Airlines v Transport Workers Union of America, </em>451 US 77, 90-95; 101 S Ct 1571; 67 L Ed 2d 750 (1981), the United States Supreme Court found that title vn did not provide an employer charged with a civil rights violation with a right to contribution from the union. The Court also concluded that, in the absence of congressional authorization, the Court was without authority to grant an employer such a right. <em>Id. </em>at 95-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">While we often examine federal law in construing our Civil Rights Act, Michigan law is not analogous to federal law on this point. Under federal law, there is no statutory right to contribution, whereas in Michigan there is. Under these circumstances, <em>Northwest Airlines </em>is wholly inapplicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The union additionally argues that the Civil Rights Act \u201cimpliedly repealed\u201d the contribution statute. We find no merit in this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">We will only infer the repeal of a statute in narrow circumstances, and there is a strong presumption against such a finding. <em>House Speaker v State Administrative Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 563; 495 NW2d 539 (1993). A repeal may be inferred: (1) when it is clear that a subsequent legislative act conflicts with a prior act, or (2) when a subsequent act of the Legislature clearly is intended to occupy the entire field covered by a prior enactment. <em>Id. </em>Here, the union has failed to meet the heavy burden of establishing either of these criteria. Nothing in the Civil Rights Act directly conflicts with the contribution statute, nor is there any evidence that the Civil Rights Act was intended to address, much less completely occupy, the field of contribution. Under these circumstances, there is absolutely no basis for finding that the contribution statute has been impliedly repealed by the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">C. PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Finally, the union argues that public policy precludes an employer from seeking contribution from a union. We are unaware of, and the union has failed to identify the source of, any free-standing public policy that would operate to protect a wrongdoer from paying for its own discriminatory actions. Indeed, the articulated legislative policy of this state is that discrimination in employment on the basis of sex is forbidden. MCL 37.2202; MSA 3.548(202). If, as defendant has alleged in its contribution action, the union was complicit with defendant in discriminating, then they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>are both wrongdoers and neither should be able to escape liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We find it easier to consolidate our response to the dissent, rather than providing it piecemeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The dissent has taken on the leviathan burden of justifying the position that plaintiffs\u2019 union may escape liability for its alleged role in fostering employment discrimination in the workplace. Stripped to its essentials, the dissent would hold that a union may conspire to discriminate on the basis of sex, and, when called to account at the bar of justice for its role in that conspiracy by the others charged, escape liability. Thus, the dissent would grant this union a blanket immunity from contribution that is unavailable to any other person, corporation, or entity in our state.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">To make the matter plain, the legal question posed by this case is simple: Where a plaintiff has alleged that the terms of a collective bargaining agreement negotiated by her employer <em>and </em>her union discriminate against her on the basis of her gender, may the union escape liability for its asserted complicity in that act of discrimination? As set forth above, we hold that the union is accountable for its role in any alleged discrimination in the workplace and is subject to a contribution action as a joint tortfeasor. By contrast, the dissent concludes that a union alleged to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>complicit in workplace sex discrimination is nonetheless immune from contribution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The dissent\u2019s answer to this charge is that the plaintiffs are free to file a discrimination suit against then-union. The dissent fails to point out that this is true in all cases involving joint tortfeasors; a plaintiff is always free to file suit against any or all tortfeasors. Yet, our Legislature has seen fit to allow contribution among joint tortfeasors, even when the plaintiff chooses not to sue all of them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The dissent\u2019s recognition that plaintiffs are free to sue their union also seems to contradict the dissent\u2019s primary argument, that plaintiffs here (and, perhaps, plaintiffs in general) need the assistance of their union in order to maintain a discrimination suit. We find it odd that the dissent urges union litigation support as its primary policy rationale for avoiding contribution liability. While assisting union members with litigation may be a laudatory union object, surely it is secondary to the union\u2019s core duty to negotiate and administer labor agreements. The irony here is that plaintiffs contend that their union negotiated pay provisions that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>discriminatory. We are not prepared to overlook a union\u2019s alleged discrimination in performing this core duty in order to further one of the union\u2019s secondary functions, and we do not believe that the dissent\u2019s rationale for granting this union a \u201cfree pass\u201d can withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A. THE DISSENT\u2019S STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The linchpin of the dissent\u2019s argument that a union charged with discrimination in the workplace may not be held accountable for such discrimination is its \u201cconstruction\u201d of the contribution statute. The dissent acknowledges that the contribution statute, according to its plain terms, allows contribution among \u201cjoint tortfeasors.\u201d The dissent further recognizes that the statute does not distinguish between joint tortfeasors whose conduct injures by intentional design and those whose conduct injures by negligence. Notwithstanding the absence of any supporting language in the statute, the dissent finds a legislative intent to distinguish between the two kinds of joint tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The dissent relies in part on one of our longstanding rules of statutory construction \u2014 that statutes enacted in derogation of the common law are narrowly construed. After properly stating the rule, however, the dissent immediately misapplies it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Relying upon <em>Moyses, supra, </em>the dissent asserts that the term \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d was a term of art defined in our common law to refer only to <em>negligent </em>tortfeasors. Even if this were true, it is simply irrelevant: four years after <em>Moyses </em>was decided, our Legislature amended the contribution statute to remove any reference to the phrase \u201cjoint tortfeasors.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, to the extent the Court in <em>Moyses </em>addressed a right of contribution among intentional tortfeasors, it did so only in dicta; the issue before the Court there was whether several, but not joint, tortfeasors could seek contribution. There was simply no allegation that any of the defendants in <em>Moyses </em>were intentional tortfeasors. Yet the dissent appears prepared to treat <em>Moyses </em>as binding authority on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Despite evidence of a legislative intent to eliminate any distinction between negligent and intentional tortfeasors, the dissent attempts to revive the contrary dicta from <em>Moyses </em>by pointing out that our Legislature has not seen fit to overrule that dicta. Aside from the obvious fallacy in this argument (why would this or any other court expect the Legislature to react to dicta?), we note that the Legislature only amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the contribution statute to bring it into conformity with the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act in 1974,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> four years after <em>Moyses </em>was decided. It was at this point that the Legislature apparently made the decision not to adopt the model act\u2019s provision prohibiting contribution among intentional tortfeasors. Thus, if we accept the dissent\u2019s argument that silence can be an indication of legislative intent (which, as made clear below, we do not), the Legislature, by its decision in 1974 not to adopt the intentional tortfeasor provision of the model act, has already \u201coverruled\u201d <em>Moyses </em>on this point.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In response to the dissent\u2019s legislative acquiescence argument, we must take this opportunity to observe that legislative acquiescence is an exceedingly poor indicator of legislative intent. Justice Taylor took great pains to point this out last term in <em>Rogers v Detroit, </em>457 Mich 125, 163-166; 579 NW2d 840 (1998), and his remarks regarding the majority opinion in that case apply equally to the dissent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">[The majority\u2019s legislative acquiescence argument] is remarkable indeed and is perhaps what former Harvard University Law School Professor Thomas Reed Powell meant when he said in discussing legislative acquiescence arguments of this type:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201c \u2018[C]ongress has a wonderful power that only judges and lawyers know about. Congress has a power to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>silent. ... Of course when congress keeps silent, it takes an expert to know what it means. But the judges are experts. They say that congress by keeping silent sometimes means that it is keeping silent and sometimes means that it is speaking.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Report to the Attorney General, Using and Misusing Legislative History: A Re-Evaluation of the Status of Legislative History in Statutory Interpretation, </em>U S Dep\u2019t of Justice, Office of Legal Policy, January 5, 1989, p 110, n 475, citing Powell, <em>The Still Small Voice of the Commerce Clause, </em>in 3 Selected Essays on Constitutional Law 931, 932 (Ass\u2019n of American Law Schools 1938), quoted in Tribe, <em>Toward a syntax of the unsaid: Construing the sounds of congressional and constitutional silence, </em>57 Ind L J 515, 522 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">I believe that the majority\u2019s legislative factual history argument ... is, as Justice Scalia so aptly said of similar legislative history arguments, \u201cfrail substitute!] for bicameral vote upon the text of a law and its presentment to the [executive].\u201d <em>Thompson v Thompson, </em>484 US 174, 192; 108 S Ct 513; 98 L Ed 2d 512 (1988). In fact, if such \u201chistory\u201d tells us anything, its meaning eludes me. At the very most, it is a \u201chistory\u201d that allows the reader, with equal plausibility, to pose a conclusion of his own that differs from that of the majority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The majority\u2019s analysis poses yet a further problem, for it should not be assumed that the Legislature even agrees it has a duty to correct interpretations by the courts that it considers erroneous. As Judge Stephen Markman, of our Court of Appeals, insightfully observed on this topic in one of his scholarly writings, \u201cno sensible theory of statutory interpretation would require Congress to devote a substantial portion of its time to extinguishing judicial forest fires.\u201d Markman, <em>On interpretation and non-interpretation, </em>3 Benchmark 219, 226, n 60 (1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">As is clear, in my view, this case is an excellent example of the misuse of the doctrine of legislative acquiescence. Indeed, whether it can ever be appropriate to use legislative acquiescence has in the past been the subject of heated debate on this Court. In <em>Autio v Proksch Construction Co, </em>377 Mich 517, 527; 141 NW2d 81 (1966), Justice Souris described it as \u201ca pernicious evil designed to relieve a court of its duty of self-correction\u201d and indicated that it \u201chas been examined and rejected by this Court before, but its current resurrection demands we perform the task once more lest our silence be construed as signifying its unanswerable validity.\u201d In the course of his discussion, Justice Souris quoted language from <em>Van Dorpel v Haven-Busch Co, </em>350 Mich 135, 145-146; 85 NW2d 97 (1957), which is worthy, of consideration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\u201cNow this beguiling doctrine of legislative assent by silence possesses a certain undeniable logic and charm. Nor are we oblivious to the flattery implicit therein; double flattery, in fact; flattery both to the profound learning and wisdom of the particular supreme court which has spoken, and flattery to a presumably alert and eagerly responsive State legislature. One pictures the legislators of our various States periodically clamoring and elbowing each other in their zeal to get at the pearls of wisdom embalmed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>latest decisions and advance sheets of their respective supreme courts \u2014 and thenceforth indicating their unbounded approval by a vast and permanent silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">\u201cYet there are several dark shadows in this picture. For one, it suggests a legislative passion for reading and heeding the decisions of our supreme courts which we suspect may be scarcely borne out by the facts. For another, pushed too far such a doctrine suggests the interesting proposition that it is the legislatures which have now become the ultimate courts of last resort in our various States; that if they delay long enough to correct our errors those errors thus become both respectable and immutably frozen; and, finally, the larger and more dismal corollary that if enough people persist long enough in ignoring an injustice it thereby becomes just.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">If it has not been clear in our previous decisions, we wish to make it clear now: \u201clegislative acquiescence\u201d is a highly disfavored doctrine of statutory construction; sound principles of statutory construction require that Michigan courts determine the Legislature\u2019s intent from its <em>words, </em>not from its silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Finally, we note that the dissent would use legislative acquiescence to bind the Legislature not only to our past holdings, but also to mere dicta. We think it presumptuous to bind the Legislature to that which we do not even bind ourselves. <em>Hett v Duffy, </em>346 Mich 456, 461; 78 NW2d 284 (1956), overruled on other grounds in <em>Weller v Mancha (On Rehearing), </em>353 Mich 189, 194; 91 NW2d 352 (1958).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Heaven for-fend if the Legislature is obligated to respond to every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>excursus of the third branch or else be deemed bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The language of the contribution statute plainly allows contribution among joint tortfeasors of all stripes. We are unconvinced by the dissent\u2019s effort to look beyond the words of the statute and find a distinction between intentional and negligent tortfeasors that is otherwise unapparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">B. THE DISSENT\u2019S VIEWS ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Again we agree with the generic proposition propounded by the dissent that Michigan courts frequently look to the federal law arising under title vn for guidance in construing our own Civil Rights Act. <em>Koester v City of Novi, </em>458 Mich 1, 11-12; 580 NW2d 835 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">However, we disagree that the <em>Northwest Airlines </em>decision provides aid to the union\u2019s attempt to avoid contribution liability for discrimination in which the union participated. As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Northwest, </em>title vn contained no provision touching upon contribution and there was no federal statute authorizing contribution. In the absence of any federal statute supporting a contribution action, the Supreme Court declined to impose one, believing this to be a legislative prerogative of the Congress. This is precisely the opposite of our situation; Michigan\u2019s Legislature <em>has </em>exercised its prerogative by creating a general right of contribution among joint tortfeasors. This being the case, <em>Northwest </em>is entirely inapposite and provides no support for the dissent\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>C. THE DISSENT\u2019S PUBLIC POLICY ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">As stated previously, we find no basis for a \u201cfree floating\u201d public policy argument that the union may escape liability for its alleged participation in gender discrimination. Without a single citation of authority, the dissent suggests a public policy based upon the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">A union is designed to advance the interests of its members. ... By permitting an employer to seek contribution from [it], the majority creates a conflict of interest, placing a union and its members in an adversarial posture . . . [and] denying [employees] access to legal representation from their unions. <em>[Post </em>at 275-276.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We find no inherent contradiction between the union\u2019s duty to its members and its obligation to avoid participating in discriminatory practices prohibited by the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That is, there is no conflict between one statutory policy that says a union\u2019s duty is to its members, and another statutory policy that prohibits a union from conspiring to injure a union member. In fact, these propositions are in total harmony. If there is a conflict of interest in this case between the plaintiff and her union, it arises because our Civil Rights Act precludes her union from participating in unlawful employment discrimination. To the extent that the union here may have participated in negotiating the terms of a collective bargaining agreement that resulted in gender discrimination, the dissent has failed to articulate any sound public policy that justifies insulating the union from liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>such misconduct. Indeed, we believe that holding the union accountable for such misconduct via a contribution action will actually support the fundamental goal of our Civil Rights Act to eradicate discriminatory employment practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Surely, all would agree that the goal of the Civil Rights Act is broadly to prevent discrimination in the workplace. But the dissent apparently believes that the union here should enjoy some special protected status unavailable to any other person or entity. The dissent simply fails to adequately explain the reason for and the source of a public policy that would provide a free pass to this union (or any other entity) alleged to have participated in such discrimination. In sum, given the choice between vindicating Michigan\u2019s civil rights laws and protecting this union, the dissent has chosen the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In light of the plain language of the contribution statute, we find no evidence of a legislative intent to preclude an employer from seeking contribution from a union in this context.

Until 1974, the Michigan contribution act was apparently based on the 1939 version of the uniform act. See the history appended to 1948 CL 691.561. In 1974, the Michigan Legislature amended the statute, and adopted most of the provisions of the 1955 revision of the uniform act. The 1955 revision of the uniform act provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, where two or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same ir\\jury to person or property or for the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3s\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>(c) There is no right of contribution in favor of any tortfeasor who has <em>intentionally </em>[wilfully or wantonly] caused or contributed to the injury or wrongful death. [12 ULA 194 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">A number of other states have adopted subdivision 1(c) in some form. See Ariz Rev Stat Ann 12-2501(0); Cal Civ Proc Code 875(d); Colo Rev Stat Ann 13-50.5-102(3); Fla Stat Ann 768.31(c); Nev Rev Stat 17.255; NC Gen Stat 1B-I(c); ND Cent Code 32-38-01(3); Ohio Rev Code Ann 2307.32(A); Okla Stat Ann, tit 12, \u00a7 832(C); SC Code Ann 15-38-20(C); Term Code Ann 29-ll-102(c). At least two states have adopted different language, which presumably has a similar effect. See Ky Rev Stat Ann 412.030 and Va Code 8.01-34, which both state: \u201cContribution among wrongdoers may be enforced when the wrong results from negligence and involves no moral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">Thus, it is particularly noteworthy that the Michigan Legislature declined to adopt the subsection of the uniform act prohibiting an intentional tortfeasor from seeking contribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b336-14\"> We note that there are persuasive policy arguments supporting both sides of the question whether intentional tortfeasors should be able to seek contribution.

As noted above, <em>Johnson </em>did not involve an intentional tort, and did not directly address this issue. Similarly, <em>Salim </em>involved a negligence action, and only reached this issue in dicta. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\"> The statute specifically states that it does not apply in certain cases, such as those involving breaches of trust or other fiduciary obligations.

The merits of such a claim are to be resolved in the contribution action. The only issue posed in this case is whether the union is amenable to a contribution action under our contribution statute because of its participation in negotiating terms of a collective bargaining agreement that plaintiff has alleged to be sexually discriminatory in her action against her employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\"> We note that this Court has already dismissed the dissent\u2019s argument. See <em>CaldweU, supra </em>at 420 (\u201c[Plaintiff\u2019s caprice in choosing to join or not to join third-party defendants is not determinant of third-party plaintiffs\u2019 right to contribution\u201d). Indeed, we believe that allowing a plaintiff to determine the allocation of liability unilaterally is antithetical to the purpose of a contribution statute. See <em>Markey v Skog, </em>129 NJ Super 192, 201; 322 A2d 513 (1974) (The policy of a contribution statute \u201cseeks to prevent plaintiffs, by their unilateral actions, from electing where to place the burden of a common fault\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> We note that this venerable rule acts as a guide to the courts in construing statutes, not as a limitation on the Legislature. In other words, the fact that a statute enacted in derogation of the common law must be construed narrowly is not to say that the Legislature is precluded from changing the common law. Quite the contrary; our Legislature is always free to change the common law. Indeed, it has express constitutional authority to do so. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 7; <em>Myers v Genesee Co Auditor, </em>375 Mich 1, 7; 133 NW2d 190 (1965) (O\u2019Hara, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">As we previously noted, in enacting the contribution statute, our Legislature chose to abandon all of the restrictions that the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>imposed on contribution actions among joint tortfeasors. As the dissent recognizes, the contribution statute at issue here was based upon the model contribution act that itself retained the prohibition recognized in our common law after <em>Moyses </em>\u2014 that <em>intentional </em>tortfeasors could not maintain a contribution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The fact that our Legislature did not include this restriction in adopting its version of the model contribution act is significant to any good-faith effort to give meaning to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Gibson v Neelis, </em>227 Mich App 187, 194; 575 NW2d 313 (1997) (\u201c[Djeviation from the language in a model act is presumed to be deliberate\u201d). The deletion of the model act\u2019s provision restricting contribution among intentional tortfeasors is clearly inconsistent with an intent to maintain any distinction between intentional and negligent tortfeasors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> 1974 PA 318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\"> 1974 PA 318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\"> The dissent asserts that this Court \u201ccontinued to recognize the distinction between intentional and nonintentional tortfeasors in <em>Downie v Kent Products, Inc, </em>420 Mich 197, 217; 362 NW2d 605 (1984).\u201d <em>Post </em>at 269, n 5.

In addition, it prohibits employees from acquiring legal representation from their union, thereby increasing the costs of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">This case involves statutory interpretation, which is a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>Oakland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Co Bd of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Michigan Property &amp; Casualty Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>456 Mich 590, 610; 575 NW2d 751 (1998). The primary purpose of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">When promulgating new laws, the Legislature is presumed to be familiar with the rules of statutory construction and existing laws on the same subject. <em>Malcolm v East Detroit, </em>437 Mich 132, 139; 468 NW2d 479 (1991); <em>People v Tracy, </em>186 Mich App 171, 177; 463 NW2d 457 (1990). Therefore, the language of a statute should be read in light of previously established rules of common law. <em>Nummer v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>448 Mich 534, 544; 533 NW2d 250 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Any word or phrase that has a unique meaning at common law should be interpreted as having the same meaning when used in a statute dealing with the same subject. <em>Pulver v Dundee Cement Co, </em>445 Mich 68, 75; 515 NW2d 728 (1994). Because well-settled common-law principles must not be abolished by implication, an ambiguous statute that contravenes common law should be interpreted to make the least change in the common law. <em>Marquis v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity (After Remand), </em>444 Mich 638, 652-653; 513 NW2d 799 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">THE CONTRIBUTION STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">At common law, as a general rule, contribution was not recoverable between joint wrongdoers or tortfeasors. <em>O'Dowd v General Motors Corp, </em>419 Mich 597, 603; 358 NW2d 553 (1984). The Legislature partially abrogated this common-law bar by adopting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>predecessors to MCL 600.2925a; MSA 27A.2925(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and this Court abolished the remnants of it in <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314, 329; 174 NW2d 797 (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Dowd, supra </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In <em>Moyses, </em>this Court recognized that the phrase \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d had a unique meaning at common law. <em>Id., </em>329-331.

Moreover, <em>Moyses </em>rejected the majority\u2019s conclusions by explicitly excepting wilful or intentional wrongdoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Addressing whether joint tortfeasors are entitled to seek contribution under then \u00a7 2925, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">Stimulated by the national advancement of principles set forth in the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act [ucata] . . . the tendency of other courts to provide by judicial action the right of contribution on behalf of all but intentional wrongdoers, and the compelling admonitions of modem writers like Prosser,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] we have decided to overrule what is left of Michigan\u2019s common-law bar of contribution between or among \u201cwrong-doers,\u201d <em>wilful or intentional wrongdoers excepted.

Despite the absence of such a prohibition, this Court interpreted both the common law and the predecessor to \u00a7 2925a to conclude that intentional tortfeasors were barred from seeking contribution. <em>Moyses, supra </em>at 334.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is \u201cparticularly noteworthy\u201d because the Michigan Legislature failed to expressly permit contribution among intentional tortfeasors when it enacted the present version of \u00a7 2925a.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Silence by the Legislature following judicial construction of a statute suggests consent to that construction. <em>Craig v Larson, </em>432 Mich 346, 353; 439 NW2d 899 (1989).

A phrase that acquires a unique meaning at common law should be interpreted as having that same meaning when used in a statute dealing with the same subject. <em>Pulver, supra </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Given the Legislature\u2019s presumptive familiarity with rules of statutory interpretation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the language of the statute indicates that the Legislature intended only to permit contribution among negligent, or nonintentional, tortfeasors. Had the Legislature intended to permit contribution among intentional tortfeasors, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>would have so provided. Therefore, the majority has erred by interpreting \u00a7 2925a in a manner that contravenes common-law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">the civil rights act</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The language of the Michigan Civil Rights Act closely parallels language adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency vested by Congress to enforce title vn, defining sexual discrimination. <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 381; 501 NW2d 155 (1993). Although the majority criticizes the defendant union for relying on federal authority, this Court often turns to federal precedent for guidance in reaching a decision. <em>Id., </em>381-382; <em>Sumner v Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co, </em>427 Mich 505, 525; 398 NW2d 368 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In <em>Northwest Airlines v Transport Workers Union of America,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an employer paid male cabin attendants higher wages than its female attendants pursuant to a fixed-wage scheme contained in a collective bargaining agreement. As a result, the employer was held hable to its female employees for backpay, because its collectively bargained wage differentials violated the Equal Pay Act and title VII. <em>Id., </em>79-82. The employer then sought contribution from the unions that negotiated the collective bargaining agreement with it. <em>Id., </em>82.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Assuming that the unions bore significant responsibility for the discriminatory practices, the United States Supreme Court nevertheless concluded that the employer was not entitled to contribution for intentional discrimination. <em>Id., </em>90, 95. It explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>that neither title vn nor the Equal Pay Act provided employers with a right to contribution for intentional discrimination, and a general right to contribution did not exist under common law. <em>Id., </em>92-96. It also declined to create a right to contribution in addition to the statutory rights created in the Equal Pay Act and title VII. <em>Id., </em>98.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The majority here attempts to distinguish federal law by stating that there is no statutory right to contribution under federal law. Although Michigan law contains a statutory right to contribution, the majority disregards the absence of any provision permitting contribution for intentional tortfeasors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, the majority has created a right to contribution for intentional tortfeasors in addition to the statutory rights created by the Michigan Civil Rights Act, but attempts to attribute its creation to the Legislature. <em>Ante </em>at 262. Consequently, the majority erroneously asserts that <em>\u201cNorthwest </em>is entirely inapposite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Finally, the majority finds itself \u201cunaware of . . . any free-standing public policy\u201d precluding an employer from seeking contribution from a union. <em>Ante </em>at 253. I believe that, as a matter of public pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>icy, precluding an employer from seeking contribution from a union protects the relationship between a union and its members. A union is designed to advance the interests of its members.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the majority emphasizes that \u201cthe union\u2019s core duty [is] to negotiate and administer labor agreements,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it fails to explain how undermining this relationship advances this goal. By permitting an employer to seek contribution from the union, the majority creates a conflict of interest, placing a union and its members in an adversarial posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">Union counsel presented persuasive comment regarding this policy during oral argument, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">[I]f in fact whenever there is alleged discrimination the union is going to find itself hauled into court defending itself at great expense and unable to assist its members, as it may very well want to do, that is not going to assist enforcement of the [Civil Rights] Act. It is going to deter enforcement of the act. The union here is not able to help its members. It is put at cross purposes with its members, and the employer ought not be able to create, at its will, ... a barrier between the union and its members which precludes the union from giving the assistance it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>needs. If the union has, in fact, injured its members and the members are so convinced, they can sue it. But where the employer is able in this instance as it would be under this Court of Appeals decision, if the employer is able to separate the union from its members, and to put the employees who have sued, in this instance the three women, in a position where their union realizes that if the employees prevail the union is going to be probably bankrupt and possibly even \u2014 it\u2019s possible that if the union lost here and if the employer prevailed, that because it is a small and voluntary unincorporated association, as most unions are, most unions are unincorporated associations, it is possible that liability could be imposed upon the individual members. What I\u2019m saying is that it does not serve the policy of [the Michigan Civil Rights Act] to permit an employer to do that. To permit an employer essentially to punish the bargaining unit, to drag the union into court when the employees have not chosen to do so, to put the union at cross-purposes with its members, and to essentially put the union members who have chosen to exercise their rights under [the Michigan Civil Rights Act], to put them in a position where their fellow union members see them, rightfully if this decision is upheld, as having endangered the union and possibly having endangered their co-workers. It allows the employer to punish the union, to punish the bargaining unit, to put it at great risk, because some employees have chosen to sue their employer. And I would suggest to you that that is very much counter to the public policy of [the Michigan Civil Rights Act]. And in fact it is extremely destructive to the policy of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Also, permitting an employer to seek contribution from a union will discourage discrimination victims from pursuing claims by denying them access to legal representation from their unions. As demonstrated in the immediate case, union counsel originally represented plaintiffs, but was forced to withdraw after the defendant employer filed a motion to disqualify counsel on grounds of conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The majority asserts that my position will provide unions with a \u201cfree pass\u201d to participate in sexual discrimination. It fails, however, to explain how my position would preclude plaintiffs from directly filing suit against its union for discriminatory conduct. Curiously, the majority attempts to disguise its interference with the employee-union relationship as \u201cvindicating Michigan\u2019s civil rights laws.\u201d To the contrary, the majority undermines this goal by denying discrimination victims access to union legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Finally, liability from contribution claims could damage the financial stability of unions, reducing or eliminating their ability to represent and negotiate on behalf of their members. This result would clearly violate Michigan public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Given that the majority\u2019s decision contradicts the manifest intent of the Legislature, federal law, and state public policy, I respectfully dissent. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and conclude that the defendant employer may not seek contribution from the union for intentional sexual discrimination arising from a collective bargaining agreement provision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-7\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\"> The mjyority opinion observes that \u201ca plaintiff is always free to file suit against any or all tortfeasors.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 255. Despite the absence of any supporting statutory language, it then conclusively states, \u201cour Legislature has seen fit to allow contribution among joint tortfeasors, even when the plaintiff chooses not to sue all of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the majority fails to recognize the distinction between joint (negligent) and intentional tortfeasors. <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314, 329; 174 NW2d 797 (1970). The weakness of the majority opinion\u2019s holding is evidenced by its reliance on its own unsupported conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The majority also asserts that \u201cthis Court has already dismissed the dissent\u2019s argument.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 255, n 13. Ironically, the majority then cites a Michigan case recognizing the distinction between intentional and nonintentional tortfeasors, <em>Caldwell v Fox, </em>394 Mich 401, 416; 231 NW2d 46 (1975), as well as a New Jersey case, <em>Markey v Skog, </em>129 NJ Super 192; 322 A2d 513 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> The initial predecessor to \u00a7 2925a provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">It shall be lawful for all persons having a claim or cause of action against 2 or more joint tort-feasors to compound, settle with, and discharge, at any time prior to rendition of a judgment in said action, any and everyone or more of said joint tort-feasors for such sum as such person may deem fit, without impairing the right of such person or persons to demand and collect the balance of said claim or cause of action from the remaining joint tort-feasors, against whom such person, or persons, has such claim or cause of action, and not so released.- [MCL 691.562; MSA 27.1683(2) (repealed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">In 1961, \u00a7 2925(2) was amended to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">It shall be lawful for all persons having a claim or cause of action against 2 or more joint tort-feasors to compound, settle with, and discharge, at any time prior to rendition of a judgment in said action, any and every one or more of said joint tort-feasors for such sum as such person may deem fit, without impairing the right of such person or persons to demand and collect the balance of said claim or cause of action from the remaining joint tort-feasors, against whom such person, or persons, has such claim or cause of action, and not so released.

As noted by the majority, subsequent cases have maintained the distinction between intentional and nonintentional tortfeasors. <em>Johnson v Bundy, </em>129 Mich App 393, 400; 342 NW2d 567 (1983); <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co of Maryland v Newman, </em>109 Mich App 620, 625-626; 311 NW2d 821 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\"> Quoting Prosser, Torts (2d ed), \u00a7 46, this Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">\u201cIt seems quite clear that the rule denying contribution in favor of negligent tortfeasors is in full retreat, and that in due course of time the pressure of opinion will compel its abolition.
