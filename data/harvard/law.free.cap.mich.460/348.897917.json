The Court of Appeals determined that the phrase was ambiguous and that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Dawn Mysierowicz, plaintiff\u2019s assignor, came within the definition of an insured<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under defendant\u2019s insurance policy because she was \u201cin the care of\u201d the named insured. We find that the Court of Appeals erred in reaching this holding. Because we conclude that neither plaintiff nor defendant was entitled to summary disposition, we reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In early 1993, Mysierowicz\u2019 mother was in the process of divorcing her father and was unable to provide a home for her. Bonnie Twitchell, the mother of Mysierowicz\u2019 boyfriend Travis Twitchell, agreed that Mysierowicz could stay at the Twitchell home on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>temporary basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 19, 1993, plaintiff Daniel Henderson was visiting the Twitchell household. An altercation occurred with some strangers in front of the Twitchell home during which plaintiff was stabbed. Henderson subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging that Travis Twitchell and Mysierowicz had negligently provoked the strangers, resulting in his being injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The lawsuit was tendered to State Farm Fire and Casualty Company. State Farm assumed a defense for Travis Twitchell, but declined to provide a defense for Mysierowicz on the basis that she was not an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy. Plaintiff obtained a default judgment for $75,000 against Mysierowicz. In consideration of a promise by Henderson not to proceed against her personal assets, Mysierowicz assigned all rights, benefits and claims she had against State Farm to Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Henderson subsequently filed a complaint, as Mysierowicz\u2019 assignee, against State Farm alleging that it had breached its obligations when it did not defend and provide coverage to Mysierowicz under the Twitchell homeowner\u2019s policy. Plaintiff alleged that he was entitled to a judgment of $75,000 against defendant. State Farm filed an answer denying liability on the basis that Mysierowicz was not an \u201cinsured\u201d as the term was defined in the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">After depositions of Mysierowicz and the Twitchells were taken, plaintiff filed a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(9) (failure to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>valid defense) and MCR 2.116(C)(10) (no genuine issue of material fact). Plaintiff argued on the basis of deposition testimony that he filed with his motion that Mysierowicz fit within the definition of an \u201cinsured\u201d in the insurance policy. Defendant responded by filing its own motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10). Defendant also cited and provided deposition testimony it said demonstrated that Mysierowicz was not an \u201cinsured\u201d and that it had properly refused to defend or provide coverage in the earlier lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The trial court denied plaintiffs motion and granted defendant\u2019s motion. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">This Court finds that Dawn Mysierowicz was at the age of 18, [a] legal adult suffering from no physical or mental disabilities. She resided with the Twitchelfls] and was not under the[ir] control, guidance, supervision, management or custody. As such it is clear to this Court that State Farm\u2019s policy of insurance did not provide coverage to her because she was not, \u201cIn the care of,\u201d the insureds. Thus, this Court finds no genuine issue as to any material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Plaintiff filed a claim of appeal. After consulting dictionary definitions of the word \u201ccare\u201d and some out-of-state cases, the Court of Appeals determined that \u201ccare\u201d had many meanings and thus the phrase \u201cin the care of\u201d was ambiguous because it could also reasonably be understood to have different meanings. The Court ultimately reversed the order granting summary disposition for defendant and further found that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Mysierowicz came within the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d because she was \u201cin the care of\u201d Bonnie Twitchell, the named insured under defendant\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy. 225 Mich App 703; 572 NW2d 216 (1997). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>subsequently granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 459 Mich 880 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We review the grant or denial of a motion for summary disposition de novo. <em>Groncki v Detroit Edison Co, </em>453 Mich 644, 649; 557 NW2d 289 (1996). Further, the construction and interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law for a court to determine that this Court likewise reviews de novo. <em>Morley v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>458 Mich 459, 465; 581 NW2d 237 (1998). Whether contract language is ambiguous is also a question of law which we review de novo. <em>Port Huron Ed Ass\u2019n </em>v <em>Port Huron Area School Dist, </em>452 Mich 309, 323; 550 NW2d 228 (1996). It is axiomatic that if a word or phrase is unambiguous and no reasonable person could differ with respect to application of the term or phrase to undisputed material facts, then the court should grant summary disposition to the proper party pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). <em>Moll v Abbott Laboratories, </em>444 Mich 1, 28, n 36; 506 NW2d 816 (1993). Conversely, if reasonable minds could disagree about the conclusions to be drawn from the facts, a question for the factfinder exists. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">PRINCIPLES UTILIZED IN INTERPRETING INSURANCE CONTRACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Initially, in reviewing an insurance policy dispute we must look to the language of the insurance policy and interpret the terms therein in accordance with Michigan\u2019s well-established principles of contract con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>struction. <em>Arco Industries Corp v American Motorists Ins Co, </em>448 Mich 395, 402; 531 NW2d 168 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">First, an insurance contract must be enforced in accordance with its terms. <em>Upjohn Co v New Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197, 207; 476 NW2d 392 (1991). A court must not hold an insurance company liable for a risk that it did not assume. <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 567; 489 NW2d 431 (1992). Second, a court should not create ambiguity in an insurance policy where the terms of the contract are clear and precise. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the terms of a contract must be enforced as written where there is no ambiguity. <em>Stine v Continental Casualty Co, </em>419 Mich 89, 114; 349 NW2d 127 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">While we construe the contract in favor of the insured if an ambiguity is found, <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v DeLaGarza, </em>433 Mich 208, 214; 444 NW2d 803 (1989), this does not mean that the plain meaning of a word or phrase should be perverted, or that a word or phrase, the meaning of which is specific and well recognized, should be given some alien construction merely for the purpose of benefitting an insured. <em>Upjohn Co, supra </em>at 208, n 8. The fact that a policy does not define a relevant term does not render the policy ambiguous. <em>Auto Club Group Ins Co v Marzonie, </em>447 Mich 624, 631; 527 NW2d 760 (1994). Rather, reviewing courts must interpret the terms of the contract in accordance with their commonly used meanings. <em>Group Ins Co of Michigan v Czopek, </em>440 Mich 590, 596; 489 NW2d 444 (1992). Indeed, we do not ascribe ambiguity to words simply because dictionary publishers are obliged to define words differently to avoid possible plagiarism. <em>Upjohn Co, supra </em>at 209, n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"pAMP\">The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the phrase \u201cin the care of\u201d was ambiguous. It is not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals failed to recognize that this phrase is a colloquial or idiomatic phrase that is peculiar to itself and readily understood as a phrase by speakers and readers of our language.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">An example of a court recognizing that parsing phrases word by word may lead to an inaccurate interpretation is informative. In <em>Nat'l Security Archive v United States Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>279 US App DC 308, 310; 880 F2d 1381 (1989), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in analyzing the phrase \u201ceducational institution,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">It is often the case that words, used in conjunction, convey a meaning different from that which they would bear if interpreted separately.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Utilization of plain English in insurance policies and other legal instruments has been on occasion required, but in all cases encouraged, in recent years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This change requires courts to utilize less rigid methods of inteipretation than the old densely written policies demand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With this in mind, when faced with plain English phrases in an insurance contract, any attempt to define each element, or word, of the phrase, as the Court of Appeals did, will almost invariably result in an inaccurate understanding of the phrase. Rather, the proper approach is to read the phrase as a whole, giving the phrase its commonly used meaning. <em>Group Ins Co v Czopek, supra </em>at 596. This requires a court to give contextual meaning to the phrase to determine what the phrase conveys to those familiar with our language and its contemporary usage. This approach is consistent with the parallel rule for statutory construction, which requires that all nontechnical words and phrases be defined according to the common and approved usage of the language. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). Thus, when the meaning of a colloquial phrase is in dispute, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>must not mechanistically parse the meaning of each word in the phrase; instead, it must look to the contextual understanding and consider the phrase as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The tools available to a court in seeking to establish the meaning of such phrases include common understandings of which the court can take notice, as well as other sources such as specialized dictionaries<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or publications.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that the goal of the court in this endeavor is to construe the phrase so as to preserve the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">While the meaning of the phrase \u201cin the care of\u201d is not ambiguous,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this is not to say that application of the phrase to a given set of facts will always be easy. This is the case here. While the facts are not in dispute here, reasonable persons could disagree about the conclusions to which they lead. Said another way, individual factfinders could reasonably give different weight to the same facts, causing them to reach opposite conclusions regarding whether Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d Mrs. Twitchell at the time of the stab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>bing. Thus, it was improper to grant summary disposition to either party in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">THE GENERAL MEANING OF THE PHRASE</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Given that the contract does not define the phrase \u201cin the care of,\u201d and because interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law, it falls to us to provide some guidance regarding the meaning of the phrase. In our view, the following nonexclusive common-sense factors are relevant for the factfinder to consider in answering when someone is \u201cin the care of\u201d someone else:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">(1) is there a legal responsibility to care for the person;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">(2) is there some form of dependency;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">(3) is there a supervisory or disciplinary responsibility;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">(4) is the person providing the care providing substantial essential financial support;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">(5) is the living arrangement temporary or permanent, including how long it has been in existence and is expected to continue;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">(6) what is the age of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u201d another (generally, the younger a person the more likely they are to be \u201cin the care\u201d of another);</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">(7) what is the physical or mental health status of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u201d another (a person with health problems is more likely to be \u201cin the care\u201d of another); and</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">(8) is the person allegedly \u201cin the care of\u201d another gainfully employed (a person so employed is less likely to be truly dependent on another)?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>FACTS OF RECORD SUGGESTING MYSIEROWICZ WAS \u201cIN THE CARE\u201d OF BONNIE TWITCHELL</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Court of Appeals relied on deposition testimony establishing the following in concluding there was no genuine issue of material fact that Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d Bonnie Twitchell: (1) Mysierowicz paid no rent and contributed nothing in terms of the monthly mortgage payments, property taxes and utilities; (2) Mrs. Twitchell performed all household chores including meals when she was home; (3) Travis hoped that everyone regarded Mysierowicz as a member of the family and considered the three of them to be living as one family unit;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (4) Mrs. Twitchell had assumed responsibility for Mysierowicz\u2019 well-being;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (5) Mysierowicz was primarily dependent on Mrs. Twitchell for food and shelter;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (6) Mrs. Twitchell provided virtually total<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> financial support for Mysierowicz.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">FACTS OF RECORD SUGGESTING MYSIEROWICZ WAS NOT \u201cIN THE CARE\u201d OF BONNIE TWITCHELL</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The Court of Appeals reached its conclusion that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d Mrs. Twitchell, while acknowledging: (1) Mysierowicz was eighteen years old; (2) the living arrangement was temporary; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>(3) Mysierowicz was responsible for purchasing all her personal items, including toiletries and clothing and maintaining the car her parents had purchased for her; (4) Mysierowicz had a telephone in her own name in the Twitchell house; (5) Mysierowicz agreed to contribute $20 a week toward an average weekly grocery bill of $50; (6) neither Bonnie nor Travis Twitchell exercised any control over Mysierowicz\u2019 activities; (7) Mrs. Twitchell did not sign an agreement to take care of Mysierowicz nor did she consider herself responsible for Mysierowicz; and (8) Mysierowicz was free to come and go as she pleased, while providing for some of her own support.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Those factors cited by the Court of Appeals in support of its ruling, which are supported by the record, would allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d Mrs. Twitchell at the time Henderson was stabbed. However, the eight other factors cited immediately above would similarly allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Mysierowicz was not \u201cin the care of\u201d Mrs. Twitchell at the time of the stabbing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In our judgment, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred. The trial court should not have granted summary disposition to defendant because there was deposition testimony from which a reasonable person could conclude that Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d Mrs. Twitchell at the time of the stabbing. The Court of Appeals likewise erred in concluding as a matter of law that Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Mrs. Twitchell at the time of the incident, because there was evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that she was not.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Each side cited deposition testimony supporting its position. Viewing all the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff forecloses a ruling, as a matter of law, that Mysierowicz was not \u201cin the care of\u201d Mrs. Twitchell. Similarly, viewing all the facts in a light most favorable to defendant forecloses a ruling as a matter of law that Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d Mrs. Twitchell. We are satisfied that a question of fact clearly exists in this case that can only be resolved by a trier of fact. Neither party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law under MCR 2.116(C)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-8\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> The insurance policy contained the following definition of the word \u201cinsured\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">4. \u201cinsured\u201d means you and, if residents of your household: a. your relatives; and b. any other person under the age of 21 who is <em>in the care of </em>a person described above.

The fact that each party is advocating a definition that supports its desired outcome in a case of first impression does not make a phrase ambiguous. If this were the test, all terms and phrases would be rendered ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b441-10\"> The major flaw in the Court of Appeals approach, as will be discussed below, was failing to deal with the disputed phrase as a phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Furthermore, even when one engages in a word-by-word analysis, such as the Court of Appeals did here, the mere fact that various dictionaries define the word \u201ccare\u201d differently does not make the word \u201ccare\u201d ambiguous. To so hold would make virtually any word ambiguous, thus derailing proper interpretation where word by word explication is called for. See our discussion of the proper understanding of the word \u201cof\u201d in <em>Horace v City of Pontiac, </em>456 Mich 744, 755-756; 575 NW2d 762 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\"> To nail down the point, the court wryly gave the phrase \u201cmonkey business\u201d as an example of a phrase that had a different meaning than the sum of its constituent parts. <em>Id. </em>at 310-311, n 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b442-5\"> The Legislature since 1990 has required basic insurance policies to be written in plain English.

For example, the Michigan Bar Journal regularly publishes articles encouraging, and even giving awards regarding, the use of plain English in contracts, pleadings, and the like. Indeed, the Plain English Committee even has its own Web site.

Under Michigan law, general contract rules are followed when construing insurance contracts. <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Harrington, </em>455 Mich 377; 565 NW2d 839 (1997). Whether the language is ambiguous is a question of law, which is likewise reviewed de novo. <em>Port Huron Ed Ass\u2019n v Port Huron Area School Dist, </em>452 Mich 309, 323; 550 NW2d 228 (1996). In construing insurance contracts, any ambiguities are strictly construed against the insurer, to maximize coverage. <em>American Bumper &amp; Mfg Co v Hartford Fire Ins Co, </em>452 Mich 440; 550 NW2d 475 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Concomitant to the rules of construction is the rule of reasonable expectation. It states that a court examines whether a policyholder was led to a reasonable expectation of coverage for the loss in question upon reading the contract. <em>Vanguard Ins Co v Clarke, </em>438 Mich 463, 472; 475 NW2d 48 (1991). If so, coverage will be afforded. <em>Fire Ins Exchange v Diehl, </em>450 Mich 678, 687; 545 NW2d 602 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In this case of first impression, the majority concludes that the phrase \u201cin the care of\u201d is unambiguous. The phrase is ambiguous, not because various dictionaries define the word \u201ccare\u201d differently, but because both parties attached materially different meanings to the phrase. See <em>Allstate Ins Co v Fick, </em>226 Mich App 197; 572 NW2d 265 (1997). See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Seaboard Surety Co v Bachinger, </em>313 Mich 174; 20 NW2d 854 (1945). I disagree with the majority\u2019s statement in footnote 3. <em>Ante </em>at 355. In this case, the parties advocate completely distinct constructions of the phrase, \u201cin the care of.\u201d It is not a matter of ambiguity being asserted on the sole basis that each party offers a different definition for the puipose of supporting his desired outcome. If ambiguity could be grounded alone on differing definitions, then, as the majority suggests, any term would be ambiguous. What distinguishes this case is that, here, each party\u2019s construction is equally plausible. When the language of a contract is subject to two or more reasonable inteipretations, then the contract is ambiguous. <em>Petovello v Murray, </em>139 Mich App 639; 362 NW2d 857 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The words in an insurance policy are generally considered to be ambiguous when they may be reasonably understood in different ways. <em>Fick, supra </em>at 203. The defendant advocates a narrow construction, that is, the phrase should be construed to mean \u201clegal care,\u201d such as a nurse would render to a patient. The plaintiff construes the phrase much more broadly and would not limit its definition to such a narrow construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The majority states that \u201cin the care of\u201d was misinterpreted by the Court of Appeals because it was parsed, rather than being treated as an idiom or colloquialism. \u201cIn the care of\u201d is not a colloquial or idiomatic phrase. It cannot be analogized to a phrase like \u201cmonkey business.\u201d There is only one noun used in the expression \u201cin the care of,\u201d whereas, in \u201cmonkey business,\u201d two nouns used together obliterate the meaning of each and form a whole new meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>When interpreting \u201cin the care of,\u201d the proper focus is on the parties\u2019 intent. This is reviewed on an objective basis. See <em>Allstate Ins Co v Keillor (After Remand), </em>450 Mich 412, 417; 537 NW2d 589 (1995). Materiality connotes objective reasonableness. See <em>Rowe v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>437 Mich 627; 473 NW2d 268 (1991). The cardinal rule in interpreting contracts is to effectuate the intent of the parties. <em>Terry Barr Sales Agency, Inc v All-Lock Co, Inc, </em>96 F3d 174 (CA 6, 1996); <em>Rasheed v Chrysler Corp, </em>445 Mich 109; 517 NW2d 19 (1994). Therefore, a reviewing court must necessarily examine the intent of the parties and the meanings attached by each on an objective basis when construing a contract term.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">I agree, as the majority recites, that a term is not rendered ambiguous merely because its meaning varies with changed circumstances. Also, a term is not ambiguous because it is difficult to apply to certain factual situations. However, in either instance, the likelihood of ambiguity is greatly enhanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">A fair reading of some insurance policy language leads one to understand that there is coverage under a particular set of circumstances. Another fair reading of the same language may lead another to understand that there is no coverage. Under those circumstances, the contract is ambiguous and should be construed against the drafter in favor of coverage. <em>Michigan Mut Ins Co v Dowell, </em>204 Mich App 81; 514 NW2d 185 (1994), lv den 447 Mich 971 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In this case, defendant reads \u201cin the care of\u201d to connote only support, supervision, charge, custody, and responsibility. Courts in other jurisdictions have interpreted the phrase \u201cin the care of\u201d as used in homeowners\u2019 insurance policies more broadly. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>plaintiff and defendant here have relied on <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co v Odom,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case involving a State Farm policy containing language almost identical to the instant policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Odom, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a child, who lived with her mother in the named insured\u2019s house, but was unrelated to the insured, was \u201cin the care of\u201d the insured. The court relied on the fact that the insured provided the child with significant physical care, giving her housing, clothing, and food, and sharing in her care. <em>Id. </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">While the insured was looking after her, the child was fatally injured. The mother sued the insured for wrongful death. The Sixth Circuit agreed with State Farm that (1) the child was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy because she was \u201cin the care of\u201d the named insured, and (2) the policy excluded liability coverage for injuries suffered by an insured. Accordingly, State Farm was not obligated under the policy to provide coverage or defense arising out of the insured\u2019s alleged liability for the child\u2019s injuries and death. <em>Id. </em>at 249-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Notably, in <em>Odom, </em>State Farm sought to have the child deemed an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy because such a finding precluded coverage. In this case, State Farm seeks to prevent this Court from finding that Dawn Mysierowicz is an insured under Bonnie Twitchell\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The irony apparent here was commented on by contracts scholar, Allan Farnsworth: \u201c[S]ometimes the drafter may have foreseen the [ambiguity] but deliberately refrained from raising it \u2014 the lawyer who \u2018wakes these sleeping dogs\u2019 by insisting that it be resolved may cost the client the bargain.\u201d 2 Farnsworth, Contracts, \u00a7 7.8, p 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Also persuasive is the Louisiana Court of Appeals decision in <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co v Richardson, </em>486 So 2d 929, 930-931 (La App, 1986). There, the question whether the fourteen-year-old daughter of the insured\u2019s girlfriend living in the insured\u2019s home was \u201cin the care of\u201d the insured for purposes of coverage under the insured\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy. The policy defined as insureds \u201cresidents of the named insured\u2019s household, his spouse, the relatives of either, and any other person under the age of twenty-one in the care of any insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The court found that all three individuals lived together in the insured\u2019s house under an unwritten agreement for sharing expenses. The insured paid the mortgage, bought his food, and took care of his vehicle. The insured\u2019s girlfriend paid for utilities, telephone bills, her car, purchased food for her and her daughter, and occasionally contributed to the mortgage payment. <em>Id. </em>at 930-931. In concluding that the fourteen-year-old was \u201cin the care of\u201d the insured and was, therefore, an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">It is clear that on the basis of the agreement between the parties, the payments made by James Richardson [the insured] did directly benefit Demetric Ayio. He was caring for the child by letting her stay in his home and by paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>for both the maintenance of the home and his other agreed-upon expenses. Further, the bills and other expenses paid by James Richardson allowed Evelyn to devote more of her own income to Demetric\u2019s needs. Even though he did not consider himself as having guardianship of Demetric, James was much more than a nameless, unseen benefactor. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court was correct in its finding that the child was \u201cin the care of\u201d James Richardson under the policy. <em>[Id. </em>at 931.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Thus, the insured\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance company was required to provide insurance coverage for the girl and her mother when the girl injured her classmate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Similarly, in <em>Nationwide Mut Ins Co v </em>Anderson,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a woman and her eighteen-year-old son lived with the named insured in his home. The son was sued for wrongful death when a shotgun he held discharged and killed Kevin Anderson. Subsequently, the plaintiff, who had issued a homeowner\u2019s policy to the insured, sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether the son was an insured under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 92. The policy defined \u201cinsured\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cinsured\u201d means you and residents of your household who are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">a. your relatives; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">b. other persons under the age of 21 and in the care of any person named above. <em>[Id. </em>at 93.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The lower court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>The North Carolina Court of Appeals found that the son was an insured under the policy. The named insured, the mother, and the son had acted as a family for many years, the son even refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ring to the insured as his stepfather. <em>Id. </em>at 95. The son, although eighteen when the incident occurred, remained dependent on the insured and his mother for the basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, and shelter. <em>Id. </em>at 94-95. Also, it was irrelevant that the son provided for his own support to some degree. The policy language did not contain a distinction based on whether the person \u201cin the care of\u201d the insured could support himself. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Giving the phrase \u201cin the care of\u201d a nonstrained, nontechnical reading, and in light of the reasoning in cases that construed nearly identical provisions, I find that Dawn Mysierowicz was \u201cin the care of\u201d defendant\u2019s insured, Bonnie Twitchell. Therefore, she was an \u201cinsured\u201d under defendant\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In accordance with established precedent, I would construe the phrase against defendant and in favor of plaintiff, as Mysierowicz\u2019 assignee. <em>State Farm Mut Automobile Ins Co v Enterprise Leasing Co, </em>452 Mich 25; 549 NW2d 345 (1996). The phrase \u201cunder the care of\u201d has been interpreted to mean \u201cguidance, supervision, control, management or custody of another.\u201d <em>Bruno v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co, </em>337 So 2d 241 (La App, 1976). However, <em>Odom, Richardson, </em>and <em>Anderson </em>support plaintiff\u2019s claim that the phrase is subject to broader meanings that include the provision of support to another.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The majority opinion correctly states the applicable construction guidelines and this Court\u2019s standard of review. However, it ignores its proper role in construing the phrase in question and erroneously delegates that responsibility to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It lists eight \u201cnonexclusive common-sense factors\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for which it provides no authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It then lists the undisputed facts and orders the jury to arrive at a legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It is undisputed that Bonnie Twitchell permitted Mysierowicz to stay in her home without requiring Mysierowicz to pay for either the maintenance of the home or substantial household expenses. Bonnie Twitchell, not Mysierowicz\u2019 mother, provided for Mysierowicz during the approximately six months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>that Mysierowicz spent in the Twitchell home. As in <em>Richardson, supra, </em>Bonnie Twitchell took care of nearly all household expenses, enabling Mysierowicz to spend more of her income on herself. Moreover, unlike a \u201cnameless benefactor,\u201d Bonnie Twitchell provided Dawn Mysierowicz with food, shelter, and supplies without exercising control over her. Arguably, however, by doing so, she assumed responsibility for Mysierowicz\u2019 well-being in a larger measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">As in <em>Anderson, </em>Mysierowicz provided her own support by purchasing her own clothing and personal articles and maintaining her vehicle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, as in <em>Anderson, supra, </em>she was primarily dependent upon Bonnie Twitchell to provide her with food and shelter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mysierowicz moved from her mother\u2019s home to Bonnie Twltchell\u2019s home and remained with the Twitchells when they moved into a hotel after their house was damaged by fire. She then returned to her mother\u2019s home when she left the Twitchells. She never lived by herself during this period. While residing in the Twitchell home, Mysierowicz was considered a member of the family, as in <em>Odom, supra. </em>Although not dispositive, this fact provides further support for the conclusion that she was \u201cin the care of\u201d Bonnie Twitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Finally, as in <em>Anderson, supra, </em>Mysierowicz\u2019 age did not preclude her from being dependent on Bonnie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Twitchell for the basic necessities, even though she provided some of her own support.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">By construing the phrase \u201cin the care of\u201d in favor of coverage and applying the law to the essentially uncontested material facts, I find that Dawn Mysierowicz came within the definition of an \u201cinsured\u201d because she was \u201cin the care of\u201d Bonnie Twitchell, the named insured under defendant\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In conclusion, what the majority denominates an issue of fact is actually an issue of law that only a court should decide. Given that no genuine issue of material fact exists and given our rules of contract construction, plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law under MCR 2.116(C)(10). Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-6\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\"> 799 F2d 247 (CA 6, 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> In <em>Odom, supra </em>at 249, the insurance contract defined the term \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201cyou and the following residents of your household: a. your relatives; b. any other person under the age of 21 who is in the care of any person named above.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-11\"> 118 NC App 92; 453 SE2d 542 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Odom, supra </em>at 250, found that \u201cin the care of\u201d was unambiguous in the context of that case.
