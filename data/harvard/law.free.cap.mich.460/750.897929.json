Next, we extend the plain error rule of <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535; 520 NW2d 123 (1994), to claims of unpreserved, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>stitutiona! error. Although the court\u2019s failure to properly instruct on aiding and abetting felony murder was plain error, defendant has not established prejudice. Moreover, the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm the unpublished opinion of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Defendant was tried before a Kent County jury for the robbery and murder of Thomas Eugene Gober in a downtown Grand Rapids parking garage. While taking trash to a dumpster outside a restaurant, prosecution witness James Warren heard a commotion coming from the parking structure across the street. He saw two people on the second story involved in a struggle. One man, subsequently identified as codefendant Victor Escobar, wore a brown or green sweater.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was holding a third person whom Warren could not see. When Warren yelled, the men ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Warren then observed three people run from the parking structure, among them Escobar and defendant. Defendant wore a black jacket with red markings. The hood was pulled over his head.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Latisha Washington, an employee of the parking garage, likewise saw the three men run from the structure. She confirmed that one man had been wearing a black hooded jacket with red markings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Warren then went to the second floor of the parking structure where he found Gober lying on the floor with his throat cut. Blood had pooled around Gober\u2019s head. An autopsy revealed that Gober died from a single stab wound to the neck that severed his carotid artery.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Warren immediately called 911. Officer Mike Woronko responded. Within minutes after the crime was discovered, Woronko, armed with a description of the suspects, stopped defendant and Escobar less than half a mile from the crime scene. Defendant was wearing his jacket inside out with the hood tucked inside the collar. Warren and Washington later identified defendant by his distinctive jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The right arm and cuff area and the left and right pocket of defendant\u2019s jacket were bloodstained. The blood did not match defendant\u2019s or Escobar\u2019s blood type, but was consistent with Gober\u2019s blood type. The record established that less than one percent of the population shares the characteristics of Gober\u2019s blood. The police also found blood on Escobar\u2019s clothes, but that blood matched Escobar\u2019s blood type, not that of defendant or Gober. The police found a small amount of blood on Escobar\u2019s hands. The sample was too small to be identified. The police did recover a watch inscribed with Gober\u2019s name from Escobar.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Defendant testified in his own defense, but refused to answer any questions. Instead, he made a nonresponsive, unsupported assertion that the police had planted the blood on his jacket. Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury to disregard defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Following the presentation of proofs and closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury on felony murder without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The first thing which the prosecution must prove is that the victim, Mr. Gober, was killed during an armed <em>robbery </em>by one of the robbers. <em>The prosecution does not have to prove that Mr. Carines, himself, killed him or participated in the killing. </em>To prove this element the prosecution need prove only that one of the robbers killed Mr. Gober. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The court further instructed the jury that defendant must have participated in the robbery during which Gober was killed, and that defendant must have possessed the requisite mental state, i.e., malice. The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\">Just because a defendant participated in a robbery during which someone was killed does not itself prove [felony murder]. However, in many circumstances committed [sic] a robbery, particularly one involving violence and/or the use of a weapon, can indicate an intention to kill, an intention to cause great bodily harm, or the knowing creation of a very high risk of death or great bodily harm, knowing that death or such harm was the likely result of his actions. You may infer that a defendant had the necessary intent from evidence that the defendant set in motion, a force, likely to cause death or great bodily harm. ... If none of the participants intended for anyone to get killed or hurt and there was no good reason to anticipate given how things were planned and/or how they were carried out, that anyone would get killed or hurt, then any death which occurred during the course of the robbery is not a Felony Murder. If given the circumstances of planning and committing the robbery there was no good reason for participants other than the killer to anticipate a killing or a serious injury, those other participants are not guilty of a Felony Murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The jury found defendant guilty of armed robbery and felony murder. The trial court imposed the mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence in an unpublished opinion. The Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove armed robbery and felony murder. Further, because defendant failed to preserve his claim that the trial court had not properly instructed the jury on the elements of felony murder, the Court reviewed the instructional issue for a miscarriage of justice. The Court noted that the trial court appeared to have \u201cblended an aiding and abetting element into the felony murder instructions without giving a separate instruction on aiding and abetting felony murder,\u201d and failed to instruct the jury on the second element of aiding and abetting, i.e., that defendant must have performed acts or given aid or encouragement that assisted in the crime. The Court concluded, however, that \u201cthe jury apparently found defendant guilty as the principal in the felony murder\u201d because \u201cthe evidence at trial supported the theory that defendant was the individual who stabbed the victim.\u201d Thus, the Court of Appeals determined, \u201cthe aiding and abetting instructions for felony murder did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal to consider the question of sufficiency of the evidence and the claim of instructional error. 459 Mich 894 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">H. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Defendant initially contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his armed robbery and felony murder convictions. <em>People v Wolfe, </em>440 Mich 508, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>515; 489 NW2d 748 (1992), articulates the standard for reviewing sufficiency claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">[W]hen determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to sustain a conviction, a court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from that evidence can constitute satisfactory proof of the elements of a crime.\u201d <em>People v </em>Allen, 201 Mich App 98, 100; 505 NW2d 869 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">B. ARMED ROBBERY</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The prosecution presented sufficient evidence to prove defendant\u2019s armed robbery conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe elements of armed robbery are: (1) an assault, (2) a felonious taking of property from the victim\u2019s presence or person, (3) while the defendant is armed with a weapon described in the statute.\u201d <em>People v Turner, </em>213 Mich App 558, 569; 540 NW2d 728 (1995). The prosecution here relied, in part, on an aiding and abetting theory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\">\u201cAiding and abetting\u201d describes all forms of assistance rendered to the perpetrator of a crime and comprehends all words or deeds that might support, encourage, or incite the commission of a crime. ... To support a finding that a defendant aided and abetted a crime, the prosecutor must show that (1) the crime charged was committed by the defendant or some other person, (2) the defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime, and (3) the defendant intended the commission of the crime or had knowledge that the principal intended its commission at the time he gave aid and encouragement. An aider and abettor\u2019s state of mind may be inferred from all the facts and circumstances. Factors that may be considered include a close association between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>the defendant and the principal, the defendant\u2019s participation in the planning or execution of the crime, and evidence of flight after the crime. <em>[Turner, supra, </em>213 Mich App 568-569 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In this case, the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish that defendant committed armed robbery, either as a principal or as an aider and abettor. The presence of the victim\u2019s blood on defendant\u2019s sleeve and in his pockets suggested that defendant himself assaulted the victim. The jury could have inferred further that defendant assisted in a felonious taking of property in light of his close association with Escobar. Defendant fled the crime scene with Escobar, who had the fruits of the robbery, the victim\u2019s inscribed watch, on his person. Finally, the jury could have concluded that defendant had been armed with a dangerous weapon. The autopsy established that the victim died from a stab wound to the neck. Given the presence of the victim\u2019s blood on defendant\u2019s clothes, and the absence of the victim\u2019s blood on Escobar\u2019s clothes, the jury rationally could have inferred that defendant had used a knife during the robbery. Accordingly, the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to prove armed robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">C. FELONY MURDER</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The prosecution also adduced sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s felony murder conviction as either a principal or an aider and abettor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-8\">The elements of felony murder are: (1) the killing of a human being, (2) with the intent to kill, to do great bodily harm, or to create a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result [i.e., malice], (3) while committing, attempting to commit, or assisting in the commission of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>of the felonies specifically enumerated in [the statute, including armed robbery]. <em>[Turner, supra, </em>213 Mich App 566.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The facts and circumstances of the killing may give rise to an inference of malice. A jury may infer malice from evidence that the defendant intentionally set in motion a force likely to cause death or great bodily harm. <em>Id. </em>Malice may also be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon. <em>Id., </em>p 567.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201cIn situations involving the vicarious liability of cofelons, the individual liability of each felon must be shown. It is fundamentally unfair and in violation of basic principles of individual criminal culpability to hold one felon liable for an unforeseen death that did not result from actions agreed upon by the participants. In cases where the felons are acting intentionally or recklessly in pursuit of a common plan, liability may be established on agency principles. If the homicide is not within the scope of the main purpose of the conspiracy, those not participating are not criminally liable.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>pp 566-567, quoting <em>People v Flowers, </em>191 Mich App 169, 178; 477 NW2d 473 (1991) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">See also <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, 731; 299 NW2d 304 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Here, the prosecution satisfied the first element by proving the killing of a human being, Thomas Gober. A knife wound to Gober\u2019s throat severed his carotid artery. The jury could infer that defendant inflicted the fatal wound, given the blood stains on his sleeve and in his pockets. The jury also could have inferred that defendant, if not acting as the principal, had aided and abetted the murder by participating in the underlying offense, i.e., the robbery, and that the killing was within the scope of the robbers\u2019 common plan. Warren saw Escobar in the parking structure involved in a struggle. Defendant fled the scene of the crime with Escobar and an unknown third suspect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Defendant\u2019s hood was pulled up as he ran from the parking ramp. He later turned his jacket inside out to avoid detection. These facts establish that defendant was not merely present, but an active participant in the armed robbery. The jury could thus have inferred that defendant, if not acting as a principal, aided and abetted the homicide by participating in the robbery in which the victim was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The second element, malice, is also supported by the evidence. The autopsy established that a knife was used in the homicide. An inference of malice arises from the use of the knife. Moreover, by engaging in an armed robbery with his co-felons, defendant set in motion a force likely to cause death or great bodily harm. Even if defendant did not personally use the knife, the jury could have inferred that defendant acted with malice. Defendant participated in a robbery involving the use of a knife, acting in wanton and wilful disregard of the possibility that death or great bodily harm would result. See <em>People v Kelly, </em>423 Mich 261, 273; 378 NW2d 365 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The use of a knife in an isolated parking structure to rob the victim supported the finding of malice. Even if defendant had not intended to kill the victim when he entered the parking garage, the nature of the killing established that it was neither accidental nor done without malice. Defendant at the very least became aware of his cohort\u2019s intent during the events in question. See <em>id., </em>p 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Finally, the prosecution presented evidence that defendant committed or assisted in the commission of armed robbery when the victim was killed. The police retrieved the victim\u2019s watch from Escobar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>shortly after the crime. The jury could have inferred that defendant assisted in the robbery of Gober\u2019s watch, given his close association with Escobar, his flight from the scene, and the presence of the victim\u2019s blood on his clothes. Accordingly, the prosecution presented sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find the elements of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">in. the felony murder instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We next address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on felony murder. In considering this issue, we note two critical points. First, defendant failed to object to the court\u2019s instructions. Second, an error in omitting an element of the felony murder instructions would be an error of constitutional magnitude. See <em>United States v Gaudin, </em>515 US 506, 510; 115 S Ct 2310; 132 L Ed 2d 444 (1995) (the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution \u201crequire criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). Accordingly, our analysis of the alleged instructional error requires that we first address the standard of review for unpreserved claims of constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">A. THE PLAIN ERROR DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">This state encourages litigants \u201c \u2018to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time around . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Grant, supra, </em>445 Mich 551. This Court disfavors consideration of unpreserved claims of error. In <em>Grant, </em>this Court discussed the standards for reviewing unpreserved claims of nonconstitutional error. We noted that a rule of automatic reversal would conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>with MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, which provides that judgments or verdicts shall not be reversed absent a miscarriage of justice. Grant, p 543. We also observed that Michigan has long recognized the importance of preserving issues for appellate review. <em>Id., </em>pp 546, 550-551.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The United States Supreme Court has acknowledged the importance of this policy and the right of the various states to impose preservation requirements. <em>Id., </em>pp 546-547, 551, citing <em>United States v Young, </em>470 US 1, 15; 105 S Ct 1038; 84 L Ed 2d 1 (1985); <em>Henry v Mississippi, </em>379 US 443; 85 S Ct 564; 13 L Ed 2d 408 (1965); <em>Yakus v United States, </em>321 US 414, 444; 64 S Ct 660; 88 L Ed 834 (1944). Trial is \u201cby far the best time to address a defendant\u2019s constitutional <em>and </em>nonconstitutional rights.\u201d <em>Grant, supra, </em>445 Mich 551 (emphasis added). \u201cIndeed, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a state\u2019s right to develop procedural rules that lead to issue forfeiture[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>][ even where the procedural rules implicate constitutional protections if the rules serve a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 546-547.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>In <em>Grant, </em>this Court examined federal authority in adopting an issue forfeiture rule for unpreserved, nonconstitutional error. We relied primarily on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v Olano, </em>507 US 725; 113 S Ct 1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508 (1993). In <em>Olano, </em>the Supreme Court explained the plain error rule of FR Crim P 52(b), which provides: \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d The <em>Olano </em>Court emphasized that a constitutional right may be forfeited by a party\u2019s failure to timely assert that right. <em>Id., </em>p 731. To avoid forfeiture under the plain error rule, three requirements must be met: 1) error must have occurred, 2) the error was plain, i.e., clear or obvious, 3) and the plain error affected substantial rights. <em>Id., </em>pp 731-734. The third requirement generally requires a showing of prejudice, i.e., that the error affected the outcome of the lower court proceedings. <em>Id., </em>p 734. \u201cIt is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, once a defendant satisfies these three requirements, an appellate court must exercise its discretion in deciding whether to reverse. Reversal is warranted only when the plain, forfeited error resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an error \u201c \u2018seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u2019 independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 736-737.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In <em>Grant, </em>we found <em>Olano </em>persuasive in distinguishing between Michigan\u2019s issue preservation requirement and harmless error rule. <em>Grant, supra, </em>445 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>552.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we applied the factors set forth in <em>Olano </em>to the question of nonconstitutional error presented in <em>Grant. Id., </em>pp 552-554. We found that plain error occurred, but that it was not decisive of the outcome. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">B. APPLICATION OF THE PLAIN ERROR RULE TO UNPRESERVED, CONSTITUTIONAL ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We hold that the plain error rule discussed in <em>Olano </em>and <em>Grant </em>extends to unpreserved claims of constitutional error. Although <em>Grant\u2019s </em>holding was limited to nonconstitutional error, our reasoning made it clear that extending the doctrine to constitutional error furthers the policy underlying the forfeiture rule. In discussing <em>Olano, </em>we noted in <em>Grant </em>that \u201cthe specific language of the federal rules themselves, and of the <em>Olano </em>majority\u2019s formulation from earlier precedent, make no distinction between constitutional and non-constitutional error.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 550. Thus, \u201cit is the forfeiture aspect and not the actual constitutional status that drives the federal standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">We reaffirm <em>Grant. </em>The policy underlying the issue forfeiture rule provides no basis for distinguishing constitutional from nonconstitutional error. In both instances, requiring a contemporaneous objection provides the trial court \u201can opportunity to correct the error, which could thereby obviate the necessity of further legal proceedings and would be by far the best time to address a defendant\u2019s constitutional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>nonconstitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 551. Applying the <em>Olano/Grant </em>forfeiture rule to unpreserved claims of constitutional error thus serves the important historical and policy reasons underlying the preservation requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In applying the plain error rule to claims of unpreserved, constitutional error, we find instructive <em>Johnson v United States, </em>520 US 461; 117 S Ct 1544; 137 L Ed 2d 718 (1997). In <em>Johnson, </em>the trial court had failed to submit the element of materiality to the jury in the petitioner\u2019s perjury trial. <em>Id., </em>pp 463-464. The petitioner, however, had not preserved the issue at trial. <em>Id., </em>p 464. The United States Supreme Court, in a virtually unanimous decision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> applied the plain error doctrine to the petitioner\u2019s claim of instructional error. <em>Id., </em>pp 465-470. The Court concluded that the first two requirements for avoiding forfeiture were met, i.e., plain error occurred. <em>Id., </em>pp 465-468.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court, however, declined to decide whether the petitioner had satisfied the third requirement, i.e., that the error affected substantial rights. <em>Id., </em>pp 468-469. Nevertheless, the Court questioned the petitioner\u2019s claim that the error was so serious as to defy harmless-error analysis, noting that so-called \u201cstructural errors\u201d are found in a very limited class of cases. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The Supreme Court determined in <em>Johnson </em>that, even if the third requirement had been met, it would not correct the error because it did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>judicial proceedings. <em>Id., </em>pp 469-470. In reaching this conclusion, the Court ruled that the evidence of materiality was overwhelming and the issue had been uncontroverted at trial and on appeal. <em>Id., </em>p 470. <em>Johnson </em>is persuasive in applying the plain error standard of review to constitutional error, including instances where the alleged error is the failure to instruct the jury on an element of the offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Because our holding in this case is inconsistent with the plurality opinion in <em>People v Vaughn, </em>447 Mich 217; 524 NW2d 217 (1994), we repudiate the <em>Vaughn </em>plurality. In <em>Vaughn, </em>the defendant claimed that the trial court had failed adequately to instruct the jury on the essential element of asportation in his kidnapping trial. <em>Id., </em>p 224. The plurality declined to apply the <em>Grant </em>plain error rule, stating that it is \u201cwell established in our jurisprudence that where an erroneous jury instruction pertains to an essential element of an offense, a contemporaneous objection to the instruction is not required to preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 228.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It therefore concluded that the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the instructions did not preclude appellate review. <em>Id., </em>p 229. Applying a harmless error standard, the plurality concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>that the instructional error was harmless. <em>Id., </em>pp 235-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">We repudiate the <em>Vaughn </em>plurality\u2019s conclusion that litigants have no duty to preserve claims of instructional error.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The policy underlying Michigan\u2019s preservation requirement governs all issues. Moreover, <em>Vaughn </em>failed to acknowledge that preservation of instructional error is required both by our court rules and by statute. MCR 2.516(C) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">A party may assign as error the giving of or the failure to give an instruction only if the party objects on the record before the jury retires to consider the verdict (or, in the case of instructions given after deliberations have begun, before the jury resumes deliberations), stating specifically the matter to which the party objects and the grounds for the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Also, MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052 provides that \u201c[t]he failure of the court to instruct on any point of law shall not be ground for setting aside the verdict of the jury unless such instruction is requested by the accused.\u201d Although MCR 2.516(C) and MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052, do not control in this case because the alleged error is a constitutional one, they do provide additional support for extending the <em>Olano/Grant </em>forfeiture rule to unpreserved, constitutional error, including claims of instructional error.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>C. APPLICATION TO THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Having determined that the plain error rule applies to defendant\u2019s claim, we next consider whether defendant may avoid forfeiture of the alleged instructional error. Defendant has met the first requirement, i.e., the existence of an error, because the court\u2019s felony murder instructions were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">As noted above, the elements of felony murder are: 1) the killing of a human being, 2) malice, and 3) the commission, attempted commission, or assisting in the commission of one of the felonies enumerated in the statute, among them armed robbery. <em>Turner, supra, </em>213 Mich App 566. To establish guilt under an aiding and abetting theory, the prosecution must proffer evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">(1) the crime charged was committed by the defendant or some other person, (2) the defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime, and (3) the defendant intended the commission of the crime or had knowledge that the principal intended its commission at the time he gave aid and encouragement, <em>[Id., </em>p 568.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The trial court here instructed the jury on all three elements of felony murder. The court instructed that the prosecution must prove that the victim \u201cwas killed during an armed robbery by one of the robbers,\u201d thus satisfying the first element. The court also clearly instructed the jury regarding malice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>defendant\u2019s participation in the underlying felony, i.e., robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Defendant, however, assigns error to the court\u2019s instruction that \u201c[t]he prosecution does not have to prove that Mr. Cannes, himself, killed him or participated in the killing. To prove [the first] element the prosecution need prove only that one of the robbers killed Mr. Gober.\u201d Defendant argues that the instruction allowed the jury to convict him of felony murder without finding that he participated or assisted in killing the victim. The Court of Appeals accepted defendant\u2019s argument. It concluded that the trial court \u201cblended\u201d its felony murder instruction with an aiding and abetting instruction, and in doing so, the court failed to instruct the jury regarding the second element of aiding and abetting, i.e., that defendant must have performed acts or given encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals determined that the error did not affect the verdict because the jury \u201capparently\u201d convicted defendant as a principal, given the evidence supporting such a theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">On the specific facts presented here, the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the second element of aiding and abetting. We wish to emphasize that we have never held that a defendant must participate in the actual killing to be guilty of felony murder. To the contrary, our case law establishes that, in certain circumstances, a defendant may be held responsible for the actions of a co-felon. See, e.g., <em>Aaron, supra, </em>409 Mich 731 (liability may be established on agency principles where the felons are acting intentionally or recklessly in pursuit of a common plan); <em>Flowers, supra, </em>191 Mich App 177 (relying, in part, on <em>Aaron\u2019s </em>discussion of vicarious liability in rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that \u201che should not be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>responsible for the independent, unauthorized acts [of a co-felon] of breaking and entering and shooting the decedent\u201d); <em>Turner, supra, </em>213 Mich App 566-573 (relying, in part, on the agency principles discussed in <em>Aaron </em>in affirming the defendant\u2019s felony murder conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Although felony murder may be submitted to the jury on a vicarious liability theory, the trial court in the case at bar chose to instruct the jury under a traditional aiding and abetting theory. The court properly instructed the jury on the first and third elements of aiding and abetting. The court\u2019s instructions made clear that the crime charged must have been committed by defendant or some other person, and that defendant must have had the requisite intent, i.e., malice. The court failed, however, to instruct the jury that, to be guilty under a traditional aiding and abetting theory, defendant must have performed acts or given encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime. Once the court began to instruct on such a theory, it should have provided a complete instruction on the aiding and abetting requirements. Defendant has thus established the existence of an error.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Moreover, the error was plain. Our case law clearly establishes that, to be guilty as an aider and abettor, a defendant must perform acts or give encouragement that assists the commission of the crime. Defendant has thus satisfied the second criterion of the plain error test.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Defendant has failed, however, to meet his burden of persuasion regarding prejudice. The trial court\u2019s instructions, when viewed as a whole, adequately pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>tected defendant\u2019s rights. Under the instructions given, the jury would not have convicted defendant without concluding that he performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The court instructed the jury that it could not find defendant guilty unless he deliberately participated in the robbery in which the victim was killed and unless he acted with malice. The court also instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">[i]f the killing was purely accidental and totally unexpected, none of the robbers is guilty of First Degree Murder, or if the killing was an act done by one of the robbers which the others had no reason to anticipate, the other robbers are not guilty of First Degree Felony Murder. They are guilty of an armed robbery, but not murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The court then explained once again the different, ways to prove malice, and emphasized that \u201c[j]ust because a defendant participated in a robbery during which someone was killed does not itself prove First Degree Felony Murder.\u201d The court further instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">[i]f none of the participants intended for anyone to get killed or hurt and there was no good reason to anticipate given how things were planned and/or how they were carried out, that anyone would get killed or hurt, then any death which occurred during the course of the robbery is not a Felony Murder. If given the circumstances of planning and committing the robbery there was no good reason for participants other than the killer to anticipate a killing or a serious injury, those other participants are not guilty of a Felony Murder. If the way a robbery is planned and/or carried out gives the participants good reason to anticipate that someone might be killed or seriously injured, those participants are guilty of First Degree Felony Murder if someone does get hurt and dies from their injuries even though it was not planned that anyone be killed or injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>These instructions, while imperfect, did not prejudice defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court instructed the jury regarding the element of malice and further made clear that defendant must have participated in the underlying offense. The jury presumably followed the trial court\u2019s instructions and found defendant guilty only after concluding that he participated in the robbery <em>and </em>acted with malice. Given the evidence in this case, the jury could not have come to those conclusions without also finding that defendant aided or encouraged the killing. The key evidence tying defendant to the robbery, i.e., the blood on his jacket, tied him even more convincingly to the murder.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Defendant has therefore failed to show that the court\u2019s error affected the outcome at trial. Accordingly, defendant forfeited the claim of error by not timely objecting to the jury instruction. <em>Grant, </em>p 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Alternatively, even if defendant had satisfied the third requirement for avoiding forfeiture we would decline to reverse in this case because the alleged error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Johnson, </em>520 US 469-470. This conclusion is supported by the same reasoning that causes us to conclude that no prejudice occurred. In light of the court\u2019s instructions and the evidence presented, the jury could not have reasonably concluded that defendant participated in the robbery and acted with malice without also concluding that he participated in the killing either as the principal or an aider and abettor. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Johnson </em>applies here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">On this record there is no basis for concluding that the error \u201cseriously a\u00a3fect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Indeed, it would be the reversal of a conviction such as this which would have that effect. \u201cReversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u201d R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970). <em>[Johnson, supra, </em>520 US 470.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">In summary, the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s armed robbery and felony murder convictions. Regarding the instructional issue, we hold that the <em>Olano/Grant </em>forfeiture rule applies to unpreserved claims of constitutional error. Defendant cannot avoid forfeiture because he has not established that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s plain error. Further, even if the three requirements for establishing plain error had been met, we would decline to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction because the alleged error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b859-8\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Taylor, and Young, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Recent decisions establish that the standard for reviewing error on appeal depends upon two factors: first, whether the error is constitutional or nonconstitutional, and second, whether the error is preserved or forfeited. For the convenience of the bench and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>bar, we provide the following chart reflecting the current state of the law regarding the governing standards of review.</p>\n<p id=\"pA4U\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-9\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued April 25, 1997 (Docket No. 182792).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\"> Escobar was separately tried and convicted of felony murder and armed robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\"> Warren\u2019s view of the events in the parking structure was partially obstructed.

We do not address the propriety of this decision since it has not been raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\"> \u201cThe felony is a factor the jury may use to find malice,\u201d although malice may not be inferred merely from the intent to commit the underlying felony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\"> We noted in <em>Grant </em>that issue preservation and harmless error rules reduce the cost to society that arises from the reversal of convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">\u201cThe reversal of a conviction entails substantial social costs: it forces jurors, witnesses, courts, the prosecution, and the defendants to expend further time, energy, and other resources to repeat a trial that has already taken place; victims may be asked to relive their disturbing experiences. The \u2018[p]assage of time, erosion of memory, and dispersion of witnesses may render retrial difficult, even impossible.\u2019 Thus, while reversal \u2018may, in theory, entitle the defendant only to retrial, in practice it may reward the accused with complete freedom from prosecution,\u2019 and thereby \u2018cost the society the right to punish admitted offenders.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Id., </em>p 551, quoting <em>United States v Mechanik, </em>475 US 66, 72; 106 S Ct 938; 89 L Ed 2d 50 (1986).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\"> \u201cWaiver is different from forfeiture.

Similarly, Michigan\u2019s preservation requirement would have no meaning if we applied the same harmless error rule to both preserved and unpreserved constitutional error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\"> Justice Scalia joined all but two sections of the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\"> The Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that the error was \u201cstructural\u201d and fell outside the scope of the plain error rule, noting that \u201cthe seriousness of the error claimed does not remove consideration of it from the ambit of the [rule].\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 466.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\"> The Court recently answered the question left open by <em>Johnson, supra, </em>in <em>Neder v United States, </em>527 US 1; 119 S Ct 1827; 144 L Ed 2d 35 (1999), holding that an instructional error involving the omission of an element of an offense is subject to harmless-error analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\"> We also note that several lower federal courts have applied the plain error rule to unpreserved, constitutional error. See, e.g., <em>United States v Whiting, </em>28 F3d 1296 (CA 1, 1994); <em>United States v Brown, </em>307 US App DC 60; 26 F3d 1124 (1994); <em>United States v Jarvis, </em>7 F3d 404 (CA 4, 1993); <em>Thame, </em>n 9 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\"> The plurality relied in part on several <em>pre-Grant </em>decisions of both this Court and the Court of Appeals to support its view of the preservation requirement.

Continued adherence to that approach to issue preservation is inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b853-7\"> The plurality opinion is not precedent because a majority did not agree on the ground for the decision. <em>People v Anderson, </em>389 Mich 155, 170; 205 NW2d 461 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\"> The dissent would follow <em>Vaughn </em>and apply a simple harmless error rule because it believes a contemporaneous objection is not required when the erroneous instruction concerns an essential element of the offense. This position is flawed because it ignores the plain language of MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052 and MCR 2.516(C), which require parties to preserve claims of instructional error. Although the dissent suggests that the Fourteenth Amendment may require that this Court disregard the policy underlying the preservation requirement, <em>post </em>at 776, n 2, it fails to explain how our extension of the plain error rule to unpreserved claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>constitutional error violates due process. The Supreme Court surely would not have applied the plain error rule in <em>Johnson </em>if its application violates due process. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s approach would collapse Michigan\u2019s preservation requirement into the harmless error rule and would thus fail to further the important policy considerations underlying our preservation jurisprudence. By contrast, our adoption of the federal plain error rule encourages litigants to preserve claims of error at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b856-8\"> Our holding is controlled by the trial court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury on a traditional aiding and abetting theory.

Although the majority accurately recognizes that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on aiding and abetting felony murder, it errs by concluding that this error does not warrant reversal. Consequently, I would reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand for a new trial, because failure to provide relief with regard to this issue will result in manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">As explained in the Court of Appeals opinion, failure to object to jury instructions constitutes waiver of any error, unless relief is necessary to avoid manifest injustice. MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052; <em>People v </em>Vaughn, 447 Mich 217, 228; 524 NW2d 217 (1994) (opinion of Brickley, J.); <em>People v Petrella, </em>424 Mich 221, 276; 380 NW2d 11 (1985). Manifest injustice results when an erroneous or omitted instruction pertains to a controlling or basic issue of the case. <em>People v Nawrocki, </em>376 Mich 252, 260; 136 NW2d 922 (1965), cert den 382 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>US 455 (1966). Consequently, when an erroneous jury instruction pertains to an essential element of a crime, a contemporaneous objection is unnecessaiy to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Vaughn, supra </em>at 228-229 (opinion of Brickley, J.);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>People v Liggett, </em>378 Mich 706, 714; 148 NW2d 784 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The majority extends the plain error doctrine advanced in <em>Grant </em>to unpreserved claims of constitutional error. It requires that a defendant establish the following three elements to avoid forfeiture of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>unpreserved claim of constitutional error: (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the plain error affected substantial rights. <em>Ante </em>at 763. Although the majority recognizes that the Grant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cholding was limited to nonconstitutional error,\u201d it nonetheless concludes \u201cour <em>[Grant] </em>reasoning made it clear that extending the [plain error] doctrine to constitutional error furthers the policy underlying the forfeiture rale.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">However, in <em>Grant, </em>we explicitly recognized that \u201cthis preservation rule is not without exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. We explained that \u201cappellate courts will consider claims of constitutional error for the first time on appeal when the alleged error could have been decisive of the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, <em>Grant </em>emphasized \u201cthe instant case does not involve a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The case before us involves a constitutional error, an erroneous instruction concerning an essential element of the offense. Therefore, I would conclude that a contemporaneous objection to an erroneous jury instruction is not required to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Vaughn, supra </em>at 228. Defendant\u2019s conviction should only \u201cbe affirmed if the reviewing court is satisfied that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>People v Graves, </em>458 Mich 476, 482; 581 NW2d 229 (1998); See <em>Neder v United States, </em>527 US 1; 119 S Ct 1827, 1837; 144 L Ed 2d 35 (1999). Given that \u201cerroneous jury instructions regarding essential elements [are] reviewed for harmless error by utilizing a \u2018prejudice\u2019 standard,\u201d this Court must assess whether a properly instructed jury might have reached a different result, had the error not occurred. <em>Vaughn, supra </em>at 228, 230, 238 (opinion of Brickley, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">FELONY MURDER INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">As recognized by the majority, defendant was convicted of felony murder \u201cas either a principal or an aider and abettor.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 758. To convict defendant of felony murder, the prosecution was required to establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-6\">(1) the killing of a human being, (2) with the intent to kill, to do great bodily harm, or to create a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result, (3) while committing, attempting to commit, or assisting in the commission of any of the felonies enumerated in MCL 750.316; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>MSA 28.548.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] <em>[People v Nix, </em>453 Mich 619, 640; 556 NW2d 866 (1996) (Boyle, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">After the trial court appropriately instructed the jury on the first element of felony murder,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">The prosecution does not have to prove that [defendant], himself, killed [the victim] or participated in the killing. To prove this element the prosecution need prove only that one of the robbers killed [the victim].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">By instructing the jury that the prosecution was required to prove only that one of the robbers killed the victim, the trial court blended its felony-murder instruction with an element of aiding and abetting. As noted by the majority, the elements supporting a finding of aiding and abetting felony murder are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">\u201c \u2018(1) [felony murder] was committed by the defendant or some other person, (2) the defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of [felony murder], and (3) the defendant intended the commission of [felony murder] or had knowledge that the principal intended its commission at the time he gave aid and encouragement.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Ante </em>at 757, quoting <em>People v Turner, </em>213 Mich App 558, 568; 540 NW2d 728 (1995).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">By instructing the jury that the victim had to be killed by defendant or another person, the trial court satisfied the first element of aiding and abetting felony murder. The trial court also satisfied the third element by instructing the jury that defendant had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>possess the requisite mens rea to commit felony murder.

It reasons that, when viewed as a whole, the trial court\u2019s instructions adequately protected defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Id. </em>at 770-771. However, the majority attempts to support this erroneous reasoning by citing the following excerpts from the trial court\u2019s instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">\u201cIf the killing was purely <em>accidental and totally unex</em>pected,, none of the robbers is guilty of First Degree Murder, or if the killing was an act done by one of the robbers which the others had no reason to <em>anticipate, </em>the other robbers are not guilty of First Degree Felony Murder.' They are guilty of an armed robbery, but not murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">\u201cIf none of the participants <em>intended </em>for anyone to get killed or hurt and there was no good reason to <em>anticipate </em>given how things were planned and/or how they were carried out, that anyone would get killed or hurt, then any death which occurred during the course of the robbery is not a Felony Murder. If given the circumstances of planning and committing the robbery there was no good reason for participants other than the killer to <em>anticipate </em>a killing or a serious injury, those other participants are not guilty of a Felony Murder. If the way a robbery is planned and/or carried out gives the participants good reason to <em>anticipate </em>that someone might be killed or seriously injured, those participants are guilty of First Degree Felony Murder if someone does get hurt and' dies from their injuries even though it was not planned that anyone be killed or injured. <em>[Ante </em>at 771 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The majority acknowledges that these excerpts provided additional instructions, only, regarding the element of malice. <em>Id. </em>at 772. However, on the basis of them, it inexplicably concludes that \u201cthe jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>not have come to those conclusions without also finding that defendant aided or encouraged the killing.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The trial court utterly failed to instruct the jury on the second element of aiding and abetting felony murder, and the remaining instructions provided no guidance regarding this element.

The trial court failed to instruct the jury that defendant must have \u201cperformed acts or given encouragement that assisted\u201d in the killing, and expressly instructed that defendant need not have participated in the killing. Consequently, I would conclude that defendant was prejudiced by the failure to instruct on an essential element of the crime. Although I believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of felony murder,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a properly instructed jury might have found otherwise.

Although it accurately recognizes that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on aiding and abetting felony murder, it errs by concluding that defendant was not prejudiced by this error. In addition, I reject the majority\u2019s unwarranted extension of the standard for reviewing unpreserved claims of constitutional error utilized in <em>People v Grant </em>to the unpreserved claim of constitutional error presented here. Therefore, I would reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b869-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\"> 445 Mich 535; 520 NW2d 123 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\"> The majority contends my</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">position is flawed because it ignores the plain language of MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052 and MCR 2.516(C), which require parties to preserve claims of instructional error. Although the dissent suggests that the Fourteenth Amendment may require that this Court disregard the policy underlying the preservation requirement, ... it fails to explain how our extension of the plain error rule to unpreserved claims of constitutional error violates due process. The Supreme Court surely would not have applied the plain error rule in <em>Johnson [v United, States, </em>520 US 461; 117 S Ct 1544; 137 L Ed 2d 718 (1997)] if its application violates due process. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s approach would collapse Michigan\u2019s preservation requirement into the harmless error rule and would thus fail to further the important policy considerations underlying our preservation jurisprudence. <em>[Ante </em>at 767-768, n 16.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Whereas it asserts that I ignore the \u201cplain language of MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052 and MCR 2.516(C),\u201d the majority itself concedes that MCR 2.516(C) and MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052 \u201cdo not control in this case because the alleged error is a constitutional one . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 767.

Contrary to the majority, I believe that we are not free to follow MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052 and MCR 2.516(C) if they provide less protection of a defendant\u2019s due process rights than required under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>261, citing <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\"> The majority fails to acknowledge that <em>Grant </em>addressed \u201ca trial court\u2019s failure to give a <em>preliminary </em>instruction before an offer of testimony on insanity . . . .\u201d <em>Grant, supra </em>at 537 (emphasis added).

As noted by Justice Levin in his <em>Grant </em>dissent, the \u201cadoption of the views expressed by the majority in <em>Olano </em>concerning the meaning of the federal plain error rule ignores the significant difference between the federal judicial power and the judicial power confided to this Court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>556.
