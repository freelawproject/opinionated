He was sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tenced to 25 to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment. The Court of Appeals reversed his conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued October 3, 1997 (Docket No. 179955). It held that defendant was denied the right to a fair trial on the basis of the cumulative effect of three errors: 1) prosecution witnesses improperly testified regarding complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness before complainant testified and before defendant attacked her character for truthfulness, 2) the prosecutor improperly introduced evidence relating to defendant\u2019s use of marijuana with his son, and 3) an expert witness improperly testified that complainant\u2019s behavior was consistent with that of a sexual abuse victim. We granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 457 Mich 864 (1998). We find error in the admission of evidence bolstering complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness before defendant attacked it, but conclude that this error was harmless. Further, we find no error in the admission of the other challenged evidence. We accordingly reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">At trial, complainant testified that defendant sexually assaulted her over forty times in a two-year period, including \u201c[m]aybe two\u201d times in May, 1992. (The charge at issue arises out of an alleged incident of sexual intercourse on or about May 1, 1992.) Complainant testified that she finally reported the sexual abuse to a teacher in May, 1993. She also testified that she attempted suicide following her report of the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Defendant\u2019s son testified that he observed his father engaging in inappropriate wrestling with his sister. He testified that defendant later \u201csaid that he was very sorry that he did this and that it was her [complainant] that said to do these things not him and that he just said he really screwed up and just kept saying he was sorry.\u201d Defendant\u2019s son also testified that defendant told him that complainant \u201chad eyes like her mother\u2019s . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Defendant testified that he did not engage in sexual intercourse with complainant. He explained that his conversation with his son about being sorry did not relate to any sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">At issue are three alleged errors regarding the admission of evidence. The decision whether to admit evidence is within the trial court\u2019s discretion; this Court only reverses such decisions where there is an abuse of discretion. <em>People v Starr, </em>457 Mich 490, 494; 577 NW2d 673 (1998). However, decisions regarding the admission of evidence frequently involve preliminary questions of law, e.g., whether a rule of evidence or statute precludes admissibility of the evidence. This Court reviews questions of law de novo. <em>People v Sierb, </em>456 Mich 519, 522; 581 NW2d 219 (1998). Accordingly, when such preliminary questions of law are at issue, it must be borne in mind that it is an abuse of discretion to admit evidence that is inadmissible as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">I. EVIDENCE SUPPORTING COMPLAINANT\u2019S CHARACTER FOR TRUTHFULNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The first issue before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the prosecution to introduce evidence supporting complainant\u2019s charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ter for truthfulness before she had even testified. Specifically, the trial court allowed the prosecution to present the testimony of complainant\u2019s teacher, complainant\u2019s brother, complainant\u2019s mother and the investigating police officer regarding complainant\u2019s good character for truthfulness. Resolution of this issue requires a determination whether defense counsel\u2019s opening statement attacked her character for truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">MRE 608(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Where a defense counsel attacks a witness\u2019 character for truthfulness in an opening statement, the prosecution may present evidence that supports the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness on direct examination. <em>United States v Cruz, </em>805 F2d 1464, 1479-1480 (CA 11, 1986); <em>United States v Jones, </em>763 F2d 518, 522 (CA 2, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Here, in his opening statement, defense counsel stated that defendant\u2019s defense was that the charged incident \u201cdidn\u2019t happen.\u201d Specifically, defense counsel stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">[TJhere are only two people on the face of this Earth who [are] in a position to know what happened and there may be evidence from which you may come to the conclusion that one or both of them don\u2019t even know what happened. Because there is a potential for evidence that one of the witnesses that will be offering testimony has serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>problems that may affect her ability to recount and describe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The trial court found that this opening statement attacked complainant\u2019s credibility and accordingly overruled defendant\u2019s objection to evidence supporting complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The trial court\u2019s ruling failed to note the distinction between credibility and character for truthfulness and the implications of this distinction. Credibility is defined as \u201c[worthiness of belief; that quality in a witness which renders his evidence worthy of belief.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 366. Credibility may be attacked in numerous ways, e.g., demonstrating a witness\u2019 inability to perceive or remember the event at issue. Attacking a witness\u2019 character for truthfulness is one of the means by which a witness\u2019 credibility may be attacked. Thus, the two terms are not synonymous; rather, character for truthfulness is a specific aspect of credibility. MRE 608(a) states that \u201ccredibility\u201d may be attacked or supported by opinion or reputation evidence, subject to two limitations: 1) that the evidence refer only to \u201ccharacter for truthfulness\u201d and 2) that evidence supporting a witness\u2019 \u201ccharacter for truthfulness\u201d is only admissible after the witness\u2019 \u201ccharacter for truthfulness\u201d has been attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Here, defense counsel did not accuse complainant of intentionally lying, but he asserted that she had emotional problems that affected her ability to recount and describe and that the charged incident, which she was expected to describe, did not happen. These assertions indicated that her testimony would not be worthy of belief. Accordingly, defense counsel\u2019s opening statement did attack her credibility. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>it did not attack her character for truthfulness, i.e., it did not suggest that she was lying. An attack on a witness\u2019 <em>credibility, </em>like the one at issue, that is not an attack on the witness\u2019 <em>character for truthfulness </em>does not trigger MRE 608(a)(2). In the absence of an attack on complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness, the prosecution was not entitled, under MRE 608(a), to support her character for truthfulness. Further, we note that evidence of complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness is simply unresponsive to defendant\u2019s contention that complainant suffered emotional problems that affected her ability to recount and describe \u2014 the contention the bolstering evidence was allegedly admitted to rebut. Because the evidence bolstering complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness was inadmissible as a matter of law under MRE 608(a) when her character for truthfulness had not been attacked, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the prosecution to introduce such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Having concluded that the trial court erred in admitting this evidence, we must next determine whether this error requires reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction, hi <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203, 212; 551 NW2d 891 (1996), this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">In Michigan, the harmless-error rule is primarily embodied in statute [MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096], with additional statements of the doctrine in our court rule [MCR 2.613(A)] and evidentiary rule [MRE 103].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Section 26 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">No judgment or verdict shall be . . . reversed ... in any criminal case, on the ground of. . . the improper admission ... of evidence, . . . unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The <em>Mateo </em>Court held at 206:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">Under our statute, as under federal law, a reviewing court is not to find nonconstitutional preserved error harmless simply because it concludes the jury reached the right result. Disregarding errors that do not affect substantial rights, the reviewing court is to examine the record as a whole and the actual prejudicial effect of the error on the factfinder in the case at hand. Where the error asserted is the erroneous admission of evidence, the court engages in a comparative analysis of the likely effect of the error in light of the other evidence. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">It explained at 215:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">Simply stated, . . . reversal is only required if the error was prejudicial. That inquiry focuses on the nature of the error and assesses its effect in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">However, because it was unnecessary to the resolution of the matter before it, the <em>Mateo </em>Court did not decide the issue of \u201cthe level of assurance an appellate court on direct review must have that a preserved, nonconstitutional error was not prejudicial and thus harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 220-221.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">In <em>People v Gearns, </em>457 Mich 170; 577 NW2d 422 (1998), a majority of this Court decided that issue by adopting the \u201chighly probable\u201d standard for preserved, nonconstitutional error. Under this standard, the test is whether \u201cit is highly probable that the [erroneously admitted] evidence did not contribute to the verdict[] in light of the strength and weight of the untainted evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173. This test effectively creates a presumption that such an error justifies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>reversal of a conviction unless the prosecutor demonstrates that the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The test articulated by the <em>Geams </em>majority is inconsistent with \u00a7 26 because it places the burden on the prosecutor to demonstrate that a preserved, nonconstitutional error is harmless. In contrast, \u00a7 26 states that the types of error listed <em>are not grounds for reversal unless </em>it shall \u201caffirmatively appear\u201d that such an error resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Thus, \u00a7 26 creates a presumption that preserved, non-constitutional error is harmless, which presumption may be rebutted by a showing that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>Mateo </em>Court correctly so held at 211:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[Section 26] should not be construed to require actual innocence, but, rather, it should be viewed as a legislative directive to <em>presume </em>the validity of verdicts and to <em>reverse only </em>with respect to those errors that <em>affirmatively appear </em>to undermine the reliability of the verdict. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Section 26, with its rebuttable presumption, clearly places the burden on the defendant to demonstrate that a preserved, nonconstitutional error resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>miscarriage of justice. We are therefore convinced that the test adopted by the <em>Gearns </em>majority, which placed the burden on the prosecution to demonstrate that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that a preserved, non-constitutional error \u201cdid not contribute to the verdict,\u201d is wrong because it conflicts with the burden of proof established by \u00a7 26. We accordingly overrule the <em>Gearns </em>test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Both <em>Mateo </em>and <em>Gearns </em>indicated the necessity of determining a \u201clevel of assurance\u201d for deciding whether a preserved, nonconstitutional error justified reversal of a conviction. In the context of \u00a7 26, with its rebuttable presumption of harmlessness, this would be articulated as the level of assurance that a preserved, nonconstitutional error resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The <em>Mateo </em>Court suggested three possible levels of assurance: highly probable, more probable than not, and reasonable likelihood. <em>Mateo </em>at 219. Section 26 itself provides no specialized level of assurance. In the absence of any such provision in the statute, we believe that the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d standard is proper. Given that \u00a7 26 places the burden on a defendant to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice, any higher standard, e.g., \u201chighly probable,\u201d would place a greater burden on defendants than \u00a7 26 envisions. It would be troubling indeed if a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ant\u2019s demonstration that it was more probable than not that a preserved, nonconstitutional error resulted in a miscarriage of justice was deemed insufficient to justify a new trial. On the other hand, a lower standard, like \u201creasonable likelihood,\u201d would be inconsistent with \u00a7 26\u2019s rebuttable presumption of harmlessness. Accordingly, we conclude that the level of assurance that a preserved, nonconstitutional error justifies reversal of a conviction is the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In summary, we reiterate that \u00a7 26 controls judicial review of preserved, nonconstitutional error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 26 places the burden on the defendant to demonstrate that \u201cafter an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error asserted has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d We agree with the <em>Mateo </em>Court\u2019s holding that reversal is only required if such an error is prejudicial and that the appropriate inquiry \u201cfocuses on the nature of the error and assesses its effect in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.\u201d <em>Mateo </em>at 215. The object of this inquiry is to determine if it affirmatively appears that the error asserted \u201cundermine [s] the reliability of the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211. In other words, the effect of the error is evaluated by assessing it in the context of the untainted evidence to determine whether it is more probable than not that a different outcome would have resulted without the error. Therefore, the bottom line is that \u00a7 26 presumes that a preserved, nonconstitutional error is not a ground for reversal unless \u201cafter an examination of the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>cause, it shall affirmatively appear\u201d that it is more probable than not that the error was outcome determinative.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Here, there was no physical evidence of the alleged assault. However, this case did not present a simple credibility contest between complainant and defendant. The testimony of complainant\u2019s brother (who is also defendant\u2019s son) included discussion of an apology by defendant in which he virtually confessed that he had sexually assaulted complainant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Defendant testified at trial and contended that this apology did not relate to any sexual contact with complainant. However, defendant confirmed that he made such an apology and offered no explanation for his statements to the effect that it was complainant\u2019s idea \u201cto do these things\u201d and that she \u201chad eyes like her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>mother\u2019s.\u201d The apology, with these unexplained references, is strong evidence that defendant was admitting and apologizing for the charged conduct with complainant. Complainant\u2019s brother\u2019s testimony about this apology, confirmed in large part by defendant, is untainted by the improper bolstering of complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness. In the context of this untainted evidence, defendant has not demonstrated that it is more probable than not that the outcome would have been different without this error. Thus, it does not \u201caffirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Accordingly, this preserved, nonconstitutional error is not a proper ground for reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">H. EVIDENCE THAT DEFENDANT SMOKED MARIJUANA WITH HIS SON</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The second issue before us is whether the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to cross-examine defendant regarding his use of marijuana with his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">MRE 404 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">(a) <em>Character Evidence Generally. </em>Evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">(1) <em>Character of Accused. </em>Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">MRE 405 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">(a) <em>Reputation or Opinion. </em>In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tion or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into reports of relevant specific instances of conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Here, on direct examination, defendant testified regarding his role as a father and provider and gave examples of the types of activities he engaged in with his children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He essentially claimed that he only engaged in appropriate activities with his children. This claim was clearly \u201cevidence of a pertinent trait of character\u201d in the context of a trial on charges that defendant raped his daughter. Thus, this evidence offered by the accused was admissible under MRE 404(a)(1). This testimony opened the door to cross-examination about whether he considered himself a \u201crole model\u201d and whether he tried to \u201cinstill morals and values\u201d in his children. Defendant responded affirmatively to these questions. The prosecutor then asked whether defendant provided marijuana to or smoked marijuana with his son. This cross-examination inquired into a specific instance of conduct to rebut defendant\u2019s claim that he only engaged in appropriate activities with his children. Where, as here, evidence of a pertinent character trait is admitted, MRE 405(a) allows cross-examination into relevant specific instances of conduct. Accordingly, the cross-examination regarding whether defendant smoked marijuana with his son was admissible under MRE 404(a)(1) and MRE 405(a). The prosecutor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>not engage in misconduct by asking these questions on cross-examination, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Defendant and the Court of Appeals improperly framed this issue as whether this \u201cbad act\u201d evidence was admissible under MRE 404(b). MRE 404(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">(1) Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, scheme, plan, or system in doing an act, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident when the same is material, whether such other crimes, wrongs, or acts are contemporaneous with, or prior or subsequent to the conduct at issue in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">(2) The prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in. advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial and the rationale, whether or not mentioned in subparagraph (b)(1), for admitting the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Here, the prosecutor did not attempt to introduce evidence that defendant smoked marijuana with his son to prove that defendant had acted in conformity with his character for marijuana use. Rather, he merely cross-examined defendant regarding this issue, as permitted by MRE 405(a), in response to defendant\u2019s testimony, under MRE 404(a)(1), that he was a father who only engaged in appropriate activities with his children. This cross-examination under MRE 405(a) simply did not implicate MRE 404(b). Thus, the prosecutor was not obligated, under MRE 404(b), to demonstrate a purpose under which such evidence would be admissible or to provide notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Accordingly, we find no error in this cross-examination and, therefore, no justification for reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">HI. EVIDENCE THAT COMPLAINANT\u2019S BEHAVIOR WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF SEXUAL ABUSE VICTIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The third issue before us is whether the trial court erred in allowing an expert to testify that complainant\u2019s behavior was consistent with that of a sexual abuse victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In <em>People v Peterson, </em>450 Mich 349, 352; 537 NW2d 857 (1995), this Court reiterated general principles regarding child sexual abuse expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">(1) an expert may not testify that the sexual abuse occurred, (2) an expert may not vouch for the veracity of a victim, and (3) an expert may not testify whether the defendant is guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">It also clarified aspects of such testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">(1) an expert may testify in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief regarding typical and relevant symptoms of child sexual abuse for the sole purpose of explaining a victim\u2019s specific behavior that might be incorrectly construed by the jury as inconsistent with that of an actual abuse victim, and (2) an expert may testify with regard to the consistencies between the behavior of the particular victim and other victims of child sexual abuse to rebut an attack on the victim\u2019s credibility. <em>[Id. </em>at 352-353.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">The <em>Peterson </em>Court specified two situations in which an expert may testify that a victim\u2019s behavior was consistent with that of a sexual abuse victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">Unless a defendant raises the issue of the particular child victim\u2019s post-incident behavior <em>or </em>attacks the child\u2019s credibility, an expert may not testify that the particular child vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>tim\u2019s behavior is consistent with that of a sexually abused child. Such testimony would be improper because it comes too close to testifying that the particular child is a victim of sexual abuse. <em>[Id. </em>at 373-374 (emphasis added). ][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Here, Judith Schiap7 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> testified that complainant\u2019s psychiatric behaviors were consistent with those of a sexual abuse victim. She testified about characteristics that fit within a sexual abuse victim profile. She acknowledged that some of the characteristics in the profile were also consistent with other traumas and specifically stated that suicide attempts were consistent with traumas other than sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Defendant\u2019s theory was that complainant had emotional problems, unrelated to any sexual abuse, that made her testimony incredible. In his opening statement, defense counsel asserted that complainant had \u201cserious problems that may affect her ability to recount and describe.\u201d This theory raised the issue of complainant\u2019s post-incident behavior, e.g., her suicide attempts. Under <em>Peterson, </em>raising the issue of a complainant\u2019s post-incident behavior opens the door to expert testimony that the complainant\u2019s behavior was consistent with that of a sexual abuse victim. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Schiap to so testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Moreover, defendant effectively cross-examined Schiap and convincingly argued in closing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>fact that a behavior is \u201cconsistent\u201d with the behavior of a sexual abuse victim is not dispositive evidence that sexual abuse occurred. Specifically, he argued that \u201calmost any behavior is not inconsistent with being a victim of sexual assault.\u201d In the context of defendant\u2019s effective cross-examination and closing argument regarding this issue, any error in admitting this evidence would not have resulted in a miscarriage of justice that would justify reversal under \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Accordingly, we find no error in the admission of this expert witness testimony that justifies reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that the admission of evidence bolstering complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness was error here, but that this error did not result in a miscarriage of justice that would justify reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 26. Further, we conclude that the other two. evidentiary errors found by the Court of Appeals were not, in fact, errors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We accordingly reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Weaver, C.J., and Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\"> The dissent misreads our opinion by suggesting that we have held that \u00a7 26 creates a rebuttable presumption solely because of the words \u201caffirmatively appear\u201d that are found in the section. The dissent\u2019s understanding is flawed. We have reached the conclusion that there is such a presumption through the language and structure of the statute as a whole, which when read in its entirety creates this presumption. Specifically, \u00a7 26 states in pertinent part, \u201cNo judgment or verdict shall be . . . reversed ... in any criminal case, on the ground of [listed types of error] <em>unless </em>in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language speaks for itself. Moreover, we are not the first court to understand this language in this fashion. The <em>Mateo </em>Court similarly concluded that \u00a7 26 creates such a presumption, as noted below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\"> We do not lightly overrule prior decisions of this Court. Yet the rule of stare decisis is not an inexorable command. <em>People v Graves, </em>458 Mich 476, 481; 581 NW2d 229 (1998). \u201cWhen it becomes apparent that the reasoning of an opinion is erroneous, and that less mischief will result from overruling the case rather than following it, it becomes the duty of the court to correct it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Attorney General ex rel Barnes v Midland Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>178 Mich 513, 518; 144 NW 883 (1914). That is the situation we face here with the <em>Geams </em>test, which is of recent vintage and has perforce had little reliance placed upon it.

Whether it will or not is unknown at this time. But if the standard mandated by the Legislature in \u00a7 26 proves unworkable or unfair, the Legislature can, of course, be expected to modify it. This Court\u2019s duty is to follow the law articulated by the Legislature rather than to adopt a standard that a majority of the Court merely prefers in contravention of the plain language of an applicable statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\"> In addition to the direct testimony quoted above, this apology was also explored on cross-examination of complainant\u2019s brother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\"><em>Q. </em>Now, this discussion with your father you described it in detail what he supposedly admitted to having done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\"><em>A. </em>Are you talking about the conversation we had at the table when I was helping him move?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\"><em>Q. </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\"><em>A. </em>You want me to try and give you his exact words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\"><em>Q. </em>Well, you said that he said he had screwed up and that he was sorry and that he started to cry and you described he said that [complainant] and your mother had similar eyes.

Today the majority overrules our decision in <em>Geams, </em>and holds that a court must not reverse a conviction unless it finds that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the error in question was prejudicial. <em>Ante </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The harmless error statute states that \u201c[n]o judgment or verdict shall be . . . reversed ... unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, <em>it shall affirmatively appear </em>that the error complained of has resulted in <em>a miscarriage of </em>justice.\u201d MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096 (emphasis supplied). Our cases agree that the phrase \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d means \u201cprejudicial,\u201d and this means simply that the error influenced the verdict. <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203, 215; 551 NW2d 891 (1996). The question before us, then, is how certain must the court be that the error was prejudicial?</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In <em>Geams, </em>we adopted dictum in <em>Mateo </em>stating that the appropriate level of certainty was \u201cwhether it is highly probable that the challenged evidence did not contribute to the verdict <em>. Id. </em>at 205, citing <em>Mateo, supra </em>at 219. While I agree as a matter of pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>icy that this level of certainty is appropriate, I am unable to reconcile the <em>Geams </em>test with Michigan\u2019s harmless error statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The statute states that the verdict should not be disturbed unless \u201cit shall affirmatively appear\u201d that the error was prejudicial. MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096. The majority\u2019s standard is more consistent with this language than the standard we set forth in <em>Geams.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Because the language of the statute resolves this question and compellingly supports the majority\u2019s conclusion, I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Cavanagh, J. I must dissent from both the majority\u2019s decision and its effort to recast this case into a vehicle with which to begin the process of both rewriting and simultaneously rendering effectively pointless large portions of our standards of review for error in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In <em>People v Gearns, </em>457 Mich 170; 577 NW2d 422 (1998), this Court continued down the path begun in <em>People v Mateo, </em>453 Mich 203, 212; 551 NW2d 891 (1996), adopting the highly probable test of Justice Traynor for instances of preserved, nonconstitutional error. The essence of that test was that the prosecution must prove that it was highly probable that erroneously admitted evidence did not contribute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tainted verdict. As anyone who has ventured through the sixty-one pages and four opinions might note, <em>Gearns </em>and its companion were not easy cases, and there certainly was no lack of deliberation or debate among the Court. Now, but a year later, we are summarily told that <em>Gearns </em>was wrongly decided, and, moreover, so told by one whose views were heard among us in <em>Gearns.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In this case, as the majority is forced to agree,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there was clear error in the admission, before the complainant had even testified, of bolstering testimony regarding her character for truthfulness. By offering these \u201csneak previews\u201d into complainant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>character for truthfulness, the prosecutor was able to build up her purported character for truthfulness before it was even attacked. The gate to the minefield that is character evidence is closely guarded by our court rules, and the Court\u2019s decision allowing the prosecutor to drag the jury down his selected path through that field was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The majority posits that <em>Gearns </em>is not true to MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096, and thus must go. Nonetheless, the majority would look at the very same statute for the proposition that the statute \u201citself provides no specialized level of assurance.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 494. In the words \u201caffirmatively appear,\u201d of \u00a7 26, the majority finds lurking a rebuttable presumption of harmlessness. While the word \u201caffirmatively,\u201d under our rules of statutory construction, must surely be given meaning, I cannot fathom any definition<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the word that includes a meaning such as \u201cin a sufficient fashion as to defeat a rebuttable presumption of harmlessness.\u201d And yet, that is how the majority \u201creads\u201d the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall <em>in a sufficient fashion as to defeat a rebuttable presumption of harmlessness, </em>appear that the error complained of is a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Compare this, of course, with the Legislature\u2019s own wording, viewed without the added gloss of the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">A more literal and simpler definition of affirmatively, which, in its various forms, implies an assertion that something is true, might well speak more to a court having some level of assurance<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> than it does to any rebuttable presumption.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>While claiming (correctly) that \u00a7 26 \u201ccontrols\u201d our inquiry, the majority must, in effect, add a considerable amount of text to the statute in order for it to \u201ccontrol\u201d its chosen result.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Were we in a world where stare decisis required more than a perfunctory disregarding note, I would apply the test of <em>Gearns. </em>The majority suggests that the testimony of complainant\u2019s brother, cited in the margin <em>(ante </em>at 496-497) was persuasive that such error was harmless. While an apology by the defendant was acknowledged by the brother, the quotation offered by the majority contains far more information (as cited by the majority) offered by the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>than was actually contained in the brother\u2019s rather ineffectual answers. While, if one were willing to build a house of inference cards, there certainly could be some evidence that defendant came close to confessing to the brother,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this merely points toward the primary problem with the majority\u2019s newfound standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The majority (as opposed to the statute itself) crafts a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d under which the defendant must come forth with some showing that \u201cit is more probable than not that the error was outcome determinative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496. Exactly how, I would ask, will this presumption ever be rebutted? In almost every criminal case, there will be at least two witnesses for the prosecution, the complainant and a law enforcement officer of some sort (and in those cases where the complainant is unavailable, there will likely be many more witnesses). Thus, there will nearly always be testimony on at least tangential issues, untainted by any error, no matter how egregious.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">A favorite line among some of my colleagues in discussing harmlessness is \u201ca reasonable jury could have found.\u201d And thus, no matter what showing a defendant may make regarding how damning the error was to his cause, the appellate court (particularly if it sanctions inference piling) will always be in a position to state \u201ca reasonable jury could have found\u201d and rely on whatever untainted testimony (and inferences, tenable and otherwise) exists in the record. The majority has constructed a hurdle that cannot be cleared, not because of its height, but because of the wall on the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Review of error for harmlessness is by no means an easy task. This is so, in large part, because one of the most basic tenets of our system is that we do not journey behind a jury\u2019s verdict or into the jury room. There is naturally some level of difficulty in determining what we insist we have no information of, whether the jury relied on the tainted evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A burden placed on the prosecutor to establish that he proved guilt without and beyond the tainted evidence, to the extent that the jury would have had no need for the tainted evidence, is perhaps demanding, but nonetheless certainly achievable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, given our tendency to credit the jury for possibly selecting any pearl of evidence from a sea of shells, the majority\u2019s test will place the defendant in a position of not only having to demonstrate the harm wrought by the error, but also of having to counter suppositions and inferences from other evidence that are limited only by the number of witnesses offered and the imagination of the reviewing court. The Legislature selected \u201caffirmatively\u201d as its level of assurance in \u00a7 26, not some more demanding term (e.g., positively, absolutely, or even clearly, etc. . . .). I fear the effect of the majority\u2019s implicit statutory modification is to replace the balancing of the scales chosen by our Legislature with one of a markedly more severe tilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The majority\u2019s effort today does not bode well for consistency in our law, adherence to (what is said by, as opposed to what we would prefer to be said by) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>our statutes, or the worthwhileness of appellate review of nonconstitutional errors (or, for that matter, preservation of such errors).</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-11\"> \u201cAffirmative\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]hat which declares positively; that which avers a fact to be true; that which establishes . . .

Such endeavors, however, are likely to suggest that the decisions of this Court are only as stable as its composition, and that changes in it might be presumed by some to evidence a mandate for wholesale changes in the other, even in the absence of the passage of time, changes in circumstances, or any other of the more noble reasons to reevaluate our past decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior courts.
