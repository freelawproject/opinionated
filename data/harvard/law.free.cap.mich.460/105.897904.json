Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company seeks a determination of its obligation to indemnify its insureds for collateral property damage resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>from the insureds\u2019 intentional destruction of their inventoiy by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">We hold that the collateral damage was not \u201caccidental\u201d as defined in the insurance policies at issue. Consequently, no \u201coccurrence\u201d triggered Frankenmuth\u2019s liability under the policies. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of Frankenmuth.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">This case arises out of a fire that began on the premises of the Masters <em>&amp; </em>Son Men\u2019s Clothing Store in Alpena, Michigan. George Edwin Masters (George Sr.) and his son, George Enger Masters (George Jr.), intentionally set the fire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fire occurred at the Masters &amp; Son Men\u2019s Clothing Store during the early morning hours of August 17, 1993. Both confessed to police that their plan had been to start a small smokey fire that would damage their clothing inventory and allow them to collect casualty insurance. They denied intending to destroy their building or any of the neighboring buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The resulting fire extensively damaged the clothing store and spread to nearby businesses, causing collateral damage from both the fire and the efforts to extinguish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The clothing store was owned by George Sr. It was insured by a casualty and comprehensive general liability policy written by Frankenmuth Mutual (commercial policy). George Sr. and his wife also owned a home, insured under a homeowners policy also written by Frankenmuth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Certain of the other businesses damaged by the fire had full casualty insurance coverage, while others were only partially covered. They, along with their insurers, sought to impose liability against the Masters. The Masters in turn asked Frankenmuth to defend and indemnify pursuant to the commercial and homeowners policies. Frankenmuth then filed the instant declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination whether there was coverage for the property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Frankenmuth sought summary disposition, arguing two theories. First, it asserted that neither policy provided coverage because the policies define \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident\u201d and this intentionally set fire cannot be construed as an accident. Second, even if the fire and resulting damage could be construed as an occurrence, the policies\u2019 intentional-acts exclusion clauses negate coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The trial court granted summary disposition in favor of Frankenmuth, pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). It held that, to find whether there had been an \u201coccur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>rence,\u201d it must examine the events from the standpoint of the insureds and subjectively evaluate their intent. It reasoned that our recent decisions in <em>Arco Industries Corp v American Motorists Ins Co</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Piccard</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>provided guidance in this area. The trial court concluded that <em>Arco </em>and <em>Piccard </em>were distinguishable from the instant case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">Turning to the case at bar, it is necessary for this Court to ascertain whether or not the Masterses [sic] had the subjective intent for the \u201coccurrence\u201d in question. It is undisputed that setting the initial fire was not an accident, i.e., no occurrence under the policy. It is clear that the Masterses intended to bum property; the crime they were convicted of required a finding by the jury of the specific intent to bum property, a subjective standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">The Masterses had the specific intent to bum property\u2014 the questions of whose or how much are wholly irrelevant. What is relevant is that the character of the resulting harm is consistent with the harm intended by the Masterses. To the contrary, in <em>Piccard </em>and <em>Arco, </em>the character of the resulting harm was inconsistent with that intended by the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The trial court also went on to discuss the alternative argument, concluding that both policies\u2019 intentional-acts exclusions would also bar recovery here.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The subrogee insurance companies appealed to the Court of Appeals, which partially reversed the trial court\u2019s holding in a published decision. 225 Mch App 51; 570 NW2d 134 (1997). It found <em>Arco </em>controlling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">[W]e must analyze whether the Masters\u2019 conduct, from their perspective, evidenced an intent to bum the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>adjoining buildings. Second, we must analyze whether the Masters had an awareness that harm was likely to follow from the performance of their actions. Further, the <em>[Arc\u00f3] </em>Court stated: \u201cMere knowledge of potential danger does not equal knowledge of actual, intentional, expected harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">In the present case, the trial court found that the Masters had the specific intent to bum property and that the questions of whose property and how much property they intended to bum were \u201cwholly irrelevant.\u201d The trial court also stated that the character of the resulting harm was consistent with the harm intended by the Masters. We believe that the trial court erred in ruling that the Masters, as a matter of law, intended to bum the adjoining buildings and that the question of whose property they intended to bum was irrelevant. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arco </em>certainly instructs to the contrary. In <em>Arco, </em>although there were intentional discharges of volatile organic compounds into the environment by the insured, there was no evidence presented establishing that the intentional discharges were intended or expected to harm the environment. Thus, there was an occurrence within the meaning of the policy such that the insurer had a duty to defend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">The case before us presents a similar situation. Although the Masters intended to start a fire in their store, there is evidence that they did not intend or expect to bum the adjoining buildings. Therefore, the trial court erred in deciding this case under a motion for summary disposition. There is a question of fact regarding whether the Masters intended or expected to bum the adjoining buildings. This issue should not have been decided as a matter of law. [225 Mich App 59-60 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Court of Appeals then went on to examine the intentional-acts exclusion provisions. It concluded that, since the homeowners policy\u2019s exclusion used objective language, there was no coverage under this policy. However, because the commercial policy\u2019s exclusion used subjective language, there is a question of fact about whether the Masters intended or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>expected to damage property other than their own store.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Both Frankenmuth and the subrogee insurers sought leave to appeal in two separate applications. This Court granted leave in both on October 12, 1998. 459 Mich 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In determining whether Frankenmuth must indemnify the Masters, we examine the language of the insurance policies and interpret their terms in accordance with well established Michigan principles of construction. <em>Arco, supra </em>at 402; <em>Michigan Millers Mut Ins Co v Bronson Plating Co, </em>445 Mich 558, 567; 519 NW2d 864 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">An insurance policy must be enforced in accordance with its terms. <em>Upjohn Co v New Hampshire Ins Co, </em>438 Mich 197, 207; 476 NW2d 392 (1991). We will not hold an insurance company liable for a risk it did not assume. <em>Arco, supra; Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 567; 489 NW2d 431 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In interpreting ambiguous terms of an insurance policy, this Court will construe the policy in favor of the insured. <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v DeLaGarza, </em>433 Mich 208, 214; 444 NW2d 803 (1989); <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602, 624; 398 NW2d 411 (1986). However, we will not create ambiguity where the terms of the contract are clear. <em>Churchman, supra </em>at 567; <em>Patek v Aetna Life Ins Co, </em>362 Mich 292; 106 NW2d 828 (1961). Where there is no ambiguity, we will enforce the terms of the contract as written. <em>Arco, supra </em>at 402; <em>Stine v Continental Casualty Co, </em>419 Mich 89, 114; 349 NW2d 127 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Furthermore, this Court will interpret the terms of an insurance contract in accordance with their \u201ccommonly used meaning.\u201d <em>Arco, supra </em>at 403; <em>Group Ins Co of Michigan v Czopek, </em>440 Mich 590, 596; 489 NW2d 444 (1992); <em>Fireman's Fund Ins Cos v Ex-Cell-O Corp, </em>702 F Supp 1317, 1323, n 7 (ED Mich, 1988). We take into account the reasonable expectations of the parties. <em>Vanguard Ins Co v Clarke, </em>438 Mich 463, 472; 475 NW2d 48 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">According to the plain meaning of both the Frankenmuth homeowners and commercial policies, coverage exists only where an \u201coccurrence\u201d has taken place. The relevant portion of the homeowners policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily iryury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, [Frankenmuth] will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">1. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable. Damages include prejudgment interest awarded against the insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">2. provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice, even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. We may investigate and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. Our duty to settle or defend ends when the amount we pay for damages resulting from the occurrence equals our limit of liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The term \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined in the homeowners policy as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">a. bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-13\">b. property damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The relevant portion of the commercial policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">a. [Frankenmuth] will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages. We may at ora discretion investigate any \u201coccurrence\u201d and settle any claim or \u201csuit\u201d that may result. But:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">b. This insurance applies to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(1) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\" is caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d that takes place in the \u201ccoverage territory;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(2) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurs during the policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The term \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined in the commercial policy as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The question we must answer, then, is whether the case before us involved an \u201caccident\u201d as defined under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">In recent times, there has been controversy over inteipreting the term \u201caccident\u201d in cases such as the instant case, particularly where it is not defined in the insurance policy. See, e.g., <em>Auto Club Group Ins Co v Marzonie, </em>447 Mich 624; 527 NW2d 760 (1994). When the meaning of a term is not obvious from the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>language, the \u201ccommonly used meaning\u201d controls. <em>Arco, supra </em>at 404; <em>Czopek, supra </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In the instant case, the term \u201caccident\u201d is not defined by the Frankenmuth policies. However, using the common meaning of the term, we have repeatedly stated that \u201can accident is an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Arco, supra </em>at 404-405; <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>432 Mich 656, 670; 443 NW2d 734 (1989); <em>Marzonie, supra </em>at 631. After some debate concerning the issue, we have also held that the definition of accident should be framed from the standpoint of the insured, not the injured party.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, in the instant case, we hold that the accident must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>evaluated from the standpoint of the Masters, not those harmed by their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">We also hold that the appropriate focus of the term \u201caccident\u201d must be on both \u201cthe injury-causing <em>act </em>or <em>event </em>and its relation to the resulting property damage or personal injury.\u201d <em>Marzonie, supra </em>at 648 (Griffin, J., with Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurring); see also <em>Piccard, supra </em>at 556-557 (Cavanagh, C.J., with Boyle and Griffin, JJ., concurring). In so doing, we specifically adopt the persuasive analyses contained in Justice Griffin\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Marzonie </em>and Chief Justice Cavanagh\u2019s dissent in <em>Piccard.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Of course, \u201can insured need not act unintentionally\u201d in order for the act to constitute an \u201caccident\u201d and therefore an \u201coccurrence.\u201d <em>Marzonie, supra </em>(Griffin, J., with Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurring); see also <em>Piccard, supra </em>(Cavanagh, C.J., with Boyle and Griffin, JJ., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">However, where an insured does act intentionally, a problem arises \u201cin attempting to distinguish between intentional acts that can be classified as \u2018accidents\u2019 and those that cannot.\u201d <em>Marzonie, supra </em>(Griffin, J., with Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurring). In such cases, a determination must be made whether the consequences of the insured\u2019s intentional act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFp\">either were intended by the insured or reasonably should have been expected because of the direct risk of harm intentionally created by the insured\u2019s actions. When an insured acts intending to cause property damage or per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>sonal injury, liability coverage should be denied, irrespective of whether the resulting injury is different from the injury intended. Similarly, . . . when an insured\u2019s intentional actions create a direct risk of harm, there can be no liability coverage for <em>any </em>resulting damage or injury, despite the lack of an actual intent to damage or injure. <em>[Marzonie, supra </em>at 648-649 (Griffin, J., with Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We find useful the hypothetical example posed by Chief Justice Cavanagh in <em>Piccard, supra </em>at 558:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">Suppose the fire had been started by a faulty electric cord on the insured\u2019s coffeemaker. Examining the insured\u2019s act for \u201cintent,\u201d there is no doubt that he purposely plugged in the coffeemaker and turned on the switch. In that sense he acted intentionally. The fire remains an accident and the act constitutes an occurrence, however, because at the time of the insured\u2019s purposeful act he had no intent to cause harm. The act of plugging in the coffeepot is not a sufficiently direct cause of the harm, and the fire in this example is an accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Applying these principles to the case before us, viewed from the standpoint of the Masters, the fire, which was the underlying event, was caused by the Masters\u2019 intentional act. Also, there is no question that, in perpetrating the intentional act, the Masters intended to do property damage. Thus, the Masters\u2019 act cannot be characterized as an \u201caccident,\u201d and there was no \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of coverage under either policy. It is irrelevant whether the harm that resulted, damage to the clothing store and surrounding businesses, was different from or exceeded the harm intended, minor damage to the clothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>inventory. <em>Id. </em>at 557 (Cavanagh, C.J., with Boyle and Griffin, JJ., concurring).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In light of our conclusion, we need not determine whether the policies\u2019 intentional-acts exclusions would preclude recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Because the policies at issue do not provide coverage in this case, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of Frankenmuth.</p>\n<judges id=\"b203-6\">Weaver, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Taylor, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\"> The Masters now deny intentionally setting the fire. However, both George Sr. and George Jr. have been convicted of arson for burning the store. MCL 750.73; MSA 28.268. For purposes of this case, therefore, it is a settled question. The Masters were acquitted of another charge of arson in relation to the burning of several adjacent buildings. However, the acquittal does not directly answer the question whether the damage to those buildings should be considered an \u201coccurrence,\u201d requiring indemnification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> Although Frankenmuth originally contested that the Masters were \u201cinsured\u201d under the commercial policy, it has not continued to dispute this issue.

They are notably different in scope. However, we hold that the fire and resulting damage did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under either policy. Therefore, we do not reach whether the intentional-acts exclusions would bar coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\"> 448 Mich 395; 531 NW2d 168 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AF2\"> 440 Mich 539; 489 NW2d 422 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\"> As noted by Justice Mallett in <em>Arco, supra </em>at 405:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">This Court has debated this issue in a number of previous cases.
