While Ms. Glover\u2019s husband kept the attendant busy, Ms. Glover removed some money from a cash register. The Glovers were detained by gas station employees when the till was found to be open. Ms. Glover\u2019s husband slipped Ms. Glover a handgun he had and asked her to hide it. Ms. Glover hid the gun in the ladies\u2019 room toilet. A few minutes later, Ms. Glover\u2019s husband asked Ms. Glover to retrieve the gun so they could escape. Ms. Glover retrieved the gun and handed it to her husband. While attempting to escape apprehension, Ms. Glover\u2019s husband shot three people. One of the victims died immediately, and two others were seriously wounded. Ms. Glover was charged with one count of felony murder and two counts of assault with intent to commit murder. Pursuant to a plea bargain entered into after two days of trial, Ms. Glover pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder and two counts of assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>intent to commit murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court subsequently imposed three concurrent parolable life sentences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAOp\">In 1994, i.e., after eighteen years of incarceration, the parole board voted to move Ms. Glover\u2019s request for parole to a public hearing. The successor judge<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> declined to exercise his right under MCL 791.234(6)(b); MSA 28.2304(6)(b) to file a written objection and thereby bar the public hearing that must occur before a parole can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">A public hearing was held on May 25, 1994. As the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">Appellant\u2019s case might be described as a cause celebre. Her many supporters submitted letters[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and gave testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>at the public hearing urging the Parole Board to grant parole. Their testimony established that appellant has put her talents and industry to extensive use while in prison. Appellant earned college degrees with high honors and received a prestigious literary award. She was active in social and religious programs for prisoners, and involved herself in a ground-breaking federal lawsuit that has enhanced opportunities for the female inmates of this state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, relatives and friends of the victims, as well as community members, opposed parole[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] for various reasons, not the least being the tragic loss they had experienced as a result of appellant\u2019s acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">[226 Mich App 655, 657-658; 575 NW2d 772 (1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the chairperson of the parole board stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>I would be lying to any one of you if I said there\u2019s no way she is ever going to get out because we wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t close .... What will happen at this point in time is the Parole Board will have to weigh this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">On August 1, 1994, the parole board issued the following Notice of Action declining to grant parole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">After full consideration of the positions taken by those testifying at the public hearing and consideration of the adjustment, attitude and behavior of the prisoner, the parole board withdraws interest in proceeding toward parole at this time. You will next be interviewed by the parole board five years from your most recent interview as indicated in the official date above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Ms. Glover sought judicial review of this denial with the circuit court, complaining that the parole board had not provided a sufficiently detailed statement explaining its decision to deny her parole, that the parole board had violated the oma because the decision to deny parole was made without public notice, and that a recent statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> changing the interval of a lifer\u2019s parole interview from every two years to every five years violated the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the federal and Michigan Constitutions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The circuit court rejected each of Ms. Glover\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The Court of Appeals granted Ms. Glover\u2019s application for leave to appeal. The Court of Appeals found the parole board\u2019s explanation for denying parole inadequate, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">In the face of a mountain of information concerning appellant\u2019s correctional history, the Parole Board here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>abjured any meaningful explanation. It indicated that it considered all the information before it and decided to \u201cwithdraw\u201d interest in or consideration of parole. In other words, thumbs down. The Attorney General suggested during oral argument before this panel that we should undertake the review process that led the Parole Board to its decision by examining all the exhibits, reading all the testimony, briefs, and records and deciding on that basis whether the board had abused its discretion. That is not a review; it invites instead a post facto justification of a decision that we are unqualified to make at the outset. The Parole Board did indicate a \u201creason code of 92,\u201d which refers to the \u201clifer law interview.\u201d We take that to mean that the Parole Board considered its job to conduct an interview of the appellant because it had to, declined to grant parole, and gave no reasons because it need not. We do not think that passes federal or state due process constitutional muster. [226 Mich App 668-669, n 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The Court of Appeals held as follows: (1) no statute required the parole board to provide a written explanation for its decision to deny parole, (2) Ms. Glover nevertheless had a right under the federal and state Due Process Clauses to a written explanation of why she had been denied parole, (3) no ex post facto violation had occurred,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (4) the parole board had violated the OMA by making its final decision to deny parole without public notice. The Court remanded the case to the parole board so that it could provide a written explanation and retained jurisdiction, holding in abeyance consideration of the merits pending review of the board\u2019s written explanation. <em>Id. </em>at 670.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>We subsequently granted the parole board\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">THE BOAED\u2019S \u201cEXPLANATION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The primary issue in this case is whether Ms. Glover is entitled to a written explanation of the reason the parole board denied her request for parole. Before considering that question, however, we first must determine whether Ms. Glover has already received an adequate explanation. If she has, there is no need to remand or reach the other questions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The record of the public hearing reveals that there was substantial support for Ms. Glover\u2019s request for parole. Numerous letters of support had been submitted. Testimony showed Ms. Glover\u2019s educational achievements, her involvement in religious activities while incarcerated, her participation in individual and group psychotherapy, and a psychological report indicating that she did not need further psychotherapy. Moreover, resident unit managers filed positive reports, Ms. Glover had a confirmed offer of employment, and one of the deceased victim\u2019s children testified in favor of granting Ms. Glover parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Notwithstanding the impressive presentation on behalf of Ms. Glover, the record of the public hearing also establishes that there was significant opposition to a grant of parole. There was testimony from the surviving victim and relatives of the victims, all of whom opposed parole, along with a number of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>munity members expressing similar sentiments. A record was also established showing twenty-nine prison misconduct reports, numerous letters in opposition, and a petition signed by approximately 1,200 people who opposed, as a general matter, any parole for prisoners serving life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">That this was a difficult decision was made clear when the chairperson of the parole board stated at the conclusion of the public hearing \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t close.\u201d The parole board, after exercising its discretion to grant or deny parole, was required, pursuant to MCL 791.234(8); MSA 28.2304(8),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to provide a sufficient explanation for its decision, thereby allowing meaningful appellate review. The board failed, given the record herein, to provide such an explanation. It stated in its notice of action that it withdrew its interest in proceeding toward parole, citing only that it had considered \u201cthe positions taken by those testifying\u201d and had considered the \u201cadjustment, attitude and behavior of the prisoner . . . .\u201d We find that there is a lack of clarity regarding what about these factors compelled the board to act that caused the Court of Appeals to remand to the parole board for explication of its reason for denying parole. The Court of Appeals rightly decided that the board had \u201cabjured any meaningful explanation,\u201d 226 Mich App 668, n 3, and we conclude that the Court of Appeals remand in the instant case was well within its authority, although, as we hold below, its cited justification for the remand was in error. Having determined that the board\u2019s explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>is inadequate for judicial review, we now turn to the questions decided by the Court of Appeals in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The Court of Appeals held that Ms. Glover had a federal and a state due process right<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to have the parole board provide a sufficiently detailed written explanation of its decision to deny her request for parole. In concluding that Ms. Glover\u2019s due process rights had been violated, the Court of Appeals relied solely upon a dissenting opinion from <em>Greenholtz v Inmates of Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, </em>442 US 1; 99 S Ct 2100; 60 L Ed 2d 668 (1979). The <em>Greenholtz </em>majority held: \u201cThat the state holds out the <em>possibility </em>of parole provides no more than a mere hope that the benefit will be obtained ... a hope which is not protected by due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The dissenting opinion would have held that due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>process must be observed during parole release proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 23 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The United States Supreme Court is the final arbiter regarding the meaning of the federal constitution, <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Crunch) 137; 2 L Ed 60 (1803), and the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the federal constitution. <em>Cooper v Aaron, </em>358 US 1, 18; 78 S Ct 1401; 3 L Ed 2d 5 (1958). Neither the Court of Appeals nor any other court, save for the United States Supreme Court itself on rehearing or in a later case, is free to hold that the federal constitution provides a right that a majority opinion of the United States Supreme Court says it does not contain.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals holding that Ms. Glover\u2019s federal due process rights were violated when the parole board failed to provide a sufficiently detailed explanation for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Court of Appeals also held that Ms. Glover\u2019s state due process rights required the parole board to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>provide a sufficiently detailed written explanation of its decision to deny parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">This Court is, of course, free to find that an individual has greater rights under a Michigan constitutional provision than under its federal counterpart when compelling reasons to do so exist.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals, however, engaged in no analysis of the Michigan constitutional language independent of the federal constitutional language, nor did it examine or base its state due process ruling on the second sentence of art 1, \u00a7 17. Because we hold below that statutory grounds exist to affirm the Court of Appeals decision to remand this matter to the parole board, we find no call to consider whether a compelling reason justifies us in interpreting our state constitution as conferring greater rights on parolable life prisoners than the federal constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">STATUTORY RIGHT TO A WRITTEN EXPLANATION</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The Court of Appeals determined that Ms. Glover did not have a statutory right to a written explanation of the parole board\u2019s decision. Anticipating that this Court might disagree with the Court of Appeals due process holding, Ms. Glover maintains, as she has throughout these proceedings, that Michigan parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>statutes mandate that the parole board provide a petitioner a written explanation of its decision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The parole board\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by MCL 791.234; MSA 28.2304. As explained above, \u00a7 34(8) expressly creates judicial review rights with respect to all parole decisions, providing both parolable lifers and those inmates serving indeterminate sentences a right of appeal by leave to the circuit court from adverse decisions by the parole board.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Parole interviews are governed by MCL 791.235; MSA 28.2305. Section 35, which is entitled \u201cRelease of prisoner,\u201d sets forth an inmate\u2019s rights during the interview process and details, among other things, the permissible considerations at the interview, the right to advance notice of the interview, and the right to representation at the interview. More specifically, \u00a7 35(12) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">When the parole board makes a final determination not to release a prisoner, the prisoner shall be provided with a written explanation of the reason for denial and, if appropriate, specific recommendations for corrective action the prisoner may take to facilitate release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The Court of Appeals held that the \u201cwritten explanation\u201d provision in \u00a7 35(12) is applicable only to prisoners serving indeterminate sentences. We find nothing in \u00a7 35 remotely suggesting that parolable life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>prisoner interviews are excluded from the requirements detailed in subsection 12, and the parole board has not offered any compelling reasons why it should be so construed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, in addition to protecting a petitioner\u2019s statutory right to a written explanation, the need for a written explanation providing reasons for a parole decision is necessary in order to facilitate judicial review as provided for in \u00a7 34(8).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that individuals serving parolable life terms and denied parole are statutorily entitled to a sufficiently detailed written explanation for the board\u2019s decision and, where appropriate, \u201cspecific recommendations for corrective action the prisoner may take to facilitate release.\u201d MCL 791.235(12); MSA 28.2305(12).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We conclude that the Court of Appeals remand in the instant case was well within its authority, although its cited justification for the remand was in error. Our holding today is narrow: Our decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>not based, as the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded, on a constitutional right to a written explanation; rather, it is simply an incident of the right to a written explanation expressly provided for in MCL 791.235(12); MSA 28.2305(12), and implicitly provided for in MCL 791.234(8); MSA 28.2304(8). Moreover, the parole board is not required to provide extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, nor do we insist upon legal opinions when it denies or grants a life prisoner parole. Rather, the board should simply indicate what it relied on in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the instant case, the parole board stated that it was denying parole after considering Glover\u2019s \u201cadjustment, attitude and behavior.\u201d However, there was testimony that Glover had adjusted well, had a good attitude, and had engaged in much good behavior. Similarly, there was also evidence of a poor adjustment, an insincere attitude, and bad behavior.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If the record were one-sided, containing almost all negative information about the prisoner, the explanation provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Ms. Glover would likely be deemed adequate because such a record can only be reasonably understood in one way. However, here the record was not one-sided, and, in order to carry out the Legislature\u2019s directive in \u00a7\u00a7 35(12) and 34(8), we require that the board provide greater explanation for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">OPEN MEETINGS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Lastly, we consider the Court of Appeals holding that the parole board violated the oma by deciding to deny Ms. Glover parole without public notice and in a closed, informal voting procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">MCL 15.263(2); MSA 4.1800(13)(2) provides that all decisions of a public body shall be made at a meeting open to the public. Subsections (7) through (11) exempt several public bodies from complying with the OMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">As explained by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Before amendment in 1987, MCL 791.202(2); MSA 28.2272(2) stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">\u201cThe business which the [Michigan Corrections Commission] or the parole board may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting held in compliance with [the OMA], Public notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting shall be given in the manner required by [the OMA].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">In 1987, the Legislature amended MCL 791.202(2); MSA 28.2272(2), deleting its language concerning the Parole Board. 1987 PA 79. [226 Mich App 674.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">The Court of Appeals majority, however, found that the board was subject to the OMA because the Legislature did not amend the oma, exempting the board when it amended MCL 791.202(2); MSA 28.2272(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Judge Gage dissented, agreeing with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature manifested its intent to exempt the board from OMA requirements by amending MCL 791.202(2); MSA 28.2272(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We find ourselves in agreement with the circuit court and Judge Gage. Under the Court of Appeals majority opinion, the Legislature\u2019s amendment of MCL 791.202(2); MSA 28.2272(2) to delete the parole board\u2019s obligation to comply with the oma would be a nullity because the Legislature did not also at the same time amend the oma. Such a construction violates the principle that statutes are to be construed in pari materia so as to give the fullest effect to each provision. <em>Parks v DAIIE, </em>426 Mich 191, 199; 393 NW2d 833 (1986). Although it may have been preferable for the Legislature to have added the parole board to the oma exemptions, its intent to excuse the board from the oma was adequately expressed when it amended MCL 791.202(2); MSA 28.2272(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The Court of Appeals remand to the parole board for a more detailed explanation is affirmed. The Court of Appeals shall further consider Glover\u2019s appeal upon receipt of the explanation from the parole board. The Court of Appeals federal and state due process and oma rulings are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b613-9\">Weaver, C.J., and Cavanagh, Kelly, and Young, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> MCL 15.261 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 4.1800(11) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> Ms. Glover\u2019s husband is serving life without parole, having been convicted by a jury of felony murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-11\"> The judgment of sentence actually used the words \u201cnatural life.\u201d However, a trial court is without authority to impose a life without parole sentence for second-degree murder or assault with intent to murder, and, thus, use of the word \u201cnatural\u201d constitutes ineffectual surplusage.

However, amicus curiae also states that \u201c[t]he implications of <em>Sandin </em>for due process in the parole context are unclear\u201d and concedes that <em>Sandin </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Greenholtz. </em>Given such circumstances, we are satisfied that Ms. Glover\u2019s federal due process rights were not violated by the parole board\u2019s terse explanation. We agree with Judge Gage\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Glover has not demonstrated a protectable interest covered by due process guarantees that entitles her to a more detailed explanation of the reasons behind the parole board\u2019s denial of parole. 226 Mich App 680.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> See <em>Kivela v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>449 Mich 220, 233; 536 NW2d 498 (1995); <em>Sitz v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>443 Mich 744; 506 NW2d 209 (1993). We note, however, that the presence of an additional sentence in a state constitutional clause, after utilization of parallel language from the federal constitution, which is the case here, does not necessarily mean that the state constitutional provision is to be interpreted differently than the federal provision. See, e.g., <em>Harville v State Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc, </em>218 Mich App 302, 310-311; 553 NW2d 377 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\"> See, e.g., <em>Lisee v Secretary of State, </em>388 Mich 32, 40-41; 199 NW2d 188 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> Subsections 1 to 5 of \u00a7 34 apply to inmates who are serving sentences which contain a minimum term, i.e., indeterminate sentences; subsection 6 applies to inmates serving parolable life terms, and establishes a more stringent set of procedures that such inmates must successfully navigate to be granted parole. The parole board concedes, and Ms. Glover agrees, that subsection 8 provides for a right of review not just to inmates serving parolable life terms, but to inmates serving indeterminate sentences as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> We note here that the parole board concedes that it utilizes, by standard practice, other subsections of \u00a7 35 in considering the parole both of inmates serving parolable life terms, as well as inmates serving indeterminate sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> See, e.g., <em>In re Parole of Scholtz, </em>231 Mich App 104; 585 NW2d 352 (1998) (holding that, while the board need not engage in opinion writing, its explanation must contain sufficient reasons and detail to facilitate appellate review for an abuse of discretion); <em>In re Parole of Roberts, </em>232 Mich App 253, 258; 591 NW2d 259 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> The concurring opinion\u2019s reliance on MCR 7.104(D)(7) does not resolve whether a petitioner is <em>entitled </em>to a written explanation at the time of the board\u2019s decision, and whether such explanations must be routinely furnished. By its very terms, MCR 7.104(D)(7) is a discretionary rule (\u201cthe court <em>may . </em>. .\u201d) designed to assist the decisional process employed by the circuit court, the Court of Appeals, and this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\"> We do not suggest that the parole board is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence and then decide whether to grant parole by a preponderance of the evidence standard. The ultimate decision whether to grant parole is subject to the board\u2019s discretion. However, the board remains obligated to provide a sufficient explanation pursuant to the express language of \u00a7 35(12) protecting a petitioner\u2019s rights, along with \u00a7 35(8)\u2019s implicit directive that the explanation facilitate meaningful judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Likewise, we do not intimate that a reviewing court should remand for an explanation whenever a prisoner\u2019s positive factors equal or outnumber the negative factors. Rather, a remand is appropriate only when a reviewing court, after surveying the explanation given and relevant record, cannot discern, such as here, the basis of the parole board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b613-10\">Taylor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai_l\">(concurring).

If the parole board had stated that it was denying parole because of Glover\u2019s unsatisfactory adjustment, bad attitude, and poor behavior, as evidenced by the twenty-nine misconducts, and because of compelling testimony of the victims and relatives of the victims who opposed parole, I would have found the explanation adequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-9\"> This statute provides that a prisoner\u2019s release on parole is discretionary with the parole board, but is also appealable to the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
