Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals and vacate the PSC order implementing the experimental retail wheeling program.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In 1992, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity (abate) petitioned the PSC for an experimental retail wheeling program involving industrial customers. Under retail wheeling, the customer, or \u201cend-user,\u201d contracts for electricity with a supplier other than the utility that owns the power lines in the geographic area in which the customer is located. The other supplier, or \u201cthird-party provider,\u201d uses the local utility\u2019s system to transmit the electricity to the end-user. The local utility is compensated for the use of its system.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Retail wheeling effectively \u201cunbundles\u201d a local utility\u2019s production and distribution services. Traditionally, a local utility provided a \u201cbundled\u201d product; it generated the electricity and transmitted it to end-users connected to its system of power lines. The industry has, however, undergone changes in recent years. Local utilities have interconnected with one another to form a nationwide grid. Thus, a utility can transmit electricity to an end-user who is not directly connected to its system. When a third-party provider supplies electricity to these end-users, the intermediate utilities are said to \u201cwheel\u201d electricity across their systems. A retail wheeling program requires local utilities to provide these transmission services.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Acting on abate\u2019s petition, a referee presided over a contested case hearing and issued a proposal for decision. The referee concluded that the PSC was not preempted by federal law from authorizing retail wheeling and that retail wheeling did not unconstitutionally impair contractual obligations. The referee further determined that, while a third-party provider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>need not obtain a municipal franchise under Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 29, it must acquire a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the PSC under MCL 460.501 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 22.141 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The referee recommended that the psc allow retail wheeling only if the end-user\u2019s local utility agreed to provide the service. After examining the statutory framework, the referee concluded that the PSC cannot compel a utility to provide retail wheeling services, but may establish tariffs setting the price, terms, and conditions of a voluntarily provided service. The referee proposed that the psc negotiate and authorize voluntary retail wheeling programs for Consumers Power and Detroit Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The PSC rejected the referee\u2019s proposed decision, concluding that it may implement a retail wheeling program under the electric transmission act, 1909 PA 106 (Act 106),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the public service commission act, 1939 PA 3 (Act 3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the railroad commission act, 1909 PA 300 (Act 300).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It reasoned that the program would not intrude on a utility\u2019s authority to manage its production and procurement operations. The PSC also rejected the utilities\u2019 assertion that federal law preempts states from implementing retail wheeling. It held, however, that third-party providers must obtain a franchise from the municipality in which an end-user is located, as well as a certificate of public convenience and necessity to supply the electricity. The psc then remanded the case to the referee to determine rates and charges for retail delivery services.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The PSC established the rates and charges for retail delivery services in its decision after remand. After the PSC modified its order on rehearing, Detroit Edison, Consumers Power, and abate appealed. The Attorney General cross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the PSC order in all respects.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It determined that the PSC has statutoiy authority to implement an experimental retail wheeling program, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">Whfle the psc has only those powers conferred on it by the Legislature, <em>[Union Carbide Corp v Public Service Comm, </em>431 Mich 135, 146; 428 NW2d 322 (1988)], the interpretation given to statutes by the agency charged with applying them is entitled to great deference. <em>In re Quality of Service Standards for Regulated Telecommunication Services, </em>204 Mich App 607, 612; 516 NW2d 142 (1994). The psc did not cite specific sections of Act 106, Act 3, or Act 300 when concluding that those statutes authorize it to implement an experimental retail wheeling program; however, an examination of various provisions of those statutes demonstrates that they support the psc\u2019s decision. Section 2 of Act 106, MCL 460.552; MSA 22.152, gives the PSC \u201ccontrol and supervision of the business of transmitting and supplying electricity . . . .\u201d Supplying electricity must be deemed to include the act of delivering electricity to a customer. Section 6 of Act 106, MCL 460.556; MSA 22.156, allows the psc to order service to be rendered in any case in which such an order is reasonable. Section 6 of Act 3, MCL 460.6; MSA 22.13(6), authorizes the psc to regulate services and conditions of service. While this section does not contain a grant of specific powers, it construes the extent of the psc\u2019s jurisdiction and grants the psc broad authority. <em>Attorney General v Public Service Comm, </em>122 Mich App 777, 786-787; 333 NW2d 131 (1983). Under Act 300, the psc possesses the same authority over utilities as did the Railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Commission over railroads. <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 156. Section 22 of Act 300, MCL 462.22; MSA 22.41, authorizes the psc to investigate and order adequate service to be rendered. [227 Mich App 451-452.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The Court further determined that the psc order does not infringe the utilities\u2019 right to control their management activities. The Court reasoned that utilities are not required to construct new facilities, compelled to engage in a specific management practice, or required to enter into any particular contract. Thus, the Court concluded, the PSC order is lawful and reasonable because it does not dictate the substance of management decisions. The Court of Appeals rejected the parties\u2019 other challenges to the psc order.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">This Court granted plaintiffs Consumers Power Company, Detroit Edison Company, and the Attorney General their respective applications for leave to appeal, limited to whether the PSC exceeded its authority in ordering the electric utilities to transmit electricity produced and sold by other suppliers to customers in the service area of the utility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">n. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Public Service Commission has no common-law powers. It possesses only that authority granted by the Legislature. <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 146. Moreover, this Court strictly construes the statutes which confer power on the psc. As this Court explained in <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 151, quoting <em>Mason Co Civic Research Council v Mason Co, </em>343 Mich 313, 326-327; 72 NW2d 292 (1955):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u201cThe power and authority to be exercised by boards or commissions must be conferred by clear and unmistakable language, since a doubtful power does not exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In construing the statutes empowering the PSC, this Court does not weigh the economic and public policy factors that underlie the action taken by the PSC. Retail wheeling implicates many policy concerns, from the most basic questions whether a consumer should be able to choose an electricity supplier and what market structure will ensure adequate power supply to consideration of arguable secondary effects on the environment and shareholders. See, generally, Vander Veen, <em>Michigan is now entering a new electrical energy field: Competition, </em>78 Mich B J 164 (1999). The Legislature, not this Court, is the body that must consider these questions and weigh the economic and social costs and benefits of restructuring. As this Court observed in <em>Huron Portland Cement Co v Public Service Comm, </em>351 Mich 255, 262; 88 NW2d 492 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">Those are matters of legislative concern. We have had presented to us ... an issue of law, the statutory authority of the commission in the light of the facts before us to order the service, and upon that, and that only, do we propose to pass.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In this case, the PSC relies on the electric transmission act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MCL 460.551 <em>et </em>seq.; MSA 22.151 <em>et seq., </em>the public service commission act, MCL 460.1 <em>et seq.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>MSA 22.13(1) <em>et seq., </em>the railroad commission act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MCL 462.2 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 22.21 <em>et seq., </em>and 1929 PA 69, MCL 460.501 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 22.141 <em>et seq. </em>We examine those statutes to ascertain whether the PSC has the authority to order retail wheeling. <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 146. The PSC\u2019s determination regarding the scope of its authority is one of law, which we review de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>McAuley v General Motors Corp, </em>457 Mich 513, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">A. RATEMAKING POWER</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The PSC initially characterizes its retail wheeling program as ratemaking, thus falling within its authority under \u00a7 7 of the electric transmission act, MCL 460.557; MSA 22.157, and \u00a7 22 of the railroad commission act, MCL 462.22; MSA 22.41. See also MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>460.6a; MSA 22.13(6a). The challenged portion of the order does not, however, involve ratemaking. Although retail wheeling has a ratemaking component, i.e., the establishment of the rate a third-party provider must pay to transmit power through a local utility\u2019s system, appellants do not challenge that aspect of the experimental program. Instead, appellants contend that the psc cannot order local utilities to transmit electricity from a third-party provider\u2019s system through its own system to an end-user. This aspect of retail wheeling is simply not ratemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">This Court explained in <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 148, that the psc\u2019s authority to regulate a utility\u2019s rates and charges does not include the power to make management decisions. We quoted <em>Missouri ex rel Southwestern Bell Telephone Co v Public Service Comm, </em>262 US 276, 289; 43 S Ct 544; 67 L Ed 981 (1923), to emphasize our point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">It must never be forgotten that while the State may regulate with a view to enforcing reasonable rates and charges, it is not the owner of the property of public utility companies and is not clothed with the general power of management incident to ownership. <em>[Union Carbide, supra </em>at 148-149.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In <em>Union Carbide, </em>we concluded that, although the psc could preclude a utility from passing along increased charges incurred from its noneconomic operation of facilities, it could not order the utility to cease those operations. In other words, the psc can encourage a specific management decision through the exercise of its ratemaking power, but it may not directly order the utility to make the decision. Similarly, in <em>Huron Portland Cement, supra, </em>this Court considered whether the psc had the authority to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>a utility to render service to an end-user in an area it did not serve and in which it had no power lines. This Court concluded that, absent specific statutory authority, the decision whether to provide the service rests with the utility\u2019s management. <em>Id. </em>at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In this case, the PSC attempts to compel utilities to provide a new service \u2014 the transmission of electricity from a third-party provider\u2019s system to an end-user who is not directly connected to that system. Retail wheeling would require that utilities accept power from suppliers chosen not by management, but by an end-user, and necessitate the negotiation of new interconnection agreements or modification of existing ones. Further, the utility would have to adjust its own production and purchases of power to ensure sufficient capacity to transmit the third-party provider\u2019s electricity. Absent a statute clearly conferring on the PSC the power to order such service, the decision to provide the service lies within the province of the utility\u2019s management, not the PSC. <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 151; <em>Huron Portland Cement, supra </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The PSC next asserts that \u00a7 6 of the public service commission act, MCL 460.6; MSA 22.13(6), grants it broad authority over all matters pertaining to public utilities, including the power to order retail wheeling. In 1939, the Legislature enacted the public service commission act to abolish the public utilities commission and transfer its powers and duties to the newly created public service commission. <em>Huron Portland Cement, supra </em>at 264-265. The provision on which the PSC relies provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The public service commission is vested with complete power and jurisdiction to regulate all public utilities in the state except a municipally owned utility, the owner of a renewable resource power production facility as provided in section 6d, and except as otherwise restricted by law. The public service commission is vested with the power and jurisdiction to regulate all rates, fares, fees, charges, services, rules, conditions of service, and all other matters pertaining to the formation, operation, or direction of public utilities. The public service commission is further granted the power and jurisdiction to hear and pass upon all matters pertaining to, necessary, or incident to the regulation of public utilities, including electric light and power companies, whether private, corporate, or cooperative; water, telegraph, oil, gas, and pipeline companies; motor carriers; and all public transportation and communication agencies other than railroads and railroad companies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">This Court has consistently held, however, that the broad language of \u00a7 6 serves as an outline of the PSC\u2019s jurisdiction, not a grant of specific powers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">The broad language [of \u00a7 6] furnishes no grant of specific powers. It is an outline of jurisdiction in the commission and does not purport to be more. If, indeed, the general language quoted had the effect of vesting particular, specific, powers in the commission, not only would a constitutional question be presented arising from an asserted lack of standards . . . , but there would have been no need whatever for the many statutes enacted (both before and after the effective date of PA 1939, No 3) vesting specific powers in the commission. <em>[Huron Portland Cement, supra </em>at 263.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>We adhered to this construction of \u00a7 6 in <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 147. Since the psc has only those powers granted by statute and \u00a7 6 furnishes no grant of specific powers, \u00a7 6 provides no support for the PSC\u2019s order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">C. THE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The PSC argues that the electric transmission act, MCL 460.551 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 22.151 <em>et seq., </em>grants it broad authority to regulate all aspects of retail electric service, including services for supplying and delivering electricity, of which retail wheeling is allegedly one. The electric transmission act was the Legislature\u2019s first foray into the field of electricity generation and transmission. Sections 1 and 2 of the act provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">When electricity is generated or developed by steam, water or other power, within 1 county of this state, and transmitted and delivered to the consumer in the same or some other county, then the transmission and distribution of the same in or on the public highways, streets and places, the rate of charge to be made to the consumer for the electricity so transmitted and distributed and the rules and conditions of service under which said electricity shall be transmitted and distributed shall be subject to regulation as in this act provided. [MCL 460.551; MSA 22.151.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">The Michigan public utilities commission, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe commission\u201d shall have control and supervision of the business of transmitting and supplying electricity as mentioned in the first section of this act and no public utility supplying electricity shall put into force any rate or charge for the same without first petitioning said commission for authority to initiate or put into force such rate or charge and securing the affirmative action of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the commission approving said rate or charge. [MCL 460.552; MSA 22.152.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Contrary to the psc\u2019s assertion, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 do not grant it authority to compel a utility to transmit a third-party provider\u2019s electricity through its system to an end-user. The grant of control and supervision contained in \u00a7 2 is qualified by the language \u201cas mentioned in the first section of this act.\u201d Thus, the authority granted by \u00a7 2 does not extend beyond the subject matter enumerated in \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The power to regulate the \u201ctransmission and distribution\u201d of electricity under \u00a7 1 is limited to that \u201cin or on the public highways, streets and places.\u201d It does not encompass a utility\u2019s lines that extend over private lands. Moreover, a requirement that a utility transmit a third-party provider\u2019s electricity does not constitute a \u201ccondition of service\u201d under which the utility transmits and distributes electricity. In discussing the distinction between rates and services in <em>General Telephone Co of Michigan v Public Service Comm, </em>341 Mich 620, 636; 67 NW2d 882 (1954), this Court approved the following language from <em>Elyria Telephone Co v Public Utilities Comm of Ohio, </em>158 Ohio St 441, 446; 110 NE2d 59 (1953):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201cThere is, of course, no doubt that a utility must render adequate service to its patrons, and the general assembly recognizing that at times service might be inadequate has provided a means whereby a utility may be compelled by the commission to improve its services and facilities. The commission has the power to require adequate service under sections 614-21 and 614-27, General Code, but services and rates, although related, are not wholly dependent on each other. As to rates the question is whether the company is receiving a just and reasonable return on the value of its existing property; the question as to adequate service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>is whether the company is rendering or is capable of rendering reasonable service with its existing property or whether by improvements, either in the use of the property it owns or by new installations, this can be done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">As used in \u00a7 1, the term \u201cservice\u201d plainly refers to the utility\u2019s supplying its electricity to the end-user, not the use of its lines to transmit another provider\u2019s electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The word \u201cservice\u201d has different meanings. We construe words and phrases in statutes according to the common usage of the language, but give technical words and phrases their \u201cpeculiar and appropriate\u201d meaning. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed) defines the term \u201cservice\u201d in the context of public utilities as \u201c[t]he furnishing of water, heat, light and power, etc., services by utility.\u201d That definition comports with those provided in lay dictionaries.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Of the numerous definitions included in <em>Random House Webster's College Dictionary, </em>p 1225, the one relevant for our purposes provides: \u201cthe supplying or supplier of utilities, commodities, or other facilities that meet a public need, as water, electricity, communication, or transportation.\u201d <em>The American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Heritage Dictionary </em>(3d ed), p 1649, includes among its definitions the following: \u201cA facility providing the public with the use of something, such as water or transportation.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(7th ed), p 793, similarly defines the term as \u201ca facility supplying some public demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Thus, under any definition, the term \u201cservice\u201d does not refer to a utility\u2019s transmission of electricity for another provider. To construe the phrase \u201cconditions of service\u201d as encompassing a requirement that one utility transmit another provider\u2019s electricity would require an interpretation that stretches well beyond the plain statutory language. As we reiterated in <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 151, however, the PSC has only those powers conferred by clear statutory language. The power conferred by \u00a7 1 simply does not encompass the PSC\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We further note that only electricity generated or developed \u201cwithin 1 county of this state, and transmitted and delivered to the consumer in the same or some other county\u201d falls within the scope of the electric transmission act. MCL 460.551; MSA 22.151. Retail wheeling often involves the transmission of electricity generated within another state. To the extent that the experimental program required utilities to wheel power supplied by an out-of-state provider, the program would clearly fall outside the scope of the electric transmission act, even if the act could be construed to grant the PSC the authority to order retail wheeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The PSC also relies on \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 of the act, which provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">The commission shall have power in its discretion to order electric current for distribution to be delivered at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>suitable primary voltage, to any city, village or township through which a transmission line or lines may pass; to order service to be rendered by any such electric utility in any case in which it will be reasonable for such service to be ordered .... [MCL 460.556; MSA 22.156.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">After investigation and hearing, the commission may by order fix the price of electricity to be charged by the electric utility within lawful limits. . . . The commission may establish by order rules and conditions of service that are just and reasonable. [MCL 460.557(2); MSA 22.157(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">These provisions do not grant the psc broad authority to order retail wheeling. The first clause of \u00a7 6 grants the PSC the power to order that \u201celectric current for distribution\u201d be \u201cdelivered at a suitable primary voltage\u201d to a city, village, or township through which its lines pass. Thus, under the plain language of the statute, the PSC has the authority to set the primary voltage at which a utility transmits electricity to an end-user. Section 6 also authorizes the psc to order a utility to provide \u201cservice\u201d to a city, village, or township through which its lines pass. <em>Huron Portland Cement, supra </em>at 265-266. It does not confer the power to order a utility to transmit electricity for another provider. Similarly, the authority to establish \u201crules and conditions of service\u201d granted in \u00a7 7 must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 1. That authority clearly does not encompass the PSC\u2019s order. Accordingly, we conclude that the electric transmission act does not grant the psc the authority to order retail wheeling.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>D. THE RAILROAD COMMISSION ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The PSC contends that it may order retail wheeling under \u00a7 22 of the railroad commission act, MCL 462.22; MSA 22.41, which empowers the PSC to, upon complaint, investigate and remedy unreasonable or inadequate practices and services. MCL 460.54; MSA 22.4 grants the PSC the \u201csame measure of authority\u201d with reference to utilities as the Michigan Railroad Commission once had over railroads under the railroad commission act. As we noted in <em>Union Carbide, supra </em>at 156, however, the railroad commission \u201cdid not enjoy sweeping powers . . . .\u201d We conclude that the PSC\u2019s commensurate authority does not include the power to require a utility to provide transmission services for third-party providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">By statute, the Legislature required railroads to transfer and deliver freight, cars, or passengers carried on another line that are destined to a point on its line or a connecting line. MCL 462.7(a); MSA 22.26(a). As MCL 462.7(a); MSA 22.26(a) aptly demonstrates, the Legislature has expressly required that public service providers open their facilities to other providers when it deems appropriate. The Legislature recognized a similar need involving telephone service in 1913, and granted the Railroad Commission the authority to order local providers to interconnect their lines and perform switching service for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>transmission of messages between the lines. 1913 PA 206, repealed by 1991 PA 179.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Absent a comparable statutory provision, the PSC cannot mandate that an electric utility transmit a third-party provider\u2019s electricity to an end-user.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">E. 1929 PA 69</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The PSC further argues that the requirement under 1929 PA 69, MCL 460.501 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 22.141 <em>et seq., </em>that a utility obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the PSC before it renders service authorizes the PSC to encourage competition in the industry. Although the PSC has historically used its power to issue certificates to prevent, rather than promote, competition, the PSC may allow more than one utility to provide service in an area under the terms of the act. <em>Huron Portland Cement, supra </em>at 267. The psc\u2019s ability to foster competition, however, does not include retail wheeling because it lacks authority to order an existing utility to share its capital facilities. As this Court observed in <em>Huron Portland Cement, </em>quoting Barnes, Economics of Public Utility Regulation, p 229:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201cThe requirement of a certificate of convenience and necessity may enable the commission to prevent the needless multiplication of companies serving the same territory, and at the same time to avoid a wasteful duplication of capital facilities, thus keeping the investment at the lowest figure consonant with satisfactory service. By protecting the utility from unnecessary competition, the risks inherent in the utility investments are reduced and the cost of capital is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>thereby kept as low as the conditions of the investment market permit.\u201d <em>[Huron Portland Cement, supra </em>at 267-268.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">1929 PA 69 does not grant the psc the authority to order retail wheeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">m. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">We express no view regarding the public policy implications of retail wheeling. The economic wisdom of the program is not our concern. See <em>Huron Portland Cement, supra </em>at 261. The question before us involves the psc\u2019s statutory authority. We conclude that the psc lacks statutory authority to order a utility to transmit a third-party provider\u2019s electricity through its system to a customer. Thus, the psc lacked the statutory authority to implement the experimental retail wheeling program. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and vacate the psc order implementing the program.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-9\">Weaver, C.J., and Taylor and Young, JJ., concurred with Corrigan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> MCL 460.551 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 22.151 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"><em> </em>MCL 460.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 22.13(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> MCL 462.2 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 22.21 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> 227 Mich App 442; 575 NW2d 808 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\"> 459 Mich 880 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> The electric transmission act, 1909 PA 106 as amended by 1921 PA 274, granted the Michigan public utilities commission authority to regulate electric utilities.

An agency interpretation cannot overcome the plain meaning of a statute. <em>Ludington Service, supra </em>at 505. Even under the dissent\u2019s view of the proper deference courts should give to an agency\u2019s construction of the statute that grants it authority, we need not defer to the psc interpretation in this case because the language of the statute is plain.

Dictionaries, however, often contain multiple definitions and define a term using terms that also have multiple definitions. Thus, as the dissent aptly demonstrates, exclusive reliance on dictionary definitions can blur, rather than clarify, the meaning of a word. Dictionaries are, however, merely interpretative aids used by the court. See note, <em>Looking it up: Dictionaries and statutory interpretation, </em>107 Harv L R 1437 (1994). Words are given meaning by context or setting. <em>Tyler v Livonia Public Schools, </em>459 Mich 382, 391; 590 NW2d 560 (1999).

The majority \u201cgrant[s] no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>deference to the psc interpretation in this case because the plain meaning of the statutes are controlling.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 157, n 8, citing <em>Union Carbide Corp v Public Service Comm, </em>431 Mich 135, 151; 428 NW2d 322 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">While I agree with much of what the majority holds, I cannot agree that the relevant section of the electric transmission act has a \u201cplain meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute can conceivably bear the meaning imposed on it by the majority, but the psc\u2019s interpretation is more in accord with the meaning of the relevant statutory language and with the context of the statute itself. This case also demonstrates that courts should defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statutes it is designated to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The majority holds that the electric transmission act, MCL 460.551 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 22.151 <em>et seq., </em>does not give the psc the power to order retail wheeling. I would hold that the most reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 6 of this act gives the PSC this power. MCL 460.556; MSA 22.156.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Section 6 provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>[t]he commission shall have power in its discretion to order electric current for distribution to be delivered at a suitable primary voltage, to any city, village or township through which a transmission line or lines may pass; to order service to be rendered by any such electric utility in any case in which it will be reasonable for such service to be ordered ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The language of this section bears repeating: the PSC has \u201cpower <em>in its discretion </em>to order electric current for distribution <em>to be delivered . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. </em>(emphasis supplied). This first clause of \u00a7 6 plainly contemplates the psc\u2019s power to order that electric current be delivered,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as strongly implying that the production and delivery of the electric current are two separate activities. Because the Legislature delegated discretionary power to the PSC to order that electric current be delivered over already existing transmission lines, the majority errs in ignoring this grant of authority and preventing the psc\u2019s exercise of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The majority also errs in its interpretation of the second clause of \u00a7 6. In that clause, the Legislature authorized the PSC to \u201corder service to be rendered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>any such electric utility in any case in which it will be reasonable for such service to be ordered . . . MCL 460.556; MSA 22.156. The majority reasons that the first two clauses of \u00a7 6 do \u201cnot confer the power to order a utility to transmit electricity for another provider.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 165. The statute does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u201cService,\u201d as the majority notes elsewhere in its opinion, means \u201c \u2018[t]he furnishing of water, heat, light and power, etc., services by utility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 1368. The majority looks no further into this definition, however, and concludes that the word \u201cservice\u201d necessarily denotes the joint production and transmission of electric current. The definition of \u201cservice\u201d is not so constrained, however, as a closer look at the majority\u2019s definition reveals.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">While \u201cservice\u201d means the \u201cfurnishing of . . . power,\u201d \u201cfurnish\u201d is defined in the same dictionary as \u201c[t]o supply, provide, or equip, for accomplishment of a particular purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cSupply\u201d is defined as \u201cthe act of furnishing what is wanted,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1439, and a \u201csupplier\u201d is \u201c[a]ny person engaged in the business of making a consumer product directly or indirectly available to consumers; includes all persons in the chain or production and distribution of a consumer product . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Unlike the majority, I cannot conclude that the word \u201cservice\u201d can only mean the joint act of producing the commodity in question and delivering it to the consumer. Indeed, the common definitions of the relevant terms allow for \u201cservice\u201d to include separate production, separate distribution, <em>or </em>both together.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In light of these common definitions, and the distinction made by the first clause of \u00a7 6, between the act of producing electric current and the act of delivering it, there is no reason to read the PSC\u2019s discretionary power to order \u201cservice to be rendered\u201d as meaning solely the power to order the combined production and delivery of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The majority\u2019s statutory analysis ignores the first clause of \u00a7 6, and does not take into account the full meaning of the word \u201cservice\u201d in the second clause. Because the text of these two clauses fully supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the psc\u2019s order in this case, I would uphold the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the order of the PSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">This case also presents an important question of this state\u2019s jurisprudence: whether the agency or the courts should have the authority to determine which of several permissible interpretations should be given to an agency\u2019s jurisdictional statute. Clearly, where the language of the statute in question is plain, statutory construction is not permissible by any authority, and no real question is presented. <em>Ludington Service Corp v Acting Comm\u2019r of Ins, </em>444 Mich 481, 505; 511 NW2d 661 (1994), amended 444 Mich 1240 (1994); see <em>Chevron USA, Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, </em>467 US 837, 843, n 9; 104 S Ct 2778; 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984). As discussed in part i(a), however, that is not the situation presented by the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 6 of the electric transmission act is not persuasive, but I do not believe that it is impermissible under the language of the statute. The intent of the Legislature with respect to the instant controversy is not clear from the text of the statutes in question. In light of this lack of clear legislative intent, this case presents us with a good opportunity to examine how a court should determine which of two or more permissible interpretations of a statute is the proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">l</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">This Court has not always been consistent regarding the degree of deference courts should give to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutes the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>delegat\u00e9d that agency to enforce.

Cf. <em>City of Livonia v Dep\u2019t of Social </em>Services, 423 Mich 466, 501-505; 378 NW2d 402 (1985). Therefore, given that the relevant statutory language is ambiguous, that there is no clear indication of the Legislature\u2019s intent, and that the PSC exercises some of the Legislature\u2019s policy-making authority in this area, this Court should avoid striking down the policy decision inherent in the psc\u2019s permissible interpretation of the electric transmission act.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe principle of deference to administrative interpretations\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201chas been consistently followed by this Court whenever decision as to the meaning or reach of a statute has involved reconciling conflicting policies, and a full understanding of the force of the statutory policy in the given situation has depended upon more than ordinary knowledge respecting the matters subjected to agency regulations.\u201d <em>[Chevron, supra </em>at 844, quoting <em>United States v Shimer, </em>367 US 374, 382; 81 S Ct 1554; 6 L Ed 2d 908 (1961) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The Court further stated that if the agency\u2019s choice represents</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u201ca reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency\u2019s care by the statute, we should not disturb it unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have sanctioned.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 845, quoting <em>Shimer, supra </em>at 383.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The United States Supreme Court has also extended this rule to sanction deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its jurisdiction under its enabling legislation, noting that \u201cthere is no discernible line between an agency\u2019s exceeding its authority and an agency\u2019s exceeding authorized application of its authority.

For this reason, the PSC\u2019s ratemaking power achieved its stated purpose without shutting down the noneconomic operations, rendering any further use of that power unlawful as beyond its own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Similarly, in <em>Huron Portland Cement, </em>we noted that \u201c[t]his is not a case where a utility, already servicing a city, arbitrarily refuses to take on a new (or expanded) burden, for Consumers has never supplied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>electricity to either the city of Alpena or the Alpena area generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260. We went on to examine \u00a7 6 of the electric transmission act, and held that its grant of power to the PSC \u201cis not unlimited, but restricted. [The PSC] is given statutory power to order electric current (for distribution) to any community \u2018through which a transmission line or lines may pass.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">We held against the PSC\u2019s exercise of power in that case because Consumers\u2019 power lines <em>did not </em>pass through the communities in question. Therefore, \u201cthose cases involving an undertaking of service to an area, particularly where a statute empowers the commission to order reasonable extensions of the mains and service . . . , are not controlling on the issue before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">For these reasons, I find no guidance in either <em>Portland Huron Cement </em>or <em>Union Carbide. </em>The question in this case is determined by \u00a7 6 of the electric transmission act.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Because \u00a7 6 of the electric transmission act gives the PSC the authority to order retail wheeling, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-8\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\"> Because \u00a7 6 of the electric transmission act gives the psc the power in question, I would not reach the other statutory interpretations discussed by the majority. MCL 460.556; MSA 22.156. However, I do agree with the majority that \u00a7 6 of the public service commission act, MCL 460.6; MSA 22.13(6), is only \u201can outline of the psc\u2019s jurisdiction, not a grant of specific powers.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 160, citing <em>Huron Portland Cement Co v Public Service Comm, </em>351 Mich 255, 263; 88 NW2d 492 (1958). I further agree that \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the electric transmission act, MCL 460.551, 460.552; MSA 22.151, 22.152, are not applicable to the instant case \u201c[t]o the extent that the experimental program required utilities to wheel power supplied by an out-of-state provider . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 164.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> \u201cDeliver\u201d is relevantly defined as \u201c[t]o bring or transport to the proper place or recipient; distribute.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>(3d ed), p 494. Another dictionary defines it as \u201cto cany and turn over (letters, goods, etc.) to the intended recipient or recipients.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, </em>p 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The statute limits the scope of the psc\u2019s power under this section to \u201cany city, village or township through which a transmission line or lines may pass . . . .\u201d MCL 460.556; MSA 22.156. Thus our decision in <em>Huron Portland Cement Co, </em>n 1 <em>supra, </em>is consistent with this statute. In that case, we overturned a psc order that would have compelled Consumers Power to build new transmission lines. We noted that \u00a7 6 did not give the psc this power because \u201cConsumers\u2019 lines do not pass through the city ... in which Huron seeks the service to be rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">In stark contrast, the order at issue in the instant case would compel the appellant utilities to deliver electric current over their already existing transmission lines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> Black\u2019s further definition of \u201cfurnish\u201d is instructive by way of analogy: \u201cAs used in the liquor laws, \u2018furnish\u2019 means to provide in any way, and includes giving as well as selling. As used in the Controlled Substances Act, means [sic] to provide or supply and connotes a transfer of possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In neither of these contexts is it necessary to produce or manufacture the commodity in question in order to \u201cfurnish\u201d it to a third party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> Compare this definition of \u201csupplier\u201d with the majority\u2019s quotation of one of the relevant definitions of \u201cservice\u201d: \u201c \u2018the supplying or supplier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>utilities, commodities, or other facilities that meet a public need, as water, electricity, communication, or transportation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 163, quoting <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, supra, </em>p 1225. A utility is therefore a \u201csupplier\u201d of electric service whether it produced the electric current, or delivered it, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b258-11\"> The majority quotes the following relevant definitions of \u201cservice\u201d: \u201cthe supplying or supplier of utilities, commodities, or other facilities that meet a public need, as water, electricity, communication, or transportation.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s Dictionary, </em>p 1225; \u201cA facility providing the public with the use of something, such as water or transportation.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>(3d ed), p 1649. <em>Ante </em>at 163-164.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">The <em>Random House </em>dictionary goes on to define \u201csupply\u201d as \u201c1. to furnish or provide (a person, establishment, etc.) with what is lacking or requisite: <em>supplying the poor with clothing. </em>2. to furnish or provide (something wanting or requisite): <em>supplied needed water to the region.\" Random House Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>pp 1295, 1343. The <em>American Heritage </em>dictionary defines \u201cprovide\u201d as \u201c1. To furnish; supply: <em>provide food and shelter for a family. </em>2. To make available; afford: <em>a room that provides ample sunlight through French windows.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary, supra, </em>p 1458. None of these definitions carry the implication that the supplier or provider of the commodities in question had to have produced or manufactured them before providing or supplying them to the recipients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> In one case, we held that \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the judiciary to interpret legislative intent and this responsibility cannot be delegated.

Four justices of this Court split on this decision, however, with three justices abstaining.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> Again, I agree that the Court would be acting properly if the statute at issue were, indeed, unambiguous.
