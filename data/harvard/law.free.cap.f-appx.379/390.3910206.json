He acknowledges that district courts may consider post-sentencing behavior when deciding \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, but he argues that the district court should not have denied his motion solely on the basis of his post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-19\">Although \u00a7 3582(c)(2) directs the court to consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the reasonableness standard derived from <em>United States v. Book</em>er, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009)), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). We review the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 295 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-22\">In exercising its discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court is instructed to consider (1) the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (2) \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment\u201d and (3) \u201cpost-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the original term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(ii)-(iii)). In denying the motion, the district court expressly considered these factors, emphasizing Whitley\u2019s criminal history and that he had been sanctioned numerous times for prison disciplinary infractions. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce Whitley\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1322 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-18\"> Pursuant to 5tm Cut R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
