Popp moves this court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. The district court dismissed Popp\u2019s complaint as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), as to defendants McLennan County Sheriffs Department, Agriplex Task Force, Mclennan County D.A.\u2019s Office, Scott Peterson, Charles McDonald, and Kay Smith. The district court further determined that judicial immunity ba0rred Popp\u2019s claims against Texas Judge George Allen and it dismissed those claims as well. The district court denied Popp leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith for the reasons stated in the original dismissal. Popp\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Jackson v. Johnson, </em>475 F.3d 261, 267 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Popp does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Because he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, any argument is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Popp has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">The dismissal of the initial complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Popp is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
