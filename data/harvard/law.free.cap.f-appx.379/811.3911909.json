We granted a certificate of appealability to determine \u201cwhether counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor, during closing arguments, referred to what \u2018did not happen\u2019 before the grand jury.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">At trial, the government introduced evidence that agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency observed Smith, Wade, and Culberson transport to Culberson\u2019s house a collection of substances and glassware commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine. During a search of the house, agents discovered sufficient methylamine to manufacture 2000 grams of methamphetamine. Agents also discovered a handwritten note containing a recipe for manufacturing methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Federal agents testified about the discovery of the note. Agent Mel Schabilion testified that he had discovered the note in \u201cpart of a coiled notebook that was on top of a nightstand adjacent to the bed in the master bedroom of Miss Culberson\u2019s house.\u201d Agent David Gray also testified that the note was found on a night stand. On cross-examination, Gray explained that he had mistakenly stated in his affidavit in support of the search warrant that the note was found in a purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">During closing arguments, defense counsel for Smith and Culberson discussed conflicting evidence about who had found the note and where the note had been discovered. Counsel for Culberson argued that Gray had made statements about the note in his \u201coriginal testimony,\u201d before a judge, and at trial. The prosecutor responded that Agent Gray mistakenly had made conflicting statements about the note and asked the jury to consider the facts in evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-13\">Contrary to what [Culberson\u2019s counsel] said, Agent Gray did not testify that he said he found the notes in the purse. Agent Gray, in the criminal complaint, said that other agents found the note in the purse, and he was mistaken about that. That\u2019s not where the note was found, but he did not claim that he found it. And you have not heard any evidence about the grand jury, where supposedly Agent Gray said that he found the note. You\u2019ve heard no evidence of that. It did not happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">Agent Gray, as you know and as we admitted, made some mistakes in the search warrant affidavit and the criminal complaint. Those kind of things have to be done in a big hurry.... Mistakes get made when that happens. And it\u2019s made Agent Gray a target here for unfair allegations that something was done wrong when in fact nothing happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">Defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument. The district court la<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>ter instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he lawyer\u2019s statements are not evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The jury found Smith guilty of four crimes: conspiracy with intent to distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846; possession of a listed chemical, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(c)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; possession of a prohibited flask, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, 843(a)(6); and use of a communication facility to commit a drug offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841, 843(b). Wade and Culberson were convicted of three crimes: conspiracy with intent to distribute methamphetamine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841, 846; possession of a listed chemical, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(c)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and possession of a prohibited flask, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, 843(a)(6). The district court sentenced all three defendants to 360 months of imprisonment. This Court affirmed them convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>240 F.3d 927 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Smith, Wade, and Culberson moved to vacate their sentences. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Smith, Wade, and Culberson argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the credibility of Agent Gray. Smith, Wade, and Culberson alleged that the prosecutor stated that she \u201cpersonally did not believe Gray had intentionally lied or omitted information in preparing the search warrant affidavit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The district court denied the motions to vacate. The district court stated that it was \u201csomewhat troubled by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to what \u2018did not happen\u2019 before the grand jury\u201d but \u201cin viewing the prosecutor\u2019s argument as a whole and in the context of arguments made by defense counsel,\u201d the court concluded that the prosecutor did not vouch for Agent Gray. The district court ruled that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Smith, Wade, and Culberson argue that counsel made a professional mistake that prejudiced the outcome of them trials, but we disagree. Counsel reasonably could have determined that an objection was unnecessary. <em>See Zakrzewski v. McDonough, </em>455 F.3d 1254, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2006). Counsel for Culberson referred to Gray\u2019s \u201coriginal testimony\u201d about discovering the note, and the prosecutor, who interpreted counsel\u2019s remark as a reference to testimony before a grand jury, was entitled to respond that no testimony before the grand jury had been mentioned during trial and the jurors could not consider facts not in evidence. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (recognizing, as an exception to the prohibition against vouching for a witness, that \u201ca prosecutor [is entitled] to respond to arguments advanced by defense counsel in his or her statement to the jury\u2019 \u201d). Even if we were to assume that the failure to object constituted deficient performance, there is no evidence of prejudice. The district court instructed the jury that the arguments of counsel were not evidence, <em>id., </em>and the government presented ample proof that Smith, Wade, and Culberson possessed illegal paraphernalia and precursor materials sufficient to manufacture a large quantity of methamphetamine, <em>see Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1309 (11th Cir.1998). The district court did not err by denying the motions to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
