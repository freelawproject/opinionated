Ray, Texas prisoner # 1210691, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (AEDPA) one-year limitations period. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). In his petition, Ray sought to challenge his 2003 aggravated assault conviction and 45-year sentence of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">To obtain a COA, Ray must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). When, as here, the district court\u2019s denial of relief is based upon procedural grounds without analysis of the underlying constitutional claims, \u201ca COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">The district court dismissed Ray\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations. This dismissal was based on the district court\u2019s conclusion that, in light of <em>Salinas v. Dretke, </em>354 F.3d 425 (5th Cir.2004), Ray\u2019s out-of-time petition for discretionary review was not part of the direct review process for purposes of calculating the federal limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Following the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ray\u2019s petition, the Supreme Court held that when \u201ca state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is not yet \u2018final\u2019 for purposes of\u2019 the one-year limitations period. <em>Jimenez v. Quartemian, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 129 S.Ct. 681, 686, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2009). Although the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jimenez, </em>its reliance on <em>Salinas </em>to conclude that Miller\u2019s petition was untimely was, in light of <em>Jimenez, </em>erroneous. <em>See Womack v. Thaler, </em>591 F.3d 757, 757-58 (5th Cir.2009). Consequently, Ray has shown that reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. Further, we conclude that Ray has satisfied the COA standard with respect to whether reasonable jurists would debate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that his petition states a valid constitutional claim. <em>See Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">For the foregoing reasons, Ray\u2019s motion for a COA is GRANTED on the issue whether this petition was barred by the statute of limitations; his motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED; the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Ray\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred is VACATED; and this matter is REMANDED to the district court for further pi'oceedings. <em>See Womack, </em>591 F.3d at 758; <em>Whitehead v. Johnsoyi, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). Ray\u2019s motions for appointment of appellate counsel and to expedite the appeal are DENIED. We express no opinion on the ultimate disposition of Ray\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
