No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">From Espino-Macree\u2019s base offense level of 38 (applicable to offenses involving at least 150 kilograms of cocaine), two levels were subtracted for satisfying the safety-valve criteria of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.1, and another three levels were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility. With his criminal history category of 1, the guideline range was 135 to 168 months; the statutory range was 10 years\u2019 to life. Because Espino-Macree met the safety-valve criteria, the court was authorized to sentence him based on the applicable guideline range without constraint by the statutory minimum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1)-(5). Also, the government filed a motion for a three-level downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on his cooperation. With the additional three-level downward departure, Espino-Macree\u2019s guideline range was 97 to 121 months; a 97-month sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Espino-Macree argued before the district court- \u2014 and argues again on appeal \u2014 that it was error to fail to award him a downward adjustment for having a minor role in the offense. Espino-Macree acknowledges that he was the vessel\u2019s mechanic, that he assisted in loading cocaine onto the vessel, and that the vessel was carrying between 4,000 and 5,000 kilograms of cocaine. But Espino-Macree also contends that he only learned of the cocaine to be delivered to the vessel after the vessel had left port, he had no ownership interest in the cocaine, he had no navigational skills, he played no part in organizing the venture, and he was not associated with a drug cartel. According to Espino-Macree, his role \u2014 as was the role of most all the other crew members \u2014 was minor when compared with that of unin-dicted co-conspirators who had an ownership in the di\u2019ugs and held managerial positions in the drug cartel.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), \u201c[a] defendant warrants a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in an offense if he is less culpable than most other participants, although his role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant bears the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">We have set out two elements that inform the sentencing court\u2019s determination about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which has been held accountable; and (2) the defendant\u2019s role as compared to that of other participants in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940. About the first element, <em>De Varon </em>explains that \u201c[ojnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. About the second element, <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>counsels that this relative culpability inquiry includes \u201conly those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first element is the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>important and, in many cases, may end the inquiry. <em>See id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The district court committed no clear error in determining that Espino-Macree\u2019s role in the offense was more than minor. About the first element, Espino-Macree\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: the 3,000 to 4,000 kilograms of cocaine aboard the vessel. Espino-Macree\u2019s role in the offense included serving as the vessel\u2019s mechanic, assisting with uploading the cocaine onto the vessel, assisting in concealing the drugs, and scuttling the vessel once the United States Coast Guard began its search. The district court was unpersuaded \u2014 especially in the light of the substantial quantity of cocaine being transported \u2014 that Espino-Maeree carried his burden of showing he should receive the benefit of a minor role adjustment. And the district court noted correctly that, as the vessel\u2019s mechanic, Espino-Maeree played a more fundamental role than other crewmen aboard the vessel. Our precedent forecloses Espino-Macree\u2019s claimed entitlement to a minor role adjustment: that his role \u2014 however similar to that of other crew members\u2014 was minor in the context of a broader criminal scheme that involved conduct for which he was not held accountable supports no adjustment. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Espino-Maeree also argues that his low-end of the guidelines range sentence was substantively unreasonable in the light of his personal history and characteristics. He contends that his requested sentence of 70 months would be reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence in the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). A deferential abuse of discretion standard governs our review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging a sentence in the light of the record and the section 3553(a) factors bears the burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We do not deem a sentence within the advisory guidelines range per se reasonable, <em>id. </em>at 787; but \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And we will not vacate a sentence as unreasonable unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the section 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range or reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007), <em>quoting United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">It is clear from the record that the district court listened to Espino-Macree\u2019s arguments in support of a below guidelines range sentence; it is also clear from the record that the district court considered the advisory guideline range and the section 3553(a) factors to fashion a sentence that was reasonable, sufficient, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>greater than the district court deemed necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. That the defendant disagrees \u2014 or even if we were to disagree \u2014 with the sentencing court\u2019s relative weighing of facts and circumstances is of no moment absent a showing of a clear error of judgment; and no such error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-7\">. We see no merit to Espino-Macree's argument based on Amendment 668, adopted after our decision in <em>De Varon. </em>Amendment 668 applies to defendants who have already received a minor role reduction; it offers no relief to defendants who fail to establish entitlement to the reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. In support of a 70-month sentence, Espino-Maeree argues (1) his age makes him an unlikely recidivist; (2) he did not know the vessel was to engage in cocaine smuggling until after it left port; (3) his sincere willingness to behave lawfully was evidenced by the substantial assistance he provided the government; and (4) his need to be reunited with his 12-year-old daughter who suffers from leukemia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
