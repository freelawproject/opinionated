Thomas appeals the 33-month sentence imposed after her guilty plea conviction for one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The district court upwardly departed from criminal history category I to category IV, and Thomas\u2019s guideline range of imprisonment of 15 to 21 months increased with the upward departure to 27 to 33 months. Thomas argues that the district court improperly based its decision to depart on her arrest record and on her violations of the conditions of her pretrial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>A district court incorrectly applies the Guidelines by basing a departure upon a factor that the Sentencing Commission \u201chas expressly rejected as an appropriate ground for departure.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 200, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3), a \u201cprior arrest record itself shall not be considered for purposes of an upward departure.\u201d Because the district court departed based, in part, on Thomas\u2019s prior arrests apart from reliable evidence that Thomas was guilty of the offenses for which she was arrested, the court erred. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 434-36 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">However, we have held, after <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), that \u201c[n]ot all errors in determining a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence require reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656 (5th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 904, 173 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). As in <em>Bonilla </em>and <em>United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2008), neither party has taken issue \u2014 in the district court or on appeal \u2014 with the guideline range of 15 to 21 months calculated by the district court prior to its upward departure. The district court explained that it would have imposed the same 33-month prison term as a \u201cvariant sentence\u201d even if it \u201cerred in using the guidelines to have an upward departure.\u201d In support of that ruling, the court recited in lengthy detail such Section 3553(a) factors as the nature and circumstances of Thomas\u2019s offense, her history and characteristics, her repeated violations of the terms of her supervised release, the need for deterrence, the need to promote respect for the rule of law, and the need to provide Thomas with training and treatment. Therefore, Thomas\u2019s sentence did not \u201cresult from\u201d an incorrect application of the Guidelines, and reversal is not required. <em>See Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d at 656-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
