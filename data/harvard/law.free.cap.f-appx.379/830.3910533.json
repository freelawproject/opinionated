The issue on appeal is whether the district court erred by concluding Lee was not eligible for a reduction because he was subject to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">A sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c)(2). The applicable policy statements state that a sentence reduction is not authorized if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). A defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied. McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">Here, the district court did not err by denying Lee\u2019s motion for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his guideline range was based on the statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment and not on the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2008) (holding a defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because he \u201cwas subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range\u201d). Lee cannot challenge, in this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court\u2019s original sentencing determination that he was subject to the mandatory statutory minimum penalty. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>(stating <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d). Finally, to the extent Lee argues the district court would have had the discretion to go below the amended guideline range, his argument is foreclosed by precedent. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lee\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-18\">. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court's con-elusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
