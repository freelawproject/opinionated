His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the court erred in calculating drug quantity, assessing a dangerous-weapon enhancement, and assigning two criminal history points to a prior sentence. In a pro se supplemental brief, Echols joins counsel in challenging the dangerous-weapon enhancement and the criminal history points. He also argues that counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel withdrew Echols\u2019s objections to the presentence report\u2019s drug-quantity calculations, dangerous-weapon enhancement, and assignment of criminal history points. He therefore waived our consideration of those issues. <em>See United States v. Burnette, </em>518 F.3d 942, 946 (8th Cir.2008) (on appeal, defendant waives issues raised in withdrawn objections to presentence report). We also conclude that Echols should raise his ineffective-assistance argument in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>449 F.3d 824, 827 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Finally, having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment, and we deny Echols\u2019s motion for new appointed counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. The Honorable John A.
