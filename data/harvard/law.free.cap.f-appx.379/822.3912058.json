Lockette and Clerk Evonne S. Mull of the Superior Court of Dougherty County, Georgia violated his constitutional rights. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Watson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Watson filed this <em>pro se </em>appeal. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">A. State Court Personal Injury Action</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">According to Watson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint, Watson filed a personal injury action in the Dougherty County Superior Court after he was injured in a car accident. Watson also filed an affidavit of indigence and was relieved of state court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">On March 28, 2008, Superior Court Judge Lockette ordered Watson\u2019s personal injury case transferred to the city of Sylvester, Georgia. The transfer order imposed upon Watson a $50 transfer fee. The superior court clerk sent Watson a copy of the order and a letter explaining that the case would be transferred after Watson paid the transfer fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">On April 18, 2008, Watson took his notice of appeal and other appeal papers to the superior court clerk\u2019s office for filing. The clerk\u2019s office receptionist and another office worker looked over Watson\u2019s appeal papers, and the receptionist told Watson she could not accept them because they were not proper. She also told Watson he could not file an appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and had to pay the filing fee. The receptionist advised Watson to go to a law library to learn how to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-20\">Watson left with his papers and, several days later, mailed his notice of appeal, affidavit of poverty and certificate of service to the superior court. On April 27, 2008, Watson\u2019s deadline for appealing the transfer order expired. Two days later, on April 29, 2008, the clerk\u2019s office returned Watson\u2019s appeal papers by mail with a letter explaining that Watson needed a certificate of service before his appeal could be filed. The clerk\u2019s office also included a guide for filing an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>B. Federal Court \u00a7 1983 Action</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Watson filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint in federal court on March 23, 2009. Watson\u2019s complaint alleged that Judge Lockette and Clerk Mull \u201cand their agents\u201d violated Watson\u2019s constitutional rights. Specifically, Watson\u2019s complaint alleged that the clerk\u2019s office violated his First Amendment right when \u201cthey refused the plaintiffs court papers\u201d on April 18, 2008 and his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when \u201cthey withheld the citizen\u2019s guide to filing appeals\u201d until the appeal period had expired. As to Judge Lockette, Watson\u2019s complaint alleged that \u201cthe court violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when it ordered the plaintiff to pay fifty dollars for transfer fees under Forma Pau-peris.\u201d The complaint prayed for declaratory and equitable relief and \u201csuch other and further relief that the court deems to be appropriate and just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The district court granted Watson\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>After conducting a preliminary screening, the district court dismissed Watson\u2019s complaint <em>without prejudice </em>for failure to state a claim, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e) (2) (B) (ii). Because Watson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint did not specify the declaratory or equitable relief he sought, the district court presumed Watson wanted the court to declare that the actions of Judge Lockette and Clerk Mull were improper and allow Watson to either transfer his state court case at no cost or continue his appeal in the Dougherty County Superior Court. The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">over Watson\u2019s complaint under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Watson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">A. <em>Sua Sponte </em>Dismissals</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The district court must dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint at any time if it determines that the action \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). A dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same standard as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate when the facts as pled do not state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal); <em>Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.2008) (Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal). In addition, a district court may <em>sua sponte </em>consider subject matter jurisdiction at any stage in the litigation and must dismiss the complaint if it concludes that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3); <em>Ar-baugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 506, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1240, 1244, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). After liberally construing Watson\u2019s complaint, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>B. <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The district court dismissed Watson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as barred by the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine. Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, lower federal courts \u201cdo not have jurisdiction to act as appellate courts and [are] preclude[d] ... from reviewing final state court decisions.\u201d <em>Green v. Jefferson County Comm\u2019n, </em>563 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 199, 175 L.Ed.2d 127 (2009). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is confined to cases that are \u201c[1] brought by state-court losers [2] complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments [3] rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and [4] inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>see also Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1272-74, 1278-79 (explaining that, after <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is limited and applied narrowly).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies only when the state court proceedings ended before the federal action was filed. <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1275, 1277 n. 11. Further, this Court has concluded that \u201cstate proceedings have not ended for purposes of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>when an appeal from the state court judgment remains pending at the time the plaintiff commences the federal court action....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279; <em>see also Green, </em>563 F.3d at 1250 (concluding that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine did not apply because an appeal of the state court summary judgment order was pending when the federal action was filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">1. <em>Watson\u2019s Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">Here, it is unclear from the face of Watson\u2019s complaint whether Watson is a state-court loser whose state court proceedings had ended before he filed his federal action on March 23, 2009. However, admissions in Watson\u2019s appeal brief show the state court proceedings had ended on March 23, 2009 before Watson filed his federal \u00a7 1983 case on that date. <em>See Young &amp; Vann Supply Co. v. Gulf, F. &amp; A. Ry. Co., </em>5 F.2d 421, 423 (5th Cir.1925) (\u201cWe may consider the statements in the brief as admissions of facts.\u201d); <em>see also Cooper v. Meridian Yachts, Ltd., </em>575 F.3d 1151, 1177-78 (11th Cir.2009) (discussing general rule that a party is bound by admissions in his pleadings).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, Watson is a state-court loser and his state court proceedings ended before his federal proceedings commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">Nonetheless, for the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to apply, Watson\u2019s federal claims against Judge Lockette and Clerk Mull must also \u201ceomplain[] of injuries caused by state-court judgments\u201d and \u201cinvit[e] district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. As to Judge Lockette, we readily conclude that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars Watson\u2019s claims. Watson alleges that Judge Lock-ette\u2019s transfer order erred in imposing the $50 transfer fee because Watson had been afforded pauper status. Therefore, Watson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against Judge Lock-ette allege an injury caused by Judge Lockette\u2019s transfer order and invite the district court to review and reject that state court ruling. As such, the district court correctly concluded that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precluded it from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Watson\u2019s access-to-the-court claim against Clerk Mull, however, does not complain of an injury \u201ccaused by\u201d the state court judgment itself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, Watson complains that, as a result of the actions of the clerk\u2019s office employees, he lost the opportunity to appeal the transfer order. Watson complains of an injury caused by the independent actions of clerk\u2019s office employees in refusing to accept Watson\u2019s appeal papers and then in withholding the citizen\u2019s guide to filing appeals until the appeal period had expired. Thus, Watson\u2019s access-to-the-court claim against Clerk Mull is not barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\">C. Failure to State a Claim Against Clerk Mull</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">We nonetheless conclude that the district court properly dismissed Watson\u2019s claim against Clerk Mull. <em>See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that this Court may affirm the district court on any ground supported in the record even if that ground was not relied upon or considered by the district court). Although Watson\u2019s complaint names Clerk Mull as a defendant, it alleges conduct taken by the receptionist and another office worker in the clerk\u2019s office, not by Clerk Mull. \u201cIt is well established in this circuit that supervisory officials are not liable under \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional acts of their subordinates on the basis of respondeat superior or vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Hartley v. Parnell, </em>193 F.3d 1263, 1269 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Absent personal participation, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must allege \u201ca causal connection between actions of the supervising official and the alleged constitutional deprivation,\u201d such as a history of widespread abuse that put the supervisor on notice of constitutional violations or a custom or policy of the supervisor that results in the constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>Watson\u2019s complaint did not allege that Clerk Mull either personally participated in the alleged denial of Watson\u2019s access to the courts or was aware of a widespread pattern of engaging in such conduct. The complaint also did not allege that the clerk\u2019s office employees were acting pursuant to Clerk Mull\u2019s policy or custom. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed without prejudice Watson\u2019s access-to-the-court claim against Clerk Mull for failure to state a claim, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">. <em>See Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and take the well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1997). Likewise, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">. Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down on or before September 30, 1981 are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc </em>).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b850-5\">.Watson's complaint cited the First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in support of the claim against Clerk Mull. The right of access to the courts is grounded in, <em>inter alia, </em>the First Amendment's Petition Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. <em>See Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415 n. 12, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 2186 n. 12, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002). The Eighth Amendment, which prohibits excessive bail or fines and the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment, does not appear to be applicable to the facts Watson alleged. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. VIII. Perhaps in recognition of this fact, on appeal, Watson cites only the First and Fourteenth Amendments in support of his court access claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b850-10\">. The fact that the Georgia Court of Appeals, in dismissing Watson's appeal, may have addressed the propriety of the clerk's office employees\u2019s actions does not implicate the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine, but it may implicate some preclusion doctrine. <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 293, 125 S.Ct. at 1527 (\"If a federal plaintiff presents some independent claim, albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a slate court has reached in a case to which he was a party ..., then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.\u201d (quotation marks and brackets omitted)). However, such a determination cannot be made on the present record, which is silent as to the basis for the Georgia Court of Appeals's dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b850-11\">. We reject Watson's argument that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>trict court was required to hold a hearing before dismissing his complaint without prejudice. <em>See Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that a court need not look beyond the allegations in the complaint in ruling on a motion to dismiss based on the plaintiff's failure to state a claim); <em>In re CP Ships Ltd. Sec. Litig., </em>578 F.3d 1306, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that while a district court may need to hold a hearing before ruling on a \"factual attack\u201d on subject matter jurisdiction, a district court takes the allegations in the complaint as true when ruling on a \"facial attack\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
