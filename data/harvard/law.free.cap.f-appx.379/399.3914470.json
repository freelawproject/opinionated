Although he noticed an appeal of both those convictions and the resulting concurrent 120-month sentences, as well as an appeal from the revocation sentence, Valencia failed to brief any argument regarding the underlying convictions and sentences. Thus, he has abandoned those issues. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 438 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">Valencia argues that the consecutive 60-month revocation sentence was unreasonable and/or plainly unreasonable<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>it was unduly punitive, given that he had already received a harsh 10-year sentence on the underlying violations based on his criminal past and other factors cited by the district court. He urges that those same factors cannot support an additional five-year revocation sentence because they had already been accounted for sufficiently. Alternatively, Valencia argues that, if a consecutive revocation sentence was warranted, the court should have restricted the sentence to the Guidelines range of 21 to 27 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to run the revocation sentence consecutive to the sentence on the underlying charges was authorized by statute and is preferred under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) &amp; comment. (n.4.). Additionally, both the sentencing transcript and the written statement of reasons reveal that the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors when imposing Valencia\u2019s revocation sentence. Specifically, the court found that a significant sentence beyond that imposed on the underlying charges was necessary to reflect the seriousness of Valencia\u2019s criminal past and future dangerousness, as well as to promote respect for the law and provide adequate deterrence, particularly given his nearly 30-year criminal career of drug-trafficking, violence, and disregard for the laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Because the 60-month sentence Valencia received on revocation was not greater than what is authorized by statute, it is \u201cthus clearly legal.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, this court has \u201croutinely upheld release revocation sentences in excess of the advisory range but within the statutory maximum\u201d as satisfying both the plainly unreasonable and unreasonableness standards. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>182 Fed. Appx. 343, 344 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Accordingly, Valencia\u2019s revocation sentence is acceptable under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d and <em>Booker </em>\u201cunreasonableness\u201d standards. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 118-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-19\">. We have yet to address whether sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release are to be reviewed under the ''unreasonableness\u201d standard of <em>United States v. Booker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Prior to <em>Booker, </em>we applied a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005). We need not decide the correct standard today, as Valencia's sentence is appropriate under either standard. <em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
