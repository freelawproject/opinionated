Kennemer, appointed counsel for Marco Antonio Hernandez-Espinoza in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and has filed a brief pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ken-nemer\u2019s brief asserts nothing more than a \u201cbare conclusion\u201d that Hernandez-ESpino-za\u2019s appeal lacks merit, citing no authority to support his view that the appeal is frivolous. The brief falls far short of the <em>Anders </em>protocol. <em>See id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. at 1400 (after a \u201cconscientious examination\u201d of the case, the attorney must submit a brief \u201creferring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Blackwell, </em>767 F.2d 1486, 1487-88 (11th Cir.1985) (the <em>Anders </em>brief must point out <em>\u201cany </em>irregularities in the trial process or other potential error which, although in his judgment not a basis for appellate relief, might, in the judgment of his client or another counselor or the court, be arguably meritorious\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Nonetheless, our independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguably meritorious issues. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Hernandez-Espinoza\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
