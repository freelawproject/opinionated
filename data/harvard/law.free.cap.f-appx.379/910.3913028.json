Both parties moved for summary judgment. Ap-pellee United States of America moved for summary judgment on two grounds. The first ground \u2014 that Appellant\u2019s claims were time-barred because she did not file a claim with the appropriate federal agency within two years of her decedent\u2019s death\u2014 was rejected by the district court. However, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellee on its second asserted ground. Specifically, the district court found that the testimony of plaintiffs experts on the issue of causation was unreliable and, therefore, inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Without the testimony of those witnesses, there was no evidence of causation and, accordingly, the district court concluded that summary judgment in favor of the government was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-23\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to exclude an expert\u2019s testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Rink v. Cheminova, Inc., </em>400 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Car</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number><em>michael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999)). \u201cThis standard of review requires that we defer to the district court\u2019s ruling unless it is \u2018manifestly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Quiet Tech. DC-8, Inc. v. Hurel-Dubois UK Ltd., </em>326 F.3d 1333, 1340 (11th Cir.2003)). \u201cBecause the task of evaluating the reliability of expert testimony is uniquely entrusted to the district court under <em>Daubert </em>... we give the district court \u2018considerable leeway\u2019 in the execution of its duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the plaintiffs proffered expert testimony. As noted by the district court, both of the plaintiffs experts, Dr. Edward Taylor and Dr. Alan Moshell, claim to have utilized what is referred to as the \u201cdifferential diagnosis\u201d methodology in reaching their opinions as to causation. However, as is required in applying that methodology, there is no indication that either expert compiled a \u201ccomprehensive list\u201d of potential causes of the decedent\u2019s illness or explained why potential alternative causes were ruled out. Both experts admit in their respective depositions that they failed to rule out the potential role of other drugs that the decedent was taking in causing his fatal illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The district court found that, based on these failures, the experts failed to apply the differential diagnosis methodology reliably in their respective evaluations. The district court further found that, because of these failures, the experts\u2019 testimonies would not assist the trier of fact. For these reasons, the district court concluded that the testimony of both experts should be excluded under Rule 702 and <em>DcmberL </em>The district court did not abuse its discretion in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Finally, the district court was correct that, without the testimony of these two experts, the plaintiff had no evidence as to causation. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the government was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
