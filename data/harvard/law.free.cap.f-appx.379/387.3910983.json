Slaughter, federal prisoner # 32675-077, was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, distribution and possession of cocaine base within 1,000 feet of a playground, and two counts of distribution of cocaine base. Slaughter was sentenced respectively to concurrent terms of imprisonment for life, 480 months, 480 months, and 240 months. Slaughter has been unsuccessful in seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-24\">Slaughter filed a petition for a writ of audita querela in the district court challenging the legality of his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court found that relief pursuant to a writ of audita querela was not available because redress was available under \u00a7 2255. The district court denied and dismissed Slaughter\u2019s petition on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-25\">Slaughter contends in this appeal that he should be permitted to assert his <em>Booker </em>claim via a petition for a writ of audita querela because <em>Booker </em>was decided after he was sentenced and is not retroactively applicable in the \u00a7 2255 context. Although the writ of audita querela \u201cpermits a defendant to obtain relief against a judgment because of some legal defense arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>after the judgment,\u201d <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 355 (5th Cir.1993), a prisoner may not seek a writ of audita querela if he \u201cmay seek redress under \u00a7 2255.\u201d Id.; <em>see also Massey v. United States, </em>581 F.3d 172, 173-74 (3rd Cir.2009). The fact that a movant cannot meet the requirements for bringing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). Because Slaughter\u2019s remedy is under \u00a7 2255 and he has not obtained leave of this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court did not err in dismissing his petition. The district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"A_z\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-19\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
