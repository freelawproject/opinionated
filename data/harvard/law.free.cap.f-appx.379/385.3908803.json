Maldonado contends that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault is not a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. He argues, inter alia, that the Texas crime of aggravated assault is more broadly defined than most other definitions of aggravated assault because it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>be committed by threatening behavior. The Government has moved for summary affirmance and provides a detailed argument regarding governing precedent, which the Government asserts forecloses Maldonado\u2019s argument. The Government alternatively moves for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The Texas statute under which Maldonado was convicted, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02 (Vernon 2006), is substantially similar to the generic, common sense definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d and thus qualifies as the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
