In his petition, Herrera argued that his 262-month sentence for conspiring to possess with intent to deliver marijuana and cocaine imposed in the Southern District of Texas was unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court observed that Herrera\u2019s claim should have been brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the Southern District of Texas and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-28\">Because Herrera is proceeding under \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain a COA to pursue his appeal. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u201cA section 2241 petition on behalf of a sentenced prisoner attacks the manner in which a sentence is carried out or the prison authorities\u2019 determination of its duration .... \u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). By contrast, \u00a7 2255 is the appropriate vehicle to attack the legality of the prisoner\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>A \u00a7 2241 petition cannot substitute for a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 452. A \u00a7 2241 petition must be filed in the district where the prisoner is incarcerated, while a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cmust be filed in the sentencing court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451. Despite these principles, a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Herrera does not argue that his \u00a7 2241 petition qualified for review under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, nor does he contend that the district court had jurisdiction to construe his petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Although he asserts that he made allegations in his \u00a7 2241 petition regarding the manner in which his sentence has been executed, he did not, in fact, do so. We decline to consider these allegations for the first time on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225, 227 (5th Cir. 1993). The district court did not err by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Puck, </em>218 F.3d at 451-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
