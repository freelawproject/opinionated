No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a determination that a habeas claim was procedurally defaulted. <em>Brownlee v. Haley, </em>306 F.3d 1043, 1058 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a state prisoner fails to present his claims properly in state court, the federal habeas court is precluded from hearing the merits based on the doctrine of procedural default, if any present attempt by the prisoner to exhaust such claims in state court is procedurally barred. <em>Bailey v. Nagle, </em>172 F.3d 1299, 1302-03 (11th Cir.1999). To overcome procedural default, a petitioner must show adequate cause for and actual prejudice arising from the default, or that the failure to consider the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Toole raised these two main claims in his section 2254 petition: (1) the state violated the Interstate Agreement of De-tainer Act (\u201cIADA\u201d) by not trying him within the applicable 180-day deadline, and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel operated under an actual conflict of interest. Toole filed no direct appeal or post-conviction motion in state court; and the time for doing so has expired. <em>See </em>Ala.R.App.P. 4(b)(1); Ala.R.Crim.P. 32.1, 32.2(c)(2). Thus, Toole was required to show cause and prejudice to overcome the procedural default of his claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">Toole argued that his lawyer failed to file a direct appeal raising the IADA issue and that this failure constituted cause for Toole\u2019s failure to raise the IADA claim in state court. But Toole did not raise the claim about his lawyer in state court either. \u201c[A] procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim can serve as cause to excuse the procedural default of another habeas claim only if the habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>petitioner can satisfy the \u2018cause and prejudice\u2019 standard with respect to the ineffective-assistance claim itself.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Carpenter, </em>529 U.S. 446, 120 S.Ct. 1587, 1591, 146 L.Ed.2d 518 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">And to show cause, Toole must demonstrate some objective factor external to the defense that impeded his effort to raise properly in state court his claim that his lawyer failed to file a direct appeal of the IADA issue. <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2645, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). On appeal, Toole argues that cause existed because he was denied access to legal materials both when he was held in the Coffee County jail after sentencing and, later, when he was transferred to a Florida prison.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The record indicates that the Coffee County jail had a law library and that Toole could have accessed it during the day unless the library was occupied. Thus, Toole had access to Alabama legal materials while he was at the Alabama jail. The record also indicates that, while incarcerated in Florida, Toole had access to law clerks who would have aided him in legal research and assisted him in filing for state habeas relief in compliance with Alabama procedural rules. Toole\u2019s failure to obtain available legal materials or take advantage of other available resources was due to his own lack of diligence and not an external impediment.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Toole also fails to show how lack of access to legal materials actually deprived him of access to the courts. <em>See Akins v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1086, 1090 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that, in the context of the statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f), even though prisoners have a constitutional right to access the courts, the mere inability to access the prison law library, without showing that it caused actual ham, is not unconstitutional). While incarcerated in Florida (and within the time to file an Alabama state post-conviction motion), Toole realized that there were potential problems with his appeal process and filed a myriad of motions in the Alabama state courts to file a belated appeal. The Alabama courts informed Toole that his only recourse was to seek Rule 32 post-conviction relief. But Toole \u2014 even with this knowledge and available resources \u2014 still failed to exhaust his ineffective-assistance-of counsel claim through state habeas proceedings. So, Toole\u2019s argument that a lack of access to Alabama legal materials impeded him from raising his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">We also reject Toole\u2019s contention that his counsel\u2019s conflict of interest impeded him from pursuing his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in state court. As noted above, Toole was aware of the problems with his appeal and the sole Rule 32 remedy. His counsel\u2019s alleged conflict of interest did not bear on Toole\u2019s ability to pursue state court remedies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Therefore, we conclude that Toole\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim for his counsel\u2019s failure to file a direct appeal on his behalf was procedurally defaulted; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Toole proffered insufficient causes to overcome the default. Because Toole cannot overcome his procedural default, we decline to address the merits of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel or LADA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">We now address Toole\u2019s other procedurally defaulted section 2254 claim \u2014 that his counsel operated under a conflict of interest because counsel was the presiding judge who signed Toole\u2019s grand jury indictment. On appeal, Toole solely argues the merits of the conflict-of-interest claim and fails to proffer cognizable causes to explain his procedural default as specifically required by the certificate of appealability. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (in an appeal brought by an unsuccessful habeas petitioner, \u201cappellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA\u201d). Thus, we do not address the merits of Toole\u2019s conflict-of-interest claim because he fails to show proper causes to justify the procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-11\">. Toole challenged his robbery convictions from Pike County Circuit Court in Alabama. For these convictions, Toole received a 20-year sentence. Toole also filed a separate, but identical, section 2254 petition attacking his robbery conviction entered in Coffee County Circuit Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-16\">. In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b908-15\">. Toole argues that he did not bypass the state appellate process because he filed many motions in state court seeking to file a belated appeal. But none of the motions Toole filed could be construed as a Rule 32 post-conviction motion for habeas relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b909-8\">. We decline to address Toole\u2019s argument that his psychotropic medication impeded him from raising the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim because he did not raise this claim in the district court. <em>See Depree v. Thomas, </em>946 F.2d 784, 793 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b909-9\">. We also reject Toole's contention that his <em>pro se </em>status and lack of legal knowledge constituted an external impediment justifying his failure to exhaust his claim. <em>See McCoy v. Newsome, </em>953 F.2d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir.1992) (explaining that a <em>pro se </em>petitioner is not exempt from the cause and prejudice requirement and that a \"petitioner\u2019s 'failure to act or think like a lawyer cannot be cause for failing to assert a claim\u2019 since he has no constitutional right to counsel during habeas corpus proceedings\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
