He contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he argues that the guidelines range was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record. He also argues that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and non-violent reentry offense, which amounted to an \u201cinternational trespass.\u201d Finally, Flores-Garcia argues that the guidelines range failed to account for his age, his single prior conviction, and that, despite prior removals, this was his first illegal reentry offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Flores-Garcia did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence after it was imposed; thus, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, Flores-Garcia must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">We review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). As Flores-Garcia concedes, an appellate presumption of reasonableness can be applied \u201c[ejven if the Guidelines are not empirically-grounded.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">This court has consistently rejected Flores-Garcia\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See id. </em>at 366-67; <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). This court has also rejected the argument that double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">The district court considered Flores-Garcia\u2019s request for a downward variance, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court noted that Flores-Garcia had been removed from the United States on 10 occasions. The district court also noted that it had sentenced Flores-Garcia to only nine months of imprisonment on his prior alien-smuggling conviction, at which time he was warned of the consequences of illegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>reentering the United States. Moreover, the district court indicated that it would have imposed a higher sentence if not for Flores-Garcia\u2019s pending supervised release revocation. Flores-Garcia\u2019s assertions that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s lack of an empirical basis, the double-counting of his single pri- or conviction, the non-violent nature of his offense, his age, and the lack of any prior illegal reentry offenses justified a lower sentence are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Flores-Garcia has failed to show that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable, and he has not shown error, plain or otherwise. <em>See id.; Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir.
