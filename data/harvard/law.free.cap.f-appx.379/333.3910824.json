Orr was employed as a pharmacist by the Department of the Army. In 1992, the Army appointed Orr to an overseas position for a twelve-month term ending July 11, 1993. The Army terminated Orr on July 11, 1993 at the end of the term of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-23\">Orr appealed her termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), contending that the Army ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>pointed her to a thirty-six month term, not a twelve-month term. The MSPB dismissed the appeal, finding that Orr was appointed to a twelve-month term, and therefore, her termination by the Army at the end of that term was not an adverse action that was appealable to the MSPB. Orr did not appeal the Board\u2019s decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, as was her right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In 1999, Orr filed another appeal with the MSPB. The MSPB dismissed Orr\u2019s claims, finding that she was collaterally estopped from relitigating whether her appointment extended past July 11, 1993. Orr appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the MSPB\u2019s decision. <em>Our v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>251 F.3d 170, 2000 WL 1810011 (Fed.Cir. Dec.11, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Now nearly seventeen years after her termination by the Army and more than nine years after the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in this matter, Orr for the third time seeks to litigate her termination. The March 2000 MSPB order, which is the subject of the instant suit indicated that Orr had 60 days to appeal to the Federal Circuit. This suit is clearly time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Furthermore, the district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Orr\u2019s case. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Williams v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>242 F.3d 315, 318 (5th Cir.2001). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9), the Federal Circuit has <em>exclusive jurisdiction </em>over an appeal from a final order or final decision of the MSPB. <em>See also Blake v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>794 F.2d 170, 172 (5th Cir. 1986). If a case involves a discrimination claim, the Federal Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction is not exclusive and a federal employee may obtain <em>de novo </em>review of an MSPB decision in such a \u201cmixed case appeal\u201d by filing a civil action in federal district court. <em>See Harms v. I.R.S., </em>321 F.3d 1001, 1005 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 858, 124 S.Ct. 159, 157 L.Ed.2d 105 (2003) (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.310(b)). Although Orr\u2019s pleadings are hardly pellucid, her conelu-sory assertions that her termination was motivated by a retaliatory intent and that she intends to secure a favorable ruling from the EEOC, do not a discrimination claim make. Accordingly, she was entitled to review only in the Federal Circuit, which she received.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Because the district court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
