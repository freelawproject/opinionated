Greathouse\u2019s only explanation for why he refused to comply is that he would have to forgo purchases if required to pay the fee. Nor does the record indicate he was justified in refusing to pay it. Greathouse is not barred by the applicable statute of limitations (Texas) from refiling his complaint. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 41(b) (involuntary dismissal). <em>See McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Further, contrary to Greathouse\u2019s contention, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) provisions that require a prisoner to pay the full appellate filing fee in installments are constitutional. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 290 (5th Cir. 1997). There is no right to proceed in a civil action without paying a filing fee, and the PLRA requires prisoners to consider the filing cost prior to filing a civil action in federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 290-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Greathouse\u2019s assertion that <em>Boumediene v. Bush, </em>553 U.S. 723, 128 S.Ct. 2229, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008), renders this court\u2019s decision in <em>Norton </em>nonbinding is without merit. In <em>Boumediene, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that aliens held at Guantanamo Bay as enemy combatants had a right to file habeas corpus applications challenging their detention; <em>Boumediene </em>does not concern issues relevant to the present case. <em>See </em>128 S.Ct. at 2242-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">This appeal is entirely without merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Greathouse is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pawpens </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
