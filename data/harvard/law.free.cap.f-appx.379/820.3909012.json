After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b844-25\">Watson pled guilty in 2006 to two counts of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii). <em>See </em>Rl-1, 33, 34; R4 at 5. The probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Watson a base offense level of 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but enhanced his offense level to 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B), after determining that Watson, who had three prior felony convictions for \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d was a career offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility, Watson\u2019s total adjusted base offense level was 31. Based on his career offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>status, Watson\u2019s criminal history category was determined to be VI, yielding an advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">At sentencing, Watson challenged his career offender designation on the grounds that his three prior state convictions, which he argued were part of a common course of conduct that occurred without an intervening arrest, should have been counted as a single conviction for enhancement purposes. R3 at 15-18, 23. The district court rejected Watson\u2019s argument, finding that his prior convictions were separate because they: (1) did not occur on the same occasion; (2) were not part of a single, common scheme or plan; and (3) were not functionally consolidated for sentencing, even though Watson was sentenced on the same day for all three convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 23-25. The district court nevertheless determined that Watson\u2019s improved behavior after his release on bond indicated that he was amenable to rehabilitation and varied downward to impose 120-month sentences for each count, to run concurrently. <em>See </em>R2 at 93-97. We affirmed Watson\u2019s sentences on direct appeal. <em>See </em>Rl-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Watson thereafter filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>Rl-59. The district court denied the motion, finding that Amendment 706 was inapplicable because Watson\u2019s sentences were based on his career offender designation under \u00a7 4B1.1 and not on a drug quantity determined under \u00a7 2D1.1. Rl-60 at 2-3. Watson moved for reconsideration, arguing that his three underlying predicate offenses were \u201crelated\u201d and, pursuant to Amendment 709, should not have been considered separately for purposes of the career offender enhancement. Rl-61 at 1-3. The district court denied Watson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed. Rl-62, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">On appeal, Watson argues that, in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion for reduction of sentence based on Amendment 706, the district court should have reconsidered his career offender designation in light of Amendment 709, which requires district courts, when assessing a defendant\u2019s criminal history, to treat as a single sentence all prior sentences that were imposed on the same day. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 1, 2007). He asserts that application of Amendment 709 would have resulted in his three prior state convictions being counted as only one predicate offense for career offender purposes. Watson also argues that if Amendment 709 were applied to nullify his career offender status, then he would be entitled to a sentence reduction by virtue of Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Section 3582(c)(2) grants district courts the discretion to reduce a previously imposed sentence \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The relevant policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences provides that a sentence reduction is authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only where the applicable guideline range was lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual enumerated under \u00a7 1B1.10(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that only the amendments listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) may be applied retroactively using a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). Therefore, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if (a) none of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant; <em>or </em>(b) an amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We readily reject Watson\u2019s argument that the district court erred in failing to reduce his sentences based on Amendment 709, as that amendment is not among those listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) as retroactively applicable. To the extent Watson asserts that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706, his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and </em>cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (holding that a defendant whose sentence is based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendments 706 and 713 do not lower the applicable guideline range for a career offender). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-16\">.
