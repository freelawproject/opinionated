Langdon sought reconsideration of his motion to reduce his sentence, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">Langdon has unsuccessfully attempted on several occasions to reduce his sentence. After Langdon was convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride, cocaine base, and marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), (B), 846, we affirmed his sentence of 360 months of imprisonment, <em>United States v. Langdon, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 954, 962, 963 (11th Cir.2005). Langdon next moved to vacate his sentence on the ground that his sentence had been enhanced in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied relief. Later, Langdon moved to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied Langdon\u2019s motion, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Langdon, </em>322 Fed.Appx. 888 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">Recently, Langdon petitioned for a \u201c[wjrit of audita querela, or coram nobis, or prohibition, or mandamus\u201d under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, and requested that the district court \u201creopen [his] \u00a7 3582 motion\u201d and reduce his sentence based on a reduction given to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>codefendant, Albert Jones. Langdon also reasserted his argument that his sentence violated <em>Apprendi. </em>The district court denied the petition and ruled that the \u201cfacts and amount of cocaine for which Langdon [and Jones] [were] held responsible differ[ed].... \u201d Langdon moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied. The district court explained that Langdon and Jones had the \u201csame base offense level and ... amount of drugs for which they were held responsible\u201d and, although the court had \u201cerred in reducing Jones\u2019s sentence,\u201d that error did not provide a \u201creason to reduce Langdon\u2019s sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The district court did not err by denying Langdon\u2019s petition under the All Writs Act, which does not confer jurisdiction to reconsider a motion to reduce a sentence. <em>See In re Hill, </em>437 F.3d 1080, 1083 (11th Cir.2006) (the All Writs Act \u201cempowers a federal court \u2014 in a case in which it is already exercising subject matter jurisdiction \u2014 to enter such orders as are necessary to aid it in the exercise of such jurisdiction\u201d). Even if we were to treat Langdon\u2019s petition as a motion for reconsideration, the motion was untimely because it was filed more than 10 days after the district court denied Langdon\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1196-99 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The denial of Langdon\u2019s petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
