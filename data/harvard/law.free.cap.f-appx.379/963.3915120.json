Jerdine argued that his conviction was void because the statute that conferred jurisdiction on the district court, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, was unconstitutional. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">The All Wilts Act gives federal courts authority to issue \u201call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). A district court may issue a writ of error coram nobis only if \u201cthere is and was no other available avenue of relief\u2019 and \u201cthe error involves a matter of fact of the most fundamental character which has not been put in issue or passed upon and which renders the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u201d <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000). We review the denial of a writ of error coram nobis for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Jerdine a writ of error coram nobis. Jerdine had available other means to challenge his conviction, and he previously challenged without success the jurisdiction of the district court in a petition for a writ of mandamus, <em>In re Jerdine, </em>No. 06-11534 (11th Cir. June 8, 2006), and a motion to vacate, <em>Jerdine v. United States, </em>No. 09-16240 (11th Cir. Apr. 21, 2010). <em>See Alikhani, </em>200 F.3d at 734. Jerdine argues on appeal that he also is entitled to relief because he was effectively denied counsel during his guilty plea proceedings and his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made, but we will not consider these arguments for the first time on appeal. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Jerdine is not entitled to extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-21\">The denial of Jerdine\u2019s petition for a writ of error coram nobis is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
