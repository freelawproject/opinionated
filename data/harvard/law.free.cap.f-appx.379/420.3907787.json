Miles, Texas prisoner # 536884, filed a civil rights complaint against the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole (Board) and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Parole Division (TDCJ), alleging that his parole was wrongfully revoked due to his refusal to comply with special conditions of parole imposed on sex offenders. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, concluding that the Board and the TDCJ have immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and that Miles\u2019s claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We review the dismissal of the complaint de novo. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-20\">Both the Board and the TDCJ are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Littles v. Board of Pardons and Paroles Division, </em>68 F.3d 122, 123 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (recognizing that the Eleventh Amendment bars suits in federal court by a citizen against agencies or departments of his state). Moreover, a challenge to a parole decision must satisfy the requirements of <em>Heck </em>to state a claim for relief. <em>McGrew v. Tex. Bd. Par</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>dons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.1995). Under <em>Heck, </em>a plaintiff seeking damages for an allegedly unconstitutional imprisonment \u201cmust prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such a determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Miles does not allege that the decision to revoke his probation has been reversed, expunged, set aside, or called into question as <em>Heck </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Miles has not established that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l),(2); <em>Ruiz, </em>160 F.3d at 275. The judgment of the district court is thus affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>fee. </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
