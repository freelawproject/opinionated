O\u2019Connor raises several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\">O\u2019Connor first contends prison officials violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by wrongfully considering several overturned or allegedly invalid disciplinary reports when initially placing him in close management and thereafter approving of his continued placement in close management. A district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is reviewed de novo. <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-19\">\u201cIn this circuit, a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging a denial of procedural due process requires proof of three elements: (1) a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest; (2) state action; and (3) constitutionally-inadequate process.\u201d <em>Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175, 177 (11th Cir.1994)). \u201cThe minimum requirements of due process for prisoners facing disciplinary action ... are (1) advance written notice of the charges; (2) a written statement of the reasons for the disciplinary action taken; and (3) the opportunity to call witnesses and present evidence, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals.\u201d <em>Bass v. Perrin, </em>170 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir.1999). A prisoner placed in close management for non-disciplinary reasons, however, is merely entitled to \u201csome notice of the charges against him and an opportuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>ty to present his views.\u201d <em>Sheley v. Dugger, </em>833 F.2d 1420, 1426 (11th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 103 S.Ct. 864, 874, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)). Due process also requires that prisoners held in close management be given \u201csome sort of periodic review of the[ir] confinement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Assuming O\u2019Connor\u2019s placement in close management deprived him of a protected liberty interest and was disciplinary in nature, O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaint fails to state a due process claim because it does not allege that he was afforded constitutionally-inadequate process. O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaint does not allege that prison officials have failed to provide him with adequate notice, a statement of reasons for his placement in close management, an opportunity to present evidence, or periodic review of his status. Moreover, although Florida\u2019s prison regulations are not constitutional mandates, <em>see Magluta v. Samples, </em>375 F.3d 1269, 1279 n. 7 (11th Cir.2004), O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaint does not even allege that prison officials violated Florida\u2019s detailed procedural requirements. <em>See </em>Fla. Admin. Code R. 33-601.800. O\u2019Connor has simply failed to allege he was denied the ability to meaningfully present his arguments regarding the contested disciplinary reports to prison officials. The district court therefore did not err by dismissing O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s complaint as to his due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">O\u2019Connor also argues the district court should not have dismissed as frivolous his fraud claim, which consisted of allegations that certain prison officials profited by selling bonds with inmates held as collateral. A district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of a complaint or part of a complaint for frivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA claim is frivolous if and only if it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citations omitted). Since O\u2019Connor\u2019s fraud claim has no basis in law or fact, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the claim as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">The district court did not err in dismissing O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaint as to his claims of due process violations and fraud. We reject O\u2019Connor\u2019s remaining claims and arguments without further discussion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-15\">. We note that, since O'Connor was not proceeding in forma pauperis in the district court, his complaint should have been dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) rather than the companion statute 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Since O'Connor does not object on appeal, and since any error resulting therefrom was harmless, we will consider the dismissal as occurring pursuant to \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>See Leal, </em>254 F.3d at 1279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-7\">. O'Connor\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal are that the district court erred by: (1) failing to address his claim for injunctive relief; (2) failing to conduct a de novo review; (3) denying his motion for reconsideration; and (4) denying his motion to proceed in forma pau-peris on appeal and requiring the payment of the filing fee in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
