(standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1018, 119 S.Ct. 543, 142 L.Ed.2d 452 (1998). Because Smith failed to serve defendants properly, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for default judgment. See <em>Norsyn, Inc. v. Desai, </em>351 F.3d 825, 828 (8th Cir.2003). Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to disqualify opposing counsel because Smith failed to show a prior attorney-client relationship with any lawyer in that firm. <em>See Petrovic v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>200 F.3d 1140, 1154 (8th Cir.1999) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">However, the court erred in dismissing Smith\u2019s claims with prejudice because a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction on account of improper service is not an adjudication on the merits and therefore should be without prejudice. <em>See Ahmed v. United States, </em>147 F.3d 791, 797 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Johnson v. Boych-Richardson Co., </em>650 F.2d 147, 148 (8th Cir.1981). Because Smith has filed multiple meritless actions in the District of Minnesota raising similar claims, we remand to the district court to determine whether and, if so, the extent to which Smith should be precluded from filing additional claims in that court or in the United States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
