He challenges his within-guidelines sentence, contending that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to provide sufficient reasons for imposing the sentence. Rodriguez also maintains that his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing and was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-19\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir. 2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-20\">\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cWhere the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence ... the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456. The Court has not, however, explicitly mandated that a sentencing court provide specific reasons for its rejection of a defendant\u2019s arguments or request for a lower sentence. <em>Id. </em>The explanation requirement may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>satisfied if the district court listens to arguments, then indicates that a sentence within the guideline sentencing range is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 357-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Here, the district court, after hearing argument of counsel for a below-Guidelines sentence, stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Rodriguez\u2019s extensive criminal history and that a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range was appropriate. The district court\u2019s statements were sufficient. <em>See id. </em>Rodriguez\u2019s 86-month sentence was within the Guidelines range of 77 to 96 months in prison and is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- \u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-17\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
