Upon <em>de novo </em>review, <em>see Moore ex rel. Moore v. Barnhart, </em>413 F.3d 718, 721 (8th Cir.2005), we agree with the District Court that substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s determination that B.M.M.\u2019s severe impairments are not functionally equivalent to a listed impairment or impairments because the record does not reflect an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in at least one of the six functional domains listed in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l) or a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in at least two of the domains. We decline to address Smith\u2019s contention that B.M.M.\u2019s severe impairments meet or are medically equal to a listed impairment or impairments. <em>See Flynn v. Chater, </em>107 F.3d 617, 620 (8th Cir.1997) (noting that new arguments need not be entertained on appeal unless manifest injustice would otherwise result); <em>see also Rotskoff v. Cooley, </em>438 F.3d 852, 854-<em>55 </em>(8th Cir.2006) (observing that an issue is deemed abandoned where it is not developed in brief); <em>Vandenboom v. Barnhart, </em>421 F.3d 745, 750 (8th Cir.2005) (summarily rejecting conclusory assertion that claimant was disabled under certain listings). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-18\">. The Honorable Barry A.
