For the first time on appeal, Granados-Reyes argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court presumed that a sentence within the applicable sentencing guidelines range was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Generally, this court reviews the sentence imposed for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, this court first determines whether the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is proeedurally sound and then determines whether the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If a defendant fails to object to an error at sentencing, this court will review the district court\u2019s actions for plain error only. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) As Granados-Reyes did not preserve his presumption-of-reasonableness argument in the district court, this court will review the district court\u2019s actions for plain error only. <em>See United States v. King, </em>541 F.3d 1143, 1144 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 947, 173 L.Ed.2d 144 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A sentencing court cannot require that exceptional circumstances be present to justify imposing a sentence that is outside of the guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586. Contrary to Granados-Reyes\u2019s argument, nothing in the district court\u2019s remarks shows that he was required to overcome a presumption that the Guidelines range was reasonable or required to prove \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d before the district court would impose a non-Guidelines sentence. Grana-dos-Reyes has not established that the district court erred, much less plainly erred, by applying a presumption of reasonableness to his advisory sentencing guidelines range. <em>See King, </em>541 F.3d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
