After being taken in custody, appellant applied to the Honorable George P. Blackburn, Judge of the 6th Judicial District, for a writ of habeas corpus, which was awarded, and a hearing had thereon. From an order remanding him, appellant has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">The sale of beer containing not more than 3.2 per cent, of alcohol by weight has not been authorized in Fannin County in accordance with the constitutional and statutory provisions. Appellant is charged with an offense denounced by the Penal Code. He does not claim the statute is unconstitutional. He has not been denied bail. The circumstances in the record present no occasion for the application for a writ of habeas corpus.
