The second count charged the burglary of a house \u201coccupied and controlled\u201d by Ray White, with intent to steal property from him. The second count only was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The house burglarized was a garage situated on property owned by Mrs. Dena Hall, mother of Scott Hall. The evidence shows that Mrs. Hall had some things stored in the garage, and that White was keeping his car in the garage but not paying for the privilege. The property stolen was taken from the car, some being casings and other things of which the car was stripped, and other property which was inside the car. The State\u2019s Attorney calls to our attention the fact that if the occupancy and control was properly alleged in White there is an entire absence of proof of want of consent from him. Want of consent from Scott Hall was proven, but as heretofore stated the count which charged occupancy and control in him was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Upon the point under consideration, White testified as follows: \u201cI recall when I lost some accessories off my car * * * At that time I was keeping my car down at Scott Hall\u2019s garage here in Vernon. I do not know the street number but it was at the residence of Mrs. Hall, who is the mother of Scott Hall. * * * Just this garage up at Scott Hall\u2019s home place was broken into * * *. They had a bunch of stuff in there, bedding and cots and things like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Scott Hall testified: \u201cI recall the occasion of <em>my garage </em>being broken open down there. At that time there was some junk in the garage out there. I don\u2019t know what was in it besides Ray White\u2019s car. * * * I had charge of that garage and I did not give anybody permission to break in there. Nobody had any authority to go in there except myself and family and Ray White. Ray White did not pay so much for the use of that garage, I just let him put his car in there and did not charge him anything * * *. My mother owns that place, but that is my garage, I built it, my mother gave me permission to build the garage on her property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Mrs. Hall testified as follows: \u201cThe garage was for Buddy\u2019s car when he was there. * * * I let Ray White have it to put his car in as we didn\u2019t have a car then. * * * I own the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>garage and I let Mr. Ray White have it. How much he paid to leave his car there, will state that his mother had been my friend so long I would have been humiliated in charging him anything. I owned that garage and told him he could put his car in it. He got permission from me to put his car in there and I did not charge him anything. I had charge and control of the garage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Neither from the evidence quoted nor from any other found in the record was proof made as to White\u2019s non-consent. Whether a failure to make such proof was an oversight, or whether the State was relying on the circumstances shown to supply such proof, is not ascertainable from the record. In either event the absence of such evidence is fatal to the conviction. The State may not resort to proof of circumstances to supply evidence of non-consent where the party whose non-consent it is necessary to show is present and testifies as a witness upon the trial. Caddell v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 133, 90 S. W., 1014; Hunt v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 404, 231 S. W., 775. Many authorities are cited in the first case mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
