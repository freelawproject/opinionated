We perceive no particular in which the affidavit upon its face falls short of compliance with article 691, P. C., and of Title 6, C. C. P., 1925. The oath was made by two credible witnesses. The property is described as a dwelling, etc. occupied by Jack Carnell, and situated a quarter of a mile east of the J. R. Goss store, about thirty miles northeast of Bonham, in Fannin County, State of Texas, and declares that the house is one in which intoxicants are manufactured and sold in violation of the law. It is the contention of the appellant that the jurat to the affidavit is void for the reason that it is signed by a \u201cJustice of the Peace\u201d and not by a magistrate. All justices of the peace are magistrates. See article 33, C. C. P., 1925; White v. State, 106 Texas Crim. Rep., 150; Hinkley v. State, 119 Texas Crim. Rep., 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The facts revealed by the evidence are in substance as follows: Appellant occupied the tw-o east rooms of a five-room house. In these two rooms the officers found three half-gallon fruit jars, all full of whisky. The other rooms in the structure were occupied by other persons. The part of the house occupied by appellant was described by the officers as being segregated from the others by doors that were nailed and padlocked, and' as understood, had but one entrance which was under the control of appellant. He and his wife resided in the rooms but at the time of the search (which was at night) they had gone to a party. The fact that part of the house was occupied by others than the appellant is not regarded as vitiating the warrant, nor under the facts does the evidence mentioned militate in any sense against the right of the officers to search the apartment occupied by appellant and to make proof of the finding of the liquor therein. See Whitlock v. State, 58 S. W. (2d) 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The expression in the court\u2019s charge that \u201cthe possession by the defendant when established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of more than one quart of intoxicating liquor is prima facie evidence of guilt\u201d is not deemed to have been harmful to the accused. The paragraph is followed by the following qualifying words:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u201cSuch possession, however, is only prima Tacie evidence of guilt, or, in other words, merely raises a legal presumption of guilt, which presumption may be overcome by evidence showing that such possession was not for the purpose of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">In addition thereto, the court instructed the jury fully upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the law of circumstantial evidence. The charge is apparently analogous to that sanctioned in the opinion of this court in the case of Wininger v. State, 36 S. W.( 2d) 509. In the present case, the qualifying or explanatory words of the charge, in connection with the instruction on the law of circumstantial evidence, are deemed adequate to inform the jury that prima facie evidence was not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The court also, at the request of the appellant, instructed the jury to acquit him unless they believed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the whisky described by the State\u2019s witnesses was in the possession of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We find no specific exception to the failure of the court to more accurately define the meaning of prima facie evidence than as was done in the manner described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b129-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Av_\">In the light of appellant\u2019s motion, we have again carefully gone over the matters complained of. We still regard the affidavit, and the search warrant based thereon, as sufficient. The affidavit was signed and sworn to by two affiants before a magistrate; described the premises to be searched as, \u2014 the private dwelling and buildings and grounds appurtenant thereto, occupied and controlled by Jack Carnell, and described as \u201cA dwelling house, all outhouses, and premises, about one-quarter of a mile east of the J. R. Goss store, about thirty miles northeast of Bonham in Fannin County, Texas; is a place where whisky and beer are being manufactured and sold in violation of law and of Art. 666, Penal Code of Texas.\u201d See Penny v. State, 114 Texas Crim. Rep., 303; Green v. State, 12 S. W. (2d) 790; Montalbano v. State, 116 Texas Crim. Rep., 242; Schwartz v. State, 120 Texas Crim. Rep., 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">On the question as to the correctness of our statement that the door was nailed up between that part of the house occupied by appellant and his wife, and that part occupied by others,\u2014 we quote what one of the women testified who lived in the room next to those of appellant: \u201cThere was no passageway between my room and Jack Carnell\u2019s, \u2014 I have got it nailed. I don\u2019t know how Jack Carnell\u2019s room was fastened the night of the raid; I know the officers had to break into it.\u201d Whether the room leading from appellant\u2019s part of the house was nailed, or closed by a button and had a bed pushed against it on appellant\u2019s side of the wall, would still leave us unable to find anything in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>record to support any reasonable conclusion that the whisky found by the officers in appellant\u2019s room, belonged to or was placed there by some one other than appellant, \u2014 who occupied said rooms with his wife, but was gone to a concert at the time the officers searched the place. The fact that a voice said by a witness to be not that of appellant was heard apparently coming from said rooms of appellant about 9:30 P. M., the night of the search, offers no tangible opposition to our conclusions. Ras Taylor said he heard some one in there and he thought it was Jack. Later he said it was not Jack. Ras Taylor\u2019s wife said she heard some one in there, and thought it was Jack. Since the officers apparently found no way to get into appellant\u2019s rooms after examining the various approaches, \u2014 save to break in as they did, \u2014 it would require some stretch of imagination to believe that a burglar got into appellant\u2019s rooms about 9:30 P. M. without noise of breaking or entry, and not only made an equally noiseless getaway but left behind him several gallons of whisky. We see no similarity between the facts in this case and those in Whitehead v. State, 60 S. W. (2d) 207, or the other cases cited by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
