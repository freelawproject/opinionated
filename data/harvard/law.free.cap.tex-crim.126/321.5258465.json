C. Hamm, operated a garage in Sulphur Springs, Texas. Appellant came to his place of business on the 31st of December, 1932, for the purpose of having his automobile repaired. Mr. Hamm boug'ht approximately seven dollars worth of parts, which he used in repairing the car. At the time the automobile was delivered to appellant he gave Mr. Hamm a check for $25.50 to cover the. new parts used on the car, and further to cover $1.15 in money. Mr. Hamm placed the check in the Sulphur Springs State Bank in order that it might be sent to Dallas to the Mercantile Bank &amp; Trust Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>pany of Texas, the bank upon which the check was drawn. The cashier of the Sulphur Springs bank mailed the check to the Mercantile Bank &amp; Trust Company, and, in due course, it was returned unpaid. Testifying in his own behalf, appellant admitted writing the check. He testified, further, that the work on his car was unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">No one connected with the Mercantile Bank &amp; Trust Company testified. The check was introduced in evidence. It bore a notation: \u201cInsufficient Funds and Payment Stopped.\u201d Ob-</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">jection was made to the admission in evidence of the notation on said check on the ground that it was hearsay. This objection being overruled, the injured party was permitted to testify, over appellant\u2019s proper objection, that the check was marked \u201cPayment Stopped. Insufficient Funds. No Account.\u201d Thereafter the assistant cashier of the Sulphur Springs bank testified, over appellant\u2019s objection, that the check was returned by the Dallas bank marked \u201cPayment Stopped and Insufficient Funds.\u201d Under the holding in Holland v. State, 2 S. W. (2d) 248, we are constrained to hold that reversible error is presented. We quote from Holland\u2019s Case as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u201cThere is an entire absence of. testimony as to the idenity of the person who made the notation of \u2018No Acct.,\u2019 without which notation a conviction could not be had. There is not even any evidence in the record to show that said check was ever forwarded to the Valley Bank of Phoenix, Ariz., or for that matter that it ever left El Paso. Who was the party who made this notation which is the State\u2019s main incriminating fact? Was he friend or foe? Did he have a motive for making same? Was the same true? Was the money in the bank originally and had same been improperly or erroneously charged to some other account? Had the account been garnisheed? None of these questions may have been in the case, but some of them may have been brought out as a fact on cross-examination, if such a right had been accorded the appellant. Instead, the unsworn statement of an unidentified and unknown person was introduced in evidence as a circumstance of guilt. His right of cross-examination was thus denied. The party who made the notation was not under oath. Appellant has been convicted upon an ex parte statement made in his absence without even knowing who gave the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u201cNo citation of authorities is necessary to show that this statement on the check of \u2018No Acct.\u2019 was hearsay of the rankest kind under rules obtaining and in force since English jurisprudence had its birth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
