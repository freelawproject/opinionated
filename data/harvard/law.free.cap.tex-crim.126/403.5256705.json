C. McPherson drove to appellant\u2019s home at night and purchased from appellant two pints of whisky for which they paid one dollar. McPherson, who was 17 years of age, testified that he remained in the truck while Barnes went to the house and bought the whisky. Peace officers saw Barnes coming out of appellant\u2019s house, and, upon stopping him, found in his possession two pints of whisky. Testifying in his own behalf, appellant denied that he sold any whisky to Barnes and McPherson. He admitted, however, that they were at his house on the occasion in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The only bill of exception found in the record relates to the argument of the assistant county attorney. Appellant had filed an application for a suspended sentence. In argument, the assistant county attorney requested the jury not to suspend appellant\u2019s sentence, but to give him five years in the penitentiary, because of the fact that he had sold intoxicating liquor to boys of high school age. We are unable to reach the conclusion that the bill of exception presents error. The evidence showed that Barnes was 21 and McPherson 17, and the bill reflects the fact that the assistant county attorney was referring to the sale to Barnes and McPherson.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b426-13\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b426-14\">LATTIMORE, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AIxe\">Appellant urges that we were wrong in holding that the argument of the county attorney, referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>to in our original opinion, did not injuriously affect his case,\u2014 in its bearing on the question of his right to a suspended sentence. The matter has again been looked into. The State proved by a number of witnesses that appellant\u2019s reputation for being a peaceable law-abiding citizen was bad. No witness testified that it was otherwise. This fact could easily have accounted for the refusal of a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We further note that according to the testimony of McPherson, a seventeen year old State witness, he contributed to the fund with which Barnes, another State witness, just past twenty-one years of age, bought whisky from appellant. The two went to appellant\u2019s place together. Barnes in his testimony said he had known appellant for two years, had been to his place before the trip in which this whisky was bought. He said he told appellant on the instant occasion what he wanted; that appellant did not mention the price. Barnes said \u201cI already knew the price.\u201d The car in which Barnes and McPherson went to the home of appellant was stopped right in front of appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We are of opinion that in view of this record showing that a boy of high school age had contributed to the fund to buy the whisky; that he sat in a truck in front of appellant\u2019s house while another boy, a few days past twenty-one, who already knew the price of appellant\u2019s whisky, and had been there before, \u2014 went in and got the whisky, \u2014 this would operate to support the argument made by the prosecuting attorney and to prevent its having any hurtful or injurious effect upon appellant\u2019s claim for a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Believing the case properly decided, ing will be overruled. the motion for rehear-</p>\n<p id=\"Aqv\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
