W. Dooley, against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The trial was had before a jury upon a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">The record is before this court without statement of facts or bills of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">The court delivered a written charge to which the appellant, through his counsel, presented some exceptions. In the absence of a statement of facts we are unable to perceive any fault in the charge which would justify a reversal or demand discussion. Likewise, the complaint as to the sufficiency of the evidence is manifestly unavailable for the reason that the testimony heard upon the trial is not brought up for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">The motion for new trial contains averments which in the absence of the statement of facts cannot be appraised.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">The sentence is regular and condemns appellant to suffer confinement in the State penitentiary for a period of not less than two nor more than ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
