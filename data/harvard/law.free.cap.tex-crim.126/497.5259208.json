Burtt Potter, </em>of Aransas Pass, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AgC\"><em>Lloyd W. Davidson, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AvdJ\">LATTIMORE, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Aoz\">Conviction for assault to murder; punishment, four years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"AF0\">Appellant made a motion to quash the indictment, which seems to have been properly overruled. Also a motion for continuance, the refusal of which is not here complained of by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>bill of exceptions, and for that reason nothing in the court\u2019s action is made to appear erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\">The facts seem ample to support the judgment. A number of witnesses testified that they were present when appellant cut the alleged injured party with a knife. Some testimony was to the contrary. The jury have settled the conflict of evidence against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In the sentence appellant was committed to the penitentiary for a period of four years. The indeterminate sentence law of this State was overlooked. The sentence will be reformed, and appellant will be sentenced to confinement in the penitentiary for a period of not less than one and not more than four years, and as reformed the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
