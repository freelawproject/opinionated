This question was before this court in the case of W. I. Butts v. The State, <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>No. 16,726, decided May 23, 1934, in which this court, speaking through Judge Hawkins, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\u201cIt seems to be the appellant\u2019s contention that since the passage of the act mentioned under the Constitutional amendment referred to an indictment is insufficient unless in addition to charging that the accused possessed for the purpose of sale intoxicating liquor, the indictment go further and describe the liquor as \u2018spirituous\u2019 or if it is vinous or malt liquor, designate it as such, and then follow the designation by an averment that it contained more than 3.2 percent alcohol by weight. We are unable to bring ourselves to agree with such contention. In our opinion the present indictment charges an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Under the authority of Butts v. State, supra, the appellant\u2019s contention is overruled and the judgment of the trial court is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\"> (Reported on page 563 of this volume.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
