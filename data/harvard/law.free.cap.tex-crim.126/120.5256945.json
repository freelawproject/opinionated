The officers testified, without contradiction, that they had information which they regarded as reliable that appellant transported whisky along that way every Saturday night. We regard the showing of probable cause sufficient, and that the facts demonstrate appellant\u2019s guilt. We have examined each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>bills of exception found in the record, and see no necessity for discussing any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
