The testimony for the State and appellant is in a condition of direct conflict, the \u2022 State claiming that appellant was observed with a package in his arms, which was investigated and found to contain whiskey. The place where he was was not that of his residence or where he stayed. He had just gotten out of a car and was going toward the Harris house with the package in his arms, which the State claimed contained whiskey. Appellant and his witnesses claimed that it contained clothing, one Gibson testifying that appellant had a shirt and a pair of trousers in a sack, and told witness he was going down to the Harris house to carry same. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that appellant was carrying a package containing a shirt and a pair of trousers to said house at the time he was confronted by the officers. We regret the necessity for reversing this case upon the proposition of the admission of this improper testimony, and especially in view of the fact that it appears from the statement of facts that said question was elicited from the deputy sheriff in the absence of the jury. However, the bill of exceptions contains the direct statement as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u201cWhich objections were overruled by the court, and the witness did testify before the jury as follows:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">It is the rule of this court that when there is a conflict between the statement of facts and a bill of exceptions, the latter will govern and be taken to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">For the error mentioned, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
