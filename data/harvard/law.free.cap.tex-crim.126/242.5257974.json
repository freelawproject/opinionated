At the time he left his car appellant and some other men were standing near it. Appellant had a patch or bandage over one eye. After the dance Davis discovered that his car had been stolen. Instituting a search on the following day, an officer and Mr. Davis found some car tracks leading from the home of appellant\u2019s father to a branch. Appellant lived with his father. The officer testified: \u201cWhen we went to Mr. John L. Davis\u2019 house we found that this car had come out the big gate there at the house into this road.\u201d It had been raining, and upon following the tracks to the branch, Mr. Davis and the officer were unable to cross. They later went back, and crossing the branch, found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the stolen car in some brush. There was only one set of tracks leading from appellant\u2019s home to the branch. The car had been dismantled and the parts hidden in various places in the brush. Three casings were missing. Near the automobile they found a patch or bandage. The missing casings consisted of two Federal tires and one Firestone. About ten o\u2019clock on the night of the theft the sheriff saw two Pontiac coupes in front of Mrs. Morris\u2019 house. One of the cars was black and the other blue. There was someone in the black car. Appellant was in front of the house on the ground. There was no one in the blue Pontiac. The cars were close together and headed in the same direction. Appellant owned a black Pontiac coupe. About two and one-half months after the loss of his car Mr. Davis observed appellant\u2019s Pontiac coupe parked near the courthouse. Upon making an investigation, he discovered two Federal tires and one Firestone on the car. He testified on direct examination: \u201cI know positively that those three casings were my casings.\u201d On cross examination he testified that he believed the casings were his but would not swear positively that they were. However, further on cross examination, he made the following statement: \u201cWith reference to the Firestone tire I found here on Pug Davis\u2019 (appellent\u2019s) car I had used it on the front wheel where the wheels were wobbling bad and were worn around in grooves, all the way around the tire, and then it had some patches in it that I recognized it by.\u201d Again, he testified on cross examination that he would know the Firestone tire anywhere; that he had changed it many times and knew just what he had put in it. On his redirect examination the witness was asked to look at the Firestone casing that had been taken from appellant's car. Showing it to the jury, he said: \u201cThat is my casing. I identify it more by these places being cut out in it. Also when the tire was new I punched a hole in it with a stick or something. It went through the center when it was new, and they put a plug in there from the inside with a little stem on it, pulled it through from the inside. Right here is where it was. When we found the tire that plug had been removed, but it was worn inside just the size of the plug. This is the place here. That is where the stick went through the tire when it was new. I knew that place on that tire. I had been using and fooling with that tire about a year- and a half, and I know positively that it is my tire. This is one of the tires taken off of Pug Davis\u2019 (appellant\u2019s) car here, and is one of the tires that was on my car when it was stolen.\u201d Thereafter, on recross-examination the witness said: \u201cI know positively this is my tire. Besides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>what I have stated I know this tire by those places being worn by the wheels wobbling that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">Appellant did not testify in his own behalf. Ira Vaughn testified that he went with appellant to the dance on the occasion in question in appellant\u2019s automobile, and that, leaving the dance, they drove in appellant\u2019s car to the home of appellant\u2019s father, where they spent the night. He denied that they took Mr. Davis\u2019 car. Appellant\u2019s father testified that appellant remained at home with Ira Vaughn after he had returned from the dance.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We are unable to agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">No other question is presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
