The bond sued upon is joint and several. Before section 758 of the Code of Civil Procedure was amended (September 1, 1877) the death of a joint surety discharged his estate from all liability upon such contract. The bond in suit was given in 1872. The death of Rodney Sargent, January 28, 1887, discharged his personal representative from the joint liability of her testator upon such bond. 3 Rev. St. (5th Ed.) p. 669, \u00a7 1; <em>Getty </em>v. <em>Binsse, </em>49 N. Y. 385; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>63 N. Y. 245; <em>Risley </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>67 N. Y. 160; <em>Hauck </em>v. <em>Craighead, </em>Id. 432. September 1, 1877, section 758 of the Code of Civil Procedure was amended so as to read that the estate of a person or party jointly liable upon contract, with others, shall not be discharged by his death, but the court may make an order to bring in the proper representative, when necessary to do so. This amendment did not affect the bond in suit, which had been gi yen before it became the law. 3STo act of the legislature could alter the effect of this bond, to the prejudice of either party. The law as it stood when the bond was given is considered a part of the written condition thereof. <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Price, </em>9 How. 83; <em>Fielden </em>v. <em>Lahens, </em>6 Blatchf. 524; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Sackett, </em>77 N.

Under this section the plaintiff had the right to join the original defendants in the action; to discontinue the action as to the defendant Gilletta Low; and, at the death of Rodney Sargent, to revive the action against the defendant Abbie A. Prouty,' as personal representative of said deceased defendant; and to continue the same to judgment against the present defendants, taking a personal judgment against the defendant Peter Ferris, and a judgment to be collected by due course of administration against the defendant Abbie A. Prouty, sole executrix of Rodney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Sargent, deceased. <em>Churchill </em>v. Trapp, 3 Abb. Pr. 306; <em>Eaton v. Alger, </em>57 Barb. 179, on appeal, 47 N. Y. 345; <em>Hauck </em>v. <em>Craighead, </em>67 N. Y. 432, 436.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-5\">\u201cThe condition of the bond in suit is that Edwin B. Low shall well and faithfully, in all things, discharge the duty of guardian of the plaintiff, his ward, according to law, and render a just and true account of all moneys and property received by him, and of the application thereof, to and before any court haying cognizance thereof, when thereto required. The case presented by the evidence shows that the guardian, soon after his ward attained his majority, rendered a correct account, showing the true balance remaining in his hands, but did not pay such balance, but by fraudulent representations induced his ward to receive in payment a worthless note and mortgage, taking from him a discharge and authority to enter a decree with the surrogate of Essex county, who had appointed the guardian, judicially settling his account, and discharging him and his sureties upon the bond in suit. As the guardian rendered a correct account, showing the true balance, it is insisted by the counsel for the defendants that the fraud committed by the guardian in making the payment was not part of his conduct as guardian, but was the individual fraud of the guardian, and not within the condition of th\u00e9 bond. The condition that the guardian shall in all things faithfully perform his duty according to law requires him, not only to render a correct account, but to actually pay over the balance to the ward, when he is entitled to receive it. Any colorable payment, made with counterfeit coin, spurious bills, or checks drawn upon a bank in which there were no funds to pay, or any payment received by the ward because of the fraudulent representations of the guardian, does not operate as a payment in fact, and does not discharge the sureties upon the guardian\u2019s bond. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>87 Tenn. 32, 9 S. W. Rep. 202, 10 Amer. St. Rep. 617, note at page 619, and eases there cited. The undertaking of the surety that the guardian shall actually pay protects the ward against any fraud of the guardian, committed in the attempt of the latter to make payment or to obtain satisfaction or discharge of the debt due by the guardian, as such, to the ward. Until the guardian had paid the ward the money, or property which was a just equivalent for it, he had not faithfully performed his duty as guardian. After such payment has once been made, the liability of the guardian, as such, and of his sureties, ceases. Further dealings of the guardian, whereby he defrauds the ward, are personal fraud, not involving his conduct as guardian, for which the sureties upon his bond cannot in any manner be made liable. The release and discharge from plaintiff to Edwin B. Low, his guardian, having been declared void for fraud by a court of competent jurisdiction, the liability of the defendants as sureties upon the bond of the guardian, if not affected by loches, remains the same as though the release had never been given. <em>Parr </em>v. <em>State, </em>(Md.) 17 Atl. Rep. 1020; Amer..Dig. 1889, p. 1722. The attempted payment by Edwin B. Low, as guardian, to the plaintiff, his ward, and the discharge given therefor, and the decree in the surrogate\u2019s court, based ther\u00e9bn, having been set aside for the fraud of such guardian, and it having been affirmatively adjudged in an action brought in this court by the plaintiff against Edwin B. Low, as guardian, that said Low, as such guardian, pay a sum of money to plaintiff, for which he is liable as guardian, such judgment and decree, obtained in the manner and under the circumstances detailed in the findings of fact, is evidence against the sureties upon said guardian\u2019s bond, and is <em>prima facie </em>binding upon them. <em>Bockfeller </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>8 Cow. 623; <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>48 Barb. 243; <em>Binsse </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>37 N. Y. 526; <em>Gerould </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>81 N. Y. 573; <em>Scofield </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>72 N. Y. 565; <em>Casoni </em>v. <em>Jerome, </em>58 N.

Rep. 1020, Amer. Dig. 1889, p. 1722. There being no evidence in any manner rebutting the reasonable inference to be drawn from the judgment roll, in that case, it is proof of the fact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>liability of Low as guardian to the plaintiff, and is competent evidence of the guardian\u2019s fraud. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Hubbell, </em>15 N. Y. 405; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>1 Hill, 56; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>34 N. Y. 275; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>103 N. Y. 527, 9 N. E.

St. Rep. 587.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b724-5\">\u201cThe judgment before mentioned determined that there was a sufficient rescission of the attempted payment, with a proper offer to restore the note and mortgage, and the same have always since remained at the disposal of Low, and were ready to be delivered to him at the trial. The note and mortgage were taken as actual payment, and except for the fraud of Low would have operated as payment, of the amount due from him to the plaintiff. As the attempted payment was set aside for fraud, it did not operate to extend the time of payment of the original indebtedness. It does not appear that there was any irregularity in the entry of final judgment in the action between the plaintiff and Low. An irregularity of the kind claimed could only be corrected by proper motion. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Hostrand, </em>94 N. Y. 32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b724-6\">\u201cIt is insisted by the counsel for the defendants that such loches on the part of the plaintiff are shown that the sureties upon the guardian\u2019s bond are released. The fraud of Edwin B. Low, the guardian, was committed May 14, 1879. It was discovered by plaintiff in November, 1880, and was by him immediately communicated to Low, and the plaintiff then demanded that the transaction respecting the note and mortgage, by which the fraud was committed, and all proceedings which had been taken under the discharge and decree of the surrogate, should be canceled and treated as void, and that said Low, as guardian, pay the $3,200 and interest, for which the note and mortgage had been substituted, to which Low assented, and promised to make such payment, and in February paid $800. In April, 1882, Low transferred his real estate to his wife, and made no further payment upon the amount' acknowledged by him to be due to the plaintiff. In October, 1882, plaintiff commenced the action against Low, his guardian, in which judgment was entered in February, 1885, vacating the attempted payment by the note and mortgage, and setting aside the discharge and the decree of the surrogate based thereon, and giving judgment in favor of the plaintiff against Low for the amount due by him as guardian. On June 9, 1885, the judgment had been affirmed by the general term, and final judgment was entered. On June 15, 1885, executions on the judgments were issued, and returned unsatisfied. This action was brought October 31, 1885, and then the sureties first became aware of the fraud of Low, and of the proceedings taken by the plaintiff in consequence of such fraud. On June 27, 1885, Low was, and since then has been, insolvent. It is fairly to be inferred that the assent of Low and his promise to pay in November, 1880, and afterwards often repeated, and his payment in February, 1882, were the cause of plaintiff\u2019s failure to prosecute an action against Low until October, 1882. From that time until the commencement of this suit, plaintiff was prosecuting the suit against his guardian to avoid the effects of his fraud, and to put himself in condition to prosecute the sureties; the guardian during all the time unjustly defending and interposing to delay. Under the circumstances, did the plaintiff owe any duty to the sureties which he omitted? They undertook, as has been shown, to guard and protect him against the fraudulent conduct of his guardian. He had undertaken to settle with this guardian when he attained his majority, and to obtain payment. In the attempt to pay him the guardian had cheated and defrauded him, and in that way had obtained his discharge. Until such payment and discharge had been set aside for the fraud, plaintiff could not call upon the sureties, and he had the right to take the proper proceedings for that purpose. Whatever time was necessarily taken for that purpose, plaintiff was entitled to. The guardian was not faithfully performing his duty when he committed the fraud, nor was he when he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>sisted proper legal proceedings to vacate and set aside what he had gained by his fraudulent conduct as guardian. The delays were caused by the fraudulent and improper conduct of the guardian, as such, against which the sureties had undertaken to guard the plaintiff. The sureties were bound to know that any transaction between plaintiff and Low, by which he defrauded plaintiff in paying over such money, was liable to be set aside for such fraud, and that nothing short of actual payment would release the guardian or his sureties. It was their duty to protect .themselves by such inquiries as to payment as would have put them into possession of the facts. The plaintiff was in the neighborhood, and they could have made inquiry of him. Without such inquiry, he had no occasion to communicate with the sureties. The plaintiff having acted reasonably, under the existing circumstances, and the delay in calling upon the sureties having been caused by the fraudulent and dishonest conduct of the principal, the guardian, for whom the sureties had undertaken that he should, as guardian, act honestly and without fraud, such delay does not constitute loches which w'ill discharge the sureties. <em>Gillett </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>126 Ill. 319, 19 N. E. Rep. 287, 9 Amer. St. Rep. 587, note, and cases cited. I. see no reason why the plaintiff should not recover the cost arid expense in undoing the fraud of the principal, and in securing an honest accounting. Judgment is ordered against the defendants for $3,509.74, and interest thereon from February 16, 1885, to April 8, 1889, and for $193.63, and interest from the same time, and for $72.50 and interest from June 9, 1885, to April 8, 1889, amounting to the time of trial to the sum of $4,714.04; said judgment to be entered against the defendant Peter Ferris personally, and against the defendant Abbie A. Prouty as sole executrix of Rodney Sargent, deceased, to be paid by due course of administration. Plaintiff is entitled to costs of this action, with an additional allowance of five per cent, upon the amount of the recovery aforesaid.

In addition to, but in harmony with, the views expressed by the trial court, the following suggestions are made:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">It seems to me that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to notify the sureties of the dishonesty of his guardian, in order to hold them to the obligation of their bond. They owed more than a passive duty. They should have seen to it that their principal discharged his duty. If they neglected it, they did so at their peril. <em>Forrester </em>v. <em>State, </em>41 Md. 161; <em>Gillett </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>126 Ill. 310, 327, 328, 19 N. E. Rep. 287. A guardian\u2019s duty does not end as soon as his ward becomes of age. He must then make a settlement with his ward, and honestly,account and pay over what is coming to him; and the sureties are responsible that he does so. I cannot assent to the idea that because, when the ward became of age, he has legal capacity to act for himself, the sureties are no longer responsible for the transactions between himself and his guardian in settling the estate. One of the most important duties the guardian owes to his ward is an honest accounting and settlement with him, and that necessarily cannot take place until he is of age; and, instead of being in any sense released by the transactions of the ward with his guardian, it seems to me it is just the time when, if ever, the sureties owe an active duty to see that their principal acts\u2014as they have bound themselves he would act\u2014as an honest man. In my opinion the defendants are in a somewhat different position from' an indorser upon a note or a guarantor of a bond, or any surety who merely binds himself to pay a sum of money or ful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>fill a contract if his principal does not. Here the sureties guaranty the fidelity \u2022and honesty of the guardian. The obligation is that the principal \u201c shall \u25a0well and faithfully, in all things, discharge the duty of guardian.\u201d If he Tails in that, they are responsible for the damages the ward suffers through That lack of fidelity. It is something more than warranting his pecuniary \u00a1responsibility, where, if he does comply with his contract to pay, and the 'creditor by his delay suffers him to become impecunious, so that the sureties \u25a0cannot collect from him, the creditor by his loches has placed the sureties in a position where they cannot make themselves good. Here, as we have seen, the bond was for fidelity and honesty. Acting promptly would not have made him honest. Delay has not made him any more dishonest than he was before.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Honesty and fidelity are the main things guarantied, not pecuniary responsibility. But, even upon the ground of delay, I do not see that the defendants have any sufficient reason to be released. The delay caused by the legal proceedings cannot be considered on the question of loches. Laches \u00abcan only be predicated upon the time that elapsed from the discovery of the fraud until the commencement of the suit against the principal. Ho inflexible rule can be laid down as to what constitutes loches. It depends upon the \u25a0circumstances in each particular case. The evidence in this case is not before us, but it is fairly to be inferred from the facts found that there were negotiations between the plaintiff and his guardian, and promises to pay by the guardian, so that the plaintiff was kept in constant hope and expectation of a settlement, and a part payment was made. Plaintiff first became aware of the fraud in Hovember, 1880, and immediately made demands upon his guardian for payment. This was promised, but not fulfilled, in February, 1882, a part payment was made, and, no further payment being made, in October, 1882, he commenced his action against his former guardian. I do \u00a1not think that the delay, under all the circumstances, constituted loches that would release the defendants. There was no extension of the guardian\u2019s time, or valid release of him, by the plaintiff, by which the plaintiff was prevented from prosecuting him upon his obligation to make an account. The fraud practiced vitiated the whole proceeding and settlement, so that it in no way acted as an extension of time or stay of proceedings. <em>Lowman </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>37 N. Y. 601. Mere indulgence or delay by the creditor to prosecute the principal debtor will not release the surety. <em>Albany Dutch Church </em>v. <em>Vedder, </em>14 Wend. 165; <em>Supervisors </em>v. <em>Otis, </em>62 N.

Low, upon his appointment as the general guardian of the plaintiff, William O. Douglass, by the surrogate of Essex county. The bond was dated on the 28th of March, 1872, and letters of guardianship were issued to the guardian on the 29th day of March, 1872. The plaintiff . arrived at the age of 21 years on the 26th day of March, 1879. On the 14th of May, 1879, after becoming 21 years of age, the plaintiff and his guardian had a voluntary settlement or accounting, and settled and fixed the amount of the guardian\u2019s liability to the plaintiff on account of such guardianship at the sum of $4,363.10, and the guardian thereupon paid to the plaintiff the sum of $1,163.10, leaving a balance due from the guardian to the plaintiff of the sum of $3,200, and in settlement or payment of that balance the guardian turned out to the plaintiff the promissory note of his insolvent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>brother, Charles W. Low, payable to the order of the plaintiff March 1, 1881, with semiannual interest, and a mortgage on real estate in the state of Illinois, executed by Charles W. Low to the plaintiff to secure the payment of the same, which mortgage was falsely and fraudulently represented by the guardian to be good security for the same. At the time of the consummation of the settlement, plaintiff gave to his attorney written authority to appear for him before the surrogate of Essex county, and discharge the guardian from all liability on account of such guardianship. Pursuant to such settlement and authority the guardian and attorney for the plaintiff so authorized and empowered by him, without personal notice to the plaintiff, on the 12th day of January, 1880, appeared before such surrogate, and such proceedings were thereupon had by and before him that a decree of final judicial settlement and accounting of such guardian\u2019s accounts were had, and the surrogate then and there, among other things, \u201cordered, adjudged, and decreed that said account be, and the.same hereby is, finally settled, as filed and adjusted, and it is further adjudged and decreed that nothing remains in the hands of said guardian, as such, or due from him to said ward.\u201d The decree was duly entered of record on that day in the office of the surrogate. The case shows that the real-estate mortgage given as collateral to the note taken by plaintiff on the settlement was not adequate security for the note, and that the plaintiff discovered that he had been defrauded in the settlement with his guardian, and that the mortgage and note were not security for the amount found due the plaintiff on that settlement, and the plaintiff in November, 1880, discovered that fact, and in February, 1882, the guardian seems to have conceded that fact, and then paid the plaintiff $800 on account of the $3,200, but failed to pay the balance,\" and in October of that year the plaintiff commenced an action in the supreme court for the same against the guardian, alleging the guardianship; the settlement between the plaintiff and guardian after plaintiff became of age; the amount found due from the guardian; the giving of the note and mortgage in satisfaction of the same; the decree of the surrogate thereon, discharging the guardian; alleging that the settlement was procured by fraud; and asking that the decree of the surrogate be vacated for fraud, and that the guardian be adjudged to pay the balance found due on the settlement. The defendant demurred to the complaint, and judgment was given for the plaintiff on the demurrer, which was affirmed on appeal, and judgment ordered against the guardian for the balance and costs. To recover that balance and the cost of that litigation the plaintiff brought this action against the sureties on the guardian\u2019s bond, and on the trial the plaintiff recovered judgment for the amount, the $3,200 and interest from date of settlement, less the $800 paid by the guardian after that date, and also the plaintiff\u2019s expense in the action against the guardian, and the cost of this action,\u2014in all, $5,555.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The first and perhaps most important question raised by the appellants on \u25a0this appeal is whether the sureties upon this bond are not discharged by the settlement of the plaintiff with the guardian after arriving at his majority, and accepting of the guardian, in satisfaction of his claim, the note and mortgage of Charles W. Low, payable nearly two years after the date of such settlement, upon which a decree discharging the guardian was entered by the surrogate. If the plaintiff by this settlement deprived the sureties of any of their legal advantages in protecting themselves from the obligation they assumed as sureties on this bond, to their prejudice, it is difficult to see how he can in this action enforce its obligation against them, for his own protection, and to the prejudice of the sureties. The capacity of the plaintiff to make a settlement with his guardian after becoming of age cannot be doubted, and it can hardly be claimed that the defendants by their bond undertook to protect the plaintiff from the consequences of his improvident dealings with his guardian after he is clothed by law with authority to act for himself, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>absence of any collusion between the sureties and the principal in the bond, unless by its terms the sureties contracted to protect the obligee against the consequences of his acts after arriving at his majority. The condition of this bond was: \u201cThat if the above-bound Edwin B. Low do and shall well' and faithfully, in all things, discharge the duty of guardian to the above-named minor, according to law, and render a just and true account of all moneys and property received by him, and of the application thereof, and if such guardian, in all respects, account to and before any court having cognizance thereof, when thereunto required, then the obligation to be void, otherwise to be and remain in full force and virtue.\u201d The obligation of the guardian was to account for all money and property, to and before any court having cognizance thereof; and that course would have afforded a complete protection to the ward, and to the sureties as well, and could at the time of making this voluntary settlement have been compelled by the plaintiff, or the sureties on this bond. The making of this voluntary settlement by the plaintiff with his guardian, and the entering of a decree thereunder and in purs fiance thereof, while the same was voidable for fraud, bound all the parties until re-, seinded, and thus suspended the right of the plaintiff and these sureties from any proceeding in court to compel an accounting by the guardian before the surrogate, as the decree <em>entered </em>in the matter was in that court, until vacated or reversed, a complete bar to any other proceeding in that court for an accounting. <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Soutter, </em>126 N. Y. 198, 27 N. E. Rep. 263. This settlement between plaintiff and his guardian was in May, 1879. In November, 1880, plaintiff knew of the alleged fraud, and waited until October, 1882, before he commenced his action against the guardian to set aside the accounting; and it does not appear that the defendants were apprised of any alleged1 fraud in the accounting, or in the manner in which the balance found due-the plaintiff was paid or secured, until September, 1885. During all that time the defendants, so Ear as this case discloses, had a right to rely upon the-recorded decree of this surrogate that the guardian had performed his whole duty, and was discharged from all liability to the plaintiff on account of such guardianship. The plaintiff having the power to make this settlement with his guardian, he, and he alone, had the power to rescind it for fraud; and the defendants in this action were powerless, and unable to take any steps against their principal in this bond, so long as this settlement remained unrevoked. During the interval between the making of this settlement and the rescission or revocation of the same the guardian, who was the principal in this bond, became insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">I am inclined to the opinion that this voluntary settlement with the guardian by the plaintiff so far affected the rights, powers, and privileges of the defendants as sureties on this bond as to, release them from all obligations te the plaintiff thereunder. By this settlement the right of the sureties to pay this balance to the plaintiff, and sue the principal, was clearly suspended during the period that this settlement and decree remained unrescinded and in force. This was such an interference with the rights of the defendants, as sureties on this bond, without- their knowledge or notice to them, as to release them from liability to the plaintiff. In <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>76 N. Y. 278, Danforth, J., in discussing this subject, says: \u201cThe holder of the security had notice of the deed and its covenants, and was bound by this relation to do nothing to affect or alter the right of the surety.\u201d In <em>Calvo </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>8 Hun, 222, the court says: \u201cThe rule is absolute that there shall be no transaction with the principal debtor without acquainting the person who has a part interest in it.\u201d In <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Cortesy, </em>100 N. Y. 132, 2 N. E. Rep. 874, it was held that the defendants, sued upon a guaranty, upon a bond and mortgage, were released from their obligation upon their guaranty by plaintiff\u2019s acceptanc\u00e9 of a chattel mortgage as additional security, and agreeing with the mortgagor, without the consent of the guarantors, to extend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>time o\u00a3 payment of the bond and mortgage, and although the chattel mortgage contained the usual danger clause, and authorized the mortgagee to foreclose it in case he deemed himself insecure, yet that did not defeat the operation of the extension of the real-estate mortgage; and Earl, J., says: \u201cIt gave no right to the defendants as sureties for the debt, and they could not, by virtue of that clause, pay the real-estate mortgage, and take an assignment thereof, and enforce the same before the extended time of payment had arrived; and, as the extension of time was thus effected against the sureties, it discharged them, notwithstanding the clause mentioned.\u201d <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Cortesy, </em>100 N. Y. 137, 2 N. E. Rep. 874. In <em>Calvo </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>73 N. Y. 218, Andrews, J., says: \u201cAnd the doctrine that a surety is discharged by dealings with the creditor and principal debtor, inconsistent with the rights off the surety, has been applied, although the creditor did not know, in the origin of the transaction, that one of the parties was a surety. \u201d In <em>Brinagar's Adm'r </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>1 B. Mon. 283, Marshall, J., states the rule as follows: \u201cTheplain principle to be deduced from the decisions is that the surety is released when by an agreement between the creditors and principal debtor, without his consent, his right to. compel the creditor to the immediate coercion of the debt from the principal, or, what is the same thing in effect, his right to make immediate payment to the creditor, and in his name and right to coerce payment from the principal, is impaired.\u201d The rule seems universal that when the \u2022surety is deprived by the act of the creditors and principal debtor, without his consent, of any right or remedy which he might otherwise have to protect himself from loss, he is thereby discharged from his liability to the creditor; and I find no case where that rule is relaxed by reason of fraud practiced upon the creditor by the principal debtor, when the creditor has .voluntarily, and without the consent or connivance of the surety, entered into contracts or speculations with the principal debtor not expressly provided for in the bond, and against which the surety has made no express guaranty. The contract of a surety being <em>strictissimi juris, </em>it cannot be enlarged or changed without his consent. <em>McCluskey </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>11 N. Y. 598. In <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Lowenberg, </em>120 N. Y. 44, 23 N. E. Rep. 978, the court says: \u201cThe rule is that a surety is entitled to a strict construction of the bond under which it is sought to make him liable, and that it cannot be enlarged by implication to cover anything which was not in contemplation of the parties at the time the bond was executed.\u201d <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>14 Barb. 123; <em>Barns </em>v. <em>Barrows, </em>61 N. Y. 39; <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Hyman, </em>107 N. Y. 562, 14 N. E. Rep. 447. Applying this rule to the case at bar, I do not see how the sureties on this bond can be held as liable for fraud practiced upon the plaintiff in transactions voluntarily entered into by him, not embraced in the provisions of the bond, and against which the bond furnishes no express guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The appellant also insists that the sureties on this bond are discharged by reason of the loches of the plaintiff in disaffirming and repudiating this settlement, for fraud, after the discovery by him of its existence. If this settlement had not delayed the defendants in enforcing their remedy against the principal, then the defendants could not urge the plaintiff\u2019s loches as an excuse for their failure to respond after the default of their principal. The-bond would then be a continuous obligation, and the sureties would at any time be liable for default of the principal, until barred by some statute of limitation. But when, by the act of the creditor and principal debtor, the sureties are delayed or hindered in their ability to protect themselves from loss, then the loches of the creditors to restore them to their original rights would furnish good grounds for their discharge. In <em>McMurray </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>72 N. Y. 523, the guarantor of the mortgage was held to be released by the loches of the holder of the same, in delaying foreclosure for 14 months after the same became due, when at the time of its maturity the property was good security, but before foreclosure it became worthless, by destruction by fire. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>Craig </em>v. <em>Parkis, </em>40 N. Y. 181; <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>46 Iowa, 352; <em>Toles </em>v. <em>Adee, </em>91 N. Y. 562. And it has been held that long acquiescence by a ward in a settlement which was procured by the fraud of his guardian, practiced upon him, would relieve the sureties from liability. <em>Aaton </em>v. <em>Mendel, </em>78 Ky. 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">If we are right in the above conclusion, then there was no breach of the bond as to the sureties. They had not covenanted to protect the plaintiff against the fraud practiced by Edwin B. Low upon the plaintiff in a transaction between him and Low after he had arrived at full age; and while such fraud might and did restore the liability of Low to the plaintiff, growing out of that fraud, it did not, it seems to us, re-establish the liability of the sureties on his bond, as guardian, under the circumstances of this case', when, as we have seen, the plaintiff, by his own act and loches, had deprived the defendants of rights which they had and could have maintained against their principal but for the obstruction put in their way by the acts of the plaintiff, without their knowledge or consent. They assumed no such obligation in their bond, and cannot be held liable in this action unless, as is insisted by the plaintiff, their liability is established in the action by the plaintiff against the guardian, to which they were not parties, and in which they were in no way before the court, or called upon to defend. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Chalmers, </em>60 N. Y. 158, Church, C. J., says: \u201cIt is a familiar rule that sureties can only be charged when the case is brought within the very lines of the contract, <em>(Birckhead </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Hill, 635,) and the obligation of sureties is not to be extended by construction to embrace purposes and objects not contemplated by the parties.\u201d It would be going too far, I think, to hold that the sureties, when they signed this bond, had in contemplation the protection of the plaintiff against fraud practiced upon him when he voluntarily undertook to deal with his former guardian after he became of age, and in the eye of the law stood upon an equality with him, especially when for years he carried on a contract with him without their knowledge and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">But it is insisted that the defendants cannot now be heard to contest their liability in this action, as the judgment against their principal fixes their liability as sureties on this bond. The general doctrine is that a decree against the principal liquidates and fixes the amount of his liability, and affords <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the correctness of that amount in an action against the sureties; but I find no case which goes to the length of holding that the liability of the surety is so fixed that he cannot defend, where he has a good and valid defense to his liability upon the bond, especially where he is not a party to the action or proceeding in which the amount of the liability of the principal is settled. In <em>Annett </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>35 N. Y. 256, the court says: \u201cIt is true that the decree is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the' amount due from Ken,- and its recovery on his admission, arising from his default, binds the sureties, in the absence of fraud or collusion.\u201d But this case does not hold that the sureties are bound as to their liability on the bond, and concluded from making a defense to the same, if they have a valid defense thereto. In <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>87 N. Y. 575, the court says: \u201cThe sureties are bound because by their contract they are privy to the proceedings against the principal; and, when the principal is concluded, they in the absence of fraud or collusion, are concluded also. \u201d But that case did not arise when the sureties interposed an independent defense to the bond upon the merits. It can hardly be claimed that the defense of forgery of the names of the sureties, or their release by their principal, could not be set up by the persons sued as sureties on the bond, when the liability of the principal to the bond had been established in a separate action against him. In the interlocutory judgment in the action by the plaintiff against his guardian, these defendants were not before the court, and none of the questions raised by them on this trial were,- or could have been, raised on the trial of that demurreri The effect of over-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ruling the demurrer in that case was that the allegations of the complaint as to that defendant were true; and judgment, therefore,- went against him, establishing as to him the truth of the allegations of the complaint. In <em>Girvin </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>21 Hun, 318, cited by the respondent, the court held that the guardian and ward may settle the account as between themselves, and in that way dispense with an accounting in court; and upon that subject the court uses this language: \u201cAn accounting by the guardian serves to show the extent of his liability, but is not conclusive as to the sureties. If there is anything wrong about it, they can show it in their own defense.\u201d It is true that, where nothing has occurred that can operate as a release or discharge of the sureties, they may be deemed bound by a judgment against the principal, because by their contract they are deemed privies to the principal\u00bb <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>87 N. Y. 576. But this rule does not extend to cases where the same would operate as a fraud upon the sureties, or subject them, to liabilities from which they have been exonerated by the acts of the obligee in the bond, to which they have not assented. In this respect I think this case clearly distinguishable from the case of <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra*</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">I am therefore clearly of the opinion that the judgment in the action against the guardian in this case does not conclude the defendants in this action, if* as we have seen, they were discharged from their liability to the plaintiff by his voluntary acts or omissions after he arrived at his majority. That action* does not assume, in terms, to adjudicate the liability of these defendants as sureties, and while, as we have seen, it could, under certain circumstances* be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the extent of the liability of the sureties on the bond, I do not think that it is binding upon them in this case. There are other questions in the case, raised by the appellant, one of which is as to the extent of the liability of the defendant Ferris, and of Prouty as the personal representative of Sargent, if the defendants are liable in this action. But, from the view I have taken, these questions need not be discussed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">For the reason above stated, I think there should a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
