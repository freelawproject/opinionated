Mickle are entitled to the whole of the principal fund now in the hands of the plaintiff, as trustee, under the last will and testament of Rachel Miller, deceased, and that the defendant Lizzie Mickle, who was the third wife, and is the widow, of George B. Mickle, is not entitled to any portion thereof. The will of Rachel Miller, who died on the 7th of October, 1848, contained the following provisions; \u2018Fourthly. I give, devise, and bequeath to my grandson, George Benjamin Mickle, the income, rents, and profits of my store and lot of ground known as \u201cNumber One Hundred and Ten Water Street, \u201d in the city of New York, with its appurtenances, to be received by my said executors and trustees and applied to his use for and during his natural life. And I do order and direct that the legal estate, title, and interest in my said store and lot of ground number one hundred and ten Water street, so as aforesaid given to the said executors and trustees, shall cease and determine immediately upon the decease of- my grandson, George Benjamin; and I there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>upon give and devise the said store and lot of ground number one hundred and ten-Water street, in said city, to such person or persons as shall then be the heirs at law of my said grandson, respectively, in such parts, shares, and proportions as such heirs would have been then, respectively, entitled thereto and therein by law if my said grandson, George Benjamin, had been seised thereof in fee-simple at the time of his death as an inheritance on the part of his mother, and he had died intestate, and they had inherited the same from my said grandson. <em>Fifthly. </em>All the rest and residue of my estate, both real and persona], I give, devise, and bequeath as follows, to-wit: The rents, issues, dividends, interest, and profits of the said residue of my estate to be received by my said executors and trustees, and as to one-fourth thereof to be applied to the use of my said grandson, George Benjamin, for and during his natural life. And I do order and direct that the legal estate, title, and interest in the said one-fourth of the rest and residue of my estate, both real and personal, and the interest and profits thereof, so as aforesaid given to the said executors and trustess, to be applied to the use of my said grandson for life, as aforesaid, shall cease and determine immediately upon the decease of my said grandson, George Benjamin, and I thereupon, after his decease, give, devise, and bequeath all his said one-fourth part of the said rest and residue of the said trust-estate then being in the hands of my said executors and trustees, the survivor or survivors, of them, their heirs, legal representatives, or successors, to such person or persons as shall then be the heirs at law and next of kin of my said grandson, George Benjamin Mickle, respectively, in such shares and proportions as, having regard to the form in which said estate shall then exist, such heirs and next of kin would have been then, respectively, entitled thereto and therein by law if my said grandson had been seised thereof in fee-simple as an inheritance on the part of his mother, or possessor of the same, and he had died intestate, and they had inherited or become entitled thereto from my said grandson, George Benjamin Mickle.\u2019 The widow, Lizzie Mickle, cannot be considered either as an heir at law or as one of the next of kin of her husband. The cases of <em>Keteltas </em>v. Keteltas, 72 N. Y. 312; <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>67 N. Y. 387; <em>Luce </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>69 N. Y. 36; and <em>Tillman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>95 N. Y. 17,\u2014if there could have been any doubt upon this subject,\u2014are decisive of the question. In <em>Keteltas </em>v. <em>Keteltas. </em>72 N. Y. 312, the, provision in the will in question was as follows: \u2018I direct my executors to apportion, divide, and pay the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, after providing as above directed, to, between, and among my next of kin, according to the statute of the state of 27ew York now in force concerning the distribution of personal estates of intestates, in like manner as though I had died intestate.\u2019 Earl, J., said: * The primary object in construing wills is to ascertain the intention of the testator, * * * but the intention is not a matter of speculation or arbitrary conjecture. It is sought for in the language used, and when language or a certain collocation of words has once received judicial construction precedents are formed which are followed in later cases. It is a general rule of construction that when a testator uses technical words he is presumed to employ them in their legal sense. * * * The important words to be construed here are \u201cnext of kin.\u201d * * * There is nothing in the other clauses of the will which throw any light on this, and the language used in this must therefore be construed by itself. The objects of the testator\u2019s bounty in this clause were his next of kin, and there is nothing in the context which shows that he intended to include his widow. That she is therefore excluded is no longer an open question in this court. <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>67 N. Y. 387. * * *\u201d The claim was made there as here that the widow was included in the term \u201cnext of kin,\u201d and it was held there, after a review of many authorities, that as there was nothing in the context to show that the widow was intended to be included, the words \u201cnext of kin\u201d must have their primary meaning, and include only blood relations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>That case was subsequently followed in <em>Luce </em>v. Dunham, 69 N. Y. 36, where the residuary estate is disposed of in the following language: \u201cI give, devise, and bequeath, and do desire and will, that the same shall be divided among my heirs and next of kin in the same manner as it would be by the laws of the state of New York had I died intestate.\u201d The claim of the widow to share in the personal estate as one of the next of kin was again rejected. In both of these cases, also, it was held that the language used in connection with the words \u201cnext of kin,\u201d relating to the statute of distribution in case of intestacy, did not enlarge the meaning of these words. We can perceive no material distinction between the language used in those cases and that used in this.\u2019 In <em>Tillman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>95 N. Y. 17, personal estate was given to the heirs of a person named. Earl, J., said: \u2018In this state it has uniformly been held, when the question has arisen for consideration in the courts, so far as we are able to discover, that the word \u201cheirs,\u201d applied to the succession of personal estate, means \u201cnext of kin,\u201d and that the words \u201cnext of kin\u201d do not include a widow or husband of an' intestate.\u2019 After reviewing the cases above cited, Earl, J., continues: \u2018 These authorities, it seems to me, leave little more to be said. There is no reason for holding the word \u201cheirs,\u2019\u2019when applied to personal estate, has a broader or more comprehensive signification than the words \u201cnext of kin.\u201d \u2019 By the Code of Civil Procedure the term \u2018 next of kin \u2019 does not include a surviving husband or wife. See sections 1870, 2514. The case of <em>Betsinger </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>88 N. 495, does not determine th\u00e1t the term \u2018next of kin\u2019 primarily includes a widow. It held that those words, as used in the provision of the Revised Statutes, (2 Rev. St. p. 114, \u00a7 9,) authorizing the next of kin entitled to share in the distribution of the estate of a deceased person to commence an action against the executor or administrator, include the widow of the intestate. That the court did not hold, or intend to hold, that the widow would be included in the term \u2018next of kin\u2019 or \u2018 heir at law,\u2019 as ordinarily used in wills, statutes, or other written instruments, unless there was something in the context of the instrument under interpretation showing that such inclusion was intended, is apparent from the language used by Church, C. J., at pages 493', 494. I fail to discover any such intention from the perusal of the will of Mrs. Miller, and am therefore obliged to adhere to the authorities above cited. I have read the elaborate briefs presented by the counsel for Mrs. Mickle, but cannot accede to the proposition, which he seeks to maintain, that there is anything in the will which shows an intention on the part of the testatrix that the widow of George Benjamin Mickle should, either as \u2018 heir at law or next of kin,\u2019 upon his death, take any share in the property, real or personal, devised and bequeathed in trust for his use and benefit during his life. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment as demanded in his complaint, and the defendants, Andrew H. and George B. Mickle, are entitled to judgment awarding to them the whole of the principal estate. Counsel will prepare and hand in findings and a decree in accordance with these views.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b446-5\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

Y. 312. The able and exhaustive opinion of the learned judge at special term renders any further discussion of the question involved unnecessary, and for the reasons stated by him in his opinion the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Van Brunt, P.
