Defendants submitted certain proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the ruling of the court in respect thereto was in the following terms: \u201cEach of the within requests is to be marked \u2018Befused,\u2019 except so far as covered by the findings of fact and conclusions of law settled and signed by me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b833-11\">The Code of Civil Procedure provides as follows: Section 1023: \u201cBefore-the cause is finally submitted to the court or the referee, or within such time afterwards * <em>* * </em>as the court or referee allows, the attorneys for either party may submit in writing a statement of the facts which he deems established by the evidence, and of the rulings upon questions of law which he-desires the court or referee to make. * <em>* * </em>At or before the time when-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the decision or report is rendered, the court or the referee must note, in the margin of the statement, the manner in which each proposition has been disposed of, and must either file or return to the attorney the statement thus noted; but an omission so to do does not affect the validity of the decision or the report.\u201d Section 993: \u201cUpon the trial of an issue of fact by a referee, or by the court without a jury, a refusal to make any finding whatever upon a question of fact, where a request to find thereupon is seasonably make by \u2022either party, * * *. is a ruling upon a question of law, within the meaning of the last section. \u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b834-5\">Argued before Sedgwick, C.

The finding as to the plaintiff\u2019s fee in Pearl street was warranted by the evidence. If the learned trial judge erred in directing the requests presented to him to be marked \u201cRefused, except so far, \u201d etc., the defendants were not prejudiced by the error, for the findings asked were not material to the decision of the case, nor would they, if the request had been properly disposed of, have been beneficial to the party asking them. It was not error requiring reversal for the learned trial judge to act as he did, although he should properly have found upon the questions. <em>Callanan </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>107 N. <em>Y. </em>372, 14 N.
