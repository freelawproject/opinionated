The appeal is before us on the judgment roll alone, and hence the only0inquiry is whether the judgment can stand consistently with the facts found. If the contention of the appellants were merely that the findings of fact are insufficient to sustain the conclusions of law, then, in the absence of the evidence, we should presume that it was adequate to authorize inferences of fact necessary to support the judgment. But the position of the appellants being that the facts, as found, negative the conclusions of law, it follows inevitably that, in the event of such repugnancy, we have no alternative but to reverse\" the judgment. The test propounded by the law of this state for determining the validity of a transaction between \u25a0client and attorney, involving adverse interests, is as well established as it is \u25a0easy of application. Because of the fiduciary relation between the parties and tlie commanding position of the attorney, any dealing between them, in which the interest of the client may have been betrayed, is <em>prima facie </em>fraudulent and void; but the presumption is provisional only, and maybe \u25a0overcome by contrary proof. The burden is upon the attorney to adduce such evidence. But what is the evidence that will thus avail to repel the presumption against the transaction, and re-establish its validity? We answer, \u25a0such proof as demonstrates good faith and fair conduct on the part of the attorney, and free volition and intelligent action on the part of the client. If the attorney be guilty of no fraud or undue influence, and if the client, comprehending clearly the circumstances of the situation, be moved only by the impulses of his own will, the transaction, though in the event favorable to the attorney and unfavorable to the client, cannot be impugned, even in a court of equity. The principle is abundantly sustained by authority and illustrated in adjudged cases. <em>Whitehead </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>69 N. Y. 462; <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>37 N. Y. Super. Ct. 161; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Ring, </em>3 Abb. Dec. 210; <em>Post </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>26 Hun, 187; <em>Hitchings </em>v. <em>Van Brunt, </em>38 N. Y. 335, 342; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bemiss, </em>110 U. S. 42, 45, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441; <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>40 Barb. 521; <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>McConnel, </em>17 Ill. 148; <em>Wharton </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>20 Fla. 934; <em>Nesbit </em>v. <em>Lockman, </em>34 N. Y. 167; <em>Cowee </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>75 N. Y. 91, 100. In <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Barnes, supra, </em>an annuity by a client to an attorney was sustained upon proof that \u201call was fair, and that the client acted freely and understandingly. \u201d 24ote, p. 536. In <em>Post </em>v. <em>Mason, supra, </em>a legacy to a lawyer was upheld upon proof that \u201cthe testator acted with full knowledge of all the surrounding circumstances, and that the transaction was free from all .fraud and undue influence\u201d on the part of the attorney. In <em>Nesbit v. Lockman, supra, </em>the action was to set aside a gratuitous conveyance from a client to an attorney. The trial court found as a fact \u201cthat the assignment was a gift, freely and voluntarily made, without any fraud, deceit, or undue influence on the part of the donee, or advantage taken by reason of his business relations, and without suggestion or inducement on, his part, but of the \u25a0donor\u2019s own free will and purpose.\u201d On review, the court of appeals said: \u25a0\u201cThe presumption is against the propriety of the transaction, and the <em>onus </em>\u25a0of establishing the gift or bargain to have been fair, voluntary, and well understood rests upon the party dealing;\u201d but, the exigency being answered by *he proof, the judgment for the defendant was affirmed,-as a necessary legal -corollary from the facts found. The court added: \u201cThe English cases hold substantially the same doctrine, viz., that while a bargain between attorney and client is viewed with great jealousy and suspicion, and its entire fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ness must be shown by the party claiming the beneBt of it, there is no inexorable rule pronouncing its illegality. \u201d In a more recent <em>case(Cowee v. Cornell, supra) </em>the court of appeals lay down the rule thus: \u201cWhenever the relations between the contracting parties appear to be of such a character as to render it certain that they do not deal on terms of equality, but that either on the one side from superior knowledge of the matter derived from a fiduciary relation, or from overmastering influence, or on the other from weakness, dependence, or trust justifiably reposed, unfair advantage in a transaction is rendered probable, then the burden is shifted, the transaction is presumed void, and it is incumbent upon the stronger party to show affirmatively that no deception was practiced, no undue influence was used, and that all was fair, open, voluntary, and well understood.\u201d As in <em>Nesbit v. Lockman, supra, </em>the single and the decisive question is, do the facts found, by necessary inference of law, displace the presumption of invalidity attached to the transaction from the relation of the parties? In determining the effect of findings of fact, the defeated party is entitled, if they be conflicting, \u201cto the benefit of those most favorable to him, in aid of his exceptions to the conclusions of law. \u201d <em>Bonnell </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>89 N. Y. 122; <em>Schwinger </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>83 N. Y. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The learned trial judge found, as facts, that the conveyance to the defendant by the plaintiffs \u201cwas an absolute transfer, made without any condition whatsoever;\u201d that its consideration \u201cwas for professional services rendered by the defendant of the value of five hundred dollars;\u201d that the defendant \u201chad no notice of any fraudulent intent of the plaintiffs to defraud their creditors;\u201d \u201cthat no fraud was intended at the time of the deed by either the plaintiffs or the defendant;\u201d that \u201cthe deed to plaintiffs was not made to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors;\u201d that the defendant \u201cdid not participate in any fraud, if any, of the plaintiffs;\u201d that the defendant \u201cdid not intend, when he took the deed of the Tragmans, to hinder or delay their creditors;\u201d that \u201cno secret trust was intended to be created by the defendant in favor of the plaintiffs;\u201d that \u201cthe defendant, at the time of his purchase, used no threats or coercion or misrepresentations to the plaintiffs;\u201d that the sale by the plaintiffs to the defendant \u201cwas made with full knowledge of the situation of the properties and their value;\u201d that at the time of the conveyance \u201cthe defendant explained fully to the plaintiffs the situation of the properties, and his inability to secure any consideration from his creditors, and also the nature of his services and their value;\u201d \u201cthat the plaintiffs knew that the deed gave defendant the absolute title;\u201d that the deed \u201cwas explained by defendant to plaintiffs in Wiley\u2019s presence;\u201d that in the conveyance to defendant, plaintiffs \u201cacted freely and voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">While there is no specific finding that the consideration of the conveyance was adequate, that is the necessary deduction from all the facts. Among the conclusions of law the learned trial judge found that \u201cthe transactions between plaintiffs and defendant were honest, and in good faith, and free from actual fraud or imposition or undue influence on the part of the defendant;\u201d that \u201cthe deed was founded upon a good and valuable considerationand that \u201cit was not made with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors of the plaintiffs.\u201d From these findings it results, as an irresistible inference of law, that the conveyance to the defendant is unimpeachable, and his title to the property absolute and indefensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Another and an independent defense interposed by the answer, and established by the findings, of itself makes a recovery by plaintiffs a legal impossibility. Subsequently to the transaction of the sale and conveyance, the defendant, out of abundant caution, took from the plaintiffs a general and absolute release, as to which the learned trial judge found that it \u201cwas given to the defendant voluntarily, and without fear or compulsion,\u201d and that the defendant \u201cpracticed no deceit or fraud or used any force to obtain it;\u201d that it \u201c was sufficiently explained, \u201d and executed in the presence of a third per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>son; and that at the time of its execution the plaintiffs \u201chad full knowledge of all defendant\u2019s dealings with the properties. \u201d Surely, further argument is-not needful to showr that, in view of the findings, the judgment cannot stand-</p>\n<p id=\"AyS\">judgment reversed, and new trial, costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
