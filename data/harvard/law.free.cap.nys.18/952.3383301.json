Both questions were determined adversely to the appellants in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>18 N. Y. Supp. 132, (decided by the general term of this court in March last,) and the present does not appear to be distinguishable from that case. The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
