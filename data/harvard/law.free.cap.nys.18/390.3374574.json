If the title to the property had been acquired by the receiver subsequent to the attachment, then, by section 682 of the Code, he would have had a right to intervene, but, such not being the fact, no such right exists; the right of strangers to intervene being by the section of the Code limited to cases where interest in the property attached has been acquired from the defendant subsequent to its levy. No attachment against the defendant\u2019s property can affect in any way the right of the moving party here to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>obtain possession o\u00ed any property the title to which had vested in him prior to the levy of the attachment. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
