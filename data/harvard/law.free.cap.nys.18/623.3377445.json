It is conceded that to a great extent the rights of the parties are to be determined by two agreements entered into between them, one dated December 20,-1889, and the other July 1, 1890. They are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\u201cCharles W.

Bullitt, Esq., who shall have power to decide according to what he thinks just, and equitable between the parties,</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\u201c \u2018The Scranton Steel Company,</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201clW. W. Scranton, Prest.\u201d\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Under this July agreement, Hart &amp; Co. undertook to deliver the iron there-undelivered in monthly installments, the defendant to pay for each month\u2019s shipments at the rate of $18 per ton, or at market rates on account; settlements to be made on the 27 th of each month for the prior month\u2019s shipments* either in cash or in four months\u2019 paper, at the option of the defendant. Deliveries were made until March 9, 1891, which were paid for at the rate of $18 per ton except the deliveries of January, February, and March, 1891-Payment for the January deliveries became due February 27th, which was. demanded in March, and refused by the defendant, and thereafter this action, was commenced, at which time it is conceded that some 4,800 tons still remained undelivered under the contract. This latter fact of a failure to deliver the full quantity is sought to be made available as a ground of defense-to the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action at all, it being insisted that until the entire contract was completed no right of action could accrue. It seems to us that this question must be disposed of by a consideration as to whether, upon the evidence, the proof was sufficient to justify the conclusion reached by the referee that there was a breach of the contract first on the part of the defendant. The evidence shows that the defendant refused to-make the payments in accordance with the terms of the contract; but, notwithstanding this fact, it is insisted that at most the plaintiff could only maintain an action for the amount then due for iron actually delivered, ancfe could not maintain an action such as this involving a repudiation of the entire contract. It would be a strange rule of law, and one for which we think, no support can be found, to hold that for the purpose of justifying defendant\u2019s breach of its contract a construction should be placed thereon which, by making each monthly delivery a separate and independent contract, would render it necessary for the plaintiff\u2019s assignor to show that he had made each month thereafter a full delivery of the iron contracted for before he could maintain an action thereon, notwithstanding that during this same period the defendant absolutely refused to make any payments of any kind until it. got what it wanted, and was insisting upon, viz., a release from some part, of its obligations under the contract, We think the law to be settled that no one is required to go on delivering goods after he has been notified by the purchaser that he will not pay for them at the agreed price at the end of the contract. This was practically the defendant\u2019s position, and in taking that position it repudiated the contract, and the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was not thereafter required, for the purpose of enforcing his rights thereunder, to continue deliveries when he had been notified that he would not be paid therefor. This consideration, we think, disposes of the question presented by the appellant as to the action having been prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">It is insisted, however, that, even if the action could be brought if any amount was due, nothing appears to have been due under the contract- in any event. This contention is predicated upon the theory that the contract, by its terms, provides that the difference between the price of $18 per ton and. the market price of iron should be adjusted at the termination of the contract,, and, as the referee found as a fact that no difference existed between the mar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>5ket price and $18 per ton, that, therefore, the plaintiff has been paid in full. If the appellant was right in its facts that the contract was one by the terms of which the difference between the price paid of $18 a ton and the market price should be adjusted at the termination of the contract, then, no difference -appearing, no damages would result by reason of the breach. In this, how-over, the appellant seeks to take advantage of a mistake occurring in the drawing of the July agreement, in which the words \u201cmarket price\u201d were inserted Snstead of the words \u201ccontract price.\u201d Ho question could arise but that, had the July agreement said \u201ccontract price\u201d instead of \u201cmarket price,\u201d there \u2022would be no room for controversy in reference to the conclusions reached by the learned referee. Having, however, on satisfactory evidence, reached the conclusion that the insertion of the words \u201c market price\u201d was the result of a mistake, he was justified in awarding a judgment determining the rights of \u2022the parties according to the agreement entered into between them as really and actually made. This consideration of the mistake resulting from the insertion of the words \u201cmarket price\u201d instead of \u201ccontract price\u201d presents the question mostly relied upon by the \u00e1ppellant, and upon the solution of which' the judgment must stand or fall. The right to allow an amendment of the \u2022complaint, which was attempted upon the trial, so as to permit a reformation of the contract, and the exceptions taken to the evidence presented on the part of the plaintiff to prove the evidence of the mistake so as to make it a basis for reforming the contract, are the questions most pressed upon our attention by the appellant. It insists that the privilege granted of amending the complaint was improperly given, and that the testimony offered relative to the proceedings had before the arbitrator was irrelevant and incompetent, as were the negotiations which led, and were prior, to the July contract, all of which were admitted in evidence over the defendant\u2019s objection. By reference to the judgment in this case it wilhbe seen that it has not been adjudged that the contract should be reformed. Regarding, therefore, the action as having been brought upon the original contract, and upon the facts stated in the complaint as it stood prior to the trial, it remains to be determined whether the objections taken to the admissibility of the evidence already referred to was error requiring a reversal of the judgment. We think that, whether the effect of the decision of Mr. Bullitt, the arbitrator, was to terminate the agreement of July, and restore the parties at once to their original rights and liabilities under the December contract, or to leave the July agreement in full force, merely determining in advance upon what basis final settlement should be made, in either case the defendant\u2019s repudiation of that decision and refusal to perform any more of its obligations until the plaintiff\u2019s assignor should consent to forego some of his legal rights gave the plaintiff\u2019s assignor an immediate right of action for the full value of the original or modified contract, as the case may be; the two values being in this case, and under the decision of the arbitrator, identical. If, \u2018however, in determining the theory upon which the plaintiff\u2019s action could be predicated, we leave out of consideration for the time being the effect of the modified agreement, whether repudiated or not, \u2022we think it will be found that it can be sustained by a pleading of the original contract. For-breach of this a recovery could be had, unless some defense \u25a0was interposed which would destroy its force and effect. This was substantially the view and position taken by the appellant in formulating the pleading which submitted the questions to the court for determination. The agreement of July was pleaded as an affirmative defense to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. It was therefore proper for the plaintiff to show any fact, such as want of consideration going to show its invalidity, or any fact such as fraud or mistake going to show-that it was or ought to be made, in whole or in part, different from its form and effect as pleaded, and this would be clearly admissible by way of reply. It will be noticed that to the evidence offered as to the correction of the July agreement no objection, based on the state of the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ings, was taken, nor do we think that any such objection would lie. What was awarded to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was his rights under the original contract, and proof of the award under the July agreement and its repudiation was therefore competent and admissible by way of reply. In other words, the plaintiff having declared upon his contract, and the defendant having set up a modification of that contract, the plaintiff was entitled to reply by showing a restoration of the original contract after modification; and this, whether the restoration was the direct effect of the award as expressed by its terms, or the indirect effect through the termination or extinguishment by the award of the July agreement. We do not think, therefore, that any amendment of the complaint was necessary, and, although it appears to have been allowed, as stated, to conform the pleadings to the proof, as this error, if error it can be called, was not carried into force and effect by the judgment, it cannot be available for the purpose of reversing the judgment. Nearly all the objections to the rulings made by the learned referee were predicated upon the theory that the testimony was offered for the purpose of supporting the complaint as thus amended. But if we disregard such amendment, and view the case as though the same had not been made, then, as we have seen, the case is presented of a right predicated upon the original contract, the force and effect of which is sought to be destroyed by the modified agreement, and then by way of reply the plaintiff introduced evidence showing that by reason of the mistake made in the drafting of this modified agreement it was not entitled to the force and effect which the appellant in its defense sought to have attributed to it. As evidence to support a reply, the testimony objected to was clearly competent. There are some other exceptions which have been referred to upon the appellant\u2019s brief, but, after examination, we do not regard them as of sufficient importance to justify a reversal of a judgment such as this, which, by testimony sufficiently clear and satisfactory, establishes the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the amount which has been adjudged by the referee. We are of opinion, therefore, that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Ingraham, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b663-6\">Van Brunt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmO-\">I dissent.
