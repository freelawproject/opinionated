Of course, under such circumstances, a judge has no opportunity to answer insinuations of this character, and consequently no such right of challenge is or should be recognized by the law. What amounts to a disqualification to act as a judicial officer and a surrogate is carefully defined by statute, and beyond that it is a matter of discretion with a judge whether he will act in a given case or not. But it is his duty to proceed with the trial of a cause, unless he is himself satisfied that he should not do so. It rests entirely in the discretion of the surrogate whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>he will or not remit proceedings to the court of common pleas for trial, and with that discretion this court has neither power nor inclination to interfere. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
