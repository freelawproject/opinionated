The order does not provide for the trial of that issue. The action is for an accounting, and, in disposing of the action, the taking and stating of the account is necessary, and a case is thus presented which the court has the power to refer. Upon such a reference all the issues should have been referred; and as it appears from the terms of the order that the reference was \u201cto take proof of the matters set forth in the pleadings, and take and state the account of the defendant, Thos. B. Knox, as assignee, \u201d instead of providing for the trial of the issues in addition to the account, the order should be modified by inserting, in lieu of the words, \u201cto take proof of the matters set forth in the pleadings,\u201d the words, \u201cto hear and determine the issues in the action, and to take and state the account,\u201d etc. The order, as so modified, should be affirmed, without costs to either party on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
