In the case at bar the relator was accused of drunkenness, and the strong preponderance of evidence seems to have been in favor of that conclusion. The excuse made by the relator, that he became intoxicated by taking the prescription of a doctor, does not seem to be at all substantiated by the evidence; his own physician being called as a witness, and virtually testifying that those things which the relator admitted having done would not account for the condition in which he undoubtedly was at the time in question. There was therefore no preponderance of evidence against the conclusion arrived at by the respondents on the trial, but on the contrary the weight of evidence seems to be in accordance with such conclusion. The writ should be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
