The actions are on notes \u25a0delivered to the Homestead Bank for advances made to complete certain buildings. Consideration having been advanced on the notes, they became negotiable property, and as such transferable'by delivery. They were so transferred to the plaintiff, presumably for value and before maturity, and the plaintiff became entitled to recover on them. The matters pleaded in defense, \u2022and attempted to be proved, whether regarded as an agreement to renew the notes, (1 City Ct. It. 264,) or as an agreement by the bank to loan additional moneys, constituted neither a defense nor counter-claim to the notes in suit; and the verdicts ordered in favor of the plaintiffs were rightly directed, and \u2022the judgments entered on them must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
