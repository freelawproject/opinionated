A copy was procured and used as stipulated. Afterwards an order was entered confirming the report of the commissioners, which provided, among other things, that respondent be paid by petitioner the costs of these proceedings to be taxed. The clerk, in taxing the costs pursuant to such order, disallowed various items, among which was one for $19.80, expense of a copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes of the testimony in the superior court action. By a subsequent order the disallowance by the taxing clerk of such item was reversed, and $19.80 expenses therefor added.</summary>\n<seealso data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"b935-11\">For former report, see 13 N.

They were procured under an order of that court which provided that each party pay one half of the stenographer\u2019s fees, and that \u25a0\u201cthe successful party may tax the sum to be paid as a part of the costs of the action.\u201d Some seven weeks after the procurement of these minutes in the manner indicated, a stipulation was entered into in this proceeding that either party might read therefrom, before the commissioners, any of the testimony thus taken in the superior court action. There was, however, no stipulation or further order with regard to the taxation in this proceeding of the disbursement so made. As this disbursement had no relation to the present proceeding, and as its taxation was provided for in the superior court action, it clearly should not be here allowed, and the order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with costs and disbursements, and the clerk\u2019s taxation affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
