' Por the jury found, upon adequate evidence, that the servant\u2014plaintiff\u2019s assignor\u2014did in fact perform his duties to the satisfaction of the defendants, the masters, and that they dismissed him only because \u201cbusiness was dull,\u201d and \u201cthey could not afford to go on with the contract.\u201d Hone of the citations sustains the proposition-upon which appellants must rely for reversal of the judgment, namely, that-although an employe perform the condition, by breach of which only his employment may determine before expiration of its stipulated period, he may be-discharged meantime at the will of the employer. The proposition is a self-evident absurdity. But appellants say that the verdict, finding the fact of the-satisfactory performance of his duties by the employe, is against the weight of evidence. The jury thought otherwise; and, if we have the power, we are not inclined to disturb their decision, unless it be palpably contrary to reason and right, which is not the case. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
