The action concerned only the last installment of 150 shares. The defense was that the work has never been turned over and accepted by the company. The reply to this is satisfactory. Before the works had been accepted by the company, the testator in his lifetime, before the completion of his contract, assigned it to a third party with the approval of the company, that at the same time released Lockwood, defendant\u2019s testator. On the face of the contract, and from extrinsic circumstances, it appears that the acceptance was referred to only as a date or time of payment. The testator was responsible solely, so far as appears, for the acceptance never taking place. He could not by his own act dissolve the obligation of the contract, and his executor remain liable upon it. The plaintiff was present at the meeting of the directors who released Lockwood from the contract, but he did not vote for or promote in any way the assent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>company to Lockwood\u2019s assignment of the company or his release. Nothing shows any assent on his part to the course taken by Lockwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Defendants\u2019 exception overruled, and judgment ordered for plaintiff on verdict, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
