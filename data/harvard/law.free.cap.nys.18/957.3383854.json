The plaintiff\u2019s attorney, when the subject was first spoken of, said he would insert like matter in behalf of defendants. \u25a0 The defendants\u2019 attorney afterwards filed that matter, and it was made part of the judgment roll. For this reason the order must be affirmed. The refusal, of course, to print the matter referred \u25a0to, was within the discretion of the court. Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
