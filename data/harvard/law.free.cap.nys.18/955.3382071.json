The judgment allows defendants to pay to plaintiffs the sum of $11,500, with interest from the date of the entry of judgment, in avoidance of the injunction; and it also awards to the plaintiffs the sum of $2,070 for past damages sustained from March 22, 1889-, to the date of the trial, with interest from the date of the trial to the date of the entry of the judgment, together with $480.18, costs, extra allowance, and disbursements. The case seems to have been carefully tried, and we find no errors in the admission or exclusion of testimony that call for a reversal of the judgment. The evidence fairly sustains the findings of the referee, and justifies the judgment. It therefore follows that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
