The only application mentioned in the section is the application made by the defendant, upon notice to the plaintiff, either to be discharged from custody if he has already been taken under a mandate against him in such action, or, if he has not yet been imprisoned, to be relieved from imprisonment by virtue of such mandate; and the provision that the court should grant the order unless reasonable cause is shown applies to this application, whether made to discharge him from arrest, if in custody, or to relieve him from arrest if not in custody. We think, therefore, that it was the duty of the court below to consider whether reasonable cause was shown why the defendant\u2019s application should not be granted, and we concur in the conclusion that in this case reasonable cause was shown, and that the application was properly denied. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
