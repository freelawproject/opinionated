The case seems to have been carefully tried by the learned referee, and we find no errors in the admission Or rejection of evidence that require a reversal of the judgment. The evidence fairly sustains the findings of the referee, and warrants the judgment. It therefore follows that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
