It says that a defendant may require security for costs to be given where the plaintiff was, when the action was commenced, (subdivision 5,) an infant whose guardian <em>ad litem </em>had not given such security, except as otherwise provided in sections 459 and 469 of the act. These sections refer to the right of an infant to obtain leave to prosecute as a poor person. As in this case it did not appear that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>had filed security for cost, or that the plaintiff had obtained leave to.sue as a poor person, the defendant\u2019s motion should have been granted. The order appealed from is reversed, and defendant\u2019s motion below granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
