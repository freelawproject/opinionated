We have held in the case of <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Delano, </em>18 N. Y. Supp. 700, (action No. 1, decided herewith,) that the description in these two deeds includes the road in front of the premises conveyed, and that, therefore, the plaintiff showed no title in the property, and the complaint should have been dismissed for the reasons stated in that opinion. The judgment in this case must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
