Y. 415, 417; <em>Lloyd, </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>51 N. Y. 124, 132. But that is not this case. The plaintiff does not allege an employment, but that he acted as broker, with the owner\u2019s \u201cknowledge and consent, \u201d and this was the issue tried. The judge properly sent the question to the jury, telling them, in substance, that, if the defendant had \u201cconscious knowledge that the plaintiff had acted as broker before the agreement was consummated, he was liable, otherwise not.\u201d On the issue raised and tried, we find no error in the charge, nor in the rulings of the trial judge, and the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
