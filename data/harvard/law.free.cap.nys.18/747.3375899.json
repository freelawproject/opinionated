Plaintiff had never been in possession, but defendant, as executor or trustee, was in possession claiming ownership. It appeared that plaintiff\u2019s title to the premises was that of mortgagee to secure certain amounts which he claimed to be due, but a dispute existed as to the amount actually due him. <em>Held, </em>that it was no abuse of discretion to refuse to appoint a receiver of such rents and profits.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b783-9\">Appeal from special term, Hew York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b783-10\">Action by Mitchel Valentine against Welhelmine Juch for an accounting of the rents and profits of certain real estate.

It appears by the plaintiff's affidavit that he stands ready to transfer the title to any person designated by the executors of Juch upon receipt of. the amount claimed to be due to him. A dispute exists as to what is actually due him, and, in this state of the controversy, it is suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>that the questions should be resolved in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, and in advance of any determination in the accounting which plaintiff seeks, that he should disturb the possession and take from the defendant the rights which were conferred upon her, either as the representative of the estate, or, as is claimed by the plaintiff, as his agent, by the appointment of a receiver. Upon this state of facts, it is clear that, at least, a question was presented, even &gt;f we assume that it was a case in which a receiver could be appointed, for the exercise of discretion; and we are unable to conclude, after an examination of the facts disclosed by the record, that there was an abuse of such discretion. We think, therefore, that the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
