While the property was in the possession of Wolff he mortgaged the property to the defendant, who subsequently foreclosed his mortgage and disposed of the fixtures, thereby making himself liable to the plaintiff in trover as for conversion. <em>Lempke </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>1 City Ct. R. 15. The defense is that the defendant had no knowledge of the conditional agreement under which Wolff held the property, and that the plaintiff having neglected to file such agreement, \u201c with the conditions and reservations therein,\u201d those providing that title to the fixtures, should remain in the plaintiff until they were paid for became inoperative and void. Laws 1884, c. 315.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There would beforcein this objection butfor the fact that the act cited does not apply to \u201chousehold goods,\u201d (Laws 1885, c. 488; Laws 1886, c. 495 ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and \u201cgas fixtures\u201d are \u201c household goods, \u201d within the proper meaning of that term. They are sometimes comprehended by the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>term \u201cfurniture,\u201d which means \u201cthat which'furnishes or whatever is added to the interior of a house for use or convenience,\u201d <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>27 Ind. 179; <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>49 Conn. 491; Burrill, Law Dict. p. 33,) and includes brass-work, knobs, window shutters, etc., (Wore. Dict.) In <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Lenke, </em>1 Daly, 487, \u201cgas fixtures\u201d are included in the terms \u201carticles of furniture movable in their nature, \u201d although attached by screws, nails, brackets, etc. See, also, <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>1 Duer, 363; <em>McKeage </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>16 Hun, 239, affirmed 81 N. Y. 38. In <em>Carnagy </em>v. <em>Woodcock, </em>2 Munf. 234, the phrase \u201chousehold goods\u201d is defined as more comprehensive than \u201cfurniture,\u201d including everything in and about the house that has usually been held and enjoyed therewith, and would tend to the comfort and accommodation of the householder. See, also, 9 Amer. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 782, note 3; <em>Paton </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>10 Sim. 186; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>2 Smal. &amp; G. 284. The expression \u201chousehold goods\u201d includes every article of personal property in the house or on the premises intended fqr ornament, use, or consumption, (Da<em>yton </em>v. <em>Tillou, </em>1 Bob. N. Y. 21,) even coal and wood provided for the use of the family, <em>(In re Fraser, </em>92 N. Y. 239.) These articles do not lose their generic character by being placed in a saloon or store, unless the intention to exclude them from the operation of the term \u201chousehold goods\u201d is made apparent, and that is not so here. It is the species of property, rather than the temporary use made of it, that determines its true character under the statute. So considered, it follows that \u201cgas fixtures\u201d are, by force of the acts of 1885 and 1886, <em>supra, </em>taken out of the operation of the act- of 1884, <em>supra, </em>requiring conditional sale agreements to be filed. The acts of 1885 and 1886 were passed in the interest of those who sell \u201chousehold goods\u201d on the installment plan, and must be liberally construed to effectuate their purpose. The objection that a duplicate copy of the agreement was not delivered to Wolff was not made at the trial, when it might have been obviated, and cannot be raised for the first time now. Oases cited <em>in Furguson </em>v. <em>Investment Co., </em>(City Ct. N. Y.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 738. If the construction aforesaid be correct, the verdict in favor of the plaintiff was properly directed, and the motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-13\"> Laws 1886, c. 495, provides that the act of 1884 \u201cshall not apply to household goods t * * provided, that the contract for the sale of the same be executed in duplicate,, and one duplicate shall be delivered to the purchaser. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
