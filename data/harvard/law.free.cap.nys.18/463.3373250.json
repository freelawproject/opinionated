But, as judgment was directed on the pleadings, there is, in truth, no question of fact in controversy; and the only point for adjudication is whether the answer raised any issue for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">1. The complaint contains the averment that the-plaintiff was and is \u201cai domestic corporation,\u201d etc. The answer alleges merely that the defendant \u201chas no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the plaintiff being a domestic corporation.\u201d As a general rule of pleading under the-Code, it is a sufficient denial to aver that the defendant \u201chas no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief\u201d as to the fact traversed; but the rude-is qualified by section 1776, which provides that \u201cin an action brought by a. corporation, the plaintiff need not prove, upon the trial, the existence of the-corporation, unless the answer is verified, and contains an affirmative allegation that the plaintiff is not a corporation.\u201d Plainly, the answer here dispensed with proof of plaintiff\u2019s incorporation. <em>Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Hepworth, </em>13 Civil Proc. R. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">2. The complaint alleges a specific agreement, and that under it the sum. became due for which judgment is' recovered. The answer does not deny that agreement; but sets up another and different agreement, under which a. less sum is due, and for that sum makes an offer of judgment. By the Code-(section 500) an answer must consist of a general or specific denial of each material allegation of the complaint, or a statement of new matter constituting a defense or counter-claim. A statement in an answer of a condition off fact inconsistent with the averments of t\u2018he complaint is not equivalent to a general denial, so \"as to defeat an admission of the allegations in the complaint. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>21 Barb. 190; <em>West </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>44 Barb. 176; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>3 Hun, 285, 286; <em>Swinburne </em>v. <em>Stockwell, </em>58 How. Pr. 312; <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>66 N. Y. 206, 210; <em>Fleischmann </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>90 N. Y. 110. The cause of action presented in the complaint, being confessed by non-denial, was not open to traverse or contrary proof on the trial. <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>38 N. Y. 31. The mere allegation in the answer that defendant was-indebted a hundred dollars, \u201cand no more,\u201d by virtue of the contract which he set up, is no qualification of his admission that he was owing $400 under the contract on which the action proceeded. Defendant\u2019s admission of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for $400, \"and his own voluntary confession of indebtedness for $100 on another and different contract, would seem to entitle plaintiff to judgment for $500, instead of operating in any way to defeat or reduce the judgment recovered. The case was properly disposed of below;., and the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
