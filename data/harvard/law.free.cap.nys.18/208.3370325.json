The referee refused'to find, at the request of defendant\u2019s attorney, that the sum fixed, if any, to be paid as an alternative for avoiding the injunction, shall not include damages to be caused in the future by the running of trains, <em>i. e., </em>include the damages to be caused in the future by noise, dirt, cinders, steam, smoke, and odors incidental to the operation of the trains in the future. The learned referee was correct in his action. The running of trains in the future would be a taking of plaintiff\u2019s easement. As to the damages to be caused in the future, the request was at least partly invalid. For, conceding that the effect of noise would not be a lessening of the easement, certain of the other particulars would be. \u201cSmoke and gas, ashes and cinders, affect and impair the easement of air. The structure itself and the passage of cars lessen the easement of light, \u201d etc. <em>Drucker Case, </em>106 N. Y. 157, 12 N. E. Rep. 568; <em>American Bank-Note Co. </em>v. <em>New York El. Ry. Co., </em>29 N. E. Rep. 302, (Dec. 15, 1891.) The referee did not include the effect of noise in his estimation of the value of plaintiff\u2019s easement. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
