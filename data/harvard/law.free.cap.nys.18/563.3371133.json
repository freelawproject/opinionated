Whitney against Imogene F. Orr, on a contract -made by defendant\u2019s husband in her name. Plaintiff offered evidence to \u2022show that the contract and a note made in consideration thereof were ratified by a person purporting to be defendant, whom he found at the husband\u2019s place of business during his absence. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AXE\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b599-9\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

Orr, to act for her, or make any contract for her. It does not appear that the contract for the work, to recover for which this action was brought, was made in her name, and there is no evidence to justify the finding that the defendant ever signed the note given for the work done by the plaintiff\u2019s as\u25a0signor for printing a prior number of the Gazette, or that the person with whom the plaintiff had the interview at the office, No. 120 Broadway, in relation to the note given for the work done on the prior number, was the defendant in this action. The plaintiff failed, in any way, to connect the defendant with the business carried on at 120 Broadway, or with the publishing of the periodical, or with the work in question. We think, therefore, that the evidence was insufficient to justify the court in directing a verdict for the plaintiff. The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs -to the appellant, to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
