The defendant commenced an action against one Blake as principal, and the complainant as bis trustee, returnable to tbe term of tbe court of common pleas liolden on tbe third Tuesday of August, 1845, and caused the writ to be duly served upon the principal and upon the complainant. Early in the morning of the first day of the term, before the hour of court, the present defendant called at the residence of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>plainant, and was informed by him that he was not indebted to said Blake; and, becoming satisfied that the trustee was not liable, the defendant told the trustee that he should not enter the action against him, and that he would discharge the action as to the trustee, without cost, which discharge the trustee declined to receive, unless the defendant would pay him costs. The defendant thereupon made and executed a written discharge \u2014 discharging and releasing the trustee from all liability, as such trustee; and offered to deliver it to him, and he declined receiving it. This defendant then told him he should not enter the action against the trustee, and laid said discharge upon a board for the trustee, and left it there. The trustee was at the time engaged in his business at home, but afterward went to the court house, and for his fees for travel and attendance, filed the complaint in this case; the defendant not having entered his action against the trustee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-5\">Hibbard, for the complainant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWiC\">If the party proceeded against incurs costs preparatory, he should have them in such a case as this.

But such are not cases for the court, who cannot discriminate between those in which the parties may, and those in which they may not, with good reason, insist upon their legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">There may be cases in which the party sued might have good cause for distrusting the promise of the plaintiff not to enter his action; and cases in which the consequences of the violation of confidence reposed might be very disastrous and wholly remediless, through the inability of the party guilty of it to respond in damages to which the other would be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">It might have been very unreasonable in this party to disbelieve Mr. Goodall, but he must stand in court like parties less worthy to be trusted. \"We cannot estimate the considerations that should prevail to inspire confidence or to cause distrust; or that might induce one, in special cases, to forego the sure and obvious measures to make himself safe against the consequences of a process that has been legally served upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The complainant having brought himself within the statute \u2014 for a trustee is in our practice regarded as a defendant \u2014 must have</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\n<em>Judgment for costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
