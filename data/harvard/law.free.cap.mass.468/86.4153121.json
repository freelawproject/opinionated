At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the time of the fall, early in the evening of February 10, 2011, Wilkins was on the city\u2019s premises to attend a scheduled parent-teacher conference. Wilkins filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the city alleging that its negligence caused her injuries. In its motion for summary judgment, the city raised as a defense G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, which bars claims of ordinary negligence against a landowner, including a government entity, that has opened its land to the public for recreational, educational, or other enumerated purposes, without charging a fee. A Superior Court judge allowed the city\u2019s motion; Wilkins appealed, and we allowed her application for direct appellate review. Because we conclude that the limitation on liability provided by G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, extends solely to land open to the general public, and during the relevant time the school was open only to a discrete group and not to the general public, we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>HipSaver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kiel, </em>464 Mass. 517, 522 (2013). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002). We review a grant of summary judgment de nova. <em>HipSaver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kiel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">b. <em>Public use statute. </em>This case requires us to interpret the scope of the public use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWe interpret a statute according to \u2018all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kindred Healthcare, Inc., </em>466 Mass. 779, 783 (2014), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In relevant part, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C <em>(a), </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">\u201cAny person having an interest in land including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>structures, buildings, and equipment attached to the land . . . who lawfully permits the public to use such land for recreational, conservation, scientific, educational, environmental, ecological, research, religious, or charitable purposes without imposing a charge or fee therefor, . . . shall not be liable for personal injuries or property damage sustained by such members of the public . . . while on said land in the absence of wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct by such person.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The city argues that Wilkins\u2019s claim is barred because she is \u201ca member of the public\u201d and her attendance at a parent-teacher conference qualifies as an \u201ceducational\u201d purpose within the meaning of the statute. The city concedes that the school was not open to the general public at the time of Wilkins\u2019s fall, but asserts that by holding parent-teacher conferences that are open to a part of the community \u2022\u2014 parents of students enrolled at the school \u2014 it has met the statute\u2019s threshold requirement that the landowner permit use of the land by \u201cthe public.\u201d See G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C <em>(a). </em>We do not agree that admission by such a delimited group meets the statute\u2019s threshold requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cthe public\u201d connotes broad public access and contemplates access by members of the community as a whole. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1348 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201cpublic\u201d when used as noun as \u201c[t]he people of a nation or community as a whole\u201d); Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 952 (1991) (\u201cpublic\u201d means \u201cthe people as a whole\u201d). See also <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 732 (1943) (college did not serve meals to \u201cthe public\u201d for purposes of tax statute where dining accommodations were \u201crestricted to a small, well defined number of classes\u201d). Without establishing a general rule, a number of prior appellate decisions have indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>to be entitled to the public use statute\u2019s immunity from claims of ordinary negligence, a landowner must permit all members of the general public to have free and equal access to the land for one or more of the enumerated activities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>441 Mass. 233, 235-236 (2004), citing 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1136, at 15-16 (public use statute intended to address increasing demand by \u201cthe general public\u201d for recreational land); <em>Seich </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>426 Mass. 84, 86 (1997) (public use statute applicable because \u201cthe plaintiffs, along with any other member of the public, could have gone to the school and observed the basketball game without paying a fee\u201d); <em>Whooley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 910 (2003) (statute applied because plaintiff \u201cwas no different from any other member of the public\u201d who could enter ice rink and watch hockey game without paying fee).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">This interpretation accords with the Legislature\u2019s \u201cvery purpose\u201d of \u201cencouraging] landowners to permit broad, public, free use of land\u201d for such recreational or other activities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 238. Adopting the city\u2019s view that \u201cthe public\u201d may include only a subset of the community would expand the statutory immunity from negligence beyond that which the Legislature intended by granting such immunity whenever a landowner invites a group of people onto the landowner\u2019s property for a recreational or other listed activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>free of charge. Such a construction would nullify the general rule that \u201c[a]n owner or possessor of land owes a common-law duty of reasonable care to all persons lawfully on the premises,\u201d <em>Dos Santos </em>v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154 (2013), citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Westwood Group, </em>420 Mass. 739, 743 (1995), and would conflict with the Legislature\u2019s intent that individuals owed a lesser duty of care under the statute constitute only \u201ca discrete subgroup\u201d of the broader category of \u201clawful visitors,\u201d who are owed the ordinary duty of reasonable care. See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 237.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">As a corollary to the requirement that a landowner must open the land to the public for certain enumerated purposes, the public use statute\u2019s immunity applies only to \u201csuch members of the public\u201d who enter the property for the purposes for which the owner has permitted general access. See G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C (a); <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>462 Mass. 148, 155 (2012); <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 237-238. The statute does not apply if the injured party possessed some \u201cother special permission or authorization\u201d to be there. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 556, 560 (2009). See <em>Alter </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 149 (1993) (public use statute did not apply to injury at school where \u201cthe plaintiff was not just a member of the public, but was ... a student to whom [the city] owed a duty of care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Here, the city has not shown that Wilkins entered on the school premises to participate in an educational or other enumerated activity open to the general public. Wilkins entered the property to attend a parent-teacher conference, an activity in which only the student, the student\u2019s parents, and the teacher may participate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even assuming that the city opened the school to all parents with students enrolled there, such an invitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>still would apply only to a discrete segment of the general public. As the city concedes, the school was closed to individuals without enrolled students. The city argues that Wilkins\u2019s attendance afforded her an opportunity to participate in her child\u2019s educational experience, and that ;\u201c[s]uch participation benefits not only the parent but the child as well.\u201d That a school serves a general educational purpose, however, does not suffice to put it within the public use statute. We do not agree that the benefit to the parent of a parent-teacher conference, albeit indirectly related to the child\u2019s education, constitutes an educational purpose for the parent within the meaning of the public use statute. In any event, such a benefit does not convert the activity into one that is open to the general public.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, Inc., and the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">We have referred to the statute as both the \u201cpublic use statute\u201d and the \u201crecreational use statute.\u201d See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>441 Mass. 233, 235, 237 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">As originally adopted in 1972, the public use statute barred claims of ordinary negligence for injuries suffered while on land that a landowner had opened to the public for \u201crecreational purposes.\u201d St. 1972, c. 575. In 1998, the Legislature expanded the statute to encompass the public\u2019s use of land for educational, charitable, and other purposes. St. 1998, c. 268.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Municipalities may still seek immunity under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258. See, e.g., <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>433 Mass. 662, 664-666 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\">That there must be access by the general public does not preclude a landowner from \u201climit[ing] the types of recreational [or other] activities that are permitted on the land.\u201d <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 238 n.8. See <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Kennecott Mining Corp., </em>911 P.2d 1290, 1293 (Utah 1996) (\u201cLandowners may impose reasonable restrictions on the type of recreational activities allowed on their land, but they must allow all members of the public to engage in the approved activities to qualify for immunity\u201d); <em>Cregan </em>v. <em>Fourth Memorial Church, </em>175 Wash. 2d 279, 285 (2012) (\u201cPermissible restriction could include limiting the types of recreational activity allowed on the land . . . [or] allowing] public access only during nonbusiness times\u201d). Such restrictions even may include limiting the number of people allowed on the land at a given moment, provided that the method for doing so preserves equal access by all members of the general public (such as would be the case if admittance were on a first-come, first-served basis).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The public use statute achieves this purpose by protecting such landowners from liability \u201cin the absence of wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct,\u201d G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C <em>(a), </em>the same limited duty of care owed to trespassers. See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 237.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Other States have employed similar reasoning in holding that their respective recreational use statutes do not apply unless the landowner has opened the property to the general public. See, e.g., <em>Conant </em>v. <em>Stroup, </em>183 Or. App. 270, 275-281 (2002), and cases cited; <em>Perrine </em>v. <em>Kennecott Mining Corp., </em>911 P.2d at 1292-1293; <em>Cregan </em>v. <em>Fourth Memorial Church, </em>175 Wash. 2d at 285-286.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Such a conference involves an exchange of confidential information about the student, and the city lawfully could not have permitted the general public to attend. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(l) (2012) (prohibiting funding to educational institutions that permit release of students\u2019 education records without parents\u2019 written consent); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 23.07(4) (2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>(\u201cno third party shall have access to information in or from a student record without the specific, informed written consent of the eligible student or the parent\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Applying the public use statute to a school opened only for parent-teacher conferences would conflict with the Legislature\u2019s intent for another reason. The Legislature adopted the public use statute to encourage landowners to permit public use of their land \u201cby limiting their obligations to lawful visitors under the common law.\u201d See <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>441 Mass. 233, 238 (2004). Municipalities, however, need no such encouragement to open their schools for parent-teacher conferences. Various statutes and regulations direct schools and teachers to involve parents in their children\u2019s education, see, e.g., G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 1G (requiring establishment of school board advisory council on parent and community education and involvement); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 35.03(3) (2011) (requiring teachers to be evaluated based on how well they engage, collaborate, and communicate with students\u2019 families); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 35.04(3) (2011) (same as to school administrators), and parent-teacher conferences represent a natural and longstanding method for doing so. See, e.g., <em>Lenox Educ. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>393 Mass. 276, 282 (1984) (affirming determination that teachers in Lenox have \u201ccustomarily and traditionally\u201d met with parents after school hours). See also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 6318(d)(2)(A) (2012) (conditioning Federal funding to eligible elementary schools on existence of annual parent-teacher conferences). Applying the public use statute under these circumstances would upend the balance that the Legislature intended to strike \u201cbetween encouraging public access to private land and protecting landowners from liability for injuries.\u201d <em>Ali </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 236.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
