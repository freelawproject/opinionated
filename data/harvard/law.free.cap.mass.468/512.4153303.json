L. c. 267, \u00a7 1; seventeen counts of uttering a forged instrument, G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 5; and three counts of attempting to commit the crime of larceny by false pretenses of the property of another, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6. The charges arose from allegations that the defendant, through his use of computers, conducted a sophisticated scheme of diverting to himself funds that were intended to be used to pay off large mortgage loans on residential properties. On November 21, 2011, the Commonwealth filed in the Superior Court a \u201cMotion to Compel the Defendant to Enter His Password into Encryption Software He Placed on Various Digital Media Storage Devices that Are Now in the Custody of the Commonwealth\u201d (motion to compel decryption). The Commonwealth also filed a motion to report a question of law to the Appeals Court prior to trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004). The question concerned the lawfulness of compelling the defendant to privately enter an encryption key into computers seized from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>him by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a hearing on January 18, 2012, a judge denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to compel decryption, but he reported the following question of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u201cCan the defendant be compelled pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed protocol to provide his key to seized encrypted digital evidence despite the rights and protections provided by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article Twelve of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We now conclude that the answer to the reported question is \u201cYes, where the defendant\u2019s compelled decryption would not communicate facts of a testimonial nature to the Commonwealth beyond what the defendant already had admitted to investigators.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the judge\u2019s denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to compel decryption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>The undisputed facts are taken from the parties\u2019 submissions to the motion judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Beginning in 2009, the defendant, who is an attorney, alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>edly orchestrated a scheme to acquire for himself funds that were intended to be used to pay off home mortgage loans. According to the Commonwealth, the defendant identified high-end properties that were listed in an online database as \u201cunder agreement.\u201d He would research each one at the applicable registry of deeds to determine whether there was a mortgage on the property. If there was, the defendant, purportedly using a computer, would forge an assignment of the mortgage to either \u201cPuren Ventures, Inc.\u201d (Puren Ventures) or \u201cBaylor Holdings, Ltd.\u201d (Baylor Holdings). He then would record the forged assignment at the applicable registry of deeds and mail a notice to the seller stating that the mortgage on the property had been assigned to one of these sham companies, which he had set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The defendant fostered the illusion that Puren Ventures and Baylor Holdings were actual companies by giving each one Internet-based telephone and facsimile numbers. When a closing attorney would contact one of these companies to request a statement documenting the sum necessary to pay off the reassigned mortgage, the attorney would be instructed to send the request to the facsimile number that the defendant had created. Next, the defendant would request an actual payoff figure from the true mortgage holder. The defendant would transmit this information by Internet facsimile number to the closing attorney, doing so under the guise of the sham company. The defendant would instruct the closing attorney to send the payoff check to a Boston address where the defendant once had practiced law. Although ultimately unsuccessful, the defendant purportedly created seventeen fraudulent assignments of mortgages, totaling over $13 million. According to the Commonwealth, the defendant relied heavily on the use of computers to conceal his identity and perpetrate his alleged scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">On December 17, 2009, State police troopers arrested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>defendant immediately after he retrieved what he believed to be over $1.3 million in payoff funds from two real estate closings. They also executed search warrants for his residence in Marble-head and for his vehicle. During the search of the defendant\u2019s residence, troopers observed several computers that were powered on, and they photographed the computer screens.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The troopers seized from the defendant\u2019s residence two desktop computers, one laptop computer, and various other devices capable of storing electronic data.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They also seized one smaller \u201cnetbook\u201d computer from the defendant\u2019s vehicle. Computer forensic examiners were able to view several documents and \u201cbookmarks\u201d to Web sites that were located on an external hard drive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, all of the data on the four computers were encrypted with \u201cDriveCrypt Plus\u201d software.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">According to the Commonwealth, the encryption software on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the computers is virtually impossible to circumvent. Its manufacturer touts the fact that it does not contain a \u201cback door\u201d that would allow access to data by anyone other than the authorized user. Thus, the Commonwealth states, the files on the four computers cannot be accessed and viewed unless the authorized user first enters the correct password to unlock the encryption. The Commonwealth believes that evidence of the defendant\u2019s purported criminal activities is located on these computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On the day of his arrest, the defendant was interviewed by law enforcement officials after having been advised of the Miranda rights. In response to questioning, he said that he had more than one computer in his home. The defendant also informed the officials that \u201c[e] very thing is encrypted and no one is going to get to it.\u201d In order to decrypt the information, he would have to \u201cstart the program.\u201d The defendant said that he used encryption for privacy purposes, and that when law enforcement officials asked him about the type of encryption used, they essentially were asking for the defendant\u2019s help in putting him in jail. The defendant reiterated that he was able to decrypt the computers, but he refused to divulge any further information that would enable a forensic search.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">On November 21, 2011, the Commonwealth filed its motion to compel decryption pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (2), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004). It sought an order compelling the defendant\u2019s compliance with a \u201cprotocol\u201d that the Commonwealth had established to obtain decrypted digital data.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As grounds for the motion, the Commonwealth stated that compelling the defendant to enter the key to encryption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>software on various digital media storage devices that had been seized by the Commonwealth was essential to the discovery of \u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s purported criminal conduct. The Commonwealth further stated that its protocol would not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under either the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to compel decryption, the judge said that, on the one hand, the Commonwealth merely was requesting a sequence of numbers and characters that would enable it to access information on the computers, but that, on the other hand, the Commonwealth was asking for the defendant\u2019s help in accessing potentially incriminating evidence that the Commonwealth had seized. In the judge\u2019s view, there was merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that production of a password to decrypt the computers constituted an admission of knowledge, ownership, and control. Further, the judge continued, the scenario presented in this case was far different from compel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ling a defendant to provide a voice exemplar, a handwriting exemplar, or a blood sample, all of which are deemed to be nontestimonial. The judge said that the defendant\u2019s refusal to disclose the encryption key during his interview with law enforcement officials could be construed as an invocation of his rights under the Fifth Amendment and art. 12. Finally, it was the judge\u2019s understanding that neither the Federal nor the State Constitution requires a defendant to assist the government in understanding evidence that it has seized from a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">2. <em>Decryption under the Fifth Amendment. </em>The Commonwealth contends that compelling the defendant to enter his encryption key into the computers pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s protocol would not violate the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the defendant\u2019s act of decryption would not communicate facts of a testimonial nature to the government beyond what the defendant already has admitted to investigators. As such, the Commonwealth continues, the defendant\u2019s act of decryption does not trigger Fifth Amendment protection. We agree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Couch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 322, 328 (1973) (\u201cIt is extortion of information from the accused himself that offends our sense of justice\u201d). It is well established that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment does not independently proscribe the compelled production of every sort of incriminating evidence but applies only when the accused is compelled to make a <em>testimonial </em>communication that is incriminating\u201d (emphasis in original). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 408 (1976). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hubbell, </em>530 U.S. 27, 34 (2000) (\u201cThe word \u2018witness\u2019 in the constitutional text limits the relevant category of compelled incriminating communications to those that are \u2018testimonial\u2019 in character\u201d); <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 761 (1966) (\u201c[T]he privilege protects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. 583, 588, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 900 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Here, the Commonwealth, through its motion, is seeking to compel the defendant to decrypt \u201call\u201d of the \u201cdigital storage devices that were seized from him.\u201d Given that the Commonwealth believes that those devices contain information about the defendant\u2019s alleged mortgage payoff scheme, the entry of the encryption key or password presumably would be incriminating because \u201cit would furnish the Government with a link in the chain of evidence leading to [the defendant\u2019s] indictment.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>487 U.S. 201, 207 n.5 (1988), and accompanying text. The issue on which this case turns is whether the defendant\u2019s act of decrypting the computers is a testimonial communication that triggers Fifth Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Although the Fifth Amendment privilege typically applies to oral or written statements that are deemed to be testimonial, <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>322 U.S. 694, 698 (1944), the act of producing evidence demanded by the government may have \u201ccommunicative aspects\u201d that would render the Fifth Amendment applicable. <em>Fisher, </em>425 U.S. at 410. See <em>Hubbell, </em>530 U.S. at 36. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>426 Mass. 206, 211 (1997) (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies not only to verbal communications, but . . . also to nonverbal acts that imply assertions\u201d). Whether an act of production is testimonial depends on whether the government compels the individual to disclose \u201cthe contents of his own mind\u201d to explicitly or implicitly communicate some statement of fact. <em>Hubbell, supra </em>at 43, quoting <em>Curcio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 118, 128 (1957). See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>487 U.S. at 213 (Fifth Amendment intended \u201cto spare the accused from having to reveal, directly or indirectly, his knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>facts relating him to the offense or from having to share his thoughts and beliefs with the Government\u201d). See also <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 595 n.9 (1990) (opinion of Brennan, J.) (\u201cnonverbal conduct contains a testimonial component whenever the conduct reflects the actor\u2019s communication of his thoughts to another\u201d). More particularly, the act of complying with the government\u2019s demand could constitute a testimonial communication where it is considered to be a tacit admission to the existence of the evidence demanded, the possession or control of such evidence by the individual, and the authenticity of the evidence. See <em>Hubbell, supra </em>at 36 &amp; n.19; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>465 U.S. 605, 613-614 &amp; n.11 (1984); <em>Fisher, supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. at 592. The determination whether an act of producing evidence in response to a governmental demand is sufficiently testimonial that it renders the Fifth Amendment applicable \u201cdepend[s] on the facts and circumstances of [each] particular case[].\u201d <em>Fisher, supra. </em>See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>487 U.S. at 214-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">It is well established that not all acts of production have communicative aspects such that they will be deemed testimonial. See <em>Hubbell, </em>530 U.S. at 34-35; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>487 U.S. at 210-211. Significantly, the Fifth Amendment privilege is not triggered where the government seeks to compel an individual to be the source of real or physical evidence by, for example, furnishing a blood sample, <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. at 764-765; producing a voice exemplar, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 5-7 (1973); standing in a lineup, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 221-223 (1967); providing a handwriting exemplar, <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U.S. 263, 266-267 (1967); or putting on particular clothing, <em>Holt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>218 U.S. 245, 252-253 (1910). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>386 Mass. 772, 776-777 (1982) (breathalyzer test and field sobriety tests do not produce evidence of testimonial nature). The Fifth Amendment privilege is not implicated in these circumstances because the individual is \u201cnot required \u2018to disclose any knowledge he might have,\u2019 or \u2018to speak his guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 211, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra </em>at 222-223. See <em>Hubbell, supra </em>at 35 (\u201cThe act of exhibiting such physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>characteristics is not the same as a sworn communication by a witness that relates either express or implied assertions of fact or belief\u201d); <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 590-599 (discussing distinctions between production of \u201creal or physical\u201d evidence and production of \u201ctestimonial\u201d communication for purposes of privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Here, the defendant\u2019s act of entering an encryption key in the computers seized by the Commonwealth would appear, at first blush, to be a testimonial communication that triggers Fifth Amendment protection. By such action, the defendant implicitly would be acknowledging that he has ownership and control of the computers and their contents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This is not simply the production of real or physical evidence like a blood sample or a handwriting exemplar. Rather, the defendant\u2019s act of entering the encryption key would be a communication of his knowledge about particular facts that would be relevant to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Our analysis, however, does not end here. We must further determine whether the defendant\u2019s act of production loses its testimonial character because the information that would be disclosed by the defendant is a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination provides that an act of production does not involve testimonial communication where the facts conveyed already are known to the government, such that the individual \u201cadds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government\u2019s information.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>425 U.S. at 411. For the exception to apply, the government must establish its knowledge of (1) the existence of the evidence demanded; (2) the possession or control of that evidence by the defendant; and (3) the authenticity of the evidence. See <em>id. </em>at 410-413; <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Bright, </em>596 F.3d 683, 692 (9th Cir. 2010). See also <em>Hubbell, </em>530 U.S. at 40-41, 44-45 (government did not satisfy \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d exception where no showing of prior knowledge of existence or whereabouts of documents ultimately produced by respondent to subpoena); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>465 U.S. at 613-614 &amp; nn.11-13 (act of producing business records involved testimonial self-incrimination where government did not show that existence, possession, and authenticity of records were \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d). In those instances when the government produces evidence to satisfy the \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d exception, \u201cno constitutional rights are touched. The question is not of testimony but of surrender.\u201d <em>Fisher, supra </em>at 411, quoting <em>Matter of Harris, </em>221 U.S. 274, 279 (1911). See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sideman &amp; Bancroft, LLP, </em>704 F.3d 1197, 1202-1205 (9th Cir. 2013) (quantum of information possessed by Internal Revenue Service regarding existence and possession of summonsed documents, together with evidence of their authenticity, satisfied \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d exception to Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fricosu, </em>841 F. Supp. 2d 1232, 1237 (D. Colo. 2012) (Fifth Amendment not implicated by requiring production of unencrypted contents of computer where government knew of existence and location of files, although not specific content of documents, and knew of defendant\u2019s custody or control of computer); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jancsek, </em>302 Or. 270, 287-288 (1986) (compelled production of letter not protected by Fifth Amendment privilege where existence, contents, and authenticity of letter already known to police). In essence, under the \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege, the act of production does not compel a defendant to be a witness against himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the factual statements that would be conveyed by the defendant\u2019s act of entering an encryption key in the computers are \u201cforegone conclusions\u201d and, therefore, the act of decryption is not a testimonial communication that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. The investigation by the corruption, fraud, and computer crime division of the Attorney General\u2019s office uncovered detailed evidence that at least two mortgage assignments to Baylor Holdings were fraudulent. During his postarrest interview with State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>police Trooper Patrick M. Johnson, the defendant stated that he had performed real estate work for Baylor Holdings, which he understood to be a financial services company. He explained that his communications with this company, which purportedly was owned by Russian individuals, were highly encrypted because, according to the defendant, \u201c[that] is how Russians do business.\u201d The defendant informed Trooper Johnson that he had more than one computer at his home, that the program for communicating with Baylor Holdings was installed on a laptop, and that \u201c[e]verything is encrypted and no one is going to get to it.\u201d The defendant acknowledged that he was able to perform decryption. Further, and most significantly, the defendant said that because of encryption, the police were \u201cnot going to get to <em>any </em>of [his] computers,\u201d thereby implying that <em>all </em>of them were encrypted.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">When considering the entirety of the defendant\u2019s interview with Trooper Johnson, it is apparent that the defendant was engaged in real estate transactions involving Baylor Holdings, that he used his computers to allegedly communicate with its purported owners, that the information on all of his computers pertaining to these transactions was encrypted, and that he had the ability to decrypt the files and documents. The facts that would be conveyed by the defendant through his act of decryption \u2014 his ownership and control of the computers and their contents, knowledge of the fact of encryption, and knowledge of the encryption key \u2014 already are known to the government and, thus, are a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to compel decryption does not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment because the defendant is only telling the government what it already knows.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">3. <em>Decryption under art. 12. </em>The Commonwealth also contends that compelling the defendant to enter his encryption key <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s protocol would not violate his privilege against self-incrimination under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Article 12 provides that \u201c[n]o subject shall... be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against himself.\u201d It is well established that art. 12 affords greater protection against self-incrimination than does the Fifth Amendment in circumstances that are \u201cdiscrete and well defined.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bur</em>gess, 426 Mass. at 218. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mavredakis, </em>430 Mass. 848, 858-859 (2000). However, as we have explained, \u201c[ajlthough art. 12 demands a more expansive protection, \u2018it does not change the classification of evidence to which the privilege applies. Only that genre of evidence having a testimonial or communicative nature is protected under the privilege against self-incrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra, </em>quoting <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Colleton, </em>387 Mass. 790, 796 n.6 (1982) . Like the Federal Constitution, the protection against self-incrimination afforded by art. 12 is unavailable where the government seeks to compel an individual to be the source of real or physical evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra, </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Similarly, we have held that, as is the case under the Federal Constitution, \u201cthe act of production, quite apart from the content of that which is produced, may itself be communicative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>405 Mass. 676, 679 (1989).

The court holds today that the defendant, an attorney who practices from his home, may be ordered to enter decryption keys sequentially on each and every electronic device seized from his home, his home office, and his automobile, in order to provide law enforcement officers with unencrypted access to those devices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such an order is the functional equivalent of requiring him to produce the unencrypted contents of the devices seized. The government suspects that some unspecified set of documents related to a mortgage fraud scheme may be located on one or more of these devices,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the government thus far has been unable to read because of the encryption. I agree with the court that this act of decryption is compelled, testimonial, and potentially incriminating. Unlike the court, I conclude that this also holds true for the intrinsically linked act of thereby producing in unencrypted form any material that may be on the now encrypted devices. Further, I do not agree that the Commonwealth has shown suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ficient knowledge of the existence, location, and authenticity of the documents it seeks such that the information that would be revealed by decryption and production is a \u201cforegone conclusion,\u201d and therefore that requiring the defendant to decrypt the devices would not violate his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. Because I believe that the act of compelled entry of the codes to decrypt the seized devices, thereby producing the unencrypted contents of those devices, is protected under both the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">1. <em>Act of production and authentication. </em>The court concludes that the act of decrypting the devices pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed protocol, which necessarily would produce in unencrypted form any files stored thereon to which the encryption key would permit access, is not analogous to the act of responding to a subpoena to produce a document, where the act of production would be testimonial because it makes an assertion that, among other things, the document produced is authentic. To reach this conclusion, the court adopts the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that, by decrypting the computers and thereby producing their unencrypted contents, the defendant would be asserting only his ability to decrypt the devices. On this view, he would not be asserting that he owned them, had exclusive use and control of them, or was familiar with any of the files on them; that certain files contained the incriminating evidence sought; or that the documents were authentic. Such is far from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In taking this view of the matter, the court maintains that the defendant merely would be entering a password, which he would not disclose to the Commonwealth, into the encryption program, and would not thereby be selecting and producing any documents. Such an artificial distinction between the act of entering the decryption key and the inevitable result of decrypting the devices,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and thereby producing the files for inspection, obfuscates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>reality of what the defendant is being compelled to disclose. The Commonwealth seeks the decryption order at issue not for its own sake but, rather, to enable the government to access the documents it sought when obtaining the search warrant permitting it to seize the devices. Here, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit concluded in similar circumstances, \u201cthe decryption and production would be tantamount to testimony by [the defendant] of his knowledge of the existence and location of potentially incriminating files; of his possession, control, and access to the encrypted portions of the drives; and of his capability to decrypt the files.\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated March 25, 2011, </em>670 F.3d 1335, 1346 (2012) <em>(In re Subpoena Duces Tecum). </em>Inexorably, once the decryption key is entered, the names and sizes of the files (if any) to which the defendant has access on that computer will be produced, the amount of unused space available to the defendant on that computer will become known, and the contents of any files will be made accessible to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Moreover, the defendant has denied that there are any documents related to Baylor Holdings, Ltd. (Baylor), on that subset of the seized devices of which he has acknowledged ownership, denied that he created any documents for Baylor,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> denied that the encrypted communication program he used to communicate with Baylor continues to be installed on those devices, and denied that there are any saved records of the encrypted communications he had with Baylor employees. If the defendant is compelled to decrypt the devices, and any such documents are produced thereby, the act of decryption will have resulted in a prior inconsistent statement by the defendant, which the Commonwealth may seek to use against him at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In light of all this, I would conclude that both the acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>decrypting the devices and of inexorably producing thereby the unencrypted contents of the devices that the Commonwealth otherwise cannot now access are testimonial. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hubbell, </em>530 U.S. 27, 43 (2000) (Hubbell); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>487 U.S. 201, 212 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">2. <em>Foregone conclusion. </em>The court concludes that the act of entering the codes to decrypt the devices would not infringe upon the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. The court is of the view that the defendant already has disclosed during an interview with State troopers anything that, absent such disclosures, might be testimonial about the act of decryption. In particular, the court concludes that the facts that might be learned through the act of decryption \u2014 ownership and control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of the seized devices \u2014 have been revealed previously by the defendant, or are already known by the Commonwealth through other means, and therefore that the \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d exception applies to what otherwise would be testimonial conduct. The court does not consider whether the act of production, also in my view testimonial, is encompassed within the foregone conclusion exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u201cThe touchstone of whether an act of production is testimonial is whether the government compels the individual to use \u2018the contents of his own mind\u2019 to explicitly or implicitly communicate some statement of fact.\u201d <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1345, quoting <em>Curcio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 118, 128 (1957). Under the foregone conclusion doctrine, an otherwise testimonial act of production is not testimonial if the government establishes that, at the time it sought the compelled production, it already knew of that which would explicitly or implicitly be conveyed by the production. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 410-411 (1976) <em>(Fisher). </em>See <em>Hubbell, supra </em>at 36 n.19, 43-45 (act of production testimonial if by compelled conduct \u201cthe witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and were authentic\u201d; inquiry turns on extent of government\u2019s prior knowledge of existence and location of documents produced); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ponds, </em>454 F.3d 313, 320-321 (D.C. Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">a. <em>Reasonable particularity standard. </em>In addressing the extent of knowledge that the government must establish in order to invoke the \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d doctrine, four circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals have concluded that the government must show with \u201creasonable particularity\u201d that it already knows the \u201clocation, existence, and authenticity of the purported evidence.\u201d <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1344 &amp; n.20. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ponds, supra </em>at 320-321; <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated April 18, 2003, </em>383 F.3d 905, 910 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated October 29, 1992, </em>1 F.3d 87, 93 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>510 U.S. 1091 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Treating computer files as documents, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is, to date, the only circuit court to have addressed the issue specifically in the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>encrypted computers. Concluding that a defendant\u2019s compelled decryption and production of the contents of computer drives and external hard drives would be sufficiently testimonial to trigger Fifth Amendment protections, the court determined that \u201can act of production is not testimonial \u2014 even if the act conveys a fact regarding the existence or location, possession, or authenticity of the subpoenaed materials \u2014 if the Government can show with \u2018reasonable particularity\u2019 that, at the time it sought to compel the act of production, it already knew of the materials, thereby making any testimonial aspect a \u2018foregone conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1345-1346. To establish a foregone conclusion, \u201c[t]he government does not have to show that it knows specific file names,\u201d but would have to \u201cshow with some reasonable particularity that it seeks a certain file and is aware, based on other information, that (1) the file exists in some specified location, (2) the file is possessed by the target of the subpoena, and (3) the file is authentic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349 n.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">While the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has yet to consider the issue, I would adopt, at a minimum for purposes of art. 12, the same reasonable particularity standard for establishing a foregone conclusion that other circuit courts have adopted, and would conclude that the Commonwealth has not met that burden here. See <em>id. </em>at 1346, 1349 (no evidence \u201cthat the Government, at the time it sought to compel production, knew to any degree of particularity what, if anything, was hidden behind the encrypted wall\u201d). Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fricosu, </em>841 F. Supp. 2d 1232, 1235-1237 (D. Colo. 2012) (existence and location of files foregone conclusion where government introduced recorded conversation of defendant and third party in which she said that file sought \u201cwas on my laptop\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">b. <em>Extent of government\u2019s knowledge in this case. </em>Here, the Commonwealth has made no showing that the existence, possession, and authenticity of the broad categories of items sought are foregone conclusions, under any definition of that term. The court focuses on the defendant\u2019s apparent access to the devices seized, and his statements that he owns a \u201claptop,\u201d that \u201ceverything is encrypted,\u201d and that he could decrypt at least one device (\u201cmy computer\u201d). In so doing, it conflates the prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>able cause showing that the Commonwealth was required to make in order to seize the devices in the first instance with the showing that the Commonwealth must make when, as here, it seeks the otherwise testimonial assistance of a defendant in accessing the contents of those devices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The showing that the Commonwealth must make as to its knowledge of the contents of those devices in order to render anything revealed by the decryption and production of that content a foregone conclusion is significantly greater than what is required to show probable cause. Hence, the \u201creasonable particularity\u201d standard requires much more than government knowledge that a defendant owns or has access to a particular computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Even under the less specific requirements articulated in <em>Hub-bell, supra, </em>moreover, the government\u2019s burden of establishing that, at the time it sought to compel decryption and production, it already knew of the documents sought, rendering any testimonial aspect of that conduct a foregone conclusion, is not met by a showing that a defendant had in his house what is essentially a locked file cabinet in which such documents might have been kept. See <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>1347 n.25 (\u201cThis situation is no different than if the Government seized a locked strongbox. Physical possession of the entire lockbox is not the issue; whether the Government has the requisite knowledge of what is contained inside the strongbox is the critical question\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">i. <em>Existence and content of documents sought. </em>Aside from knowledge pertinent to the existence and nature of the encryption program itself,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the government has not shown that it has any knowledge as to the existence or content of any particular files or documents on any particular computer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the contrary, the Commonwealth\u2019s computer forensic expert\u2019s affidavit provides general information about what computers can do, but makes no specific assertions as to any files or documents expected to be found on any of the seized devices. The focus of the trooper\u2019s affidavit is on the defendant\u2019s actions away from his home, as observed by police surveillance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There no description <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>of files that are expected to be found,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> let alone that are known to exist, on the defendant\u2019s computers;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> moreover, the affidavit contains numerous indications of the defendant\u2019s apparent efforts to avoid downloading documents to his computers, using telephone or facsimile transmission from his house.

The Commonwealth accordingly has not shown that it knows \u201cwith some reasonable particularity that it seeks a certain file and is aware, based on other information, that (1) the file exists in some specified location, (2) the file is possessed by the target of the subpoena, and (3) the file is authentic.\u201d <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1349 n.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u201cIn <em>Fisher, [supra </em>at 411,] . . . the act of production was not testimonial because the Government had knowledge of each fact that had the potential of being testimonial. As a contrast, the Court in <em>Hubbell[, supra </em>at 44-45,] found there was testimony in the production of the documents since the Government had no knowledge of the existence of documents, other than a suspicion that documents likely existed and, if they did exist, that they would fall within the broad categories requested.\u201d <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1345. Here, too, the government has no more than a suspicion that broad categories of documents, extending over periods of years, may exist on one or more of the seized devices. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>465 U.S. 605, 613-614 &amp; nn.11-13 (1984). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. 583, 592, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 900 (1980) (act of producing gun by defendant charged with assault by means of dangerous weapon would not convey \u201cmerely trivial new knowledge\u201d but would communicate \u201cjust those matters about which the Commonwealth desires but does not have solid information\u201d). Contrast <em>Fisher, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The court notes that the defendant has admitted to engaging in real estate transactions for Baylor, communicating with Baylor over an encrypted communication program installed on his laptop, using the Internet to communicate, having more than one computer, that \u201ceverything\u201d on his computer is encrypted, and that he knows how to decrypt it. The court points also to the fact that two of the mortgage assignments to Baylor apparently are fraudulent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> None of this, however, establishes anything about the government\u2019s knowledge of the documents, if any, that may be stored on the seized devices.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated April 18, 2003, </em>383 F.3d at 910 (\u201cAlthough the government possessed extensive knowledge about [defendant\u2019s] price-fixing activities as a result of interviews with cooperating witnesses and [his] own incriminating statements . . . , it is the government\u2019s knowledge of the existence and possession of the actual documents, not the information contained therein, that is central to the foregone conclusion inquiry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Furthermore, the court misconstrues the extent of the defendant\u2019s statements concerning the encryption, thereby inferring that the defendant has asserted greater access and control than is in fact the case. The court conflates the encryption of the disk drive on one of the computers, which the defendant acknowledged, with the existence of the encrypted communication program<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> purportedly used to communicate with Baylor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Contrary to the court\u2019s statement, the defendant has not said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>communication program that he ran in order to communicate with someone at Baylor is installed on any of his computers at this time; indeed, he stated explicitly that it <em>had </em>been installed on his \u201claptop\u201d but that it might no longer be there and that the program itself \u201cmay not exist anymore.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On this record, the Commonwealth does not know what is stored on any of the seized devices, or if any of them contain information relevant to the charged offenses. Notwithstanding the court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, the affidavit in support of the search warrant and the defendant\u2019s statements to police do not give rise to a foregone conclusion that whatever would be revealed by the defendant\u2019s entry of the decryption key, and consequent production of the unencrypted contents of all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>seized devices, is already known to the government. See <em>Hubbell, supra </em>at 45 (\u201cthe overbroad argument that a businessman . . . will always possess general business and tax records,\u201d could not \u201ccure [the] deficiency\u201d of government\u2019s failure to demonstrate its \u201cprior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts\u201d of requested documents); <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated April 18, 2003, </em>383 F.3d at 911 (\u201cA subpoena such as this, which seeks all documents within a category but fails to describe those documents with any specificity indicates that the government needs the act of production to build its case against [the defendant]\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>465 U.S. at 614 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Even more fundamentally, to establish a foregone conclusion the government must first show that it knows any files at all exist on a particular computer. In <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1346, 1349, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed an order requiring a suspect to decrypt his computer, which was using the same type of encryption program that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert avers is being used to encrypt the devices here, because the court concluded that the government had not shown that any files existed on the computer, other than the encryption program itself. The encryption program at issue not only encrypts information stored on a computer, it also encrypts all unused space on the computer\u2019s hard drive, making it impossible to determine how much of the computer contains actual files and how much is unused or blank. Because the government could not show that any data on the computer represented actual files, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he [government has failed to show any basis, let alone shown a basis with reasonable particularity, for its belief that encrypted files exist on the drives . . .\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1349. Given the properties of the encryption program in place on the seized devices here, as described by the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, the Commonwealth does not know whether they contain any documents of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">ii. <em>Ownership, exclusive use, and control. </em>The court\u2019s decision also conflates access to a particular computer<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> with access to, and knowledge and control of, each of the files on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>computer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As stated, the United States Supreme Court has rejected the view that a defendant\u2019s access to a locked cabinet, whose contents are not known but that might contain the documents sought, is sufficient to establish that the government knows the contents of those documents, such that their compelled production by unlocking the cabinet is a foregone conclusion. <em>Hubbell, supra. </em>This distinction is even more critical in considering the issue of production or search of files stored on a computer. See <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1346, 1349; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fricosu, </em>841 F. Supp. 2d 1232, 1235-1237 (D. Colo. 2012). Like many courts to have considered the issue, we have concluded that each computer file is a separate document in a closed container, requiring that searches of a computer to locate specific files must be limited and particular. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>448 Mass. 750, 775, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 910 (2007). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>586 F.3d 823, 833 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cofficers must be clear as to what it is they are seeking on the computer and conduct the search in a way that avoids searching files of types not identified in the warrant\u201d). See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>592 F.3d 779, 786 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3525 (2010), and cases cited; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>576 F.3d 1078, 1088-1089 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 1097 (2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>172 F.3d 1268, 1270-1273 (10th Cir. 1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stierhoff, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>477 </em>F. Supp. 2d 423, 439 n.8 (D.R.I. 2007), aff\u2019d, 549 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2008). See generally Goldfoot, The Physical Computer and the Fourth Amendment, 16 Berkeley J. Crim. L. 112 (2011); Kerr, Searches and Seizures in a Digital World, 119 Harv. L. Rev. 531 (2005); Trepel, Digital Searches, General Warrants, and the Case for the Courts, 10 Yale J. L. &amp; Tech. 120 (2007). Therefore, the government must establish knowledge of the existence of the particular file, either by the name of the file or by knowledge of its contents, as well as the defendant\u2019s access to that portion of the encrypted drive on which the file exists. See <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>670 F.3d at 1346, 1349. It has not done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">3. <em>Attorney-client privilege. </em>I would conclude also that the defendant cannot be compelled to enter the decryption key, and thereby produce all documents to which he has access, on each device, under the protocol as proposed by the Commonwealth, because of the possibility that the computers contain privileged information relating to the defendant\u2019s legal clients. See <em>Preventive Medicine Assocs. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>465 Mass. 810, 822-824 &amp; nn.24-26 (2013) (\u201ca search, to be reasonable, must include reasonable steps designed to prevent a breach of the attorney-client privilege .... [T]he harm to the defendant could be irreparable if the Commonwealth viewed privileged materials, even if only by accident\u201d). The issue of attorney-client privilege is not addressed in the search warrant affidavit, the protocol proffered in conjunction with the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to compel, or the court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The defendant told police that he ran a law office from his house, and that he had approximately ten active personal injury clients. He stated that he sent facsimile transmissions to his personal injury clients, when necessary, using TrustFax, an In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>temet facsimile site, from his home computer. He acknowledged that \u201cmy computer\u201d is encrypted, but did not identify which one of the seized devices he meant, and asserted that the encryption was to protect his \u201cprivacy.\u201d The police photographs of one of the computer screens when that computer was mnning, showing the directory name \u201cK:\\Leon DocumentsYMy Scans\u201d and an icon labeled \u201cAttorney Leon I. Gelfgatt,\u201d do not indicate that the documents, if any, on the computers relate to Baylor and not to the defendant\u2019s other clients. Nor do they show that the computers contain any documents related to Baylor. Because the proposed protocol potentially would allow the Commonwealth to view privileged information related to the defendant\u2019s other clients, I would conclude, on this basis as well, that the requested order to compel is unreasonable and impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because I believe that the compelled decryption and production here is fundamentally testimonial, and the Commonwealth has not established a foregone conclusion that the existence, location, and authenticity of the information that would be produced is known to the government, I respectfully dissent, and would answer the reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s proposed order requires the defendant to decrypt \u201call\u201d of the \u201cdigital storage devices that were seized from him.\u201d These include two desktop computers and a laptop computer seized from his house; a \u201cnetbook\u201d computer seized from his automobile; an external hard drive; two universal serial bus (USB) \u201cthumb\u201d drives (also known as \u201cflash drives,\u201d \u201cUSB drives,\u201d and \u201csticks\u201d); fourteen compact discs; two secure digital cards; and two cellular telephones. The devices were seized pursuant to a search warrant issued based on an affidavit by a State trooper involved in the investigation. The affidavit sought, inter alla, \u201c[cjomputers and/or electronic storage devices capable of storing any of the below-described records and/or data\u201d; it encompassed \u201c[a]ny and all records, documents, items, and/or data, in whatever form, relating in any way to\u201d a lengthy list of broadly defined items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\">A \u201cnetbook\u201d is a smaller, more lightweight, and less powerful type of laptop computer usually used for Internet and electronic mail (e-mail) access.

See <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated March 25, 2011, </em>670 F.3d 1335, 1347 (2012) (rejecting \u201cthe suggestion that simply because the devices were encrypted necessarily means that [the defendant] was trying to hide something. Just as a vault is capable of storing mountains of incriminating documents, that alone does not mean that it contains incriminating documents, or anything at all\u201d). See also G. L. c. 93H, \u00a7 2 (requiring adoption of regulations \u201crelative to any person that owns or licenses personal information about a resident of the commonwealth\u201d that are designed to \u201cinsure the security and confidentiality\u201d of such information; \u201cprotect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information\u201d); 201 Code Mass.

[D]ata should also be encrypted while in storage at the cloud provider\u201d). Moreover, it also seems likely, and the Commonwealth has not stated otherwise, that, should any such documents be produced on any of the seized devices, the Commonwealth will seek to characterize evidence of the defendant\u2019s earlier denials as inconsistent statements, lies, and further consciousness of guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the order to provide the key to decrypt the computers and thereby produce the unencrypted documents is necessary because encryption creates significant difficulties for law enforcement officers attempting to prosecute a lengthy list of serious crimes. In a similar vein, the Commonwealth argues explicitly that it should be able to compel the decryption of the devices and the production of their content based on the warrant affidavit, which established probable cause to seize them, as the seizure otherwise has produced no information that would be useful in prosecuting the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">It does not follow, however, that further restrictions should be placed on fundamental protections provided by the Fifth Amendment and art. 12, which heretofore have been enforced by both State and Federal courts, because the prevalence of computers, in this digital age, at times may facilitate the commission of crimes. The omnipresence of electronic devices that may be monitored, tracked, and recorded has likewise afforded unparalleled opportunities to law enforcement officers in their pursuit of criminal investigations. That encryption may at times present significant difficulties to law enforcement officers does not, as the Commonwealth suggests, result in a conclusion that the Fifth Amendment privilege should be restricted so that enforcement is made easier. See <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 761 (1977) (\u201cWhere the privilege is applicable, the constitutionally required result is that no balancing of State-defendant interests is permissible to facilitate the admittedly difficult burdens of the prosecution\u201d).

Papargiris stated that some of the storage devices seized from the defendant\u2019s house indicate use of an encryption program called \u201cDriveCrypt Plus Pack.\u201d When this program is installed on a computer, the computer displays a particular screen requesting a password every time the computer is started. Nothing further can be done on that computer until the user enters the password. Because all of the seized computers display the same screen when they are started, Papargiris believes that the program is being used for all of the seized computers and separate storage devices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">As to one external hard drive, the Commonwealth has shown knowledge of two documents related to the defendant\u2019s own home, not involving Baylor Holdings, Ltd. (Baylor), or Puren Ventures, Inc., and some links (which do not involve documents) to third-party Web sites.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The trooper\u2019s affidavit details police surveillance and review of surveillance video footage of the defendant driving to various stores and post offices. Police suspect the defendant purchased money orders and gift cards at these locations, by filling out forms by hand. Additional surveillance footage shows the defendant on one occasion entering and leaving a court house that also houses a registry of deeds. Cooperating witnesses and documents obtained from third parties indicate that an unknown individual purporting to represent Baylor arranged for checks to be mailed via United States mail to the defendant\u2019s former office building in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The affidavit also recounts police observations of the defendant suspected to be using publicly available and \u201canonymous\u201d wireless Internet services, which allow access to the Internet without identifying a particular user\u2019s Internet Protocol (IP) address, from a variety of locations, such as restaurants. These suspicions are based largely on his presence at particular times at loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tians where such services are available, or in nearby parking lots, and, on two occasions, because he was observed apparently using a laptop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Based on the affidavits, the Commonwealth clearly had probable cause to seize the devices themselves. In this regard, there was reason to think the defendant used some unspecified computer to connect to the Internet in communicating with the intended victims of the fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The search warrant affidavit states that the seized computers \u201care capable of storing,\u201d inter alla, information about the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontacts and activities\u201d for a period of more than four months; \u201canything having do to with\u201d his financial transactions over an approximately three-year period (although the fraudulent mortgage scheme allegedly lasted for less than one year); any Internet search, over an unlimited time frame and geographic area, for residential properties; and \u201cany\u201d document filed with \u201cany Massachusetts Registry of Deeds,\u201d again over an unlimited period. The same information is also sought, from \u201c[a]ny and all records, documents, items, and/or data, in whatever form,\u201d to be found at the defendant\u2019s house and in his automobile. The affidavit states further that, because \u201c[transferring data files between computers or onto storage devices such as disks is a simple task that takes little time. . . once a file is on one computer at a given location \u2014 particularly a home \u2014 I believe that there is probable cause to believe that it could be moved to any storage device or other computer at that same location.\u201d The court does not address whether these broad categories and date ranges meet the specificity requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. McDermott, 448 Mass. 750, 771-775, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 910 (2007) (concluding that each computer file is separate, closed container, and discussing limitations necessary on searches to be conducted of computer hard drives so that warrants to conduct such searches are not constitutionally infirm). The record here also does not indicate whether the Commonwealth sought a warrant as to the search of each of the devices once they had been seized and transported to the police laboratory. See <em>id. </em>at 774-775.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The trooper\u2019s affidavit suggests that the defendant made use of third-party services over the Internet to establish certain corporate telephone and facsimile numbers. The Web sites described in the affidavit, however, are explicitly discussed as services that would not require placing any documents on a suspect\u2019s own computer. They are described as permitting anonymous use, storing documents on the third-party service provider\u2019s computers, and permitting access to, for instance, e-mail message attachments without downloading anything to a user\u2019s own computer. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Falso, </em>544 F.3d 110, 112-114 (2d Cir. 2008) (warrant affidavit asserting after forensic examination of computer that defendant \u201cappeared to have gained or attempted to gain\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>access to Web site that distributed and sold child pornography, where e-mail address belonging to defendant was listed as subscriber to member section of Web site, defendant had Internet service from his house, and defendant had been convicted of prior misdemeanor sex offense, did not establish probable cause that images of child pornography would be found on defendant\u2019s computer).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Police suspect the two assignments to Baylor are fraudulent based on their communication with the closing attorneys involved in the sales of the two properties not long after the assignments had been recorded, and with the banks that previously held the mortgages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The trooper\u2019s affidavit states, without record support, that evidence seized from the external hard drive shows that the defendant used his computers to create the forged assignments. The documents described as having been observed on the external hard drive, however, which are the only specific documents described as existing on any of the seized devices, relate to an unsigned release of a mortgage on the defendant\u2019s own property, and not to any assignment to Baylor; nothing in the affidavit indicates how the documents were created.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">As the defendant described it to police, the communication program works like an online \u201cchat\u201d session; one person types, and the other person sees the message displayed on his or her computer screen. The message that the user types is encrypted before it is sent to the recipient. The program as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>described is not intended to create and store documents, or to encrypt computer drives, but, rather, to allow users to send messages back and forth in a secure way so that someone trying to eavesdrop on the messages being sent would be unable to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The court points to the defendant\u2019s statement to police that, \u201c[i]n order to decrypt the information, he would have to \u2018start the program\u2019 \u201d as being a reference to the \u201cDriveCrypt\u201d encryption software on the computer drives that it takes as an admission of control over the drives and the ability to decrypt them. The defendant was speaking, however, of the communication program he started in order to communicate in a \u201cchat\u201d session with the Russian individuals at Baylor, not of the encryption of the computer drives themselves. According to the defendant\u2019s statement, the communication program takes up very little space on a computer drive and can be installed on any device, including a removable \u201cflash\u201d drive; the program requires only an Internet connection, and can be run from anywhere, by inserting a \u201cflash\u201d drive into a computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The defendant, who is a native of Russia, obtained the program at a financial conference in Europe sometime in 2004, 2005, or 2006, because he intended to develop his business in the Russian market; he believed that encrypted communication was necessary to address Russian security concerns. In response to an explicit question, the defendant answered that he did not know whether the communication program saved the contents of any conversation on a computer drive, and then clarified that the communication program did not save any of the typed conversations but, rather, deleted them at the end of a communication session, and that he thought it did not store copies of the conversations because it was intended to be secure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\">When asked at another point about the location of the \u201cencryption device\u201d that he used to communicate with Baylor (\u201cIs it on your laptop? Is it on your desktop\u201d?), the defendant replied, \u201cAt different points it was.\u201d Whether the defendant was referring to the \u201claptop\u201d seized from his house or the \u201cnet-book\u201d seized from his car is unclear. It is also unclear which of the two other computers was meant by \u201cyour desktop.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The defendant stated that the computer in his home was in an area acces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>sible to anyone in the house or who came to his home office, and that Baylor employees accessed his computer using the encrypted communication program. On this record, the government has not shown that the defendant had exclusive access to the computers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">According to the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, the encryption program on the seized computers permits multiple users with distinct passwords, each potentially having access to a different portion of the computer drive. The government does not currently know how many user accounts exist on any of the computers, and to which portions, if any, of any particular computer the defendant has access. See <em>Trulock </em>v. <em>Freeh, </em>275 F.3d 391, 403-404 (4th Cir. 2001) (where two individuals shared use of computer, and both had access to entire computer hard drive, other user did not have authority to consent to search of suspect\u2019s password-protected files on that drive). The ability to enter a password to start the computer does not, therefore, indicate whether the defendant has access to or control over all of the different user accounts and different sections of the computer drives that may have been established on any of the seized computers; it would, however, potentially reveal to the Commonwealth the existence of other accounts, and possibly others who use the computers, about which the Commonwealth has indicated no knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The question is addressed by the defendant in his brief and by the Commonwealth in its reply brief. While the Commonwealth asserts in its reply brief, prior to a discussion on the merits, that the question of attorney-client privilege is not part of the reported question before the court, the plain language of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to report, which was allowed, and which is presented by the Commonwealth in its initial brief as \u201cthe issue presented for review,\u201d asks, \u201cCan the defendant be compelled <em>pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed protocol </em>to provide his key to seized encrypted digital evidence ...\u201d (emphasis supplied)? The joint stipulation of the parties as to the wording of the reported question uses identical language.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
