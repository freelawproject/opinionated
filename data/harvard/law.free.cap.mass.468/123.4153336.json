L. c. 258. The estate seeks to recover damages on account of the death of Steven Gavin (decedent), a death allegedly caused by negligent conduct on the part of hospital staff members. The primary issue before us is whether the statutory requirements for presentment of a claim under the act, see G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4 (\u00a7 4), were met when the presentment was made by the estate (through its attorney), and not by the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate. Ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, a judge concluded that the presentment requirement was not met in these circumstances, and allowed the motion. A divided panel of the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Estate of Gavin </em>v. <em>Tewksbury State Hosp., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 139 (2013). The case is before us on further appellate review. We conclude that in the circumstances of this case, the presentment made by the estate was proper. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The decedent died on August 11, 2008. In the weeks preceding his death, he was receiving inpatient care at the hospital for Huntington\u2019s disease; the estate claims that his death was caused by a bacterial infection due to the improper reinsertion of his feeding tube by the hospital\u2019s staff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The decedent had a will in which, it is reported without dispute, he named his father James T. Gavin (Thomas) the executor of his estate. Although the record contains no specific information, there also appears to be no dispute that the decedent\u2019s two children are his sole heirs. After the decedent\u2019s death, Thomas retained counsel to assist with the estate, and that counsel thereafter referred this matter to the estate\u2019s present counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(estate\u2019s counsel) who represents the estate as well as the decedent\u2019s parents, his two children, and the mother of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On or about July 21, 2010, the estate\u2019s counsel sent a presentment letter pursuant to \u00a7 4 to the office of the Attorney General and to the chief executive officer of the hospital, alleging that the hospital\u2019s negligent reinsertion of the feeding tube and subsequent failure to monitor the decedent caused his death. Presentment was made \u201con behalf of the estate of Steven Gavin.\u201d In the letter, counsel indicated that he represented the estate and the decedent\u2019s children. At the time presentment was made, however, no executor or administrator of the estate had been formally appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The Attorney General forwarded the presentment letter to the general counsel of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, requesting that she investigate the claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 30, 2010, the general counsel sent a letter to the estate\u2019s counsel, acknowledging receipt of the claim and stating, \u201cDuring the next several months, we will be reviewing your claim to determine whether a settlement offer is warranted . . . ,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The letter contained no indication that the presentment was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On March 24, 2011, apparently after not having received any response from the Commonwealth to its presentment, the estate filed this action in the Superior Court against the hospital and the Commonwealth (collectively, the Commonwealth) pursuant to G. L. c. 258 and G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 27, 2011, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss, arguing that the presentment requirement of \u00a7 4 had not been met because presentment had not been made by a duly appointed personal representative of the estate and, as a separate matter, that the estate was not authorized to bring an action for wrongful death because under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, any such claim must be brought by the appointed executor or administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On May 10, 2011, the decedent\u2019s parents, Thomas and Mary Gavin (collectively, the Gavins), were appointed temporary coexecutors of the estate by a judge in the Probate and Family Court. Shortly thereafter, in the Superior Court, the estate filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and moved to amend its complaint to name the Gavins, \u201cco-executors of the Estate of Steven Gavin,\u201d as the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">After a hearing, the judge allowed the motion to dismiss in a written memorandum of decision and order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Considering whether the presentment requirement had been met, the judge concluded that under \u00a7 4 a \u201cclaimant\u201d for presentment purposes must be a person with the legal authority to arbitrate, compromise, or settle the claim; that a wrongful death claim can only be brought by the executor or administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate; and that, therefore, in this case, the claimant must be the appointed executor or administrator. The judge held that because the presentment here was made only by the estate, it was defective and dismissal of the complaint was required.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The estate appealed, and the Appeals Court affirmed, substantially adopting the motion judge\u2019s rationale.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Estate of Gavin, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 144-145. One justice dissented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>concluding that in the circumstances of this case, the estate properly could serve as the claimant for purposes of meeting the presentment requirement in \u00a7 4. See <em>id. </em>at 146-155 (Agnes, J., dissenting). We granted the estate\u2019s application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cOrders on motions to dismiss ... are legal conclusions that this court reviews de nova.\u201d <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>464 Mass. 261, 266 (2013). In reviewing the judge\u2019s order in this case, like the Appeals Court, we consider two issues: (1) whether the presentment under \u00a7 4 was valid when made by the estate as the claimant before the appointment of an executor or administrator; and (2) whether the wrongful death action in any event must be dismissed because it was brought in the name of the estate rather than by a duly appointed executor or administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">a. <em>Meaning of \u201cclaimant\u201d for purposes of presentment. </em>Enacted in 1978, see St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15, the act makes public employers liable for property loss, injury, or death caused by the negligence of public employees acting within the scope of their employment. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>387 Mass. 43, 45 (1982). The presentment requirement, set out in \u00a7 4, requires a claimant to \u201cfirst present[] his claim in writing to the executive officer of such public employer within two years after the date upon which the cause of action arose.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The public employer has six months from presentment to deny the claim or reach a settlement, and a failure to respond is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>considered a denial. At the end of six months, the claimant may institute a civil action. Presentment is not jurisdictional but \u201ca statutory condition precedent to recovery under G. L. c. 258.\u201d <em>Vasys </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>387 Mass. 51, 55 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The parties do not dispute that the estate\u2019s presentment met the time requirement of \u00a7 4; was directed to the proper executive official, namely, the Attorney General on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is the \u201cexecutive officer\u201d in charge of the executive office ultimately responsible for the hospital; and described in sufficient detail a factual basis for the claimed negligence on the part of hospital staff. The sole question is whether the estate was a proper \u201cclaimant\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4. As the judge recognized, the question arises because the estate\u2019s claim is for wrongful death, and under the Commonwealth\u2019s wrongful death statute, see G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, such an action must be brought by the executor or administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>MacDonald </em>v. Moore, 358 Mass. 801, 801 (1970) (\u201cNo action . . . can be maintained for death . . . unless it is brought by the decedent\u2019s executor or administrator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We turn to the meaning of the term \u201cclaimant,\u201d mindful that \u201c[a] term appearing in different portions of a statute is to be given one consistent meaning.\u201d <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Nantucket County, </em>437 Mass. 430, 436 (2002), citing <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>327 Mass. 694, 700 (1951). The act itself does not define the term. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1. \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. 118, 124 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third (legislative directive that nontechnical words and phrases in statutes \u201cshall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language\u201d). \u201cWe derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Seideman </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>452 Mass. 472, 478 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., supra. </em>Here, the usual and accepted meaning of \u201cclaimant\u201d is \u201c[o]ne who asserts a right or demand.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 282 (9th ed. 2009). See Webster\u2019s New World Law Dictionary 74 (2006) (defining \u201cclaimant\u201d as \u201c[a]n individual or entity who asserts a right or demand to money or property\u201d). See also <em>Estate of Gavin, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 147 (Agnes, L, dissenting), quoting Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 414 (1993) (defining \u201cclaimant\u201d as \u201cone that asserts a right or title\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The Commonwealth contends that because the term \u201cclaimant\u201d is used in other sections of the act in contexts that, in its view, clearly require the claimant to have legal authority to sue, we are bound to conclude that the same holds true in the presentment context under \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Appeals Court agreed. See <em>Estate of Gavin, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 145. In any event, the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>monwealth continues, \u201c[i]t is not sensible that the Legislature intended the word \u2018claimant\u2019 to mean someone who could assert a wrongful death claim without the requisite authority, where the same claimant could not initiate a civil proceeding, or bring the claim to finality during the presentment stage of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reasoning is not without force, but, like the dissenting justice in the Appeals Court,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we think it significant that, in the act, the Legislature did not choose to define \u201cclaimant\u201d in the restricted manner suggested by the Commonwealth \u2014 despite including a section that contains very specific definitions of many of the act\u2019s significant, frequently used terms. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1. The absence of a statutory definition is relevant because interpreting \u201cclaimant\u201d in its ordinary sense still gives full effect to all provisions of the act. See <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 136, 140 (1998) (statute must be construed to give effect to all provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In arguing that \u201cclaimant\u201d must be understood to mean one with legal authority to bring suit on the claim, the Commonwealth appears to conflate the requirements of the act and the requirements of the wrongful death statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. The Commonwealth, however, does not point to any support in the language or history of the act for this fused interpretation of the two statutes, and we have found none. The act makes no mention of a wrongful death claim. Rather, as the Appeals Court stated, it is far more typical that, when a claim is made under the act, the claimant has not died, but is \u201cthe person injured, acting personally or through an attorney.\u201d <em>Estate of Gavin, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 144. Further, the myriad concerns raised by the Commonwealth regarding the negative consequences of a wrongful death action brought by someone other than the executor or administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate appear to be rooted in a source considering only G. L. c. 229, and making no mention of the act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Marco </em>v. <em>Green, </em>415 Mass. 732 (1993). There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>nothing intrinsic to the act that requires us to construe its terms in light of the requirements of G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, and we find no reason for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We do not find any indication in the language of the act, considered on its own, that in using the term \u201cclaimant,\u201d the Legislature intended to address the legal authority of the person mating the claim, and in particular that person\u2019s legal authority to file a civil action in court if the claim were administratively denied. Thus, in construing the act, we adopt the ordinary meaning of \u201cclaimant\u201d simply as one who asserts a right or demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Defining \u201cclaimant\u201d in the way that we do finds support in the act\u2019s history and purpose. See, e.g., <em>Matter of the Liquidation of Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 796, 801-802 (2004), quoting <em>Boylston </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>434 Mass. 398, 401 (2001) (\u201cBecause the statutory language \u2018does not provide a definite answer to the question, it is appropriate to consult other sources to obtain a resolution,\u2019 . . . including the relevant legislative history, insofar as it sheds light on the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the section\u201d). The act was passed in 1978 in response to \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s desire to abolish \u2018sovereign immunity and the crazy quilt of exceptions to sovereign immunity . . . which courts [had] stitched together.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>464 Mass. at 266, quoting <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 338-339 (1984). See <em>Weaver, </em>387 Mass. at 48-49. We are instructed to construe its provisions \u201cliberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.\u201d St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18. See <em>Vasys, </em>387 Mass. at 57. Two \u201cequally important\u201d purposes of the act are to \u201cto allow plaintiffs with valid causes of action to recover in negligence against governmental entities . . . [and] to preserve the stability and effectiveness of government by providing a mechanism which will result in payment of only those claims against governmental entities which are valid, in amounts which are reasonable and not inflated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Considering both purposes, we are to strike \u201c[a]n appropriate balance . . . between the public interest in fairness to injured persons and in promoting effective government.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 216 (1977). Accord <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>397 Mass. 775, 778-779 (1986); <em>George </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>394 Mass. 40, 43 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In the present case, interpreting \u201cclaimant\u201d to include the estate strikes the \u201cappropriate balance\u201d between the act\u2019s dual purposes. See <em>Vasys, </em>387 Mass. at 57, quoting <em>Whitney, </em>373 Mass. at 216 (liberal interpretation of presentment requirement best achieves balance among act\u2019s purposes). At its core, the presentment requirement is about protecting the interests of the government, giving the Commonwealth and other public employers \u201cthe opportunity to investigate and settle claims and to prevent future claims through notice to executive officers.\u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>464 Mass. at 268. The presentment made by the estate did not prevent or inhibit the Commonwealth from accomplishing any of these tasks \u2014 nothing about the presentment being made by the estate rather than an appointed executor or administrator interfered with the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to investigate the claim presented by the estate, to settle the claim if it chose to do so, or to take steps to prevent similar claims arising in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Thus, with respect to investigation, there was never any ambiguity as to the identity of the individuals behind the claim presented by the estate: the presentment letter made the Commonwealth aware that the claim, although in the name of the estate, was made on behalf of the decedent\u2019s children, who were the persons entitled to recover under a successful wrongful death claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As such, the presentment would not have unfairly \u201cbaffled or misled\u201d the \u201ceducated public officials\u201d who received and investigated the claim. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 718, 723 (1994). Indeed, the Commonwealth does not argue that presentment in this case created any obstacle to its investigation. Certainly the letter from the general counsel of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services to the estate\u2019s counsel did not mention a concern about being prevented from conducting a full investigation of the claim because it had been proffered by the estate rather than the appointed executor or administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">As for settlement, the estate\u2019s presentment prevented the Commonwealth neither from initiating settlement discussions nor from ultimately settling with the estate. At the time of presentment, the estate may not have been authorized to reach a formal settlement and release, but we can discern no principled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>reason to conclude that requiring such authority at the beginning of the six-month presentment period is, in itself, essential to the settlement process. Here, if the parties were to have reached a settlement agreement within the presentment period, the Commonwealth could have required the estate to ensure that an executor or administrator was appointed and to provide proof of that authority before signing off on a final resolution and payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Our cases requiring presentment to be made in strict compliance with the act are not to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>Weaver, </em>387 Mass. at 47; <em>Bellanti </em>v. <em>Boston Pub. Health Comm\u2019n, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 408 (2007). In <em>Weaver, supra </em>at 44-46, the issue was whether presentment was valid when it was sent to the wrong party \u2014 in that case, to the Commissioner of Mental Health and a hospital administrator rather than the Secretary of Human Services. We held that the presentment was defective, reasoning that proper presentment to the person with authority to settle the claim before a suit is filed is essential to fulfilling the purpose of the act. <em>Id. </em>at 47. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 5. In particular, presentment to the appropriate executive officer is critical because that officer alone is \u201ccharged with the over-all financial and budgetary responsibility\u201d for the relevant agency or department and, as \u201c[t]he highest officer,\u201d is in a unique position to not only initiate an investigation, \u201cbut also to make provision, during the budgetary process, for the payment of valid claims, and to institute promptly any corrective measures designed to reduce the number of valid claims in the future.\u201d <em>Weaver, supra </em>at 48.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Here, however, where the issue is whether presentment was made <em>by </em>the proper person, rather than <em>to </em>the proper person, these concerns are not implicated. See <em>Estate of Gavin, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 150-151 (Agnes, 1, dissenting). Cf. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528-529 (2002) (considering content of presentment letter in light of <em>Weaver </em>and concluding that \u201cclose scrutiny discloses that the \u2018strict compliance\u2019 precept is concerned more with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>whether presentment has been made to the proper executive officer [proper party noticed] in a timely fashion [timeliness] than with the content of the presentment [adequacy of content]\u201d). There is no doubt that here, in accordance with <em>Weaver, supra </em>at 47-48, presentment was made to the proper executive officer who had adequate opportunity to investigate and, if necessary, to plan for settlement in light of her authority over the over-all budget. <em>Weaver </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The Commonwealth argues that, as a general matter, the government\u2019s ability to settle is affected by allowing presentment to be made by a claimant without legal authority because doing so exposes a public employer to repeated liability and leaves the decedent\u2019s next of kin and beneficiaries unprotected. In support of its argument, the Commonwealth cites <em>Marco </em>v. <em>Green, </em>415 Mass. at 732, a wrongful death case that did not concern the act at all.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We disagree with the Commonwealth that <em>Marco </em>raises the specter of unprotected beneficiaries and repeated government liability under the act, or, more specifically, that the facts of this case present any such threat. <em>Marco </em>broadly stands for the proposition that, when negotiating, each party is responsible for making sure that the other has the requisite authority to negotiate and execute a settlement. See <em>Marco, </em>415 Mass. at 736-739. The act can be read, at least implicitly, to recognize this point and to take steps to deal with it by requiring every settlement over $2,500 to be approved by the appropriate \u201cpublic attorney\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or, in the case of a settlement involving the Commonwealth over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>$20,000, by the Secretary of Administration and Finance; and further requiring that every agreed-upon settlement over $20,000 also must be approved by a Superior Court judge. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7. These requirements for attorney or executive review and approval in every case of some monetary significance suggest that the drafters of the act were aware of the need to ensure that settlements are only entered into carefully and after due consideration, but wished to charge public employers with the responsibility for doing so through their attorneys and executive officers \u2014 not the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In sum, it does not appear that the Commonwealth would suffer any prejudice from the presentment that it received. Adhering to the directive to strive for the appropriate balance between the Commonwealth\u2019s interests and the interests of the injured parties,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> see <em>Vasys, </em>387 Mass. at 57, we conclude that the term \u201cclaimant\u201d as used in \u00a7 4 includes the estate in the circumstances of the present case. \u201c[T]he presentment requirement is not intended to demand such rigid particularization as to reincarnate sovereign immunity and bar legitimate claims for failing to invoke perfectly the correct \u2018Open Sesame.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martin, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 530. Demanding such stringency would elevate form over substance; we decline to do so.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">b. <em>Wrongful death claim. </em>The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the complaint on the separate ground that it was brought on behalf of the estate, thereby failing to meet the threshold requirement of G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. Although the judge declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>reach this issue, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth raises it again here.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The Commonwealth contends that the original complaint was clearly defective because it was brought by a party without authority to do so; that the subsequent motion to amend the complaint by substituting as plaintiffs the Gavins in their capacities as temporary coexecutors could not remedy the original deficiency; and that, accordingly, denial of the motion to amend on futility grounds was proper. This is so, the Commonwealth argues, because as <em>temporary </em>coexecutors, the Gavins lacked the requisite authority to bring a wrongful death action. See <em>Marco, </em>415 Mass. at 736-739. Finally, although the Commonwealth acknowledges in this appeal that the Gavins were appointed coexecutors of the estate on July 27, 2011, it asserts that this information was not part of the record below and, therefore, should not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The wrongful death statute is clear that an action for wrongful death must be brought by the executor or administrator of the deceased. G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. <em>MacDonald, </em>358 Mass. at 801. But cf. <em>Estate of Moulton </em>v. <em>Puopolo, </em>467 Mass. 478, 480 n.8 (2014) (wrongful death action brought by estate not precluded when Commonwealth withdrew initial objection and parties proceeded as if estate were properly before Superior Court throughout litigation). Given the statutory command, we reject the estate\u2019s argument that a wrongful death action may properly be brought by the estate or even a temporary executor. See <em>Marco, </em>415 Mass. at 736-739. This case, however, must be remanded to the Superior Court because improper presentment was the sole ground on which the motion judge based his dismissal of the complaint, and we have now concluded that the presentment letter filed by the estate on July 21, 2010, was valid. On remand, the estate may seek leave again to amend the complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), to address the issue concerning the identity of the proper plaintiff.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The estate of Steven Gavin (estate) states that the cause of death listed on the death certificate was \u201cfibrinopurulent organizing peritonitis, bilateral aspiration pneumonia.\u201d An autopsy report noted that \u201cthe findings are most consistent with leak from the gastronomy tube as the cause of the peritonitis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The record is not clear as to the date the presentment letter was received, but no one disputes that it was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The letter additionally stated, \u201cWe would appreciate your providing further information which would assist us in evaluating your claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\">In the complaint, the estate alleges that it may bring suit against the Commonwealth and Tewksbury State Hospital (collectively, the Commonwealth) because the statutory six-month presentment waiting period, prescribed by G.

The record does not indicate whether the Commonwealth investigated the claim or communicated with the estate during the presentment period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The first amended complaint erroneously identifies James T. and Mary Gavin (collectively, the Gavins) as coexecutors of estate when they were actually temporary executors, appointed pursuant to G.

In its reply brief filed in this court, the estate notes that on July 27, 2011, the Gavins formally were appointed executors of the estate. The estate asserts that it sent notice of these appointments to the Superior Court and counsel for the Commonwealth on the same day (July 27). No docket entry or anything else in the record indicates whether the notice was received by the Superior Court or, if so, provided to the judge. Accordingly, we do not know whether the judge became aware of the Gavins\u2019 appointments before allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Having concluded that dismissal of the complaint was required on account of the allegedly defective presentment, the judge declined to address the Commonwealth\u2019s second ground for dismissal, namely, that the estate was not authorized to bring an action for wrongful death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\">In its opinion the Appeals Court further noted, however, that \u201c[ajpart from the failure of presentment, the complaint for wrongful death also could not properly be maintained and was subject to dismissal because it had not been brought by the duly authorized executor or administrator on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>heirs at law and next of kin as required by statute.\u201d <em>Estate of Gavin </em>v. <em>Tewksbury State Hosp., </em>83 Mass.

See <em>id. </em>at 733 &amp; n.5. Thereafter, the decedent\u2019s spouse, who was the appointed administratrix with the will annexed of the estate, filed a wrongful death action in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. <em>Id. </em>Considering whether the second claim was barred by the first, this court held that the voluntary administratrix had no legal authority to bring or settle a claim for wrongful death and, therefore, that the appointed administratrix could proceed with her claim regardless of the fact that the defendants previously had paid the voluntary administratrix a $375,000 settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 739.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The term \u201c[pjublic attorney\u201d is defined in part in G.

R. Civ. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), apply to presentment under \u00a7 4. The facts of this case do not require us to consider this issue, and we see no need here to revisit the principle stated in <em>Weaver, </em>387 Mass. at 48, that relation back principles in rule 15 (c) do not apply to the presentment requirement. Rule 15 (c)\u2019s relation back principles do apply to any action filed in the Superior Court following the end of the presentment period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The Commonwealth concedes that, if the presentment was indeed proper, relation back principles could apply to the wrongful death claim. However, it argues that the Gavins, as coexecutors, are nevertheless precluded from amending their complaint at this late stage. This is particularly so, it claims, given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>fact that the estate could have filed either a motion to amend its complaint after the Gavins were appointed (before the judge issued his decision) or a motion for reconsideration after the motion to dismiss was allowed, but did neither. We disagree that these considerations bar the judge from considering a motion to amend on remand, should the estate choose to file one. As to the Commonwealth\u2019s first point, although the estate did not move to amend after the Gavins\u2019 appointment as coexecutors, the record reflects that it made a good faith effort promptly to inform the Superior Court of this change before the court issued its decision on the motion to dismiss. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>As to the second \u25a0\u2014 that the Gavins should have filed a motion for reconsideration \u2014 given the judge\u2019s ruling that the presentment was improper, any attempt to do so would have been futile. These circumstances \u2014 particularly in light of the numerous equities discussed throughout this opinion \u2014 permit the judge on remand to consider a motion to amend, despite its delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
