The defendant was charged with manslaughter, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13; serious bodily injury and homicide<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by vessel, G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7\u00a7 8A, 8B; and three counts of child endangerment while operating a vessel while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24V.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In an interview with police following the collision, the defendant admitted to having drunk beer before operating the boat, but responded negatively to the question whether he had \u201cconsume[d] any other, you know, substances that could\u2019ve impaired [his] ability to, you know, be aware of what was going on around [him].\u201d Because police later discovered that the defendant had smoked marijuana before the collision, the defendant also was charged, under the witness intimidation statute, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B (\u00a7 13B), with misleading a police officer. Evidence of his negative response to the question was admitted against him at trial; the jury were instructed to consider such evidence only in relation to the \u00a7 13B misleading charge. A Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of misleading a police officer and misdemeanor homicide by vessel, and acquitted him of the other charges. The defendant appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The defendant challenges the validity of both convictions. He argues that his conviction of misleading a police officer should be reversed because the statute, as applied, violates the prohibition in art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights against the compelled furnishing of evidence against oneself. He further argues that the statute violates the common-law rule against the admission of evidence of a defendant\u2019s unequivocal denial of a police accusation, and that the statute, as applied to him, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant also contends that his homicide conviction should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence that he was operating while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We conclude that there was insufficient evidence that the defendant misled a police officer with the specific intent necessary to prove a violation of \u00a7 13B, and therefore reverse that conviction. We affirm the homicide conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Events of August, 2010. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found based on the evidence at trial. The defendant spent part of August 17, 2010, at Norwich Lake in Huntington, where his family owned a cottage. Before arriving at the lake, the defendant had worked at his landscaping business. Upon finishing work at approximately 2:30 or 3 p.m., the defendant and his employee, Brian Friguglietti, drank beer and smoked marijuana at the defendant\u2019s shop. The defendant consumed two cans of beer and took one \u201chit\u201d of marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The defendant and Friguglietti arrived at the lake in the late afternoon, where they met the defendant\u2019s wife and children. The defendant and Friguglietti went on the water in a motorboat and pulled the defendant\u2019s children behind the boat in inflatable inner tubes. They returned to shore close to 5 p.m., at which point the defendant consumed \u201ctwo beers\u201d and took two hits of marijuana. Approximately one hour later, an acquaintance drove by in another boat and asked the defendant to pull him around the lake while he waterskied, since the children accompanying him were too young to operate the vessel. The defendant agreed, and began to pilot the acquaintance\u2019s boat, with three children as passengers, pulling the waterskier behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The path of the boat coincided with a patch of glare on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>water, which had become more extreme as the sun had begun to set.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Shortly after entering the patch of glare, sometime between 6 and 6:30 p.m., the defendant\u2019s boat struck the kayak in which Augustus and his father were fishing. Augustus was thrown from the kayak and submerged underwater for a period of time. When he surfaced, his arm was missing and there was a deep gash in his back. The defendant brought Augustus to shore in the motorboat, where he was loaded into an ambulance. Augustus died as a result of his injuries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">An environmental police officer interviewed the defendant on the lakeshore approximately one hour after the collision. When the defendant admitted to drinking two beers at 5 p.m., the officer administered several field sobriety tests, which the defendant completed successfully. Although a portable breathalyzer test detected the presence of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s system, the officer did not smell an odor of alcohol, nor did he observe the defendant\u2019s eyes to be red or bloodshot or his speech to be slurred. The defendant cooperated with the questioning and his responses were coherent. At the end of the interview, the defendant, who was not under arrest, agreed to return to the State police barracks for further questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">At the barracks, the defendant submitted to a breathalyzer test at approximately 9:30 p.m.; the test showed a blood alcohol level of 0.00 per cent. A State police detective and trooper then resumed questioning the defendant about the circumstances of the collision, after providing him with the requisite Miranda warnings. The defendant acknowledged having consumed <em>\u201ca </em>couple of beers earlier in the day\u201d while at his shop, but maintained that he had not consumed alcohol after leaving his shop and was not impaired while piloting the boat. Police then asked whether he had consumed other substances that day:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">Trooper: \u201cDid you consume any \u2014 are you on any kind of medication?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">Defendant: \u201cNope.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Trooper: \u201cDid you consume any other, you know, substances that could\u2019ve impaired your ability to, you know, be aware of what was going on around you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Defendant: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">At the end of the interview, police told the defendant that he was free to leave, and he departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">On August 23, 2010, State troopers contacted the defendant again after learning new information during the course of their investigation concerning the defendant\u2019s marijuana use on the day of the collision, August 17. They arranged to meet the defendant in a parking lot to ask him some follow-up questions. During the meeting, the defendant told the troopers that he had smoked marijuana at his shop on the day in question, and also that he had \u201chit the bowl twice\u201d after arriving at the lake, approximately one hour before starting to pull the waterskier on the motorboat; during his interview on August 17, he had not mentioned smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">b. <em>Pretrial and trial proceedings. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant moved to preclude admission of evidence that, during his interview with police, he had denied consuming other substances that could have impaired his \u201cability to ... be aware of what was going on around [him].\u201d In support of the motion, the defendant argued that the presentation of such evidence at trial would violate the common-law rule against admission of a defendant\u2019s denial of a police accusation. On the morning of the first day of trial, the defendant also moved to sever the charge for misleading a police officer from the underlying charges arising from the boating collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The judge ruled that the evidence was inadmissible to prove the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt of the underlying charges, but that it could be used to establish that the defendant misled police, in violation of \u00a7 13B, a charge the judge declined to sever. During trial, an audio recording of the defendant\u2019s August 17, 2010, police interview was played for the jury,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a State trooper testified that, if police had known on August 17 that the defendant had smoked marijuana before operating the boat, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>would have called a drug recognition expert to examine him at the police station, and would have sought a warrant to draw his blood and search his vehicle for marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The defendant also moved before trial to exclude evidence that he had consumed alcohol before the collision, arguing that such evidence would be unduly prejudicial where there was no other evidence of impairment. This motion was denied after the pretrial voir dire testimony of a drug recognition expert. At trial, in support of its theory that the defendant operated the vessel while under the influence, the Commonwealth introduced the aforesaid evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s consumption of beer and marijuana on August 17, 2010, and called the drug recognition expert to testify to the effects of both substances on the average person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The expert explained that the effects of ingesting marijuana include dilation of the pupils, increased blood pressure, and impaired perception of time and distance, and that the effects can persist for several hours following ingestion. The expert also described symptoms attendant to alcohol consumption, as well as the \u201csynergistic effect\u201d of alcohol and marijuana working in tandem, which can slow an individual\u2019s reaction time to light stimuli. An individual who ingested both alcohol and marijuana, the expert testified, could experience an unusual degree of pupillary dilation, which would permit a greater amount of light to enter the eyes; this could cause the individual to react by turning away from the light source.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In his final instructions to the jury, the judge explained that they could convict under G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 8B (2), if they found either that the defendant had operated the boat while under the influence of an intoxicating substance or that he had operated recklessly or negligently so as to endanger the lives or safety of the public. At the defendant\u2019s request, the judge further informed the jury that a conviction under that statute had to be unanimous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>as to the theory of guilt. When the jury returned a verdict of guilty of misdemeanor homicide by vessel, however, they did not specify a theory of guilt either in open court or on the verdict slip.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The judge\u2019s final charge also included instructions regarding the proper use of the defendant\u2019s statements to police. The judge instructed the jury that, if they accepted evidence that the defendant denied having \u201cingested any substance other than alcohol that could or would have impaired his ability to know what was going on around him,\u201d they could consider such evidence only in relation to the charge of misleading a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Conviction of misleading a police officer. </em>Because we have not considered the application of \u00a7 13B to a defendant who, when responding to police questions concerning his potentially criminal conduct, falsely denied such conduct, we first set forth the existing statutory scheme for prosecuting crimes against public justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">i. <em>Overview of crimes against public justice. </em>There is no general obstruction of justice statute in Massachusetts, as there is in the Federal system and in a number of other States. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a) (2006) (whoever \u201ccorruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice\u201d shall be punished); Ark. Code. Ann. \u00a7 5-54-102 (1987) (\u201c[a] person commits the offense of obstructing governmental operations if the person,\u201d inter alla, \u201c[kjnowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the performance of any governmental function\u201d); N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 195.05 (McKinney 2010) (\u201cA person is guilty of obstructing governmental administration when he intentionally obstructs, impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function or prevents or attempts to prevent a public servant from performing an official function, by[, inter alla,] means of intimidation, physical force or interference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Instead, a patchwork of statutes establishes various \u201ccrimes against public justice\u201d and \u201ccrimes against public peace,\u201d some of which involve uttering false statements or interfering with governmental operations in different capacities. For example, the perjury statute, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 1, prohibits wilfully swear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing or affirming falsely in a deposition or otherwise while under oath as to a matter material to the issue in question. It is also a criminal offense to, inter alla, knowingly and wilfully furnish a false name or Social Security number to a law enforcement officer following arrest, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 34A; to fail to report crimes under certain circumstances, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 40; and to knowingly and intentionally make a false report of crime, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 13A.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">One of the broader statutes in the category of \u201ccrimes against public justice\u201d is \u00a7 13B, the statute under which the defendant in this case was convicted of misleading a police officer. The scope of that statute, titled \u201cIntimidation of witnesses, jurors and persons furnishing information in connection with criminal proceedings,\u201d has been enlarged since its enactment in 1969, most substantially in 2006, but is still fundamentally a \u201cwitness intimidation statute.\u201d See St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 3; St. 1969, c. 460. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>459 Mass. 422, 434 n.16 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 530, 532-534 (2010). The 2006 version of the statute, relevant here, remains concerned primarily with countering the effect of witness intimidation on the successful prosecution of criminals. See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, as appearing in St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 3; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 534. In this regard, it does not contain the sort of \u201comnibus\u201d or \u201ccatchall\u201d obstruction of justice provision included in a similar Federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, that proscribes the influencing of court officers and jurors. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Aguilar, </em>515 U.S. 593, 598 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">ii. <em>Legislative history of \u00a7 13B. </em>Section 13B was enacted in 1969, see St. 1969, c. 460, and was not amended substantially until 2006, when the Legislature added the prohibition against misleading a police officer relevant to this case. See St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 3. In its original form, its purpose, \u201crather obviously, [was] to protect witnesses from being bullied or harried so that they [did] not become reluctant to testify or to give truthful evidence in investigatory or judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCreary, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 797, 799 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>442 Mass. 299, 309 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u201c[P]rior to the 2006 amendment, \u00a7 13B separately criminalized two discrete types of misconduct: \u2018(1) interference, actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>or threatened, with a witness or juror during the pendency of a criminal proceeding, and (2) physical injury to person or property undertaken in retaliation for testimony given at a criminal proceeding, regardless of when such acts are carried out.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, supra </em>at 433, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cathy C., </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 472 (2005).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The 2006 amendment overhauled \u00a7 13B as part of a larger \u201cact reducing gang violence\u201d (act), significantly expanding its scope in the process, although not its essential purpose. See St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 3. The act adopted many of the recommendations of a report of the Joint Committee on Public Safety, titled \u201cReducing Gang Violence in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\u201d 2005 Senate Doc. No. 26. That report had noted an \u201calarming trend toward witness intimidation cases, which can seriously undermine the successful prosecution of known gang members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. To that end, one of the report\u2019s chief proposals was the enactment of \u201cstronger witness and victim intimidation laws to ensure the prosecution of known gang members,\u201d and explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c[t]he criminal justice system only works if witnesses can testify free from fear of retribution. Criminals and gang members use a number of methods to intimidate victims and witnesses and force perjured statements under oath. Important changes to Massachusetts law can be made to provide prosecutors and police officers with additional power to keep dangerous criminals off the streets and away from witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The act adopted the report\u2019s recommendations by \u201cexpanding] the scope of the conduct prohibited [by \u00a7 13B], the classes of victims protected, and the types of criminal proceedings covered.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Figueroa, 464 Mass. 365, 368 (2013). As a result, \u00a7 13B for the first time outlawed \u201cmisleading]\u201d and \u201charassing]\u201d conduct, in addition to the \u201cthreatening]\u201d and \u201cintimidating]\u201d conduct that the prior version of the statute had proscribed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Beyond simply witnesses and jurors, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>prohibited such conduct targeted at police officers, judges, and attorneys, among others. The amended statute also criminalized misleading, intimidating, or harassing not only people who had furnished information to criminal investigators, as the old version had, but also people who were aware of such information, were furthering a criminal proceeding in any capacity, or were attending such a proceeding or had made their intentions to attend known. \u201cThe over-all purpose and effect of the amendment was therefore to expand the scope of the statute to address heightened concerns with witness intimidation and its interference with the successful prosecution of gang members and other street violence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 534. See <em>Hrycenko </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>459 Mass. 503, 507-508 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">iii. <em>\u201cMisleading\u201d prong of \u00a7 13B. </em>Under the \u201cmisleading\u201d prong of \u00a7 13B, as relevant to this case, whoever directly or indirectly (1) wilfully misleads (2) a police officer (3) with the intent to impede, obstruct, delay, harm, punish, or otherwise interfere thereby with a criminal investigation shall be punished.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B (1) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Because the term \u201cmisleads\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 13B, we have provided a working definition to explain what constitutes \u201cmisleading conduct,\u201d as we have done for the term \u201cintimidates,\u201d similarly undefined by the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 109 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCreary, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 797, 799 (1998) (setting forth elements of \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>we adopted the definition of \u201cmisleading\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>appears in the Federal witness-tampering statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> According to that definition, \u201cmisleading conduct\u201d comprises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201c(A) knowingly making a false statement; (B) intentionally omitting information from a statement and thereby causing a portion of such statement to be misleading, or intentionally concealing a material fact, and thereby creating a false impression by such statement; (C) with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a writing or recording that is false, forged, altered, or otherwise lacking in authenticity; (D) with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a sample, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>specimen, map, photograph, boundary mark, or other object that is misleading in a material respect; or (E) knowingly using a trick, scheme, or device with intent to mislead.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 372, quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(a)(3) (2006). Each aspect of the definition adopted suggests a knowing or intentional act calculated to lead another person astray. Objectively misleading conduct, as defined, is not enough, however, to establish the offense. In addition to the requirement that there be knowing or intentional conduct that is objectively misleading as defined, a statutory violation is not established unless there is also proof of a defendant\u2019s specific intent to \u201cimpede, obstruct, delay, harm, punish, or otherwise interfere thereby\u201d with a criminal investigation. G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B (1) (c) (v) (impeding element).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">iv. <em>Application to this case. </em>Turning to the facts of this case, we conclude that evidence that the defendant denied having ingested substances that could have resulted in his impairment while operating the motorboat was insufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction under \u00a7 13B.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">It is far from clear in the first instance that the defendant\u2019s statement to police at issue can be viewed as constituting either (A) a knowingly false statement, or (B) one that intentionally omitted information, thereby causing it to be misleading, or intentionally concealed a material fact, thereby creating a false impression.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra </em>at 372. During the August 17, 2010, interview, police did not ask the defendant point-blank whether he had smoked marijuana that day. They instead inquired somewhat opaquely as to whether he had \u201cconsume[d] any other, you know, substances that could\u2019ve impaired [his] ability to, you know, be aware of what was going on around [him].\u201d The question was not a model of clarity and, as phrased, required the defendant to assess the idiosyncratic effects of various substances on his own alertness and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Such a subjective assessment is not capable of being proven false. See <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, </em>431 Mass. 748, 756 (2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>(subjective statements of opinion not susceptible of being proven false). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>353 Mass. 1, 15 (1967) (\u201cA conviction for perjury must be based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the intentional falsity of an answer susceptible of a reasonably ascertainable meaning\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>5 Gray 78, 79 (1855) (witness\u2019s false swearing to fact, which he believes to be true to best of his knowledge, does not constitute perjury). We are hard pressed to say that a personal evaluation of bodily response to a particular intoxicating substance, like the one at issue here, can rise to the level of a knowingly false statement or an intentional omission of a material fact. This is only underscored where the over-all direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s impairment from either substance ingested was far from compelling, as discussed <em>infra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>350 Mass. 102, 112 (1966), <em>S.C., </em>353 Mass. 1 (1967), overruled on other grounds by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffee, </em>379 Mass. 353 (1979) (in perjury context, knowledge of testimony\u2019s falsity \u201cmay be inferred by the trier of fact from circumstantial evidence, which reasonably tends to show that knowledge existed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Even assuming, as the Commonwealth argues, that \u201cwhat the trooper was getting at\u201d would have been clear to a reasonable person, such that the defendant\u2019s statement indeed was knowingly false, there was insufficient evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), that the defendant had the specific intent necessary to satisfy the impeding element of the offense, in order to prove a violation of \u00a7 13B.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In other cases brought under the \u201cmisleading\u201d prong, such specific intent has been ascertained inferentially from a defendant\u2019s affirmative misrepresentations, plainly and demonstrably false, to law enforcement authorities. For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra </em>at 372-373,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201c[a] parole officer was investigating a possible violation of her directive that the defendant remain home after 6 p.m. on Halloween to avoid congregating with children who were out trick-or-treating .... On being asked why he left his home, the defendant told his parole officer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>he had attended an [Alcoholics Anonymous] meeting in Framingham and that the [global positioning system (GPS)] information reflecting that he had been in an apartment complex must have arisen from a \u2018glitch\u2019 in the GPS system. He intentionally concealed his visit to [his girl friend\u2019s] apartment and his trick-or-treating activities with her children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fortuna, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 45, 47 (2011), the defendant told police that he had been shot from far away while walking home, \u201cbut that he did not know by whom or how.\u201d However, subsequent observation revealed black soot or gunshot residue around the defendant\u2019s wound and on his clothing, suggesting that the shooter was in very close proximity to the defendant and that the defendant\u2019s account of the shooting was false. <em>Id. </em>In affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction of misleading a police officer under \u00a7 13B, the Appeals Court concluded that, \u201c[i]n light of the inconsistency between the defendant\u2019s account and expert testimony that he was shot at from a distance of no more than one and one-half feet away, the jury could have inferred that the defendant lied to the police and that he did so both intentionally and with the intent to mislead them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In those cases, the juries could have inferred from the defendants\u2019 affirmative falsehoods a specific intent to lead investigators astray, for the purposes of thereby impeding, obstructing, delaying, harming, punishing, or otherwise interfering with a criminal investigation or other aspects of the criminal process. See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B (1). Here, however, there was no evidence of affirmative misdirection on the defendant\u2019s part. The defendant\u2019s statement, the simple word \u201cno,\u201d was an exculpatory denial, not a content-laden fabrication designed to send police off course, thereby interfering with their investigation. After this negative response, police were in the same position they would have been in had the defendant instead remained silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Absent additional evidence of specific intent, such exculpatory denials, standing alone, rarely will permit a reasonable inference that a defendant possessed the specific intent necessary to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>a violation of \u00a7 13B.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> According to the principle of noscitur a sociis, \u201ca word gains meaning from others with which it is associated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gallant, 453 Mass. 535, 542 (2009), quoting HJ. Alperin &amp; L.D. Shubow, Summary of Basic Law \u00a7 19.10, at 846 (3d ed. 1996). The definitions of both \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201charass,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which appear in a list in the statute with \u201cmisleads,\u201d suggest malicious acts calculated to produce</p>\n<p id=\"AEU\">certain effects on a third party, implying a similar meaning for the word \u201cmisleads.\u201d See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B (1) (c) (\u201cWhoever, directly or indirectly, willfully misleads, intimidates or harasses another person. . .\u201d). However, when an individual denies his guilt, either falsely or truthfully, without otherwise making any affirmative misrepresentations or attempting to shift the blame onto a third party, it generally would be in aid of exculpating himself from liability, rather than of inducing action by someone else. As such, the relationship of that conduct to the fundamental anti-witness-intimidation purpose of \u00a7 13B is at best attenuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In these circumstances, therefore, we conclude that, absent other evidence of his intent to impede the investigation, the defendant\u2019s denial did not provide a basis from which to infer that he possessed the specific intent needed to establish a violation of \u00a7 13B. Because there was insufficient evidence to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction, it cannot stand.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">b. <em>Conviction of homicide by vessel. </em>Misdemeanor homicide by vessel under G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 8B (2), may be proved by one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of three theories: a defendant operated a vessel with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 per cent; operated a vessel while under the influence of, inter alla, intoxicating liquor or marijuana; or operated a vessel recklessly or negligently so as to endanger the lives or safety of the public. In the absence of evidence supporting the first theory, that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was at least 0.08 per cent, only the latter two theories were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Because the jury convicted the defendant of misdemeanor homicide by vessel on a general verdict slip, without specifying the theory of guilt, we must review the sufficiency of the evidence under both theories submitted to them to guard against the possibility of a nonunanimous verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>May</em>nard,, 436 Mass. 558, 561 (2002), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 221 (2000). The defendant concedes that evidence supporting a negligent-operation theory of guilt was sufficient to support his conviction, but argues that there was insufficient evidence at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant operated the vessel while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or marijuana.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>An individual may be found to have been \u201cunder the influence\u201d when his consumption of intoxicating liquor, marijuana, narcotic drugs, depressants, or other stimulant substances \u201cdiminished [his] ability to operate a motor vehicle safely.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. 746, 756 (2013), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 173 (1985). \u201cAlthough the Commonwealth \u2018need not prove that the defendant actually drove in an unsafe or erratic manner... it must prove a diminished capacity to operate safely.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra. </em>Such proof must comprise more than just the defendant\u2019s admission of guilt; the Commonwealth must adduce other evidence that corroborates the defendant\u2019s statements and establishes that \u201cthe crime was real and not imaginary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>401 Mass. 470, 473 (1988), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forde, </em>392 Mass. 453, 458 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Here, there was evidence at trial, in the form of the defendant\u2019s statements as well as the testimony of Friguglietti, that the defendant had consumed approximately four beers and had smoked one or two hits of marijuana on at least two separate occasions in the roughly four-hour period preceding the collision. The Commonwealth also called a drug recognition expert, who testified to the typical physical and cognitive consequences of ingesting marijuana and alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">However, the expert did not testify to the manifestation of these symptoms in the defendant in particular. Cf. <em>Douillard </em>v. <em>LMR, Inc., </em>433 Mass. 162, 166-167 (2001) (in action against tavemkeeper for overserving alcoholic beverages, \u201c[assuming, without deciding, that the problem of individual variability in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>response to alcohol prevents a plaintiff from relying exclusively on expert opinion to make out a case of apparent intoxication\u201d). Indeed, the police officer who questioned the defendant on the lakeshore in the immediate aftermath of the accident observed that his eyes were not red or bloodshot, his speech was not slurred, there was no odor of alcohol, and he successfully completed field sobriety tests. By the same token, a breathalyzer test administered to the defendant three hours after the collision revealed a blood alcohol percentage of 0.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The question is a close one, but, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we conclude that, quite apart from the expert\u2019s testimony, sufficient evidence supported the defendant\u2019s conviction. Although there was no direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s impairment, there was substantial direct evidence of his consumption of alcohol and marijuana. The jury could have inferred, based on other evidence admitted at trial, that such consumption had diminished his \u201cjudgment, alertness, and ability to respond promptly and effectively to unexpected emergencies.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra </em>at 173. In particular, there was evidence that the defendant drove his motorboat in a clockwise direction, which contravened the customary counterclockwise traffic pattern on the lake; that the boat \u201ckept coming, kept going\u201d after the collision and \u201ccontinu[ed] on [its] route\u201d; and that one witness perceived \u201ca very distinct and clear smell of alcohol\u201d upon loading the victim onto the boat. In addition to the fact of the collision, which \u201cis corroborative of the other evidence of driving while intoxicated,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marley, </em>396 Mass. 433, 442 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funk, </em>254 Pa. Super. 233, 238 (1978), this evidence tended to show that the defendant\u2019s earlier consumption of alcohol and marijuana diminished his capacity to operate the vessel safely. Thus, the defendant properly was convicted under G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 8B (2), under either a negligent- or impaired-operation theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s conviction of misleading a police officer, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, is reversed, and the conviction of misdemeanor homicide by vessel, G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 8B, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the Committee for Public Counsel Services and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\">General Laws c. 90B, \u00a7 8B, embraces both felony and misdemeanor homicide by vessel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The defendant\u2019s void-for-vagueness claim primarily is concerned with the ambiguous nature of the question posed to him by police, which, he contends, called for an \u201cinherently subjective\u201d answer.

In any event, this argument is unavailing. The common-law rule provides that \u201cif a defendant is charged with a crime and unequivocally denies it, that denial is not admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>453 Mass. 266, 273 (2009), overruled on other grounds by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>457 Mass. 268 (2010). The rationale for the rule is that \u201c[ejxtrajudicial accusatory statements made in the presence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>defendant, which he has unequivocally denied, are [inadmissible] hearsay.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, supra </em>at 272. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 691 &amp; n.12 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">It is well established, however, that \u201coperative words\u201d bearing independent legal significance, such as those \u201cused to effectuate the commission of a crime,\u201d are not hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>459 Mass. 442, 452-453 (2011), and cases cited. The defendant\u2019s statement at issue, constituting the operative words of the charged \u00a7 13B violation, was a verbal act that did not fall within the ambit of the common-law rule, which remains unaltered by \u00a7 13B. That rule continues to bar the admission of unequivocal denials to establish either the truth of the accusation or consciousness of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 273-274. In prosecutions under \u00a7 13B, denial evidence is not used to show that a defendant in fact committed the act denied or that he was conscious of his guilt of that act. Rather, it is used to show that a defendant, by his dishonesty, committed a separate substantive offense.
