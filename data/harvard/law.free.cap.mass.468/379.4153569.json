The plaintiffs, Jane T. Polay and William Morse, brought suit against the defendant, Joseph S. McMahon, alleging (1) abuse of process, (2) malicious prosecution, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (5) invasion of privacy. McMahon filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), and a special motion to dismiss pursuant to the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the motion to dismiss as to all claims; he also allowed the special motion to dismiss with respect to the abuse of process and malicious prosecution claims, but denied the special motion as to the other three claims. Having partially succeeded on his special motion to dismiss, McMahon moved for costs and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, and the judge granted the motion. The plaintiffs appealed, challenging only the dismissal of their invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, and the award of attorney\u2019s fees. We reverse the dismissal of the invasion of privacy claim, remand the issue of attorney\u2019s fees in light of our decision, and otherwise affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\"><em>Background. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 verified complaint contains the following allegations. Around April, 2008, McMahon and other neighbors entered into a common plan to harass the plaintiffs. On April 4, McMahon met with certain identified neighbors to discuss taking concerted action against the plaintiffs. After the meeting, McMahon filed what the plaintiffs allege was a false police report averring that Morse was stalking him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In December, 2009, McMahon filed another false police report, in which he alleged that Morse had parked his car in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>way as to prevent McMahon from pulling out of his driveway. Upon arrival of the police, McMahon began verbally attacking the plaintiffs, and officers ordered McMahon back inside his house. McMahon also filed \u201ccountless\u201d other false reports against the plaintiffs, including one in which he alleged that Polay committed an assault and battery against McMahon\u2019s son by attempting to push the son off his bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On or about August 13, 2010, in reliance on these false police reports, McMahon sought and was granted a harassment prevention order against the plaintiffs. McMahon thereafter filed several criminal complaints against the plaintiffs for alleged violations of the harassment prevention order, each of which was dismissed. A judge of the District Court subsequently vacated the harassment prevention order after a hearing, concluding that the conduct alleged in support of the initial complaint did not rise to the level of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Sometime around January 27, 2011, McMahon installed several video cameras in his house, which were pointed at the plaintiffs\u2019 property. On May 30, 2011, McMahon installed an additional camera, also directed at the plaintiffs\u2019 property. As alleged by the plaintiffs, these cameras record the plaintiffs\u2019 house on a continuous basis, and enable McMahon to see into the windows of the plaintiffs\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The complaint alleges that McMahon undertook all of these actions against the plaintiffs in order to cause them distress and drive them out of the neighborhood; that McMahon\u2019s conduct did cause the plaintiffs \u201cextreme discomfort and distress\u201d; and that \u201cthe emotional distress suffered by the [pjlaintiffs was severe and of such a nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motion to dismiss. </em>We review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de nova. <em>Galiastro </em>v. <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., </em>467 Mass. 160, 164 (2014). In so doing, \u201c[w]e accept as true the facts alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as well as any favorable inferences that reasonably can be drawn from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[w]e do not regard as \u2018true\u2019 legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.\u201d <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Brockton Hosp., Inc., </em>454 Mass. 37, 39 n.6 (2009), citing <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474, 477 478 (2000). To survive a motion to dismiss, the factual allegations must \u201c \u2018plausibly suggest [and] (not merely [be] consistent with)\u2019 an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Galiastro </em>v. <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., supra </em>at 164-165, quoting <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">a. <em>Invasion of privacy. </em>The plaintiffs contend that they have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of invasion of their right of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cTo sustain a claim for invasion of privacy, the invasion must be both unreasonable and substantial or serious.\u201d <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Salem State College, </em>446 Mass. 525, 536 (2006). See <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 514, 517-518 (1991) <em>(Schlesinger). </em>Most of our jurisprudence under that statute has involved public disclosure of private facts, but a plaintiff also may support a claim of invasion of privacy by showing that a defendant has intruded unreasonably upon the plaintiff\u2019s \u201csolitude\u201d or \u201cseclusion.\u201d See <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., </em>443 Mass. 367, 382 n.16 (2005); <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 517 &amp; n.4, 519-521; <em>Amato </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Cape &amp; Islands Dist., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 240 (2011). \u201cThe right which the plaintiffs claim was infringed upon is their right to be left alone.\u201d <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 630, 637 (1996) <em>(Ellis). </em>See <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Generally, whether an intrusion qualifies as unreasonable, as well as either substantial or serious, presents a question of fact. See <em>Ellis, supra </em>at 638; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>952 F. Supp. 2d 343, 353-354 (D. Mass. 2013). \u201c[T]he Legislature appears to have framed the statute in broad terms so that the courts can develop the law thereunder on a case-by-case basis, by balancing relevant factors . . . and by considering prevailing societal values and the ability to enter orders which are practical and capable of reasonable enforcement.\u201d <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 519. Factors that we have considered in assessing whether there has been an intrusion that is unreasonable, as well as substantial or serious, include the location of the intrusion, the means used, the frequency and duration of the intrusion, and the underlying purpose behind the intrusion. See <em>id. </em>at 519-522; <em>Ellis, supra </em>at 637-638. See also W.L. Prosser &amp; W.P. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 117, at 856 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser &amp; Keeton) (two most important factors are means used and underlying purpose). Thus, in <em>Ellis, supra, </em>the plaintiffs survived summary judgment on their intrusion claim by producing evidence that the defendant insurance investigator waited in front of their home, made numerous telephone calls to their home and work, followed them extensively, and acted out of a racially motivated purpose to harass.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In determining whether a defendant committed an unreasonable intrusion, we balance the extent to which the defendant violated the plaintiff\u2019s privacy interests against any legitimate purpose the defendant may have had for the intrusion. See <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Motorola, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 425, 431-434 (1994); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>408 Mass. 324, 330 (1990); <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 520-521 (1984). Here, the plaintiffs allege that McMahon installed several video cameras directed at their property, that these cameras can see through their windows into the interior of their home, that the cameras record their home on a continuous basis, and that McMahon installed the cameras in order to cause them extreme discomfort and distress and drive them out of the neighborhood.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201cNowhere are expectations of privacy greater than in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>home, and \u2018[i]n the home <em>... all </em>details are intimate details . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balicki, </em>436 Mass. 1, 12 n.14 (2002), quoting <em>Kyllo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 37 (2001). See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652B, comment b (1977) (defendant may intrude on plaintiff\u2019s seclusion by looking into plaintiff\u2019s windows). Moreover, even where an individual\u2019s conduct is observable by the public, the individual still may possess a reasonable expectation of privacy against the use of electronic surveillance that monitors and records such conduct for a continuous and extended duration. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rousseau, </em>465 Mass. 372, 382 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balicki, supra </em>at 11-13 (use of video and still cameras to document search of home exacerbated its intrusiveness). Considered in light of these factors, McMahon\u2019s alleged motive to harass converts his video surveillance of the interior of the plaintiffs\u2019 home into an unreasonable intrusion. See <em>Ellis, supra </em>at 638; 1 J.T. McCarthy, The Rights of Publicity and Privacy \u00a7 5:99, at 709 (2013) (\u201cwhen surveillance aims to frighten or torment a targeted person, there is an unreasonable intrusion upon privacy\u201d); Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 117, at 856 (surveillance may qualify as unreasonable intrusion if done for improper purpose). Cf. <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 519 (emphasizing that telephone calls were not part of \u201cpattern of harassment\u201d and \u201cwere not calculated to annoy or disturb\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">McMahon argues that he installed the video cameras not to harass the plaintiffs but to provide security for his property, and that the cameras only incidentally capture parts of the plaintiffs\u2019 home observable from the public way. He points out that \u201cin an industrial and densely populated society, some intrusions into one\u2019s private sphere are inevitable.\u201d <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 520, quoting R. Rodman, Procedural Forms \u00a7 1051, at 491 (1990). Whether McMahon acted for the legitimate purpose of securing his property in a way that outweighs any incidental intrusion on the plaintiffs\u2019 privacy interests is, however, a question of fact not suitable for resolution on a motion to dismiss. See <em>Webster </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>v. <em>Motorola, Inc., </em>418 Mass. at 434; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>952 F. Supp. 2d at 354. Cf. <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>New England Newspapers, Inc., </em>865 F. Supp. 2d 127, 132 (D. Mass. 2012) (in general, \u201cthe determination about newsworthiness [i.e., whether a legitimate public concern outweighs a plaintiff\u2019s interest in keeping information private] is made only after discovery has been completed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">That McMahon allegedly acted out of a desire to harass the plaintiffs in order to drive them out of the neighborhood also transforms his surveillance into a \u201csubstantial or serious\u201d intrusion under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B. See <em>Ellis, supra </em>at 638. Because the plaintiffs have alleged a continuous surveillance of the interior of their home that was conducted for the purpose of harassment, the plaintiffs have made out a plausible claim for invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">b. <em>Intentional infliction of emotional distress. </em>To make out a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiffs were required to show (1) that McMahon intended, knew, or should have known that his conduct would cause emotional distress; (2) that the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) that the conduct caused emotional distress; and (4) that the emotional distress was severe. See <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Enterprise Publ. Co., </em>455 Mass. 641, 672 (2010); <em>Sena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 250, 263-264 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u201cThe standard for making a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress is very high.\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Hasbro, Inc., </em>103 F.3d 186, 195 (1st Cir. 1996), citing <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 144-145 (1976). See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>400 Mass. 82, 99 (1987), quoting <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., supra </em>at 144 (\u201cthe door to recovery should be opened but narrowly and with due caution\u201d). \u201cLiability cannot be predicated on \u2018mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities,\u2019 nor even is it enough \u2018that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by \u201cmalice,\u201d or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tetrault </em>v. <em>Mahoney, Hawkes &amp; Goldings, </em>425 Mass. 456, 466 (1997), quoting <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Corp., supra. </em>Conduct qualifies as extreme and outrageous only if it \u201cgo[es] beyond all possible bounds of decency, and [is] regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Roman </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>461 Mass. 707, 718 (2012), quoting <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., supra. </em>A judge may grant a motion to dismiss where the conduct alleged in the complaint does not rise to this level. See <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589, 596 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The plaintiffs allege three types of activities engaged in by McMahon that, they contend, in combination support a finding of extreme and outrageous conduct: (1) filing false police reports and harassment prevention petitions against the plaintiffs; (2) verbally attacking the plaintiffs; and (3) monitoring and recording the plaintiffs\u2019 home on a continuous basis. Even putting \u201cas harsh a face on [McMahon\u2019s] actions ... as the basic facts would reasonably allow,\u201d the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficiently extreme and outrageous conduct. See <em>Richey </em>v. <em>American Auto. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>380 Mass. 835, 839 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">First, in determining whether McMahon engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct, we do not consider the allegations that he filed false police reports and harassment prevention petitions. For a defendant\u2019s conduct to qualify as extreme and outrageous, the defendant must have acted \u201cwithout privilege.\u201d See <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. at 144; <em>Robert L. Sullivan, D.D.S., P.C. </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 367 (1981). Under the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, an individual may not be sued for exercising the right to petition, including the right to file police reports and harassment prevention petitions, unless the party bringing the suit can show that the petitioning activities lacked any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law. See <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, </em>454 Mass. 148, 152-153 (2009), and cases cited. The motive behind such petitioning activity does not matter. See <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 122 (2002); <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 523-524 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The judge dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 abuse of process and malicious prosecution claims because the plaintiffs had not shown that McMahon lacked a reasonable basis for his petitioning activities, and the plaintiffs have not appealed from this ruling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Thus, the plaintiffs may not rely on McMahon\u2019s petitioning conduct as the basis for their claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. See, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. Parsons, 434 Mass. 543, 547 n.8, 554-555 (2001); <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 344-345, 349 (2000). Cf. <em>Sena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. at 264, quoting <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. at 145 (\u201cNeither applying for an arrest warrant, nor making an arrest pursuant to an issued warrant can be considered \u2018utterly intolerable in a civilized community\u2019 \u201d). Contrast <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 410-411, 414 (2000) (defendant neighbors\u2019 conduct, including filing suit against plaintiff, could be viewed as extreme and outrageous where plaintiff met burden of proving defendants\u2019 suit devoid of reasonable factual or legal support).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Turning to McMahon\u2019s other actions that the plaintiffs allege to be extreme and outrageous, the complaint references only the single \u201cverbal[] attack\u201d that occurred when police responded to McMahon\u2019s report that Morse\u2019s car prevented him from pulling out of his driveway, and does not describe the content of this verbal attack.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This allegation supports nothing more than mere \u201cinsults\u201d or \u201cthreats\u201d of the sort that fail to establish extreme and outrageous conduct. See <em>Roman </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>461 Mass. at 718; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, comment d, illustration 4 (1965) (no extreme and outrageous conduct where individual \u201ccalls [telephone operator] a God damned woman, a God damned liar, and says that if he were there he would break her God damned neck\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Neither does the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of constant video surveillance fill the gap. That McMahon allegedly acted for the illegitimate purpose of harassing the plaintiffs supports their claim of an unreasonable and substantial or serious invasion of privacy, see part l.a, <em>supra, </em>but does not raise McMahon\u2019s conduct to the level of extreme and outrageous behavior. See <em>Tetrault </em>v. <em>Mahoney, Hawkes &amp; Goldings, </em>425 Mass. at 466, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>quoting <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>400 Mass. at 99 (it does not suffice \u201cthat the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal,... or even that his conduct has been characterized by \u2018malice,\u2019 or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort\u201d); <em>Alderson </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>142 Idaho 733, 739-741 (Ct. App. 2006) (evidence that defendant watched plaintiff through her home windows sufficed to show invasion of privacy but did not suffice to show intentional infliction of emotional distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The plaintiffs also fail sufficiently to allege severe emotional distress. Other than referring to the plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress as \u201cextreme,\u201d the complaint contains only the conclusory statement that \u201cthe emotional distress suffered by the [p]laintiffs was severe and of such a nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d This statement does not constitute an allegation of fact but rather a recitation of the element of severe emotional distress. See, e.g., <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. at 145. Such \u201cbare assertions\u201d do not suffice. See <em>Galiastro </em>v. <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., </em>467 Mass. at 174; <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Brockton Hosp., Inc., </em>454 Mass. 37, 39 n.6 (2009). Hence, there was no error in the judge\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">2. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute, \u201c[i]f the court grants [the] special motion to dismiss, the court shall award the moving party costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, including those incurred for the special motion and any related discovery matters.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. This award is \u201cmandatory.\u201d <em>North Am. Expositions Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>452 Mass. 852, 872 (2009). The moving party need not prevail on all counts to qualify for an award, although a judge has discretion to reduce the award to account for such limited success. See <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Aceto, </em>451 Mass. 1, 9 n.10 (2008); <em>Giuffrida </em>v. <em>High Country Investor, Inc., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 244 (2008). A judge also has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs beyond those incurred in bringing the special motion itself. <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Here, the judge awarded McMahon $9,654.53 for costs and attorney\u2019s fees associated with defending against all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 claims, including those for which the judge did not grant McMahon\u2019s special motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs argue that the fee-shifting provision does not apply because McMahon\u2019s liability insurer paid for his defense and he did not himself \u201cincur\u201d any attorney\u2019s fees. We do not agree that the statute contains such a limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Nothing about the statutory term \u201cincurred\u201d precludes application of the fee-shifting provision where the fees were \u201cincurred\u201d by a third party acting on a defendant\u2019s behalf. See <em>United Cos. Lending Corp. </em>v. <em>Sargeant, </em>32 F. Supp. 2d 21, 25 (D. Mass. 1999), quoting <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>929 F. Supp. 925, 933 (D.S.C. 1995), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Burnside </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>89 F.3d 827 (4th Cir. 1996) (\u201cWhere otherwise authorized,. . . awards of attorneys\u2019 fees \u2018are not obviated by the fact that individual [parties] are not obligated to compensate their counsel\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, applying the fee-shifting provision under these circumstances furthers the statute\u2019s underlying purposes of broadly protecting petitioning activity and promoting resolution of \u201cSLAPP\u201d litigation \u201cquickly with minimum cost.\u201d See <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. at 126, quoting <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156,161 (1998). Cf. <em>Ketchum </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1131 (2001) (\u201cThe [California antiSLAPP] fee-shifting provision was apparently intended to discourage such strategic lawsuits against public participation by imposing the litigation costs on the party [bringing the suit]\u201d). This application of the statute affords deterrence against SLAPP suits without regard to whether a defendant happens to carry liability insurance. It also protects individuals who may face a SLAPP suit from bearing the cost of litigation in some other, less direct form, such as an increase in liability insurance premiums. Thus, under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, McMahon is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees notwithstanding that his insurer paid for his defense. Cf. <em>Macias </em>v. <em>Hartwell, </em>55 Cal. App. 4th 669, 675-676 (1997) (defendant was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute even though fees were paid by defendant\u2019s labor union); <em>Poulard </em>v. <em>Lauth, </em>793 N.E.2d 1120, 1124-1125 (Ind. Ct. App. 2003) (defendant was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under Indiana\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute even though fees were paid by defendant\u2019s insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Additionally, the plaintiffs contend that McMahon\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees were unreasonable in that counsel spent excessive time preparing the special motion to dismiss. The motion judge \u201cis in the best position to determine how much time was reasonably spent on a case.\u201d <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 324 (1993). The judge did not abuse his discretion in determining the attorney\u2019s fees to be reasonable. See <em>North Am. Expositions Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>452 Mass. at 872; <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. at 126, 127 n.18. Nonetheless, we remand the matter on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees so that the judge may consider whether the fee award must be reduced in light of the reinstatement of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In his brief, McMahon also requests costs and attorney\u2019s fees related to this appeal. Because the appeal does not involve the dismissal of any claims pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, we allow this request only as to the costs and fees incurred in defending the fee award. See <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Aceto, </em>451 Mass. at 9 n.10. As to that issue, McMahon may seek reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs in accordance with the procedure set forth in <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10 11 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>So much of the judgment of dismissal as relates to the claim of invasion of privacy is reversed, and the remainder of the judgment is affirmed. The order awarding attorney\u2019s fees is vacated and set aside. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by Alex G. Philipson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">McMahon\u2019s special motion to dismiss included a copy of a similar complaint that the plaintiffs had filed against different neighbors in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the judge\u2019s memorandum and order dismissing that complaint, the docket of a criminal case involving Polay, the police reports concerning McMahon\u2019s complaints to police regarding the plaintiffs, and the harassment prevention orders that had issued against the plaintiffs on McMahon\u2019s behalf. Because these items represent matters of public record or documents on which the plaintiffs relied in framing their complaint, the judge properly could consider them in reviewing the motion to dismiss under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>converting that motion into one for summary judgment. See <em>Galiastro </em>v. <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., </em>467 Mass. 160, 165 n.11 (2014); <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 631 n.14 (2008), quoting <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474, <em>477 </em>(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 IB, provides: \u201cA person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy. The superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity to enforce such right and in connection therewith to award damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">McMahon suggests that these allegations are speculative because they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>based on no more than \u201cinformation and belief.\u201d For purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss, however, a party may allege facts based on \u201cinformation and belief,\u201d see, e.g., <em>Care &amp; Protection of Lillian, </em>445 Mass. 333, 337 (2005), and we assume the truth of such allegations. See <em>Galiastro </em>v. <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., </em>467 Mass. at 164.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In their brief, the plaintiffs refer to other verbal attacks and threats that were not alleged in their complaint. These additional assertions appeared in affidavits attached to the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to McMahon\u2019s special motion to dismiss, and we do not consider them. See <em>Eigerman </em>v. <em>Putnam Invs., Inc., </em>450 Mass. 281, 285 n.6 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
