The plaintiff, Sorenti Brothers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Inc. (Sorenti), owns parcels of land near the former rotary; it operates a gasoline station on one of them. Sorenti commenced this action in the Superior Court, seeking damages from the Commonwealth on account of the temporary and permanent land takings that the Commonwealth made in connection with the flyover project. At the conclusion of a jury trial, judgment entered awarding Sorenti almost $3 million in damages. The Commonwealth appealed, and the Appeals Court, in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28, affirmed. <em>Sorenti Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 1123 (2012). The case is before us on further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">At issue is the applicability of G. L. c. 81, \u00a7 <em>7C </em>(\u00a7 <em>7C),</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to Sorenti\u2019s gasoline station parcel (Shell parcel), and whether the elimination of a portion of Canal Street as part of the flyover project resulted in a substantial, and compensable, impairment of access to that parcel. We conclude that (1) under \u00a7 <em>7C, </em>for a property owner to be entitled to damages on account of the construction of a limited access highway, the highway must be constructed in whole or in part over the public way on which the owner\u2019s property directly fronts or abuts; and (2) under G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 12 (\u00a7 12), when a partial taking of property has been made, the property owner is entitled to recover damages for loss of access to the remainder of the property only where that loss or impairment is severe. Because the flyover project was not laid over a public way that directly abutted Sorenti\u2019s property, Sorenti was not entitled to recover damages under \u00a7 7C as a matter of law. Similarly, in the circumstances of this case, Sorenti was not entitled to impairment of access damages under \u00a7 12 because it still retains reasonable and appropriate access to and from the Shell parcel. The trial judge\u2019s instructions erroneously permitted the jury to award damages in part for impairment of access under both \u00a7\u00a7 <em>7C </em>and 12. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ingly, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The flyover project eliminated the rotary and extended State Routes 3 and 6 over the Sagamore bridge by constructing a new limited access highway. To accomplish this result, the Commonwealth made eminent domain takings from a number of property owners in the vicinity of the rotary, including Sorenti. This case involves two parcels of land owned by Sorenti: the Shell parcel, containing a Shell brand gasoline station and a convenience store; and \u201cthe undeveloped parcel,\u201d a vacant, commercially zoned piece of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Before the flyover project, the Sorenti property was bounded on the west by Canal Street, a State road, and on the north and east by Meetinghouse Lane, a town of Bourne road.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Shell parcel had access to Canal Street by a curb cut, and Canal Street in turn connected directly to the east side of the rotary; the rotary connected to Route 3 on the north, Route 6 (Mid-Cape Highway) on the south, and the Scenic Highway on the west. The Shell parcel also had access to Meetinghouse Lane by a curb cut, and Meetinghouse Lane, like Canal Street, connected directly to the rotary. Cars traveling on any of the three highways feeding into the rotary could turn from the rotary onto either Canal Street or Meetinghouse Lane and then quickly enter the Shell parcel by driveways leading to the gasoline station. As part of the flyover project, Canal Street was relocated,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and although the Shell parcel had access to the relocated Canal Street, its access was at a point different from where it was before the project and, in any event, the flyover project eliminated the rotary and Sorenti\u2019s direct access, via Canal Street and the rotary, to the system of highways of which the rotary was a part. The Sorenti property still has access to the three highways (Routes 3 and 6, and the Scenic Highway) after the completion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>of the flyover project, but one must drive a somewhat more circuitous and longer route to reach those highways from the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In September, 2006, Sorenti filed its complaint in the Superior Court, seeking damages associated with all the takings effected by the Commonwealth in connection with the flyover project. Among other claims, Sorenti maintained that the loss of access to Canal Street and thereby to the highway network formerly connected to the rotary caused a significant diminution in value to the Shell parcel. After a jury trial, Sorenti received a general verdict in its favor on all its damages claims in the amount of $4.15 million; after subtraction of the pro tanto payment of $1.7 million earlier made by the Commonwealth, judgment entered for $2,954,561.42, including interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We turn to the two issues the Commonwealth has raised in its application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">a. <em>Applicability of G. L. c. 81, \u00a7 7C. </em>Section 7C provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201cIf the department [of highways] determines that public necessity and convenience require that a limited access way shall be laid out, it shall lay out such way in the same manner as state highways. A limited access way is hereby defined to be a highway over which the easement of access in favor of abutting land exists only at such points and in such manner as is designated in the order of laying out. <em>... If a limited access way is laid out in whole or in part in the location of an existing public way, the owners of land abutting upon such existing public way shall be entitled to recover damages under [c. 79] for the taking of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>or injury to their easements of access to such public way\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">There is no dispute that the flyover project created a limited access highway as defined in \u00a7 7C that runs north to south directly over where the rotary previously had been, and Sorenti specifically agrees with the Commonwealth that the limited access highway so created includes only Routes 3 and 6. In the Superior Court, Sorenti contended that it was entitled to recover damages pursuant to \u00a7 7C because the flyover project as a whole eliminated the existing Canal Street at the point that the Shell parcel abutted it, and this loss of access to Canal Street constituted an \u201cinjury to [Sorenti\u2019s] easement of access\u201d to a public way that was compensable under this statute. The trial judge agreed in substance and, over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, recited the language of \u00a7 7C to the jury as part of his final instructions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">As the Commonwealth points out, and as this court set out in <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>348 Mass. 652 (1965), \u00a7 <em>7C </em>contains a number of discrete conditions that must be met by a property owner claiming an entitlement to damages under the statute. In particular, \u00a7 <em>7C </em>requires that (1) a limited access highway be \u201claid out in whole or in part\u201d (2) \u201cin the location of an existing public way\u201d; (3) the land or property owned by the claimant \u201cabut[] upon such existing public way\u201d; and (4) the claimant must have suffered a \u201ctaking of or injury to [its] easements of access to such public way\u201d (emphasis omitted). See <em>LaCroix, supra </em>at 655 n.2, quoting \u00a7 <em>7C. </em>Here, the new limited access highway extends directly over the location of the now former rotary, which, all agree, qualified as \u201can existing public way.\u201d But before the flyover project, the Shell parcel did not directly abut or front on the rotary. Rather, the Shell parcel abutted only Canal Street and Meetinghouse Lane, and while both of these ways led to the rotary, neither of them is included in the new limited access highway, which encompasses only Routes 3 and 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with the Commonwealth that Sorenti, by definition, cannot meet the third requirement of \u00a7 <em>7C.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Sorenti argues against this conclusion by referencing the flyover project\u2019s \u201clayout plan\u201d that governed the over-all flyover project and specifically the layout and construction of the new limited access highway, pointing out that the layout plan covered the area immediately around the rotary, including Canal Street. Accordingly, the argument goes, because Canal Street is included within the layout plan and the Shell parcel abutted the relevant portion of Canal Street, Sorenti qualifies as an \u201cownerQ of land abutting upon\u201d an \u201cexisting public way\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7C, and is entitled to damages for the injury sustained to its \u201ceasement of access\u201d to Canal Street and the system of public ways to which it connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The argument fails. A property owner\u2019s entitlement to seek damages under \u00a7 7C requires that the limited access highway be \u201claid out\u201d in the same location as an existing public way. \u201cLaid out,\u201d as the past tense of \u201clay out,\u201d has a technical meaning in the highway context. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third (in interpreting statutes, \u201ctechnical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning\u201d). \u201c \u2018Laying out\u2019 is, and has been from the earliest times, the appropriate expression for locating and establishing a new highway,\u201d and involves \u201cascertain[ing] the place and course of said road.\u201d <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Board of Park Comm\u2019rs of Boston, </em>133 Mass. 321, 329 (1882) (citations and quotations omitted). See <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Street Comm\u2019rs of Boston, </em>209 Mass. 316, 317 (1911) (\u201cto lay out\u201d means \u201cto fix the termini and prescribe the boundaries of the highway\u201d). See also <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>92 Conn. 431, 436 (1918) (\u201cTo lay out a highway is to locate it and define its limits\u201d). Here, the new limited access highway was laid out in the \u201clocation\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> only of the rotary, not the location of Canal Street (or Meetinghouse Lane). See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Although the Commonwealth\u2019s layout plan for the flyover project included Canal Street and encompassed an area larger than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>rotary, the scope of the layout plan is not relevant to a determination of the proper scope of \u00a7 7C: by its terms, \u00a7 7C is concerned only with the location of the limited access highway itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Sorenti points to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 581 (1954), as supporting the contention that \u00a7 7C damages are available in relation to the Shell parcel. In <em>Nichols, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201c[Section 7C] clearly provides that if a limited access highway is laid out in the location of an existing public way, the owner of land abutting upon such existing way shall be entitled to recover damages for the taking of or injury to his access to such public way or to such new highway. By these provisions the Legislature plainly established that any impairment or deprivation of access which an owner formerly had to a public way may so affect the value of the remainder of the land not taken as to be compensable in damages to be recovered under c. 79, \u00a7 12.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 584-585. Focusing on Canal Street as a public way \u201cin the location of\u201d the new limited access highway, Sorenti contends that the quoted passage from <em>Nichols </em>entitles it to recover damages under \u00a7 7C because the deprivation of access from the Shell parcel to Canal Street (and thereby to the rotary) has materially diminished the parcel\u2019s value, for which the Legislature clearly intended Sorenti should be compensated. This interpretation of <em>Nichols </em>is flawed; the case must be read and understood in the context of its facts. In <em>Nichols, </em>the Commonwealth made takings of property, including a portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 land in Danvers, to construct a limited access highway that was located in part over an existing public way, the Newburyport Turnpike, on which the plaintiffs\u2019 property fronted (i.e., abutted), and in part over the plaintiffs\u2019 property. <em>Id. </em>at 582. Before the limited access highway was built, the plaintiffs had unrestricted access to the Newburyport Turnpike from the portion of their property that fronted on the turnpike; after construction, the plaintiffs\u2019 access to the new limited access highway was indirect and \u201cby a difficult route.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582. On these facts, and consistent with the interpretation of \u00a7 7C we adopt here, the court in <em>Nichols </em>concluded that the plaintiffs were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>entitled to recover damages under \u00a7 7C because (1) before construction, they had directly abutted the public way (the Newburyport Turnpike), (2) over which the new limited access highway was constructed (i.e., \u201claid out\u201d), <em>id. </em>at 582, and (3) the result of the construction was that the plaintiffs suffered \u201cimpairment of and injury to their former access to the public way,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 585. Accord <em>Wenton </em>v. Commonwealth, 335 Mass. 78, 79-81 (1956) (involving plaintiffs whose property directly abutted public way that was itself converted into limited access highway).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>LaCroix, </em>348 Mass. at 652, 654, 657.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, Sorenti\u2019s Shell parcel does not front on or abut the public way over which the limited access flyover highway is built. Accordingly, as was true of the plaintiff in <em>LaCroix </em>(but for somewhat different reasons), \u201c[ajny claim by [Sorenti] under \u00a7 7C falls because of the language of that section itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>trial judge erred in submitting to the jury Sorenti\u2019s claim for damages under \u00a7 7C.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">b. <em>Substantial impairment of access damages. </em>At trial, over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the judge, focusing on G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> instructed the jury that Sorenti would be entitled to damages for loss of access if the jury concluded that there was a substantial impairment of access, and distinguished between a mere \u201cdiversion in traffic\u201d on the one hand, and \u201cextreme\u201d \u201ccircuity of access\u201d on the other. See <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 74, 78, 80 (1979). The Commonwealth contends that, as a matter of law, Sorenti was not entitled to seek damages under \u00a7 12 based on a claim of substantial impairment of access to and from the Shell parcel. In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, because there is still reasonable access to the Shell parcel from both the relocated Canal Street and Meetinghouse Lane, Sorenti has no valid basis for a damages claim for impairment of access. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Section 12 sets out three different instances in which eminent domain damages are to be awarded: (1) when an owner\u2019s entire property is taken; (2) when part of the owner\u2019s property is taken; and (3) when no part of the property is taken but there is special and peculiar injury to the owner as a result of other takings or a public improvement project. Sorenti does not dispute that the second instance, namely, a partial taking, is at issue in this case. There is no question that in connection with the flyover project the Commonwealth took in fee a very small por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tian of the Shell parcel, as well as a much larger portion of the undeveloped parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Where a portion of a parcel is taken, \u00a7 12 entitles the landowner to damages for \u201call injury to the part not taken caused by the taking or by the public improvement for which the taking is made.\u201d See <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield </em>v. Commonwealth, 378 Mass. 381, 385 (1979) (landowner entitled to \u201call incidental effects of the public improvement which impair the value of the property\u201d). Coming within this provision of \u00a7 12, however, does not help Sorenti here, because not every detrimental effect of a public improvement project qualifies as a compensable injury. See 4A J.L. Sackman, Nichols on Eminent Domain \u00a7 14.03[2] (3d ed. 2013) (Sackman). See also <em>LaCroix, </em>348 Mass. at 657. Although landowners have \u201ca legal right of access to the general system of public streets,\u201d they do not have a right to have a \u201cparticular route remain in its original configuration.\u201d <em>Miczek </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 105, 109 (1992). See Sackman, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 14.02[2][b][l]. \u201c[Ujnder our decisions!,] a landowner is not entitled to compensation merely because his access to the public highway system is rendered less convenient, if he still has reasonable and appropriate access to that system after the taking.\u201d <em>LaCroix, supra </em>at 657. See Sackman, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 14.02[2][b][i] (\u201ca mere change in access that leaves the landowner with reasonable access is not compensable\u201d), 14A.01[6][a],</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u201cWe do not deal here in absolutes,\u201d and a total loss of access is not required for damages to be awarded. <em>Malone, </em>378 Mass. at 80. Nevertheless, ascertaining whether damages for loss of access are compensable requires consideration of the particular facts presented by the case. Sorenti principally laments the elimination of Canal Street as it existed while the rotary was still in place; in essence, it complains that all the public roads are not configured in the same manner as they were before the flyover project and the connected takings. Sorenti, however, does not have a right to the pre-taking roadway configuration. See <em>Miczek, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 109. See also <em>Stanwood </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>157 Mass. 17, 19 (1892) (\u201cthe advantage which the landowner had [of having] the luck to enjoy . . . being where the crowd was\u201d is not compensable injury). Notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that a portion of the original Canal Street was eliminated, the Shell parcel retains access to the relocated Canal Street as well as to Meetinghouse Lane.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Meetinghouse Lane, in turn, connects to Route 3A and the Scenic Highway, both of which permit motorists to gain access to Routes 3 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u201cThe relocation of [Canal Street and the creation of the rotary flyover] did not landlock the plaintiffl\u2019s] property; it did not create a dead end street or road; neither the plaintiffl] nor [its] customers were deprived of vehicular access to the public highway system.\u201d <em>Malone, </em>378 Mass. at 81. Instead, what the record shows is that the Shell parcel retained reasonable and appropriate access to the nearby public ways and the public highway system.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Impairments of access similar to those sustained by the Shell parcel have been held to be noncompensable. In <em>LaCroix, </em>348 Mass. at 652-654, Howard Road, the road on which the plaintiff\u2019s property abutted, became a dead-end street when Route 495 was built. As a result of the elimination of that portion of Howard Road, reaching one of the, if not the, major roadways in the area, to which the plaintiff formerly had easy access, required several miles of circuitous travel. <em>Id. </em>at 654. Even though the plaintiff was left with a dead-end street and more circuitous travel, the court concluded that damages could not be awarded for the change in Howard Road. <em>Id. </em>at 657. See <em>Tassinari </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., </em>347 Mass. 222, 224-225 (1964) (plaintiff denied compensation where street on which plaintiff\u2019s business was located was closed at one end, requiring delivery trucks to back out onto street).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The limitations on access to the Shell parcel that result from the flyover project do not approach the severity that has been found to justify damages for impairment of access. See, e.g., <em>Tarka </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>360 Mass. 855, 855-856 (1971) (plaintiff entitled to damages resulting from complete obstruction of gasoline station entrance for six months during construction); <em>Betty Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 312, 318-319 (1968) (plaintiff entitled to damages because barricades cut off travel to its land and wholly deprived it of use of loading plat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>form, essential to its business);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Wine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>301 Mass. 451, 457-458 (1938) (plaintiff entitled to damages where placement of barricades at entrance of road on which plaintiff\u2019s business abutted cut off plaintiff\u2019s access to public highways in city). Here, in contrast, during the construction process and currently, Sorenti and its customers had, and continue to have, access to the Shell parcel and the gasoline station on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In sum, the Shell parcel still retains reasonable access to the network of public ways near its property and, in particular, to the public highways that formerly connected to the rotary. Although travel to the Shell parcel from the new limited access flyover highway or from the parcel to the new highway involves a more circuitous route, we conclude that as a matter of law, it does not rise to the level of a substantial impairment that could be found to entitle Sorenti to \u00a7 12 damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge erred in instructing the jury that they might award damages for substantial impairment of access to the Shell parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because Sorenti was not entitled to damages under \u00a7 7C or based on its impairment of access under \u00a7 12, the case must be remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial. At trial, there were a number of discrete damages claims at issue. The Commonwealth made a pro tanto payment intended to cover all of Sorenti\u2019s damages. At trial, Sorenti argued that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>amount was inadequate and, in addition its claims for damages for impairment of access under \u00a7\u00a7 7C and 12, sought damages related to both the Commonwealth\u2019s present takings and temporary takings, including restoration costs. Sorenti may present these other damages claims on retrial. Further, at the new trial, use of a special verdict pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 49 (a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), may be appropriate in order to identify the claims on which any awards of damages are made, and the basis or bases of such awards. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">General Laws c. 81, \u00a7 7C (\u00a7 <em>1C), </em>provides for the laying out of limited access highways by the Department of Highways; a limited access highway is one where access to the highway itself occurs only at designated points rather than anywhere along the length of the road.

The plaintiffs owned property directly fronting on Route 2 and had a \u201cformal\u201d right of access to Route 2 via a driveway from their property to the highway \u2014 a right that could be exercised upon obtaining the appropriate permit from Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>at 79-80. The 1953 layout, however, eliminated all the plaintiffs\u2019 rights of access to Route 2, formal or otherwise. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that although the plaintiffs had not exercised their right of formal access by seeking a permit to connect a driveway to Route 2 before the 1953 project, the right nonetheless existed, and they were entitled under \u00a7 7C \u201cto recover the damage to what remained of their real estate after the appurtenant easement had been taken away from it and as a result of losing the easement. . . . Nothing turns on the fact that the [plaintiffs\u2019] acreage was the same as before the taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80-81 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>348 Mass. 652, 652-654 (1965), the court considered a property owner\u2019s claim for damages under \u00a7 7C due to the construction of Route 495 as a limited access highway over a portion of Howard Road, a public way that the plaintiff\u2019s property directly abutted. The court concluded that the plaintiff satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 7C that the limited access way be laid out in the location of an existing public way, viz., Howard Road, and the plaintiff be a property owner of land abutting that public way. <em>Id. </em>at 657. However, the court further concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages under \u00a7 7C because in the particular circumstances, the construction of Route 495 over a portion of Howard Road below the plaintiff\u2019s property did not cause him any \u201cinjury to . . . [his] easements of access\u201d \u2014 the fourth requirement of \u00a7 7C \u2014 to Howard Road: his access to Howard Road itself was the same before and after the highway construction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">General Laws c. 79, \u00a7 12 (\u00a7 12), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cThe damages for property taken under this chapter shall be fixed at the value thereof before the recording of the order of taking, and <em>in case only pan of a parcel </em>of land is taken there shall be included damages for all injury to the part not taken caused by the taking or by the public improvement for which the taking is made; and there shall be deducted the benefit accruing to the part not taken unless it was stated in the order of taking that betterments were to be assessed. In determining the damages to a parcel of land injured <em>when no part of it has been taken, </em>regard shall be had only to such injury as is special and peculiar to such parcel, and there shall be deducted the benefit accruing to such parcel, unless it was stated in the order-of taking, or if there was no taking in the order for the establishment, construction, alteration, repair or discontinuance of the public improvement which caused the injury, that betterments were to be assessed\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">As a result of the flyover project, Sorenti\u2019s property also has access to Commercial Drive and the relocated Canal Street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\"><em>Betty Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 312 (1968), on which Sorenti relies, is distinguishable from this case. In concluding that the plaintiff, Betty Corporation (Betty), was entitled to impairment of access damages, the court stated that the barrier erected on that street \u201cdeprived [Betty] of access, even for travel, to its land within Western Avenue between the barriers,\u201d and \u201cit was deprived of reasonable use ... for trucks of the old loading platform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. Thus, the barriers in <em>Betty Corp. </em>completely blocked off Betty\u2019s property from the public way at issue and prevented reasonable use of the loading dock which was an essential component to its business. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the elimination of the portion of Canal Street did not eliminate access to the Shell parcel for Sorenti or, probably more to the point, for Sorenti\u2019s gasoline station customers.
