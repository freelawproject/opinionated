Campatelli commenced this action in the county court to challenge her suspension by the three named court officials; her claim is that only the Justices of this court possess the authority to suspend her, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4. We do not interpret c. 211, \u00a7 4, to vest sole authority in this court or its Justices to suspend with pay a register of probate, and conclude that the Chief Justice of the Trial Court, the Court Administrator, and the Chief Justice of the Probate and Family Court Department possess the authority to do so pursuant to G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 9A, and 10, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\"><em>Background. </em>Campatelli disputes the allegations and findings contained in the record regarding her conduct in office, but the facts relating to the legal issues before us are undisputed. In November, 2012, Campatelli was elected as the Register of Probate and Insolvency for Suffolk County (register of probate, or register); she took office on January 3, 2013. See G. L. c. 217, \u00a7 4. As register, Campatelli served in the Suffolk County Divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>sion of the Probate and Family Court Department of the Trial Court. On December 22, 2013, the Chief Justice of the Probate and Family Court Department, Angela M. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez), citing G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 10 (vi), as authority, suspended Campatelli with pay pending further investigation of an allegation that Campatelli had physically assaulted a court employee after an office holiday party on December 18, 2013. The investigation, conducted by an attorney in the human resources department of the Trial Court, concluded that the allegation against Campatelli was unsupported, and Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez terminated the suspension on December 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">On January 15, 2014, Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, citing the same statutory authority, again suspended Campatelli with pay. As set forth in the Chief Justice\u2019s letter to Campatelli, this suspension was based on new allegations of Campatelli\u2019s (1) \u201cfailure to properly manage the office [of the registry of probate]\u201d; (2) \u201cunprofessional conduct and behaviors in the office and toward employees\u201d; and (3) causing \u201cturmoil and disruption\u201d connected to both of the above.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 17, 2014, the Chief Justice of the Trial Court, Paula M. Carey (Chief Justice Carey), and the Court Administrator, Harry Spence (Court Administrator Spence, or Court Administrator) citing their statutory authority under G. L. c. 21 1B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 9A, respectively, appointed an investigator \u201cto conduct a thorough inquiry and to report [his] findings, conclusions and recommendations, concerning the following [specified matters] in the management and administration of the Registrar\u2019s [.s'z'c] Office at the Suffolk Probate and Family Court.\u201d During his investigation, the investigator interviewed thirty-nine individuals, including registry staff, judicial staff, administrators, and an attorney with experience working in the registry; he also met with Campatelli twice. On March 3, 2014, he issued his report on the investigation, and Campatelli received a copy that same day. Relying on information obtained through interviews, documents, and transcripts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the investigator made findings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> regarding Campatelli\u2019s management of the register\u2019s office and concluded that \u201cthere are serious deficiencies in the conduct of [Campatelli] both as to her responsibilities and duties as [rjegister, in the way she interacts with a number of staff, and in the general climate she has created in the office with respect to staff that fall into her disfavor.\u201d Two days later, on March 5, Chief Justice Carey, Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, and Court Administrator Spence notified Campatelli by letter that, based on the conclusions of the investigator\u2019s report, they were \u201creferring this matter to the Committee on Professional Responsibility for Clerks of the Courts\u201d (committee).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The letter directed Campatelli, while proceedings before the committee were pending, to remain on paid administrative leave and to refrain from any contact with the Suffolk County Division of the Probate and Family Court Department or its employees. Thereafter, Campatelli filed a complaint in the county court, seeking a judgment declaring that the three court officials were without authority to suspend her, and a preliminary injunction permitting her immediately to resume her duties as elected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>register.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The single justice reserved and reported the case to the full court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Preliminary issues. </em>Campatelli brings her complaint pursuant to G. L. c. 231A, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. There is no right to bring a declaratory judgment action against the judicial department. See G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 2 (procedure for obtaining declaratory relief under c. 231A \u201cshall not apply to the governor and council or the legislative and judicial departments\u201d). Accordingly, at least with respect to Chief Justices Carey and Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Campatelli\u2019s complaint is subject to dismissal. See <em>Fathers &amp; Families, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court, </em>460 Mass. 508, 509 (2011) (affirming dismissal of complaint against Chief Justice for Administration and Management of the Trial Court because \u201cthe declaratory judgment statute, G. L. c. 231 A, prohibits any action for declaratory relief against the judicial department\u201d). Court Administrator Spence, of course, is not a judge and does not exercise judicial authority, although as the Court Administrator, he is part of the \u201cjudicial department.\u201d Nevertheless, we do not need to resolve whether declaratory relief under c. 231A is available with respect to him,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because Campatelli, apparently acknowledging that (at least as to some of the court officials) she may not pursue such relief, requests this court to consider her complaint as a petition for relief brought under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The case raises important issues concerning the proper administration of the judicial branch. Given this court\u2019s statutory authority of \u201cgeneral superintendence of the administration of all courts of inferior jurisdiction,\u201d G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u201cinherent common law and constitutional powers to supervise the administration of justice,\u201d <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>398 Mass. 800, 804 (1986), it is appropriate, as Campatelli requests, to consider her complaint as a petition brought under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and to decide the case on its merits. See <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>438 Mass. 387, 391 (2003) <em>(First </em>Justice) (court determined it appropriate to decide case pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, where it \u201cconcerns an internal dispute between members of the judicial department, . . . raises important issues with implications for the effective administration of justice, . . . and states an important matter of public interest that may cause further uncertainty within the courts\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">2. <em>Authority to suspend with pay. </em>The essence of Campatelli\u2019s argument is that the three court officials cannot suspend her (or place her on administrative leave) with or without pay, because the Legislature has vested the authority to take such action solely in this court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4. More specifically, she argues that the office of register of probate is one that exists as a result of legislative action, see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>117 Mass. 603, 603-604 (1875); St. 1856, c. 173, \u00a7 1, and because of this fact, neither the office of register nor Campatelli as its occupant is subject to regulation by any exercise of inherent judicial authority. Rather, only the Legislature can prescribe whether and how suspension and removal may take place, and the Legislature has done so by enacting c. 211, \u00a7 4, which places authority over both exclusively with this court. Accordingly, the argument goes, because this court has not taken any action under c. 211, \u00a7 4, to suspend Campatelli or even to ratify the suspension ordered by the respondents, her suspension must be terminated and she must be reinstated immediately to her position as register.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We disagree with Campatelli on two separate grounds. First, as we shall explain, G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, does not provide the sole legislative authority to suspend with pay a register of probate, and each of the three court officials possesses statutory authority to do so under different provisions of G. L. c. 21 1B. See G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 9A, and 10. Second, consistent with these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>statutory provisions, the inherent judicial authority possessed by Chief Justices Carey and Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez includes the authority to suspend a register of probate with pay when necessary for the proper administration of justice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">a. <em>Statutory authority, </em>i. <em>G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 </em>4.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is important to note at the outset of this discussion of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, that the precise issue before us in this case is the authority of the three court officials to suspend with pay \u2014 or place on paid administrative leave \u2014\u2022 a register of probate pending an investigation into allegations of professional misconduct and proceedings before the committee. General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 4, expressly vests the authority in a majority of the Justices of this court to remove, among other officials listed in the section, a register of probate from her position.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Matter of Powers, </em>465 Mass. 63, 82 (2013) (\u201cthe Legislature, by statute [G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4], has given this court the exclusive authority to remove clerks of court\u201d). Nonetheless, we have interpreted this statute to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the power to suspend. See <em>McGonigle </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>418 Mass. 147, 151 (1994) (\u201cAlthough [c. 211, \u00a7 4,] does not specifically enumerate the authority to suspend . . . , it is clear that the power to remove an official includes within it the authority to suspend that individual\u201d). Campatelli contends that <em>Mc-Gonigle </em>stands for the proposition that, as with the power to remove, c. 211, \u00a7 4, also vests exclusive authority in a majority of the Justices of this court to suspend a public official named in that statute, including a register. Therefore, she argues, the three court officials unlawfully encroached on this court\u2019s authority by placing Campatelli on paid administrative leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Campatelli\u2019s reading of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, is not correct. That this court\u2019s exclusive power of removal under the statute includes the power to suspend does not, by itself, mean that the Legislature intended the court also to have the exclusive power to suspend. In other words, although the lesser power to suspend is an intrinsic incident of the greater power to remove, see <em>McGonigle, </em>418 Mass. at 151; <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>377 Mass. 212, 214 (1979) (considering G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72), that fact says nothing about what the Legislature intended, in enacting \u00a7 4, with respect to who may exercise the power of suspension \u2014 especially where, as <em>McGonigle, supra, </em>states, \u00a7 4, by its terms, does not mention suspension or the power to suspend. In arguing otherwise, Campatelli makes an analytical leap that is unsupported by the language of c. 211, \u00a7 4, and logic. Because \u00a7 4 does not restrict the authority to suspend a register of probate with pay to the Justices of this court, we consider the statutes on which the three court officials rely for their authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">ii. <em>G. L. c. 211B. </em>Originally enacted in 1978 as part of a significant effort to improve the administrative capacity and operations of the courts, G. L. c. 211B, among other things, creates an administrative organization of the Trial Court and delineates administrative powers and duties of chief justices and certain nonjudicial officers and employees within it. See St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110. The three court officials contend that various provisions of c. 211B, most recently amended in 2011, see St. 2011, c. 93, authorize them to suspend Campatelli with pay: Chief Justice Carey locates her authority in c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (xxiii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>(\u00a7 9 [xxiii]); Court Administrator Spence locates his in c. 21 1B, \u00a7 9A (xii) (\u00a7 9A [xii]); and Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez in c. 21 1B, \u00a7 10 (vi) (\u00a7 10 [vi]). We consider the scope of each court official\u2019s authority under the cited statutory provisions, beginning with Court Administrator Spence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">A. <em>Court Administrator Spence, G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9A (xii). </em>As \u201cthe administrative head of the trial court,\u201d Court Administrator Spence is \u201cresponsible for the management of court personnel, facilities, administration, security, and court business and shall . . . have the authority necessary to carry out these responsibilities.\u201d G. L. c. 21 1B, \u00a7 9A, second &amp; third pars., as amended by St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7 52. To that end, \u00a7 9 A vests significant administrative authority in him. See G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9A, first par. (Court Administrator has \u201cgeneral superintendence of the administration of the trial court, including, without limitation, the improvement of the administration of such courts and the securing of their proper and efficient administration\u201d). Among the Court Administrator\u2019s specific enumerated powers are those found in \u00a7 9A (xii), which grants him the power to impose discipline, including suspension with pay, on employees and officers of the Trial Court; includes two provisos allowing him to transfer nonjudicial personnel; and includes in a separate sentence a third and final proviso (final proviso) stating that \u201cthis provision shall not apply to a . . . register of probate.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The parties disagree over the meaning of this final proviso. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Pointing to the fact that \u00a7 9A (xii) deals first with discipline of Trial Court nonjudicial employees and, thereafter, separately, with transfer of such personnel, the three court officials argue that the final proviso\u2019s placement at the end of the second sentence in the subsection makes clear that this proviso is concerned solely with a \u201cprovision\u201d in that second sentence addressing permanent transfers, and not with the earlier discipline provisions. In their view, because the final proviso is in the second sentence of \u00a7 9A (xii), and \u201cbears no grammatical relation\u201d to the subsection\u2019s first sentence \u2014 which contains the grant of authority to \u201cimpose discipline,\u201d including suspension with pay \u2014 the proviso does not restrict the Court Administrator\u2019s authority to suspend with pay a register of probate. Campatelli argues that the final proviso applies to the whole of \u00a7 9A (xii), and therefore bars the Court Administrator from both transferring and disciplining a register of probate such as herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u201cOur primary duty in interpreting a statute is \u2018to effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Water Dep\u2019t of Fairhaven </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>455 Mass. 740, 744 (2010), quoting <em>International Org. of Masters </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984). When the meaning of statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our obligation is to interpret the statute according to its words. See <em>Thurdin </em>v. <em>SEI Boston, LLC, </em>452 Mass. 436, 444 (2008) (\u201cOrdinarily, where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent\u201d). The meaning of the final proviso in \u00a7 9A (xii), however, is distinctly not plain and unambiguous; as the differing interpretations advanced by the parties reflect, the subsection on its face does not make clear whether the Legislature intended the final proviso to apply only to \u00a7 9A (xii)\u2019s provisions regarding transfer, or to the entire subsection. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ingly, \u201cwe consider \u2018the cause of [the statute\u2019s] enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Water Dep\u2019t of Fairhaven, supra </em>at 744, quoting <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 490 (2009). To that end, we look to its legislative history. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of Trial Court, </em>448 Mass. 15, 24 (2006), quoting <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>377 Mass. 544, 548 (1979) (\u201cStatutes are to be interpreted, not alone according to their simple, literal or strict verbal meaning, but in connection with their development, their progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, [and] prior legislation\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The current version of G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9A (xii), was enacted in 2011. See St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7 52. The 2011 legislation essentially restructured the system of administration and management of the Trial Court, and in the process reorganized many of the provisions of G. L. c. 211B. See St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 49-61. According to the legislative leaders, this initiative was part of a comprehensive court reform effort \u201cfocused on providing the Commonwealth with the most efficient and cost-effective infrastructure for the disposition of justice.\u201d Court Reorg, Hiring Reform Compromise Teed Up for Friday Session, State House News Service (July 28, 2011) (quoting joint statement of Speaker of House of Representatives Robert DeLeo and Senate President Therese Murray). A key component of these changes was the elimination of the position of the Chief Justice for Administration and Management of the Trial Court (CJAM) that had concentrated all the judicial, administrative, and managerial powers and duties in one person, and the replacement of that single position with two new positions of Chief Justice of the Trial Court (CJTC) and Court Administrator.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 6, as amended by St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 49, 52. In creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>these two new positions, the Legislature divided the exact set of powers and duties that the CJAM alone had held between the new CJTC and Court Administrator. Through this process, the statutory authority formerly vested in the CJAM to discipline and transfer officers and employees of the Trial Court under G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (xxii), as inserted by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 77 (former \u00a7 9 [xxii]),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was transferred essentially word for word to the Court Administrator and set out as the new G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9A (xii) (quoted in note 11, <em>supra). </em>Accordingly, because the ambiguous final proviso within the current \u00a7 9A (xii) originated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>in the former \u00a7 9 (xxii), we look to the legislative history of former \u00a7 9 (xxii) to help understand and resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The former \u00a7 9 (xxii) was enacted as part of an earlier court reform effort undertaken by the Legislature in 1992. One, if not <em>the </em>central, feature of the 1992 legislation was the replacement of the position of Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Court \u2014 a position created in court reform legislation passed in 1978, see St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 110 \u2014 with the CJAM position to emphasize the position\u2019s management role. See St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7\u00a7 69, 73, 77.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The legislative history of St. 1992, c. 379, shows that the Legislature intended the CJAM to possess the authority both to discipline and transfer nonjudicial officers and employees of the Trial Court, and that the disciplinary authority expressly included the ability to impose suspension. This is evident from language in early versions of the bill that ultimately became c. 379, language that remained essentially unchanged as it moved through the House of Representatives and the Senate in late 1992. See 1992 House Doc. No. 5944, \u00a7 106 (authorizing CJAM to \u201cimpose discipline on such officers and employees [of the Trial Court], including dismissal and suspension with or without pay.\u201d [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See also 1992 House Doc. No. 6232, \u00a7 102 (adopting same); 1992 House Doc. No. 6210, \u00a7 98 (adopting same). Significantly, in each of the bills, the topics of discipline and transfer were dealt with in separate clauses and subclauses, and the only limitation regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>CJAM\u2019s authority over the register of probate appeared within a separate subclause addressing transfer, not discipline.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">After 1992 House Doc. No. 6232 passed the House of Representatives and moved to the Senate on November 18, 1992, it was succeeded by additional versions, in which the language of the proposed \u00a7 9 (xxii) changed. See 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1783, \u00a7 68; 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1788, \u00a7 68. In these Senate versions of the legislation, the final proviso that is the source of the ambiguity we find in the current \u00a7 9A (xii) first appeared. But it is clear from the text and sentence structure of these Senate bills that (1) the changes that the Senate made to the proposed legislation it had received from the House all concerned the CJAM\u2019s authority to transfer nonjudicial personnel in the Trial Court, and not the authority to discipline; and (2) the final proviso, with its exception for elected and appointed clerks, clerk-magistrates, registers, and recorders, was intended to apply only to the provisions dealing with transfers of personnel \u2014 and, it appears, only permanent transfers at that \u2014 not with the entire subsection.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Following the Senate\u2019s vote on December 23, 1992, a conference committee was appointed, and on January 5, 1993, that committee reported out a new bill that was passed by both branches of the Legislature and signed by the Governor on January 13, 1993, as St. 1992, c. 379. Former \u00a7 9 (xxii) was enacted as part of this legislation, see St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 77.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The language of former \u00a7 9 (xxii), as enacted by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 77, is by no means a model of clarity. Considered in light of the history of its passage through the Legislature, however, we are persuaded that the final proviso in it was intended by the Legislature to ensure that the CJAM would not be authorized to transfer \u2022\u2014 at least on a permanent basis \u2014 any elected or appointed clerk, register of probate, or recorder. This proviso does not apply in any manner to the unambiguous directive in the first part of the first sentence of \u00a7 9 (xxii), stating that \u201cwhen necessary to ensure the proper administration of justice,\u201d the CJAM was authorized to \u201cimpose discipline\u201d on nonjudicial \u201cofficers and employees\u201d of the Trial Court, including suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We return to this case. Because the Legislature transferred to the Court Administrator in substantially identical form the authority to impose discipline vested in the CJAM by the former \u00a7 9 (xxii), and informed by the legislative history of that earlier subsection, we conclude that the Legislature intended \u00a7 9A (xii) to vest in the Court Administrator the same statutory authority to discipline officers and employees of the Trial Court that it had given to the CJAM in 1992. Accordingly, Court Administrator Spence acted within his authority under \u00a7 9A (xii) when he placed Campatelli on paid administrative leave on March 5, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">B. <em>Chief Justice Carey, G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (xxiii). </em>As the CJTC, Chief Justice Carey is \u201cthe policy and judicial head of the trial court of the commonwealth,\u201d and has \u201cgeneral superintendence of [its] judicial policy . . . including, without limitation, the improvement of the administration of such courts.\u201d G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9, first and second pars., as amended by St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7 52. Her statutory powers to carry out these functions are further enumerated in the twenty-three subsections of c. 211B, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We have reviewed previously the 2011 amendment to G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>c. 21 IB that eliminated the position of CJAM, created an administrative and management structure for the Trial Court led jointly by the new CJTC and Court Administrator, and reallocated many of the CJAM\u2019s former powers to the Court Administrator including the authority to discipline and, in particular, to suspend employees and officers of the Trial Court. Focusing on the 2011 amendments of c. 211B, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 9A, Campatelli contends that there is no statutory power currently listed or described in the current version of \u00a7 9 that purports to authorize Chief Justice Carey to suspend a register of probate, or that even touches on this topic. Campatelli is correct, insofar as a direct legislative statement of authority goes. But Chief Justice Carey argues, and we agree, that in \u00a7 9 (xxiii), the Legislature has expressly recognized her inherent judicial power, and that inherent power includes the authority to discipline and, in particular, to suspend with pay an officer or employee of the Trial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">General Laws c. 211B, \u00a7 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cThe chief justice of the trial court . . . shall have the authority necessary to carry out [her] responsibilities including, but not limited to, the following:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cthe authority to exercise any inherently judicial power not otherwise specified in this section; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall authorize the chief justice to exercise any power reserved to the full court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">As we discuss hereafter, the CJTC possesses the inherent judicial authority to \u201ccontrol and supervise personnel within the judicial system.\u201d <em>First Justice, </em>438 Mass. at 397, and this inherent authority encompasses the power to suspend with pay a register of probate when the effective administration of justice so demands. See <em>id. </em>at 397-398. Section 9 (xxiii) essentially incorporates the inherent judicial authority of the CJTC just described into the panoply of statutory powers that \u00a7 9 sets out. Accordingly, there is indeed a statutory basis in \u00a7 9 for Chief Justice Carey\u2019s suspension of the register on March 5, 2014.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>C. <em>Chief Justice Ordo\u00f1ez, G. L. c. 211B, \u00a710 (vi). </em>In addition to the authority that the CJTC and Court Administrator have over administration of the Trial Court, the chief justices of the several Trial Court departments are \u201cresponsible for the operation of their department, its clerks, other officers and employees.\u201d G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10, first par., as amended by St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7 52. Section 10 enumerates the statutory powers and duties of the departmental chief justices, and therefore Chief Justice Ordo\u00f1ez. Among those listed is the authority to impose discipline on officers and employees within Chief Justice Ordo\u00f1ez\u2019s department, including suspension with or without pay. G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10 (vi).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The language of \u00a7 10 (vi) in substance is essentially identical to that of \u00a7 9A (xii), concerning the power of the Court Administrator; of particular relevance here is that \u00a7 10 (vi) contains the same ambiguous final proviso concerning elected and appointed clerks, clerk-magistrates, registers of probate, and recorders as \u00a7 9A (xii). And, as is true of \u00a7 <em>9A </em>(xii), the language of \u00a7 10 (vi) finds its origins in the 1992 court reform legislation, St. 1992, c. 379, that we considered in connection with the discussion of the Court Administrator, see part 2.a.ii.A, <em>supra. </em>See also G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10 (v), as inserted by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 79, which is almost identical to the current \u00a7 10 (vi).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Significantly, it is almost identical as well to the former \u00a7 9 (xxii), as inserted by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The point we draw from these various connections is that the legislative history of St. 1992, c. 379, reviewed at length <em>supra, </em>is relevant to the task of understanding the ambiguous final proviso in G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10 (vi). As was the case with the Court Administrator, that legislative history indicates that the final proviso in \u00a7 10 (vi) refers only to provisions in that subsection concerned with transfers of nonjudicial officers and employees of the Trial Court \u2014 not with discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Campatelli also argues that our interpretation of \u00a7 10 (vi) ignores the additional limitations imposed on Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez\u2019s disciplinary authority in G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10 (i) (\u00a7 10 [i]). In particular, Campatelli asserts that, even if \u00a7 10 (vi) authorizes Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez to suspend Campatelli, the Chief Justice may not do so here because of \u00a7 10 (i), which, Campatelli argues, limits the Chief Justice\u2019s authority to discipline to those disputes that are first raised between a first justice and the register of probate.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> She claims that because no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>dispute was ever raised between Campatelli and the first justice of the Suffolk County Division of the Probate and Family Court Department, Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez had no authority to suspend Campatelli under \u00a7 10 (vi) in December of 2013, or in January or March of 2014. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">First, notwithstanding \u00a7 10 (i), nothing within the plain language of \u00a7 10 (vi), or its legislative history, indicates that any formal dispute must be raised before the Chief Justice may exercise her authority to suspend under \u00a7 10 (vi). Section 10 (vi) contains no mention of a \u201cdispute,\u201d and its own implicit recognition of the Chief Justice\u2019s inherent judicial authority to impose discipline \u201cto ensure the proper administration of justice\u201d is inconsistent with such a procedural limitation. Section 10 (i) <em>does not </em>alter our conclusion that Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez acted within the bounds of her authority pursuant to \u00a7 10 (vi) when suspending Campatelli.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>b. <em>Inherent judicial authority. </em>As the foregoing discussion reflects, all three court officials possessed statutory authority to suspend Campatelli or place her on paid administrative leave. Chief Justices Carey and Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez assert that the suspension of Campatelli with pay pending the investigation of her conduct constitutes a proper exercise of their inherent judicial authority that exists apart from any grant of statutory authority.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Campatelli disagrees, asserting that because the office of register of probate is \u201ccreated and defined by statute,\u201d her position is subject to the exclusive control of the Legislature such that she cannot be disciplined by any exercise of inherent judicial authority. Other than her attempt to ground this argument in her erroneous interpretation of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, discussed previously, she cites no authority, and provides no explanation of why this is so. It is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Among the fundamental principles embedded in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is the right to prompt and impartial administration of justice. See arts. 11 and 29. See also <em>First Justice, </em>438 Mass. at 396-397. \u201cIt is from these lofty principles that flows the concept of inherent judicial powers, \u2018whose exercise is essential to the function of the judicial department, to the maintenance of its authority, [and] to its capacity to decide cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397, quoting <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>422 Mass. 666, 672 (1996). \u201cAlthough inherent [judicial] powers may be recognized by statute, they exist independently, because they \u2018directly affect ... the capacity of the judicial department to function\u2019 and cannot be nullified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the Legislature without violating [the separation of powers principles of] art. 30.\u201d <em>First Justice, supra, </em>quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Mass. 607, 613 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The scope of inherent judicial authority must be broad enough to allow judges to perform core functions necessary for the proper administration of justice. As the Legislature explicitly and implicitly has recognized in both \u00a7\u00a7 9 (xxiii) (CJTC) and 10 (vi) (departmental chief justice), respectively, that authority necessarily extends beyond traditional adjudication to include \u201ccertain ancillary functions such as rule-making and judicial administration, which are essential if the courts are to carry out their constitutional mandate,\u201d <em>First Justice, </em>438 Mass. at 397, quoting <em>O\u2019Coins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507, 510 (1972), including the authority \u201cto control and supervise personnel within the judicial system,\u201d <em>First Justice, supra, </em>and the \u201cpower \u2018to control... the actions of officers of the court and the environment of the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397-398, quoting <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 53, 57 (1989). We previously have held that for clerks and assistant clerks, whose duties are \u201cinextricably related to the work of the courts\u201d and \u201cessential to [their] effective functioning,\u201d it is \u201cimperative that a judge possess inherent authority to ensure that [they] perform their jobs faithfully and in a professional manner\u201d and \u201care qualified and possess the skills and competence to enable them to perform their duties ... in conformity with governing statutes, rules, orders, and standards of accountability.\u201d <em>First Justice, supra </em>at 398-399, 401. See <em>Powers, </em>465 Mass. at 82. Similarly, because a register\u2019s duties are also \u201cin the main concerned with administering justice,\u201d <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville </em>v. <em>Buonomo, </em>467 Mass. 662, 670 (2014), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>300 Mass. 596, 598 (1938), and are integral to the successful operation and functioning of our courts, see <em>First Justice, supra </em>at 398-399, those principles apply with equal force here.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Matter of Antonelli, </em>429 Mass. 644, 649 (1999) (removal of register of probate is \u201cclosely connected with judicial business and does not involve the exercise of a nonjudicial function\u201d). The decision to suspend Campatelli with pay falls well within the inherent judicial authority of Chief Justices Carey and Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez \u201cto control and supervise personnel within the judicial system.\u201d <em>First Justice, </em>438 Mass. at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">3. <em>Preliminary injunction. </em>When she filed her complaint in the county court, Campatelli filed with it a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking an order that would immediately permit her to resume performing her duties as register of probate. The single justice reported the case to the full court without decision, including the request for preliminary injunctive relief. Campatelli has not addressed that request in her brief, and we therefore treat it as waived. In any event, as the previous sections of this opinion indicate, Campatelli\u2019s legal claim here has not prevailed, and the absence of a likelihood of success on the merits of her case defeats the request for preliminary injunctive relief.

No. 1788, \u00a7 68, was passed by the Senate on December 23, 1992. It was almost identical to 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1783, except that, near the end of the subsection\u2019s provisos concerned with transfers of nonjudicial personnel or employees, the Senate added a new, penultimate proviso stating that any nonjudicial employee assigned or transferred for more than ninety days \u201cshall be deemed to be transferred permanently and notice thereof shall be sent by the [CJAM] to the house and senate committees on ways and means.\u201d This proviso was then followed immediately with the identical final proviso appearing in 1992 Senate Doc. No. 1783, namely, \u201cand provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to a clerk, clerk-magistrate, whether elected or appointed by the governor, register of probate, or recorder.\u201d These Senate bills indicate in a reasonably clear way that the final proviso was intended to apply to protect elected and appointed clerks and registers from at least permanent transfers by the CJAM.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Pertinent to this case, the enacted subsection differs from the final Senate version discussed in note 18, <em>supra, </em>in that the Senate\u2019s provisions distinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ing between temporary and permanent transfers of nonjudicial personnel have been removed; for the first time, a second sentence has been added to the subsection \u2014 that second sentence contains the only mention of permanent transfers, and the proviso excepting clerks and registers appears at the end of the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Campatelli argues that the exception stated at the end of G. L. c. 211B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u00a7 9 (xxiii), preventing the CJTC from exercising any power reserved to this court, applies in this instance because the Legislature expressly reserved to the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court in G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, the power to both remove and suspend a register of probate and, therefore, Chief Justice Carey is precluded from suspending Campatelli \u2014 in other words, Campatelli claims, use of any \u201cinherently judicial power\u201d that the CJTC may have otherwise had to suspend her is precluded by the plain language of \u00a7 9 (xxiii). We have previously considered, and rejected, Campatelli\u2019s proffered interpretation of c. 211, \u00a7 4, as exclusively vesting the authority to suspend (as opposed to remove) a register of probate. Therefore, we also reject her interpretation of c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (xxiii), as carving out of Chief Justice Carey\u2019s inherent judicial power the authority to suspend with pay the register of probate or any other official listed in c. 211, \u00a7 4, who is part of the Trial Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\">General Laws c. 211B, \u00a7 10 (vi), as amended by St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7 52 (\u00a7 10 [vi]), provides the departmental chief justices with the authority</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cnotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, when necessary to ensure the proper administration of justice, [to] transfer employees of their department to serve where needed; <em>impose discipline on such officers and employees, including dismissal and suspension with or without pay; provided, however, that they may, upon reasonable notice, temporarily transfer nonjudicial personnel within their department, </em>divisions and places for holding court, and in no event shall any such transfer be more than a reasonable distance from the place where such personnel is employed unless the employee so transferred shall consent thereto; provided, further, that such transfer of the employee shall not be for more than [ninety] days, but such transfer may be extended for [three] consecutive [ninety-]day periods, provided that notice is given to the house and senate committees on ways and means upon each extension, including the employee\u2019s position, duties, and reason for the transfer, but such transfer shall not exceed 360 consecutive days. <em>The first justice of the court to where the employee is transferred shall provide the first justice of the court to where the employee is permanently assigned </em>with appropriate personnel records and records of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>activities, including records necessary for the payment of compensation; <em>and provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to a clerk or clerk-magistrate, whether elected or appointed by the governor, register of probate or </em>recorder\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The 2011 amendments to G. L. c. 211B created the new position of deputy court administrator (DCA) for each department of the Trial Court. See G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 5A, as inserted by St. 2011, c. 93, \u00a7 52. The authority of the DCAs is not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\">General Laws c. 211B, \u00a7 10 (i), grants the chief justices of the several Trial Court departments, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">\u201cthe power to appoint, discipline, evaluate, transfer and define the du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ties of all non-judicial personnel within their department including special masters, court reporters, law clerics, temporary clerics and other support personnel consistent with the provisions of [\u00a7\u00a7] 8 and 10A; provided, however, that they shall not have the power to appoint nonjudicial personnel serving in the office of a clerk, recorder or register, but shall have the authority to discipline said clerks, recorders and registers and all other personnel in the offices of said clerks, recorders or registers, upon the raising of any dispute between a first justice and a clerk, recorder or register . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Finally, our conclusion with respect to the statutory authority of all three court officials to suspend the register of probate with pay also is unaltered by G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 10C, which imposes a general limitation on the three court officials\u2019 authority to interfere with the register in the exercise of her powers, duties, and responsibilities absent express statutory authorization. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cThe general superintendence and administrative authority of the chief justice of the trial court, court administrator, and the chief justices of the respective departments of the trial court and the first justices of particular courts shall not include the authority or power to exercise, supersede, limit, prevent the exercise of or otherwise affect any of the powers, duties and responsibilities of the clerks or registers of probate in any general or special law, including laws authorizing or governing the selection and appointment of personnel, <em>except where expressly authorized\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Campatelli argues that by suspending her, the three court officials have impermissibly prevented her from exercising the \u201cpowers, duties, and responsibilities\u201d of her office, in plain violation of \u00a7 10C. We disagree. Assuming that the three court officials have prevented Campatelli from perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ing her duties and responsibilities as register of probate, Court Administrator Spence and Chief Justice Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez were \u201cexpressly authorized\u201d to do so by the disciplinary authority granted to them in \u00a7\u00a7 9A (xii) and 10 (vi), respectively. As to Chief Justice Carey, whose disciplinary authority over Campatelli exists as part of her inherent judicial authority recognized by G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9 (xxiii), we previously have indicated that any limitation of authority imposed by \u00a7 10C on a chief justice does not preclude her from exercising inherent judicial powers that she otherwise possesses. See <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>438 Mass. 387, 406 &amp; n.12 (2003). Chief Justice Carey possessed inherent judicial authority to suspend Campatelli in appropriate circumstances, and \u00a7 10C presented no impediment to her exercise of that authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Court Administrator Spence makes no argument that he possesses inherent judicial authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> Our cases discussing inherent judicial authority as it relates to clerks and clerk-magistrates are applicable equally to the register of probate.
