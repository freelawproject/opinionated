R. Civ. P. 12 (h) (1), as appearing in 450 Mass. 1403 (2008). American International Insurance Company (AIIC) filed a complaint in the Superior Court against Robert Seuffer GmbH &amp; Co. KG (Seuffer), alleging various theories of products liability. In its answer, Seuffer raised the defense of a lack of personal jurisdiction, but did not move to dismiss the case on that basis. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). Instead, it pursued litigation on the merits for over eighteen months before filing a motion for summary judgment that was predicated largely on the jurisdictional defense. A Superior Court judge denied the motion, ruling both that while Seuffer did not have the minimum contacts with Massachusetts necessary for personal jurisdiction, its conduct amounted to a waiver<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the defense, and that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the merits which precluded the entry of summary judgment. Seuffer appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We conclude that, where a party raises the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in a responsive pleading, the party\u2019s subsequent conduct may in some circumstances result in a forfeiture of that defense. The determination whether a party\u2019s conduct will cause it to forfeit the right to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction is fact specific and must be made on a case-by-case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>basis. Although extant Massachusetts case law had not squarely addressed the point, the weight of precedent fairly put Seuffer on notice that merely asserting the jurisdictional defense in its answer, without more, might be insufficient to preserve the defense. Moreover, as the motion judge did not err in determining that Seuffer\u2019s conduct reasonably could be deemed to merit the consequence of forfeiture, the denial of Seuffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>This case arose from claims for damages to a valuable painting owned by AIIC\u2019s insured, David Croll. On June 11, 2008, the painting, affixed to a wall in Croll\u2019s residence by two \u201cFloreat\u201d picture hangers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> manufactured by Seuffer, fell from the wall, causing the canvas to tear. Seuffer, a privately owned German company, had sold the picture hangers to Ziabicki Import Company, Inc. (Ziabicki), which in turn had sold them to Croll.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">AIIC, as subrogee of Croll, filed suit against Seuffer and Ziabicki on December 16, 2009, alleging negligence, breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness, and a violation of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Under a Superior Court tracking order dated December 16, 2009,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the suit was designated as \u201cF Track,\u201d requiring that any motions filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12, 365 Mass. 754 (1974), be submitted by May 15, 2010. On January 20, 2010, Ziabicki answered the complaint and filed a cross claim against Seuffer. On March 24, 2010, in its first pleading, Seuffer answered the complaint. Seuffer asserted lack of personal jurisdiction as an affirmative defense and, in the opening paragraph of the answer, stated that it was \u201cspecially appearing and specifically reserving the right to contest this Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over [it].\u201d On June 28, 2010, Seuffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>answered Ziabicki\u2019s cross claim and filed a cross claim against Ziabicki. In that pleading, Seuffer stated that it was incorporating all the affirmative defenses in its answer to AIIC\u2019s complaint, but did not otherwise mention a special appearance or explicitly set forth lack of personal jurisdiction as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The parties subsequently engaged in discovery as to the merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On March 30, 2010, Seuffer served AIIC with interrogatories and document requests; on August 23, 2010, Seuffer responded to AIIC\u2019s interrogatories. On December 2, 2010, Seuffer served Ziabicki with interrogatories and document requests. It also took the depositions of four people: Croll; John L\u2019Huillier, the president of Ziabicki; Jim Wright, the restorer who repaired the painting; and Matthew Sontag, AIIC\u2019s insurance claims adjuster. The deposition of L\u2019Huillier included questions designed to elicit information about any contacts Seuffer may have had with Massachusetts. Additionally, Seuffer joined Ziabicki\u2019s request to inspect the subject nails and picture hangers, and subsequently conducted an inspection with Ziabicki. On August 5, 2011, Seuffer filed an emergency motion to compel inspection of the Croll residence, which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Twenty months after filing its answer to the complaint, Seuffer filed a motion for summary judgment against AIIC based on lack of personal jurisdiction, and, in the alternative, on the merits. In denying the motion, the judge determined that, while the court lacked personal jurisdiction over Seuffer, Seuffer had nonetheless waived this defense by litigating the merits of the case and thereby submitting to the jurisdiction of the court. The judge also ruled that the existence of genuine issues of material fact otherwise precluded entry of summary judgment. Seuffer timely filed a petition for interlocutory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, and a single justice of the Appeals Court granted Seuffer leave to file an interlocutory appeal. The case was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>in the Appeals Court on January 31, 2013, and we granted AIIC\u2019s petition for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review the disposition of a motion for summary judgment de nova, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007), to determine whether all material facts have been established such that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). We construe \u201call facts in favor of the nonmoving party,\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, supra, </em>citing <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>and we may consider any grounds that support the motion judge\u2019s ruling. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Group Health Inc., </em>444 Mass. 668, 672 (2005), citing <em>Hawthorne\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Warrenton Realty, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 200, 210 n.6 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">b. <em>Constructive waiver or forfeiture under rule 12. </em>The two provisions of rule 12 pivotal to our analysis are rule 12 (b), which concerns how a party properly may assert an affirmative defense, and rule 12 (h) (1), which outlines when certain of those defenses may be deemed waived. Rule 12 (b) states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201c[ejvery defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in any pleading . . . shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required, except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: ... (2) Lack of jurisdiction over the person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">In turn, rule 12 (h) (1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\u201cA defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person . . . is waived (A) if omitted from a motion [to dismiss], or (B) if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof permitted by Rule 15(a) to be made as a matter of course.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The parties dispute whether, given the quoted language, conducting litigation on the merits for over eighteen months after having asserted a lack of personal jurisdiction in an answer, without filing a motion to dismiss, may result in the forfeiture of such a defense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Seuffer maintains that the plain language of rules 12 (b) and 12 (h) (1), read together, permits a party to raise and preserve a defense predicated on lack of personal jurisdiction either by bringing a rule 12 (b) (2) motion or, as was done here, by asserting it as an affirmative defense in a responsive pleading. On this view, a party who has raised a defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in either a motion or in a responsive pleading has done all it need do to preserve that defense. Because the defense \u201cis waived . . . if it is neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading,\u201d Seuffer contends that, conversely, it is <em>not </em>waived if raised in either a motion or a pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">AIIC, however, interprets rule 12 (h) (1) to mean that a party who initially raises the lack of personal jurisdiction as an affirmative defense in its answer may nevertheless forfeit the defense by virtue of that party\u2019s subsequent conduct. In other words, failure to raise the defense in a motion or responsive pleading would ensure its forfeiture, but inclusion of the defense in such a pleading might not ensure its preservation. Under this reading, while the affirmative defense concerning lack of personal jurisdiction \u201cis waived\u201d if not asserted in a motion to dismiss or in the answer, it also may be forfeited if raised in a pleading but not pursued subsequently, either by a defendant\u2019s active participation in litigation or as a result of the defendant\u2019s dilatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The Appeals Court implicitly has adopted AIIC\u2019s interpretation of rule 12 (h) (1) in other factual contexts, suggesting that a party may, by virtue of its conduct, forfeit all waivable affirmative defenses previously asserted in a defensive pleading, including the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. See <em>Lamarche </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 887, 889, 890 (2006), citing <em>Precision Etchings &amp; Findings, Inc. </em>v. <em>LGP Gem, Ltd., </em>953 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1992) (personal jurisdiction defense waivable by \u201cconduct, express submission, or extended inaction,\u201d with threshold question being whether defendant brought defense to attention of court before actively participating in further court proceedings); <em>Sarin </em>v. <em>Ochsner, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 421, 422-423 (2000) (personal jurisdiction defense waived, despite its assertion in answer, where defendant did not actively pursue defense until almost three years after default judgment entered for plaintiff). See also J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 12.9, at 204 (2d ed. 2006) (party who raises defense in answer but \u201cactively participates in the proceedings and does not in some way bring the issue to the court\u2019s attention constructively abandons\u201d defense). Cf. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Boykan, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 464, 466-467 (2011), <em>S.C., </em>464 Mass. 285 (2013) (\u201cprevailing interpretation\u201d of rule 12 requires party to raise any affirmative defense within reasonable time and prior to litigation on merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>to avoid waiver); <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 78-79 (1998) (waiver where party who did not allege personal jurisdiction defense in answer actively litigated case, then raised defense for first time three years after initial complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Those Federal courts to have considered the issue have concluded likewise. Under Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, upon which the Massachusetts rule is modeled, see <em>Raposo </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 379, 383 (2008); Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 12, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 192 (LexisNexis 2013-2014), alleging lack of personal jurisdiction in a responsive pleading does not \u201cpreserve the defense in perpetuity.\u201d <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Northern Dutchess Hosp., </em>106 F.R.D. <em>477, </em>481 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). See <em>Plunkett </em>v. <em>Valhalla Inv. Servs., Inc., </em>409 F. Supp. 2d 39, 41 (D. Mass. 2006). Indeed, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h) \u201csets only the outer limits of waiver; it does not preclude waiver by implication.\u201d <em>Yeldell </em>v. <em>Tutt, </em>913 F.2d 533, 539 (8th Cir. 1990), quoting <em>Marquest Med. Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>EMDE Corp., </em>496 F. Supp. 1242, 1245 n.1 (D. Colo. 1980). See <em>Gerber </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>649 F.3d 514, 519 (6th Cir. 2011); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Atlas Turner, Inc., </em>197 F.3d 58, 60-62 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1244 (2000). See also <em>Continental Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>10 F.3d 1293, 1297 (7th Cir. 1993), quoting <em>Trustees of Cent. Laborers\u2019 Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Lowery, </em>924 F.2d 731, 732 (7th Cir. 1991) (\u201cprivileged defenses\u201d in rule 12[h][l] waivable by conduct); <em>Marcial Ucin, S.A. </em>v. <em>SS Galicia, </em>723 F.2d 994, 996 (1st Cir. 1983), quoting <em>Neirbo Co. </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>308 U.S. 165, 168 (1939) (failure seasonably to assert personal jurisdiction defense or submission to jurisdiction through conduct may result in forfeiture). \u201c[W]e interpret our rule[] consistently with the construction given [its] Federal counterpart[], . . . absent compelling reasons to the contrary or significant differences in content.\u201d <em>Strom </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>423 Mass. 330, 335 (1996), quoting <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 800 (1987), and <em>Rollins Envtl. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 174, 180 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The Federal interpretation recognizes that the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, unlike certain other affirmative defenses enumerated in rule 12 (b), is a potentially dispositive procedural defect. See, e.g., <em>Cognex Corp. </em>v. <em>Lemelson Med., Educ. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Research Found., </em>67 F. Supp. 2d 5, 9 (D. Mass. 1999) (where court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant, it was \u201cunnecessary to address the remaining issues raised in [the defendant\u2019s] motion to dismiss\u201d). Whereas improper venue, insufficient service of process, the misnomer of a party, and the failure to join a party, inter alla, may be cured, no party can remedy the absence of minimum contacts<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or manufacture jurisdiction where it does not lie. For this reason, it is particularly desirable to resolve a defect in personal jurisdiction prior to engaging in substantive litigation. Where a party intends to rely upon its lack of minimum contacts with the forum State to avoid liability, fairness to the other litigants and to the court dictates that it seek to resolve the matter expeditiously, insofar as is feasible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Raposo </em>v. <em>Evans, supra </em>at 386, quoting <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Northern Dutchess Hosp., supra </em>at 481 (\u201ca prompt motion to dismiss would have saved all parties and the court the expense of years of discovery, pre-trial conferences and motions relating to discovery and to the merits of the complaint\u201d). Foreclosing the possibility of forfeiture following the assertion of the defense in its answer, irrespective of subsequent conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>would permit a party to keep the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in its back pocket, even while engaging in conduct signaling that it is submitting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Given the \u201csubstantial time, expense, and effort\u201d of litigation, <em>Raposo </em>v. <em>Evans, supra </em>at 385, parties who seriously contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction ordinarily have little incentive to delay a determination whether minimum contacts exist. However, where a party does seek \u201cto obtain the very delay which Rule 12 was designed to prevent,\u201d <em>Marcial Ucin, S.A. </em>v. <em>SS Galicia, supra </em>at 997, foreclosing the possibility of forfeiture even where a party \u201cfailed to channel [its] efforts\u201d in service of its jurisdictional defense would permit that party to \u201cgamble[] that it could raise the personal jurisdiction issue on the eve of trial, in case a trial occurred.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Atlas Turner, Inc., supra </em>at 62. Imposing upon a defendant who claims that a forum lacks personal jurisdiction over it the obligation reasonably to press the point fairly puts the court and the other litigants on notice that the issue is contested and should be resolved, thereby promoting judicial economy and efficiency. See <em>Lamarche </em>v. <em>Lussier, supra </em>at 890 (\u201cdefendant brought the jurisdictional defense to the attention of the court before further proceedings had gotten underway\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">This approach accords with the fundamental purpose of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure to ensure \u201cthe just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action,\u201d see Mass. R. Civ. P. 1, as amended, 450 Mass. 1403 (2008); <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>369 Mass. 598, 602 (1976), and furthers the broad goals of rule 12. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 12, <em>supra </em>at 192 (rule 12 [h] [1] seeks to \u201cconserve judicial time by preventing a defendant from serially raising objections which the plaintiff might well be able to meet\u201d). See also J.W. Smith &amp; H.B Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 12.22, at 221 (2d ed. 2006). Permitting conduct-based forfeiture even where a party has alleged the lack of personal jurisdiction in its answer promotes, in particular, the purpose of rule 12 (h), namely, \u201cthe avoidance of time-consuming, piece-meal litigation of pre-trial motions.\u201d 5C C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1391, at 506 (3d ed. 2004), quoting <em>Tiernan </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>295 F. Supp. 1253, 1256 (D.R.I. 1969). See <em>Yeldell </em>v. <em>Tutt, supra </em>at 539 (rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>12 seeks \u201cto expedite and simplify proceedings in the [courts]\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that raising the absence of personal jurisdiction as a defense in a responsive pleading may not alone suffice to preserve that defense. If a party alleges a lack of personal jurisdiction in an answer and then fails timely to pursue the defense, a forfeiture of that defense may result. See <em>Sarin </em>v. <em>Ochsner, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 421, 422-423 (2000) (\u201cdefendants\u2019 active participation in the proceedings, albeit they alleged the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in their answer, amounted to a waiver of that defense\u201d); <em>Yeldell </em>v. <em>Tutt, </em>913 F.2d 533, 539 (8th Cir. 1990) (discussing defense of lack of personal jurisdiction and noting that waiver may occur where defendants\u2019 \u201cconduct in delaying consideration of [personal jurisdiction] manifests an intent to submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d). Parties who opt to raise such a defense in a responsive pleading may ensure its preservation by moving to dismiss pursuant to rule 12 (b) (2) \u201cwithin a reasonable time, prior to substantially participating in discovery and litigating the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Raposo </em>v. <em>Evans, supra </em>at 385. To hold otherwise \u201cwould elevate formality over substance and would lead plaintiffs to waste time, money, and judicial resources pursuing a cause of action.\u201d <em>Broadcast Music, Inc. </em>v. <em>M.T.S. Enters., Inc., </em>811 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The inquiry whether a party has forfeited a defense predicated on a lack of personal jurisdiction necessarily will be fact sensitive, requiring a thorough assessment of the parties\u2019 conduct throughout the litigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Factors that could be relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>such an inquiry may include the amount of time that has elapsed, as well as the changed procedural posture of the case, in the period between the party\u2019s initial and subsequent assertion of the defense; the extent to which the party engaged in discovery on the merits; and whether the party engaged in substantive pretrial motion practice or otherwise actively participated in the litigation. See <em>Sarin </em>v. <em>Ochsner, supra </em>at 422-423 (defendant who raised personal jurisdiction defense in answer, \u201cactively] participat[ed] in the proceedings,\u201d and did not reassert defense until almost three years after default judgment for plaintiffs waived defense); <em>Vangel </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 78-79 (1998) (defendant who did not assert personal jurisdiction defense until three years after initial complaint, and who actively participated in discovery on merits, waived defense). See also <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Atlas Turner, Inc., </em>197 F.3d 58, 61-62 (2d Cir. 1999) (defendant who asserted personal jurisdiction defense in answer, participated in \u201c[considerable pretrial activity,\u201d and did not reassert defense until four years after answer forfeited defense); <em>Yeldell </em>v. <em>Tutt, supra </em>at 539 (defendant who asserted personal jurisdiction defense in answer, subsequently participated in motion practice and discovery, and did not reassert defense until appeal waived defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">c. <em>Retroactive application. </em>Ordinarily, our holdings \u201cappl[y] to past as well as to subsequent transactions or occurrences.\u201d See <em>Schrottman </em>v. <em>Barnicle, </em>386 Mass. 627, 631 (1982); <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Badoian, 376 </em>Mass. 907, 918 (1978) (Kaplan, J., concurring in the result).

In making this determination, we consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>extent to which a decision creates a novel rule, whether retroactive application will serve the purposes of that rule, and whether hardship or inequity would result from retroactive application. <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>464 Mass. 261, 268 (2013), quoting <em>Keller </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>425 Mass. 774, 782 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, there is no reason to disturb the presumptively retroactive application of the interpretation of rule 12 (h) (1) we announce today. Seuffer contends that where the language of rule 12 (h) (1), standing alone or when read in conjunction with rule 12 (b), admits of multiple interpretations, it was not unreasonable for litigants to have concluded prior to our decision today that raising a jurisdictional defense in a responsive pleading would suffice to preserve it. We acknowledge that it is possible to read rule 12 (h) (1) so as to permit a party, after alleging a defense of the lack of personal jurisdiction in its answer, to participate in litigation on the merits without risking the subsequent forfeiture of that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">However, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the Appeals Court has added an appreciable gloss to the text of rule 12 (h) (1), suggesting that a party\u2019s conduct may serve to indicate its intent to submit to the jurisdiction of the court, even when that party raised a defense of a lack of personal jurisdiction in its answer. See, e.g., <em>Lamarche </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 887, 889, 890 (2006); <em>Sarin </em>v. <em>Ochsner, supra </em>at 422-423. Although the Appeals Court cases addressing the question dealt with facts somewhat distinct from those at issue here, we cannot say that those cases did not put Seuffer on notice that the Commonwealth had recognized the possibility of forfeiture in the context of rule 12 (h) (1). We have applied our holdings prospectively primarily where the rule announced marks a substantial departure from prior precedent. See, e.g., <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 269 (prospective application appropriate where party could not have been expected \u201cto divine ... a dramatic shift in our decisional law\u201d); <em>Keller </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra </em>at 781 n.16 (prospective application appropriate where party \u201ccould not have known that we would change the law that had been applied for almost a century\u201d). That is not so here, given that our holding today affirms, rather than contradicts, extant Massachusetts case law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>concerning the forfeiture of a defense of a lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Nor can we say that undue hardship would result from the retroactive application of our decision to Seuffer. Seuffer rightly notes that, in at least one deposition, counsel inquired as to contacts Seuffer had with Massachusetts. Over the course of nearly two years after it raised the defense of a lack of personal jurisdiction in its answer, however, Seuffer initiated motions to extend the discovery schedule, filed a motion to compel the inspection of the Croll residence, joined in a request to inspect the Floreat picture hangers, and served Ziabicki with interrogatories and document requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Given this degree of active participation in the litigation, the judge did not err in concluding that Seuffer had caused both AIIC and the court to have a reasonable expectation that it would defend the suit on the merits. In the circumstances, SBuffer\u2019s reliance on its plausible but hardly unassailable interpretation of rule 12 (h) (1) is not dispositive, and we discern no error in the judge\u2019s denial of Seuffer\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The plaintiff and the motion judge employed the term \u201cwaiver\" as well as the term \u201cforfeiture.\u201d Where a party fails to raise a jurisdictional defense, it properly may be said to have waived that defense. However, \u201c[wjhere a litigant\u2019s action or inaction is deemed to incur the consequence of loss of a right, or, as here, a defense, the term \u2018forfeiture\u2019 is more appropriate.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Atlas Turner, Inc., </em>197 F.3d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1244 (2000) (defendant who raised defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in answer, litigated case on merits for four years, then raised motion to dismiss on same grounds had forfeited that defense by virtue of his conduct). See <em>King </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>694 F.3d 650, 658 &amp; n.3 (6th Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 1473 (2013) (defendant who raises affirmative defense in answer \u201cmay forfeit the right to seek a ruling on that defense at a later juncture through his conduct\u201d). Because Robert Seuffer GmbH &amp; Co. KG (Seuffer), like the defendant in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Atlas Turner, Inc., supra, </em>raised the jurisdictional defense in its answer but is purported to have acquiesced to the court\u2019s jurisdiction via its subsequent conduct, we use the term forfeiture rather than waiver in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The \u201cFloreat\u201d hanger consists of a nail that secures a hanging device to a wall. Here, the nail component of the two devices snapped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Specifically, AIIC alleged that the nails involved in the Floreat hangers were defectively designed because Seuffer used an insufficient quality control test, and that the nails were defectively manufactured, making them excessively hard. Seuffer contests these allegations but took no position as to the cause of the breakage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Standing Order 1-88 of the Superior Court, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, at 1108 (LexisNexis 2013-2014), effective March 1, 2007, established time standards applicable to civil actions filed in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The parties filed three joint motions to extend the tracking order. The first was filed on September 22, 2010, the second on February 3, 2011, and the third on May 18, 2011.

P. 12, 365 Mass. 754 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Although Seuffer submits that we should review the motion judge\u2019s order for an abuse of discretion, we have applied the de nova standard to dispositions of motions for summary judgment when such motions are before us on an interlocutory appeal. See, e.g., <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>408 Mass. 621, 623-624 (1990) (party sought interlocutory appeal from denial of its motion for summary judgment; on direct appellate review, court examined summary judgment record de nova); <em>Fortenbacher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 82, 85 (2008) (reviewing de nova Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal from denial of its motion for summary judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">While a defense predicated on the lack of personal jurisdiction may be waived pursuant to rule 12 (h) (1), as appearing in 450 Mass. 1403 (2008), a defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable. Pursuant to rule 12 (h) (3), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), \u201c[wjhenever it appears by suggestion of a party or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">We assume without deciding that a defendant who has asserted the lack of personal jurisdiction as a defense in a responsive pleading subsequently may file a motion to dismiss on that ground pursuant to rule 12 (b) (2). This is so even though rule 12 (b) notes that \u201c[a] motion making any of [the enumerated defenses in rule 12 (b) (1)-(10)] shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted.\u201d Although this language could be read to bar a defendant who raises an affirmative defense in its answer from filing a motion to dismiss on that ground, State and Federal courts have interpreted the above provision as applying only when a defendant opts, in the first instance, to assert an affirmative defense in a motion to dismiss. See <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Atlas Turner, Inc., </em>197 F.3d 58, 60, 61, 62 (2d Cir. 1999) (court assumed defendant asserting personal jurisdiction defense in answer, pursuing litigation for four years, then filing motion to dismiss on same grounds was not barred from filing that motion); <em>Yeldell </em>v. <em>Tutt, </em>913 F.2d 533, 539 (8th Cir. 1990) (implying that defendants asserting personal jurisdiction defense in answer could raise that issue in motion to dismiss); <em>Raposo </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 379, 382 (2008) (impliedly assuming defendant who raised rule 12 [b] affirmative defense in answer subsequently could file motion to dismiss on same grounds). See also 5B C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1351, at 272 (2004) (party is required to file motion to dismiss before pleading only if party elects to raise personal jurisdiction defense by motion rather than in answer); Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 12, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 192 (LexisNexis 2013-2014) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Personal jurisdiction is further distinguished from other rule 12 defenses in that it has constitutional dimensions emanating from the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 701-702 (1982), and its cognate provision in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, <em>Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>457 Mass. 210, 217 (2010), quoting <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 763, 772 (1994). However, like certain other affirmative defenses contemplated by rule 12 (b), \u201cthe requirement of personal jurisdiction . . .can. . .be waived.\u201d <em>Insurance Corp. of Ireland </em>v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, supra </em>at 703. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 12, <em>supra </em>at 192 (\u201cEach of the defects covered by Rule 12 [b][2]-[5] and [8]\u201d is waivable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The facts of this case illustrate the consequences of delay in the resolution of a party\u2019s personal jurisdiction defense. Because of Seuffer\u2019s nearly two-year delay in filing a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, were Seuffer to have prevailed thereafter in its motion for summary judgment, all statutes of limitation applicable to AHC\u2019s claims would likely have mn. AIIC would thereby have been precluded from filing suit in Wisconsin, an alternative jurisdiction where Seuffer\u2019s minimum contacts might well be sufficient. Given that the dispute involves events that occurred in Massachusetts, Wisconsin would presumably apply Massachusetts statutes of limitation. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.07 (2013). A party\u2019s dilatory conduct as to its jurisdictional defense, therefore, functionally may bar an opposing party from availing itself of any legal forum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Upon a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to rule 12 (b) (2), the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating the existence of minimum contacts. See, e.g., <em>Lamarche </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 887, 893 (2006), citing <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. 149, 151 (1978).
