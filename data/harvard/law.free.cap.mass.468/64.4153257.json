L. c. 76, \u00a7 5, which prohibits discrimination in Massachusetts public school education. We hold that the recitation of the pledge, which is entirely voluntary, violates neither the Constitution nor the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>The plaintiffs, Jane Doe and John Doe, commenced this action in the Superior Court challenging the practice by which the pledge is recited each morning in the public schools of the town of Acton and the Acton-Boxborough regional school district. The plaintiffs and their children are both atheists and Humanists.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They alleged, among other things, that the daily recitation of the pledge violated their rights under the Massachusetts Constitution \u2014 specifically, art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments (art. 106)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 because the pledge includes the words \u201cunder God.\u201d They also alleged that the recitation of the pledge violated G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They sought declaratory and injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>live relief, including a declaration that the daily, in-school recitation of the pledge in its current form, including the words \u201cunder God,\u201d violated their State constitutional and statutory rights; an order enjoining the defendants from continuing with the pledge in its current form or in any form that includes affirmations as to the existence or nonexistence of a deity; and a declaration that the recitation of a form of the pledge with the words \u201cunder God\u201d omitted would not violate the Massachusetts Constitution or G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">All parties moved for summary judgment. A judge in the Superior Court granted the motions of the defendants and the interveners and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The plaintiffs appealed. We granted their application for direct appellate review, which was supported by the defendants and interveners.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>The following facts are drawn from the summary judgment record, which in this case included numerous affidavits filed by both sides. No party contended that there were any genuine issues of material fact that precluded the granting of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The pledge is recited in the defendants\u2019 schools on a daily basis. The language of the pledge states: \u201cI pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>liberty and justice for all.\u201d This language is codified at 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 (2012).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The pledge was first codified in 1942, but at that time it did not include the words \u201cunder God.\u201d Those words were added to the statute in 1954, in circumstances we shall describe below.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The pledge is recited in the defendants\u2019 schools, and in schools across Massachusetts, pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 69, which provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[ejach teacher at the commencement of the first class of each day in all grades in all public schools shall lead the class in a group recitation of the \u2018Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.\u2019 \u201d The parties do not dispute that the flag ceremony, of which the pledge is a part, is intended to instill values of patriotism and good citizenship. Although the statute purports to impose a monetary fine on teachers who fail to lead the pledge, the parties do not dispute that the defendants\u2019 school administration does not require participation by teachers or students. The school superintendent, in his affidavit, avers that \u201c[f]or both students and teachers, participation in the Pledge of Allegiance is totally voluntary. Any teacher or student may abstain themselves from participation in the Pledge of Allegiance for any or no reason, without explanation and without any form of recrimination or sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">At the time the parties filed their cross motions for summary judgment, the Does\u2019 three children were fourteen, twelve, and ten years old. They acknowledged in their affidavits<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that \u201c[they] understand that [they] have the right to refuse to participate in the flag-salute ceremony, but [they] want to participate in it.\u201d They also acknowledged that \u201c[i]n fact, usually when [their] class[es] say[] the Pledge [they] do participate in the ceremony (although [they] usually do not say the \u2018under God\u2019 words).\u201d The children, as atheists and Humanists, \u201cdo not believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the United States of America or any other country is \u2018under God.\u2019 \u201d They stated that they believe that the pledge, as recited in their schools, \u201csuggests that all good Americans believe in God\u201d and that others, like them, \u201cwho don\u2019t believe in God, aren\u2019t as good as others who do believe.\u201d Jane Doe and John Doe, in their affidavits, likewise expressed concern that the recitation of the pledge \u201cmarginalizes [their] children and [their] family and reinforces [a] general public prejudice against atheists and Humanists, as it necessarily classifies [them] as outsiders, defines [them] as second-class citizens, and even suggests that [they are] unpatriotic.\u201d They claimed that \u201c[i]t is inappropriate for [their] children to have to draw attention to themselves by not participating, possibly leading to unwanted attention, criticism and potential bullying,\u201d and that at their children\u2019s ages, \u201c \u2018fitting in\u2019 is an important psychological need.\u201d As the motion judge noted in her memorandum of decision, however, there is no evidence in the summary judgment record that the Doe children have ever been subjected to any type of punishment, bullying or other mistreatment, criticism, condemnation, or ostracism as a result of not participating in the pledge or not reciting the words \u201cunder God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>History. </em>We begin with a short overview of the history of the pledge. As many courts have concluded, the pledge is a fundamentally patriotic exercise, not a religious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The pledge first appeared in 1892 in a nationally circulated magazine for American youths. <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Newdow, </em>542 U.S. 1, 6 (2004). Its timing coincided with the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019s arrival in America, and with a nationwide interest in commemorating that historic occasion. <em>Id. </em>The magazine proposed that students recite the following words as part of a flag-salute ceremony that would take place in the Nation\u2019s schools, designed to instill a sense of national unity and patriotism: \u201cI pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The phrase \u201cone Nation indivisible\u201d was particularly meaningful at that time, in light of the fact that the country had, in its recent past, fought and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>survived the Civil War with the national unity intact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 6 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The pledge was first adopted by Congress in 1942, during World War II. <em>Id. </em>at 6, citing Pub. L. No. 77-623, 77th Cong., c. 435, \u00a7 7, 56 Stat. 377 (1942).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The pledge was one part of a joint Congressional resolution establishing \u201ca detailed set of \u2018rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 6, quoting Pub. L. No. 77-623. \u201cThis resolution, which marked the first appearance of the Pledge of Allegiance in positive law, confirmed the importance of the flag as a symbol of our Nation\u2019s indivisibility and commitment to the concept of liberty.\u201d <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In 1954, Congress amended the pledge to include the words \u201cunder God.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See Pub. L. No. 83-396, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., c. 297, 68 Stat. 249 (1954). The amendment came during the escalation of the Cold War, and there is some indication in the legislative history that the amendment was intended to underscore that the American form of government was \u201cfounded on the concept of the individuality and the dignity of the human being,\u201d which is grounded in \u201cthe belief that the human person is important because he was created by God and endowed by Him with certain inalienable rights which no civil authority may usurp.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., at 1-2 (1954). The House Report acknowledges that \u201c[f]rom the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The report identifies a number of historical statements and documents of the founding fathers and subsequent national leaders that refer expressly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u201cGod,\u201d \u201cNature\u2019s God,\u201d the \u201cCreator,\u201d and like terms, and that reflect an understanding that the Nation was founded on a belief in God, including the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, and the Gettysburg Address. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 213 (1963) (\u201cThe fact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself\u201d); <em>Newdow </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., </em>597 F.3d 1007, 1032, 1038 (9th Cir. 2010) (\u201cThe words \u2018under God\u2019 were added as a description of \u2018one Nation\u2019 primarily to reinforce the idea that our nation is founded upon the concept of a limited government, in stark contrast to the unlimited power exercised by communist forms of government\u201d; \u201cA reasonable observer . . . aware of the history and origins of the words in the Pledge would view the Pledge as a product of this nation\u2019s history and political philosophy\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Although the words \u201cunder God\u201d undeniably have a religious tinge, courts that have considered the history of the pledge and the presence of those words have consistently concluded that the pledge, notwithstanding its reference to God, is a fundamentally patriotic exercise, not a religious one. See, e.g., <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist., </em>542 U.S. at 6 (\u201cAs its history illustrates, the Pledge of Allegiance evolved as a common public acknowledgment of the ideals that our flag symbolizes. Its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those principles\u201d); <em>Newdow </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., </em>597 F.3d at 1014 (\u201cWe hold that the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the Establishment Clause [of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution] because Congress\u2019 ostensible and predominant purpose was to inspire patriotism and that the context of the Pledge \u2014 its wording as a whole, the preamble to the statute, and this nation\u2019s history \u2014 demonstrate that it is a predominantly patriotic exercise. For these reasons, the phrase \u2018one Nation under God\u2019 does not turn this patriotic exercise into a religious activity\u201d); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Loudon County Pub. Sch., </em>418 F.3d 395, 407 (4th Cir. 2005) (distinguishing constitutional challenge to pledge from school prayer cases because of \u201cthe simple fact that the Pledge, unlike prayer, is not a religious exercise or activity, but a patriotic one\u201d; stating that inclusion of words \u201cunder God,\u201d despite their religious significance, \u201cdoes not alter the <em>nature </em>of the Pledge as a patriotic activity\u201d). It is principally for that reason that all the Federal appellate courts that have considered a First Amendment challenge to the voluntary recitation of the pledge in public schools, with the words \u201cunder God,\u201d have held the practice to be constitutional. See <em>Freedom From Religion Found. </em>v. <em>Hanover Sch. Dist., </em>626 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2292 (2011); <em>Croft </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>624 F.3d 157, 162-163 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>Newdow </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 1042; <em>Myers, supra </em>at 408; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Community Consol. Sch. Dist. 21 of Wheeling Township, </em>980 F.2d 437, 439-440 (7th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 950 (1993).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">b. <em>Voluntary recitation. </em>It is undisputed, as a matter of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>constitutional law and as a matter of fact on the summary judgment record before us, that no student is required to recite the pledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The statute that calls for the daily recitation of the pledge in Massachusetts schools, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 69, on its face imposes no affirmative requirement on students to participate. It purports, at most, to require teachers to lead a daily recitation of the pledge, a requirement that is itself of doubtful constitutional legitimacy. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>372 Mass. 874 (1977). In the seminal case of <em>West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Barnette, </em>319 U.S. 624 (1943), the United States Supreme Court considered a claim that the mandatory recitation of the pledge by school students violated the First Amendment. The plaintiffs in that case were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who objected on free speech and free exercise grounds to both a mandatory salute to the flag and a mandatory recitation of the pledge required by the State board of education. <em>Id. </em>at 629-630. The Court held that the mandatory salute and pledge violated the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The <em>Barnette </em>decision sounded the death knell for any statute, governmental regulation, or policy that purports to impose a requirement on students to recite the pledge. The Attorneys General of this Commonwealth have long recognized this to be the case. See Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. 12 at 170 n.1 (1977); Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. 12 at 106 (1970); Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. 12 at 243 (1965); Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. 12 at 64 (1943). The individual Justices of this court likewise have recognized it to be true. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>372 Mass. at 880 (\u201cWe think it is clear from the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the <em>Barnette </em>case that no punishment of any kind may be imposed on a student who elects, as a matter of principle, to abstain from participation\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 881 (\u201cit is clear that no such decision [requiring a student to participate in the recitation of the pledge and punishing noncompliance] could be made today\u201d). Although this court has not been called on previously to so state, we take this opportunity to confirm what has been obvious and understood to be the case for the decades since the <em>Barnette </em>case was decided: no Massachusetts school student is required by law to recite the pledge or to participate in the ceremony of which the pledge is a part. Recitation of the pledge is entirely optional. Students are free, for any reason or for no reason at all, to recite it in its entirety, not recite it at all, or recite or decline to recite any part of it they choose, without fear of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">c. <em>Analysis under the equal rights amendment. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim in this case is very limited. They do not claim that the practice of reciting the pledge violates their religious rights under the establishment or free exercise clauses of the First Amendment, or under cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution. Nor do the plaintiffs make any other claim under the Federal Constitution. Their sole constitutional claim is an equal protection claim brought pursuant to the equal rights amendment, art. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The plaintiffs rely on our recent decision in <em>Finch </em>v. Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>monwealth Health Ins. Connector Auth., </em>459 Mass. 655 (2011), <em>S.C., </em>461 Mass. 232 (2012), for the proposition that the recitation of the pledge is subject to strict scrutiny in Massachusetts because it discriminates against them on the basis of a classification identified in art. 106, i.e., their religion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <em>Finch </em>decision reaffirmed that \u201c[t]he classifications set forth in art. 106 [(sex, race, color, creed, or national origin)] ... are subjected to the strictest judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 21 (1977). See <em>Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Bd., </em>416 Mass. 635, 640 (1993) (\u201cClassifications based on sex, race, color, creed or national origin are considered suspect\u201d). \u201cEffectively, art. 106 removes the first step \u2014 determination whether a classification is suspect \u2014 from equal protection analysis and mandates strict scrutiny of the enumerated classifications.\u201d <em>Finch, supra, </em>citing <em>King, supra. </em>Thus, if the practice of reciting the pledge did in fact single out the plaintiffs and treat them differently from others in any legally cognizable way (in other words, create a \u201cclassification\u201d) because of their religious beliefs, their argument might be commendable. The flaw in the argument, however, is that there is no classification, let alone a suspect classification based on religion, created by the practice of reciting the pledge in the manner it is presently recited, voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Classification, and differing treatment based on a classification, are essential components of any equal protection claim, Federal or State. See <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985), citing <em>Plyer </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982) (equal protection mandate \u201cis essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike\u201d); <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 59-60 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (\u201cThe function of the Equal Protection Clause ... is simply to measure the validity of <em>classifications </em>created by state laws. There is hardly a law on the books that does not affect some people differently from others. But the basic concern of the Equal Protection Clause is with state legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>whose purpose or effect is to create discrete and objectively identifiable classes\u201d); <em>Wirzburger </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>412 F.3d 271, 283 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1150 (2006) (provisions of art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2, of Amendments to Massachusetts Constitution, which exclude from initiative petition process any measure related to \u201creligion, religious practices or religious institutions,\u201d or which concern art. 18, as amended by arts. 46 and 103 of Amendments to Massachusetts Constitution, the so-called anti-aid amendment, \u201cdo not require different treatment of any class of people because of their religious beliefs. . . . In short, this is not the classic violation of equal protection in which a law creates different rules for distinct groups of individuals based on a suspect classification\u201d). See also <em>Finch, supra </em>at 676 (\u201c[T]he right to equal protection recognizes that the act of classification is itself invidious and is thus constitutionally acceptable only where it meets an exacting test\u201d); <em>Matter of Corliss, </em>424 Mass. 1005, 1006 (1997), citing <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 226 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>418 Mass. 165 (1994) (\u201cOne indispensable element of a valid equal protection claim is that individuals who are similarly situated have been treated differently\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Here there is no discriminatory classification for purposes of art. 106 \u2014 no differing treatment of any class or classes of students based on their sex, race, color, creed, or national origin. All students are treated alike. They are free, if they choose, to recite the pledge or any part of it that they see fit. They are entirely free as well to choose to abstain. No one is required to say all or even any part of it. And significantly, no student who abstains from reciting the pledge, or any part of it, is required to articulate a reason for his or her choice to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit recently considered a similar claim under the Federal equal protection clause. In <em>Freedom From Religion Found. </em>v. <em>Hanover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>Sch. Dist., </em>626 F.3d at 4-5 &amp; nn.6 &amp; 7, the plaintiffs claimed that a voluntary recitation of the pledge in the New Hampshire public schools violated their rights because they were atheists and agnostics who objected to the inclusion of the words \u201cunder God\u201d in the pledge. They claimed that the pledge discriminated against them on account of their religious views. <em>Id. </em>at 5 n.6. The court disposed of the equal protection claim in short order, concluding that the New Hampshire pledge statute, which expressly made the recitation of the pledge voluntary, did not treat any class or classes of students differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cUnder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution], the Constitution \u2018guarantees that those who are similarly situated will be treated alike.\u2019 <em>In re Subpoena to Witzel, </em>531 F.3d 113, 118 (1st Cir. 2008). Invoking the Equal Protection Clause, [the plaintiffs contend] that the School Districts have a duty to show equal respect for [their] atheist and agnostic beliefs, that they are in breach of this duty by leading students in affirming that God exists, and that they created a social environment that perpetuates prejudice against atheists and agnostics. However, the New Hampshire Act does \u2018not require different treatment of any class of people because of their religious beliefs,\u2019 nor does it \u2018give preferential treatment to any particular religion.\u2019 <em>Wirzburger </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>412 F.3d 271, 283 (1st Cir. 2005). Rather, as the district court found, \u2018it applies equally to those who believe in God, those who do not, and those who do not have a belief either way, giving adherents of all persuasions the right to participate or not participate in reciting the pledge, for any or no reason.\u2019 <em>Freedom From Religion Found. </em>v. <em>Hanover School Dist., </em>665 F. Supp. 2d 58, 72 (D. N.H. 2009). Therefore, [the plaintiffs\u2019] equal protection claim fails.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\"><em>Freedom From Religion Found., supra </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In an earlier section of its opinion, the First Circuit addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the recitation of the pledge also violated the First Amendment\u2019s establishment clause, because its inclusion of the words \u201cunder God\u201d effectively constituted an impermissible State endorsement of theistic religions. <em>Id. </em>at 6-14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Although the plaintiffs in this case are <em>not </em>asserting an establishment clause claim, or for that matter any claim under the Federal Constitution, we find one part of the court\u2019s discussion of that claim particularly instructive on the equal protection claim that we have here. The plaintiffs in that case, similar to the plaintiffs here, maintained that the recitation of the pledge would effectively cast them as outsiders. <em>Id. </em>at 10. As part of its discussion of the so-called endorsement mode of analysis,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the First Circuit acknowledged the principle that \u201c[a] practice in which the [SJtate is involved may not \u2018send[] the ancillary message to members of the audience who are nonadherents \u201cthat they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>530 U.S. 290, 309-310 (2000). The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that such a message is sent when the pledge is recited voluntarily:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201cAt the heart of [the] claim is [the] argument that those students who choose not to recite the Pledge for reasons of nonbelief in God are quite visibly differentiated from other students who stand and participate. The result, [the plaintiffs argue,] is that the recitation of the Pledge makes the Doe children outsiders to their peer group on the grounds of their religion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201c[The plaintiffs\u2019] premise is that children who choose not to recite the Pledge become outsiders based on their beliefs about religion. That premise is flawed. Under the New Hampshire Act, both the choice to engage in the recitation in the Pledge and the choice not to do so are entirely voluntary. The reasons pupils choose not to participate are not themselves obvious. There are a wide variety of reasons why students may choose not to recite the Pledge, including many reasons that do not rest on either religious or anti-religious belief. These include politi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>cal disagreement with reciting the Pledge, a desire to be different, a view of our country\u2019s history or the significance of the flag that differs from that contained in the Pledge, and no reason at all. Even students who agree with the Pledge may choose not to <em>recite </em>the Pledge. Thus, the Doe children are not <em>religiously </em>differentiated from their peers merely by virtue of their non-participation in the Pledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><em>Freedom From Religion Found., </em>626 F.3d at 10-11. The same can be said of the plaintiffs\u2019 art. 106 claim in this case. Participation is entirely voluntary; all students are presented with the same options; and one student\u2019s choice not to participate because of a religiously held belief is, as both a practical and a legal matter, indistinguishable from another\u2019s choice to abstain for a wholly different, more mundane, and constitutionally insignificant reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The plaintiffs nevertheless press the claim that the children are adversely affected by the recitation of the pledge because of their religious views. They claim to be \u201cstigmatize[d]\u201d and \u201cmarginalized,\u201d and to \u201cfeel excluded,\u201d when the pledge is recited by others, regardless of whether they participate. Specifically, they contend that having the pledge with the words \u201cunder God\u201d recited in their schools effectively conveys a message that persons, like them, who do not believe that the Nation is \u201cunder God\u201d are \u201coutsiders,\u201d \u201csecond-class citizens,\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">The plaintiffs do not appear to be claiming that their children have been punished, bullied, criticized, ostracized, or otherwise mistreated by anyone as a result of their decision to decline to recite some (or all) of the pledge. There is no evidence in the summary judgment record that the plaintiffs\u2019 children have in fact been <em>treated </em>by school administrators, teachers, staff, fellow students, or anyone else any differently from other children because of their religious beliefs, or because of how they participate in the pledge. Nor is there any evidence that they have in fact been <em>perceived </em>any differently for those reasons. The plaintiffs do identify what they claim is a poor public perception of atheists in general, and they maintain that their children\u2019s failure to recite the pledge in its entirety may \u201cpossibly\u201d lead to \u201cunwanted attention, criticism, and potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>bullying.\u201d However, there is nothing in the record indicating that this has in fact happened to the plaintiffs\u2019 children or to any other Massachusetts schoolchildren because of their decision to exercise their right not to recite the words \u201cunder God\u201d in the pledge.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In short, there is nothing empirical or even anecdotal in the summary judgment record to support a claim that the children actually have been treated or perceived by others as \u201coutsiders,\u201d \u201csecond-class citizens,\u201d or \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim of stigma is more esoteric. They contend that the mere recitation of the pledge in the schools is itself a public repudiation of their religious values and, in essence, a public announcement that they do not belong. It is this alleged repudiation that they say causes them to feel marginalized, sending a message to them and to others that, because they do not share all the values that are being recited, they are \u201cunpatriotic\u201d \u201coutsiders.\u201d We hold that this very limited type of consequence alleged by the plaintiffs \u2014 feeling stigmatized and excluded \u2014 is not cognizable under art. 106.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The fact that a school or other public entity operates a voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>program or offers an activity that offends the religious beliefs of one or more individuals, and leaves them feeling \u201cstigmatized\u201d or \u201cexcluded\u201d as a result, does not mean that the program or activity necessarily violates equal protection principles. If we were to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, numerous programs and activities that are otherwise constitutional would be scuttled under the rubric of equal protection. For example, in <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Falmouth, </em>420 Mass. 749, 750, 760 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1067 (1996), we upheld a program adopted by the town of Falmouth school committee that made condoms available to students in the junior and senior high schools in Falmouth. We rejected the claims of parents and students that the program violated their constitutional rights to familial privacy and parental control of their children\u2019s education and upbringing, as well as their right to the free exercise of religion. <em>Id. </em>at 751, 763. If we were to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection theory in this case, the Falmouth program would be vulnerable for essentially the same reason: the plaintiffs in that case could claim that the implementation of the program in the schools \u2014 the dispensing of condoms by the school nurse and the presence of condom vending machines in the restrooms \u2014 sends a daily message to them that the school accepts and even promotes values that do not comport with their religious views, and therefore publicly renders them \u201coutsiders\u201d based on their religious beliefs. The school condom availability program, which passes muster under the religion provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions, would be struck down under art. 106. A host of other school programs would likewise be vulnerable.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Where the plaintiffs do not claim that a school program or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>activity violates anyone\u2019s First Amendment religious rights (or cognate rights under the Massachusetts Constitution), they cannot rely instead on the equal rights amendment, and claim that the school\u2019s even-handed <em>implementation </em>of the program or activity, and the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>exposure </em>to it, unlawfully discriminates against them on the basis of religion. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 322 (1980) (\u201cThe guarantee of equal protection . . . is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity\u201d [footnote omitted]); <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>411 U.S. at 33 (\u201cIt is not the province of [courts] to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws\u201d). Where the program or activity is applied equally to all students, and where those who object to it are not required to participate, or may choose to participate in all parts of it that they do not find objectionable, the feeling of \u201cstigma\u201d caused by seeing or hearing the program being provided to others is not legally cognizable for purposes of the equal rights amendment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Any claim that, by conducting the program or activity for others who do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>choose to participate, the school has publicly repudiated a plaintiff\u2019s beliefs and thereby rendered him or her a \u201csecond-class citizen\u201d or \u201coutsider\u201d is not tenable, and we decline to apply art. 106 in this fashion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">d. <em>Analysis under G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs argue, very briefly, that the recitation of the pledge in the defendants\u2019 schools violates G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 5. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>They cite <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>378 Mass. 342, 344 n.5 (1979) (\u201cWith the passage of [the equal rights amendment,] our constitutional law has caught up to \u00a7 5\u201d), and appear willing to assume, as we did in that case, that the antidiscrimination provisions of the statute equate with the provisions of art. 106. They argue that, because the daily recitation of the pledge violates art. 106, it also violates \u00a7 5. For the same reasons we hold that the pledge does not violate art. 106, however, we also hold that it does not violate the statute. Moreover, as we have stated, reciting the pledge is a voluntary patriotic exercise, but it is not a litmus test for defining who is or is not patriotic. The schools confer no \u201cprivilege\u201d or \u201cadvantage\u201d of patriotism within the meaning of the statute to those who recite the pledge in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

Under the theory of equal protection they have constructed, by offering any constitutionally permissible program or activity the school essentially creates a situation where those who, for protected reasons, elect not to participate can claim that they have been thereby rendered \u201coutsiders\u201d and relegated to an inferior status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">If the plaintiffs are correct, it is difficult to see how the pledge could be recited at all in Massachusetts, even without the words \u201cunder God.\" While the plaintiffs challenge only the inclusion of those words, and appear otherwise content to recite the pledge, any Jehovah\u2019s Witness could claim under the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the recitation of the pledge, even without its reference to God, offends his or her religion and thereby impermissibly stigmatizes him or her. See note 18, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Newdow </em>v. <em>Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist., </em>597 F.3d 1007, 1036 (9th Cir. 2010) (\u201cTo the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in <em>Barnette, </em>even the version of the Pledge that did not contain the words \u2018under God\u2019 violated their religious freedom by causing them to pledge allegiance to something other than God\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Similarly, this type of alleged injury would not be cognizable under the First Amendment. See <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Falmouth, </em>420 Mass. 749, 763 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1067 (1996) (\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the well-known existence of peer pressure in secondary schools adds to the alleged burden on their free exercise rights simply does not rise to the level of constitutional infringement. . . . Although the program may offend the religious sensibilities of the plaintiffs, mere exposure at public schools to offensive programs does not amount to a violation of free exercise. Parents have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>no right to tailor public school programs to meet their religious or moral preferences\u201d); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>514 F.3d 87, 106 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 815 (2008) (\u201cPublic schools are not obliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no requirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in discussions about them\u201d). See also <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist., </em>542 U.S. at 32 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring) (\u201cthe mere fact that [one] disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We likewise reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, when some children choose to exercise their constitutionally protected right not to say the words \u201cunder God,\u201d there is necessarily conveyed a message that the children are \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d Patriotism is not a legal status or benefit that is conferred or withheld by the State, and it is certainly not limited to those who recite the pledge in its entirety. There is no litmus test for patriotism. Schools might conduct patriotic exercises, but they do not define who is and who is not patriotic. See Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary 1056 (4th ed. 2007) (defining patriotism as a \u201clove and loyal or zealous support of one\u2019s country\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The case would be different if, for example, the State purported to certify citizens as patriotic (or not) and restricted eligibility for that certification to only those individuals who recite the pledge in its entirety, including the words \u201cunder God.\u201d Nothing of the sort has happened here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b98-6\">Lbnk, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">(concurring). I concur in the result and much of the reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion. I write separately to note my view that the presence of the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d in the pledge of allegiance (pledge) creates a classification that is potentially cognizable under the equal rights amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution, art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments, although not on the record in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Our opinion rightly notes that recitation of the pledge, in whole or in part, is entirely voluntary. But the logical implication of the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d is not diminished simply because children need not say those words aloud. A reference to a supreme being, by its very nature, distinguishes between those who believe such a being exists and those whose beliefs are otherwise. This distinction creates a classification, one that is based on religion. Theists are acknowledged in the text of the pledge, whereas nontheists like the plaintiffs are excluded from that text and are, therefore, implicitly differentiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">To be sure, as our holding makes clear, the plaintiffs here did not successfully allege that their children receive negative treatment because they opt not to recite the words \u201cunder God,\u201d or that the inclusion of that phrase in the pledge has occasioned \u201cthe creation of second-class citizens.\u201d <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309, 312 (2003). Absent such a showing, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim must fail. See <em>Matter of Corliss, </em>424 Mass. 1005, 1006 (1997), citing <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 226 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>418 Mass. 165 (1994) (differential treatment is \u201c[o]ne indispensable element of a valid equal protection claim\u201d). But our holding today should not be construed to bar other claims that might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>rely on sufficient indicia of harm. Should future plaintiffs demonstrate that the distinction created by the pledge as currently written has engendered bullying or differential treatment, I would leave open the possibility that the equal rights amendment might provide a remedy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
