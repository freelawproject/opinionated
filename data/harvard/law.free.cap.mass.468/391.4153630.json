Tassone, of unarmed robbery, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 19 <em>(b); </em>and assault and battery, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (a). The issue on appeal is whether an expert witness may offer an opinion that the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile generated from a known saliva sample of the defendant matched a DNA profile obtained from a swab taken from eyeglasses that were left at the scene of a robbery where the expert had no affiliation with the laboratory that conducted the DNA testing of the eyeglasses swab. We conclude that an opinion regarding the results of DNA testing is admissible only where the defendant has a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the expert witness about the reliability of the underlying data produced by such testing. Here, the defendant was deprived of a meaningful opportunity for such cross-examination because the analysts who generated the DNA profiles through DNA testing did not testify at trial, and the expert witness who offered the opinion of a match had no affiliation with the laboratory that tested the crime scene sample. Because the defendant preserved his objection to the admission of the expert opinion and its admission was prejudicial, we vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence at trial. Robert Brodeur worked as an assistant manager at a small variety store in Pittsfield. On June 22, 2009, at approximately 5:30 p.m., the only customer in the store was a white male, with short blonde hair, wearing a black T-shirt, black shorts, and eyeglasses. The man went to the store counter to purchase juice. When Brodeur opened the door to the cash register, the man tried to reach into the register to take the money; when that failed, he pulled the register away from Brodeur and threw it on the floor. Brodeur jumped over the counter and attempted to push the man out the door, but the man pushed Brodeur to the floor. While Brodeur was on the floor, the man grabbed $350 in cash and fled. When the police responded to the scene, they observed several items on the floor, including a pair of eyeglasses that did not belong to Brodeur.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The defendant worked as a house painter for a company owned by Scott Moore. On the morning of June 22, Moore met the defendant at a credit union in Pittsfield and gave him $300 in cash, along with a ladder and some tools. The defendant was wearing a black shirt and black shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On June 23, the defendant told his then-fianc\u00e9e, Brenda Streit, that he had been on a \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine binge and was entering a local inpatient facility to treat his drug problem. In a subsequent telephone conversation, Streit told the defendant that she was going to the police department to look at a pair of eyeglasses, and the defendant told her that she knew what she had to do. When Streit asked him if he had committed the robbery, the defendant replied, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He told her that he had committed the robbery because of his drug problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On June 24, Brodeur was shown a photographic array of eight photographs and picked out the photograph of the defendant as the person who committed the robbery. He initially was eighty per cent sure but, after he \u201ckept looking at it,\u201d said he was \u201c99 per cent sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Both Moore and Streit identified the eyeglasses found at the scene of the robbery as belonging to the defendant, noting that they looked like the defendant\u2019s eyeglasses and had paint specks on them. The defendant, however, shared a number of nonprescription eyeglasses with his brother, Nathan Hunt, and Hunt had a pair that looked \u201cjust like\u201d the eyeglasses found at the crime scene. Hunt was the same height and body shape as the defendant, and also had a drug problem with both heroin and crack cocaine. Although Hunt was not employed by Moore\u2019s company, the defendant brought Hunt to the home whose exterior he was painting to assist with the paint work.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">With respect to the DNA testing, a police officer used a buccal swab to obtain a saliva sample from the defendant, which was sent to the State police crime laboratory. At the defendant\u2019s trial, no one from the State police crime laboratory testified regarding the analysis of that saliva sample to generate a known DNA profile of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Lynne Sarty, a chemist in the State police crime laboratory, took a moistened swab and rubbed it on the areas of the eyeglasses that would likely come into contact with the wearer\u2019s skin, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>as the sides and the nose piece underneath the lenses. Tiffany Roy, another chemist at the State police crime laboratory, testified that the swab from the eyeglasses was sent to the Cellmark laboratory (Cellmark) in Texas for DNA testing, which generated a DNA profile from the swab, but no one from the Cell-mark laboratory testified regarding the actual testing of that swab or the generation of a DNA profile from that swab. Instead, Roy testified on direct examination that she conducted an \u201cindependent review\u201d of the DNA profile from the swab and the known DNA profile of the defendant, and concluded that \u201cthe DNA profile generated from the known saliva sample from [the defendant] matched the major male [DNA] profile obtained from the swab of the eyeglasses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The defendant appealed from his convictions and the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tassone, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 197 (2013). The Appeals Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of Roy\u2019s expert opinion \u201cis controlled in all material respects\u201d by the judgment of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>132 S. Ct. 2221 (2012). <em>Tassone, supra </em>at 199. The court stated that, although the plurality\u2019s reasoning in <em>Williams </em>might not \u201cbe relied upon in circumstances presented in some subsequent confrontation clause cases, where the facts before us are not materially distinguishable from those presented to the Supreme Court in Wil<em>liams, </em>it must follow from the judgment in that case, which turned on the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Cellmark report . . . was admissible, that the report here is admissible as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The </em>Williams <em>opinion. </em>In <em>Williams, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2229, the defendant was accused of abducting, raping, and robbing the alleged victim. The doctors who treated the victim took vaginal swabs for a sexual assault kit; a police detective collected the kit, and sent it to the Illinois State police laboratory. <em>Id. </em>The State police laboratory sent the swabs to Cellmark in Maryland for DNA testing, and Cellmark \u201csent back a report containing a male DNA profile produced from semen taken from those swabs.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>forensic specialist at the State police laboratory then conducted a computer search to determine if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Cellmark profile matched any entries in the State DNA database. <em>Id. </em>The search revealed a match with a DNA profile produced by the State police laboratory from a sample of the defendant\u2019s blood taken after he had been arrested on unrelated charges. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">At the bench trial of the defendant in <em>Williams, </em>the prosecutor called a forensic analyst at the State police laboratory, who testified that she developed a DNA profile from a known blood sample of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The prosecutor did not call as a witness any employee of Cellmark who participated in developing the DNA profile taken from the semen on the vaginal swabs, or who knew the procedures and protocols used by Cellmark in developing a DNA profile. <em>Id. </em>at 2229-2230. Instead, the prosecutor called an expert witness in forensic biology and DNA analysis from the State police laboratory who \u201cadmitted she had not seen any of the calibrations or work that Cellmark had done in deducing a male DNA profile from the vaginal swabs,\u201d but trusted Cellmark to do reliable work because it was an accredited laboratory. <em>Id. </em>at 2230. Over objection, this expert testified, based on her comparison of the two DNA profiles, that there was a \u201cmatch\u201d between the DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs taken from the victim and the known DNA profile of the defendant, and that the probability of a random match was one in 8.7 quadrillion in the black population, one in 390 quadrillion in the white population, and one in 109 quadrillion in the Hispanic population. <em>Id. </em>at 2230, 2236. The Cellmark report was neither admitted in evidence nor shown or read to the judge; moreover, it was not identified as a source of any of the expert\u2019s opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 2230.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In considering the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony, five of the nine Supreme Court Justices concluded in <em>Williams </em>that the judge did not err in admitting this evidence, with the reasoning of the plurality opinion of Justice Alito, joined by three other Justices, differing from that of the concurring opinion authored by Justice Thomas. See <em>id. </em>at 2244; <em>id. </em>at 2252 (Breyer, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 2255 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). The plurality opinion concluded that the evidence was admissible on two independent grounds. First, the plurality determined that the expert witness\u2019s statement that the DNA profile generated by Cellmark that matched the defendant\u2019s profile was \u201cfound in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>semen from the vaginal swabs\u201d was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. <em>Id. </em>at 2236-2237. Rather, the plurality stated that the expert witness \u201csimply assumed\u201d this to be true when she offered her opinion that there was a match between the two DNA profiles, and that the judge, who was the finder of fact at the bench trial, understood it to be nothing more than an assumption. <em>Id. </em>Because the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not bar the admission of testimonial statements unless they are offered for the truth of the matter asserted, the plurality concluded that there was no confrontation clause violation. <em>Id. </em>at 2235, 2240, quoting <em>Crawford </em>v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 59-60 n.9 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Second, the plurality concluded that even if the expert\u2019s statement were admitted for its truth, there still would be no confrontation clause violation because Cellmark\u2019s DNA report regarding the vaginal swab \u201cplainly was not prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2243. The plurality reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cHere, the primary purpose of the Cellmark report, viewed objectively, was not to accuse [the defendant] or to create evidence for use at trial. When the [Illinois State police laboratory] sent the sample to Cellmark, its primary purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use against [the defendant], who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that time. Similarly, no one at Cellmark could have possibly known that the profile that it produced would turn out to inculpate [the defendant] \u2014 or for that matter, anyone else whose DNA profile was in a law enforcement database. Under these circumstances, there was no \u2018prospect of fabrication\u2019 and no incentive to produce anything other than a scientifically sound and reliable profile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2243-2244, quoting <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>131 S. Ct. 1143, 1157 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Neither of these independent grounds, however, was adopted by a fifth Justice. Justice Thomas rejected the plurality\u2019s contention that the statement regarding Cellmark testing was not admitted for its truth, declaring that \u201cthere was no plausible reason for the introduction of Cellmark\u2019s statements other than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>establish their truth.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2256 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). He also rejected the plurality\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose test\u201d as lacking \u201cany grounding in constitutional text, in history, or in logic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2262 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). He concurred in the judgment \u201csolely because Cellmark\u2019s statements lacked the requisite \u2018formality and solemnity\u2019 to be considered \u2018testimonial\u2019 for the purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2255 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The dissenting opinion of Justice Kagan, joined by three other Justices, concluded that the expert witness\u2019s testimony that the victim\u2019s vaginal swab contained DNA that matched the defendant\u2019s DNA profile was offered for its truth and violated the confrontation clause, <em>id. </em>at 2270-2272 (Kagan, J., dissenting), noting that \u201cthe prosecution introduced the results of Cell-mark\u2019s testing through an expert witness who had no idea how they were generated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2265 (Kagan, J., dissenting). The dissent also rejected the plurality\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2273 (Kagan, J., dissenting). The dissent asserted that, \u201cin all except its disposition, [the plurality] opinion is a dissent: Five Justices specifically reject every aspect of its reasoning and every paragraph of its explication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2265 (Kagan, J., dissenting). The dissent also rejected Justice Thomas\u2019s argument that the Cellmark report lacked the \u201cformality and solemnity\u201d to be \u201ctestimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2275-2277 (Kagan, J., dissenting). According to the dissent, the consequence of the Court\u2019s judgment reached by five Justices is to leave \u201csignificant confusion in [its] wake.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 2277 (Kagan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">2. <em>Application of the </em>Williams <em>opinion to this case. </em>We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion that the facts in the instant case \u201care not materially distinguishable from those presented to the Supreme Court in <em>Williams.\u201d Tassone, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. at 199. Unlike in <em>Williams, </em>the fact finder in this case was a jury, not a judge, and the judge provided no limiting instructions to the jury regarding their consideration of Roy\u2019s testimony. The plurality in <em>Williams </em>acknowledged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cThe dissent\u2019s argument would have force if [the defendant] had elected to have a jury trial. In that event, there would have been a danger of the jury\u2019s taking [the expert witness\u2019s] testimony as proof that the Cellmark profile was derived from the sample obtained from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. Absent an evaluation of the risk of juror confusion and careful jury instructions, the testimony could not have gone to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Williams, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2236. Here, the jury likely considered Roy\u2019s testimony \u2014 that the DNA profile that matched the defendant\u2019s known DNA profile was obtained by Cellmark from the swab of the eyeglasses \u2014 for its truth, rather than as an assumption applied to reach the expert\u2019s conclusion. In addition, in contrast with <em>Williams, </em>the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the Cell-mark report in the instant case <em>was </em>to accuse the defendant and create evidence for use at trial, because the DNA testing at Cellmark was conducted after Brodeur had identified the defendant from a photographic array as the person who committed the robbery. Where neither of the two independent grounds relied on by the plurality would apply to the facts in the instant case, we do not agree with the Appeals Court that the admissibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Roy\u2019s testimony \u201cmust follow from the judgment in that case.\u201d <em>Tassone, supra </em>at 199. The more challenging question, given the \u201csignificant confusion\u201d that has been left in the wake of the <em>Williams </em>decision, 132 S. Ct. at 2277 (Kagan, J., dissenting), is whether the United States Supreme Court would conclude that evidence of this type, admitted under these circumstances, would violate the confrontation clause. Fortunately, we need not resolve that question because, regardless of the answer, we conclude that Roy\u2019s opinion was not admissible under our common law of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">3. <em>Our common law of evidence. </em>We noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greineder, </em>464 Mass. 580, 593, cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 166 (2013), that \u201cour evidentiary rules afford a defendant more protection than the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Our common law of evidence is more protective of confrontation rights in two ways. First, although the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause and Fed. R. Evid. 703 permit the prosecution to elicit on direct examination from an expert witness the underlying facts or data on which the expert\u2019s opinion is based for the limited purpose of explaining the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion, our common-law rules of evidence do not. <em>Greineder, supra </em>at 592-594. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 784-785 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011). Our evidentiary rules permit the facts or data underlying the opinion to be elicited only by the defendant on cross-examination and, where this door has been opened by the defendant, by the prosecution on redirect examination. <em>Greineder, supra </em>at 583-584. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 705 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Second, our common law of evidence requires that the defendant have a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the expert about her opinion and the reliability of the facts or data that underlie her opinion. See <em>Greineder, </em>464 Mass. at 595; <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 786. Where the admissibility of expert testimony is challenged, the judge as gatekeeper must determine, among other foundational requirements, whether \u201cthe expert\u2019s opinion is based on facts or data of a type reasonably relied on by experts to form opinions in the relevant field.\u201d <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 783, citing <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986). Where the gatekeeping judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>determines that the expert\u2019s opinion meets a minimum standard of reliability and admits the evidence, a defendant is entitled to a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the expert as to the reliability of the underlying facts or data. See <em>Greineder, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Where an expert in a homicide case offers an opinion regarding the cause of death, a defendant will generally have a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the expert witness regarding possible flaws in the opinion based on the underlying autopsy report and notes, and photographs taken during the autopsy, regardless of whether the expert conducted the autopsy or was employed in the medical examiner\u2019s office that did. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 383, 390-391 (2008). But \u201cwith DNA analysis, the testing techniques are so reliable and the science so sound that fraud and errors in labeling or handling may be the <em>only </em>reasons why an opinion is flawed\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 790, citing National Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 130 (2009). Therefore, where a DNA expert offers an opinion regarding a DNA match, a meaningful opportunity for cross-examination means that a defendant must have the opportunity substantively to explore the \u201crisk of evidence being mishandled or mislabeled, or of data being fabricated or manipulated, and . . . whether the expert\u2019s opinion is vulnerable to these risks.\u201d <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In <em>Greineder, </em>464 Mass. at 582, 598, we concluded that the defendant had a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s DNA expert about the reliability of the data that formed the basis for her opinion that the defendant\u2019s DNA profile matched the DNA profile found on a knife and gloves recovered from the crime scene, even though the expert did not personally conduct the DNA testing. But in that case the prosecution\u2019s expert was the forensic laboratory director of Cellmark, where the DNA testing was conducted, and \u201cwas in a unique position to speak to the DNA testing process employed by Cellmark, including the chain of custody and evidence-handling protocols.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596-597 (expert was \u201cin a better position than an individual analyst to testify to the reliability and accuracy of Cellmark\u2019s testing procedures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Similarly, in <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 779, 786, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>prosecution\u2019s DNA expert testified that the victim was \u201cincluded as being the possible source of the DNA extracted\u201d from bloodstains on the defendant\u2019s boot and pants even though another analyst in her laboratory had conducted the DNA testing, we concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated by the admission of [the expert\u2019s] opinion, because he had a fair opportunity to confront [the expert] as to the reasonable basis for that opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. There, the prosecution\u2019s expert was knowledgeable of the protocols used within the laboratory and of the testing analyst\u2019s work; the expert supervised and trained the analyst who conducted the DNA testing, reviewed the analyst\u2019s work by looking at the worksheets and reports that the analyst generated during the testing process, and signed the analyst\u2019s final report regarding the testing she performed after a full technical review. <em>Id. </em>at 782, 791. In sum, although the expert \u201cdid not have personal knowledge of how [the analyst] conducted the testing, she was familiar with the protocols [the analyst] was taught to employ, [the analyst\u2019s] documentation of her work, and [the analyst\u2019s] work history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Here, in contrast, at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine where the judge denied the defendant\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of Roy\u2019s opinion, Roy testified that she was a chemist at the State police laboratory and that Cellmark, not her laboratory, had generated the DNA profile from the eyeglasses found at the scene of the crime. Roy was able to confirm from the electropherogram sent by Cellmark that it reflected the DNA profile reported by Cellmark, but she was not in a position to confirm that the DNA profile was from the eyeglasses swab; she knew only that Cellmark said that it was. Further, there was no evidence that Roy previously had been employed by Cellmark, had any personal knowledge of the chain-of-custody or evidence-handling protocols used by Cellmark, or had seen any of the worksheets generated by Cellmark during the testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that the defendant did not have a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine Roy regarding the laboratory work, procedures, or protocols performed by Cellmark, or as to the reliability of the Cellmark data on which her opinion of a \u201cmatch\u201d with the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>DNA profile rests. Where an opinion that DNA found at the crime scene matches the defendant\u2019s DNA profile is offered by an expert who is not affiliated with the laboratory where the testing of the crime scene DNA sample was conducted, and where no analyst from that laboratory testifies regarding that testing, a defendant effectively is denied the opportunity to explore through cross-examination whether the opinion is flawed. Because the defendant here had no meaningful opportunity for cross-examination, the admission of Roy\u2019s opinion violated the right to confrontation provided by our common law of evidence. See <em>Greineder, </em>464 Mass. at 595; <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 783-784.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The prosecution may not admit powerful evidence of a DNA match against a defendant and deny the defendant a meaningful opportunity to challenge the reliability of the facts or data on which the opinion rests by failing to call an expert witness affiliated with the laboratory that tested the sample connected to the crime scene. We know of no case before <em>Williams </em>where the prosecution attempted to offer an opinion of a DNA profile match without calling the DNA analyst who conducted the testing of the crime scene DNA or a knowledgeable employee from that laboratory. At least in State courts in Massachusetts, the <em>Williams </em>opinion does not open the door to such a practice. Regardless of whether the Supreme Court ultimately interprets the confrontation clause to permit the admission of such an opinion under circumstances that effectively deny the defendant any meaningful opportunity for cross-examination, its admission in our courts is barred by the right of confrontation in our common law of evidence. In other words, if the Commonwealth sends the crime scene DNA to Cellmark for analysis, and seeks to offer in evidence an opinion that the crime scene DNA matches the DNA of the defendant, it will need, at a minimum, to call an expert witness from Cellmark.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">4. <em>Prejudicial error. </em>The defendant objected to the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of Roy\u2019s opinion on confrontation grounds by filing a motion in limine. After denying the motion, the judge agreed that the defendant\u2019s rights were saved regarding the objection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>461 Mass. 60, 66 (2011) (defendant relieved of need to object to evidence at trial where judge, after denying motion in limine, tells defendant that his rights are saved). Because we conclude that the admission of the opinion under these circumstances violated our common law of evidence, we must determine whether the error was nonprejudicial, that is whether \u201cthe error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 563 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). Although we recognize that the non-DNA evidence against the defendant was strong, we cannot say with confidence that the admission of Roy\u2019s opinion had \u201cbut very slight effect\u201d on the jury. The primary issue at trial was identification and there was evidence that the defendant\u2019s brother had the same height and body shape as the defendant, wore eyeglasses \u201cjust like\u201d those of the defendant, and had a drug problem similar to that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Apart from the DNA evidence, the most compelling evidence against the defendant was the eyewitness identification by Bro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>deur, the admissions the defendant made to Streit, and the eyeglasses left at the scene. But without the DNA evidence that connected the defendant to the eyeglasses found at the scene, the jury might have questioned whether Brodeur could have reliably identified the defendant rather than his brother, whether Streit\u2019s testimony was reliable because their engagement had ended, and whether the eyeglasses belonged to the defendant rather than his brother. The DNA evidence not only tied the defendant to the eyeglasses, but also likely diminished any doubts the jury might have had as to the reliability of Brodeur\u2019s identification and Streit\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s admissions. In these circumstances, we conclude that the admission of Roy\u2019s opinion regarding the DNA evidence was prejudicial error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse and vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The dissent\u2019s concern was well founded. \u201cWhen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \u2018the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds ....\u2019\u201d <em>Marks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977), quoting <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 169 n.15 (1976). See <em>McClure </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>436 Mass. 614, 626 n.15 (2002) (applying rule of <em>Marks). </em>In the wake of the fractured plurality decision in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>132 S. Ct. 2221 (2012), courts have struggled to find any such common denominator that may constitute its holding. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>712 F.3d 79, 95-96 (2d Cir. 2013) <em>(\u201cWilliams </em>does not, as far as we can determine, using the <em>Marks </em>analytic approach, yield a single, useful holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>relevant to the case before us. It is therefore for our purposes confined to the particular set of facts presented in that case\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Duron-Caldera, 737 </em>F.3d 988, 994 n.4 (5th Cir. 2013) (\u201cIn <em>Williams, </em>there is no such common denominator between the plurality opinion and Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion. Neither of these opinions can be viewed as a logical subset of the other\u201d). Unable to extract a governing standard from <em>Williams, </em>courts facing similar confrontation clause questions have applied both the plurality\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose\u201d and Justice Thomas\u2019s \u201cformality and solemnity\u201d tests to the facts before it. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Deadwiller, </em>350 Wis. 2d 138, 160-165 (2013); <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>232 Ariz. 391, 406-407 (2013), cert. denied, 134 S.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>455 Mass. 840, 842 (2010) (\u201cexpert testimony that DNA tests could not exclude the defendant as a potential source of DNA found at the crime scene, absent testimony regarding statistical findings explaining the import of such a result, was likely to confuse and mislead the jury such that any probative value of the test results was substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect\u201d). However, we conclude that defense counsel did not provide ineffective assistance for failure to object to the admission of the opinion on this ground, because the Cellmark report (which was not admitted in evidence) estimated the frequency of occurrence of the DNA profile among various populations as less than one in 1 quadrillion unrelated individuals, and Roy likely would have independently been able to reach this same conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Because we conclude that the admission of Roy\u2019s opinion was prejudicial, we need not determine whether its admission violated the right of confrontation in art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and therefore should be reviewed under the standard applied to constitutional error: harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
